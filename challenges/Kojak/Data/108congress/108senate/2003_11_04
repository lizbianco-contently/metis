Mr. President, today we will have a period of morning \nbusiness for the first hour of the day's session. Following that hour, \nthe Senate will begin consideration of the fair credit reporting \nlegislation. The consent agreement governing that bill allows for a \nlimited number of amendments to be offered to the legislation. We hope \nto complete action on that bill during today's session.\n  Last night we were also able to reach an agreement on H.R. 1828, the \nSyria accountability bill. We may be able to schedule consideration of \nthat measure during today's session as well.\n  Rollcall votes will occur throughout the day today. The Senate will \nrecess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the regular party luncheons.\n  In addition to the items I have mentioned, the Senate will act this \nweek on the Internet tax moratorium extension. I anticipate that debate \nto begin on Thursday, and we will complete that before the end of this \nweek.\n  Also, additional appropriations conference reports may be ready \nduring the week, and we will proceed to those that are available.\n  It is my understanding the military construction conference is \ncompleted, and that may be ready for consideration this week.\n  We will continue to schedule votes as necessary over the course of \nthe week.\n  This week we will also continue on the appropriations bills. I have \nbeen speaking to the chairman of the committee, and it is hoped the \nremaining bills can be finished in a timely way. I will have more to \nsay on the specifics of the appropriations schedule after further \ndiscussion with the chairman, Senator Stevens, and the Democratic \nleadership as well.\n  With that said, in order for us to adjourn at the earliest time this \nyear, it is important for all of our colleagues to recognize we are \ngoing to need to work every day and have productive days. That is going \nto include Mondays, and it is going to include Fridays. It will likely \ninclude each day next week. I know a lot of Senators are wondering \nabout their schedule for next week, given the Veterans Day holiday. I \nthink over the course of the morning we will be able to lock in an \nunderstanding in terms of how and when we can consider these \nappropriations bills.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2004, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $503 per year or $252 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased at the following costs: Less \nthan 200 pages, $10.50; Between 200 and 400 pages, $21.00; Greater \nthan 400 pages, $31.50. Subscriptions in microfiche format will be \n$146 per year with single copies priced at $3.00. This price \nincrease is necessary based upon the cost of printing and \ndistribution.\n\n                                                              BRUCE \nR. JAMES, Public Printer.\n[[Page S13840]]\n\n\nAfter that is done, we will clarify what will happen on Veterans Day.\n  We have all come to the floor many times to express our desire to \nfinish our work at the earliest opportunity and, in my mind, we have 3 \nweeks--actually, it is less than 3 weeks--now to complete our work. In \norder to do that, we will have to work together. We will have to have \nfull, productive days, including Mondays and Fridays. It may well be we \nhave to even consider weekends in order to complete our business. We \nwill monitor the schedule and progress closely over the next day or so \nand make those final decisions regarding scheduling next week. At this \ntime, I think all Members should prepare for a very busy 2\\1/2\\ weeks.\n  Again, I would like very much for us to work together to shoot for a \ntotal of 3 weeks, around November 21, to depart.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say on behalf of the minority that we \nare most happy to work on all the items the majority leader has \nmentioned. We look forward to working with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and Senator Byrd to move more of these \nappropriations bills. I think we have a really outstanding record \nworking with the majority on appropriations bills and will continue to \ndo that. We feel it is vitally important. The conference which was \ncompleted last week was extremely difficult and long. But we now have a \nbill which the President has.\n  We finished the Interior appropriations conference report. I am happy \nto hear we have a completed military construction conference report. \nThat wasn't easy. Everyone had to take their projects in their States \nand cut back from what they had.\n  We look forward to a productive 2\\1/2\\ weeks. I hope we will do \neverything we can to complete our business before Thanksgiving.\n  We are here to work nights, weekends, whatever it takes, to complete \nthat work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13840-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Senate an \nissue dealing with jobs. It is a story about international trade, \nunfair competition, and the impact it has had on countless of our \nworkers.\n  There was great euphoria a week or so ago about the economic growth \nnumbers for the past quarter, some 7-percent economic growth. The \nproblem is, it was accompanied by a loss of jobs.\n  Jobs are the kind of thing that families talk about in the evening as \nthey sit around the supper table: Do I have a good job? Does it pay \nwell? Do I have job security? Do I feel good about the company I am \nworking for?\n  Our country, regrettably, has lost nearly 3 million jobs in the past \nseveral years.\n  This is a picture of a bicycle. This happens to be a Huffy bicycle. \nHuffy is a well-known brand. It is sold at Wal-Mart, KMart, Sears. This \nHuffy bicycle used to be made in the United States. In Celina, OH, some \n850 U.S. workers worked manufacturing bicycles.\n  When a bike came off the Ohio plant's assembly line, they would put a \nlittle decal on, of an American flag.\n  That was then, this is now. In the last couple of years, those jobs \nhave all moved to China, Taiwan, and Mexico. There were about 1,850 \nworkers at Huffy plants in the United States as of 1998. And all those \nfolks were fired, as their jobs were moved overseas.\n  In Celina, OH, Huffy workers were paid $11 an hour plus benefits. \nThese are decent manufacturing jobs. Nobody was getting rich on $11 an \nhour plus benefits, but these were good, solid jobs.\n  Then they were told one day they would not be working those jobs any \nlonger because Huffy bicycles would be produced in China.\n  My understanding is that the very last assignment for these U.S. \nworkers was to take off that decal from Huffy bikes, and slap on a \ndecal that had a picture of the globe.\n  Let's talk a little about why a company would decide to shut its \nplant in Ohio and make bicycles in China.\n  Huffy started to manufacture its bikes at a plant in China, where \nworkers have to put in 13\\1/2\\- to 15-hour shifts, from 7 a.m. to 11 \np.m., 7 days a week.\n  Let me say that again: 93 hours a week, 7 days a week, from 7 a.m. to \n11 p.m.\n  They are paid between 25 cents an hour and 41 cents an hour. Failure \nto work overtime is punished with a fine of 2 days' wages.\n  There are strong chemical odors in the plant from the painting \ndepartment, excessively high temperatures from the welding section, no \nhealth insurance, no social pension, strict factory rules, harsh \nmanagement, no talking during working hours.\n  Twelve workers are housed in each dark, stark dorm room. They have \ntwo meals a day, with poor quality food. If the workers complain or \nattempt to raise a grievance about harsh working conditions, or \nexcessively long, forced overtime hours or low wages, they are \nimmediately fired.\n  In this particular plant, in late 1999, all the workers in the \ndelivery section went on strike and were fired immediately.\n  So the question is, if we cannot produce bicycles in Ohio for 25-\ncent-an-hour to 41-cent-an-hour wages, do U.S. workers lose? Under \ncurrent circumstances, yes, we do, because companies decide that if \nU.S. workers can't compete with slave-like conditions, tough luck. If \nyou can't compete, you are out.\n  So people who were working in this company in Celina, OH, making \nbicycles for our marketplace, could not compete because they were \nexpecting a liveable wage. They worked hard, and they were able to take \na paycheck home that meets the needs of their families: $11 an hour \nplus benefits. But they were told that this was an outrageous level of \ncompensation: $11 an hour--far too much.\n  So instead Huffy found a place where it could pay 25 cents an hour, \nand then shipped its bikes back to Celina, OH, so that some young kid \nin Celina, OH, could go into a Wal-Mart or a Sears or a KMart, and with \na gleam in their eye buy his first bicycle. A bicycle now made by \nsomebody who is making 25 cents an hour, working 93 hours a week, 7 \ndays a week.\n  I guess this so-called globalization is globalization without rules. \nIt means it does not matter that Americans lose their jobs to somebody \nmaking 25 cents an hour.\n  I have given other examples of 12-year-olds working 12 hours a day, \nmaking 12 cents an hour. I am talking about Huffy bicycles today to \ndrive home a point, because Huffy is a household name.\n  If we fought for a century on the issue of a safe workplace or child \nlabor laws or minimum wages or the conditions of production, then the \nquestion should be, Is there an admission price to the American \nmarketplace? Is there any admission price at all?\n  What about bicycles made in a plant where workers are working 93 \nhours a week, where workers are working from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., 7 days \na week? Is that fair trade--25 cents an hour, 93 hours a week, 7 days a \nweek, working in a factory that does not meet the basic conditions of \nfairness or safety for workers?\n  Is that fair trade? It is not where I come from. Yet no one will say \na word about it. In this town, you are either blindly for free trade, \nunfettered free\n\n[[Page S13841]]\n\ntrade, globalization, or else you are considered some xenophobic \nisolationist stooge who does not understand it all.\n  It is so tiresome to see people in this Chamber and the people who \nwrite the editorials and the op-ed pieces to continue to make excuses \nfor the thousands, and, yes, millions of jobs lost in this country by \npeople who worked hard but who could not make it because they made too \nmuch money. They could not compete with somebody making 25 cents an \nhour in Asia. It is so tiresome to see and read and hear the excuses \nfrom those who continue to support a failed trade policy.\n  If this is a race to the bottom, with corporations deciding they want \nto circle the globe to find out, ``Where can I produce the cheapest? \nWhere can I find 12-cents-an-hour production by 12-year-olds?'' if that \nis what this is a race towards, we lose, this country loses.\n  More and more families in this country will lose their jobs, not \nbecause they are not great workers, not because they do not know their \njob well, but because someone else in other parts of the world--where \nthey are not able to form labor unions, where they are not able to \ncomplain about unsafe working conditions, where they are not able to \nstop a plant from dumping chemicals into the air and the water, and \nwhere they are not able to complain about being paid 12 cents or 20 \ncents an hour--will get the jobs.\n\n  That product will then be made and sent back to the store shelves \nhere. I will guarantee you, it will not be cheaper, it will simply \nrepresent more profit for those who took jobs away from Americans to \ngive them to people in other parts of the world who will work for \npennies an hour.\n  We can continue to pretend it does not happen. We can continue to act \nlike ostriches. But the fact is, this country is losing economic \nstrength as a result of trade policies that are, in my judgment, \nincompetent.\n  We will have on the floor of this Senate, very soon we hear, \nadditional free trade agreements--the Australia agreement, the Free \nTrade Agreement of the Americas. In fact, this administration is now \nworking on additional free trade agreements. We just did one with \nSingapore which itself was incompetent. But that is another story for \nanother time.\n  This country, it seems to me, has a great deal at stake. This \neconomic engine of ours will work provided we have jobs for American \nfamilies. When you see the decimation of our manufacturing base, and \nnow our high-tech industry, as well, with jobs moving wholesale \noverseas--in the manufacturing base, moving to Indonesia, China, and \nother parts of Asia; in the high-tech industry, jobs moving to India \nand other countries, and moving en masse--then this county's economy is \ngoing to have trouble because the engine of progress in this country is \njobs.\n  You can talk all you want about percentages--7 percent economic \ngrowth; that is all great--but it does not mean a thing if we are \nlosing jobs. The engine of progress for the American family, the engine \nof progress for this country's economy, is jobs, good jobs that pay \nwell, that have decent benefits, that give a family confidence and hope \nabout the future, because that hope and confidence is what expands the \neconomy. That is all the economy rests on.\n  The great minds involved in international trade tell the 850 workers \nin Celina, Ohio: you are paid too much money. You cost $11 an hour to \nbuild bicycles. Shame on you. We can do this for 25 cents an hour in \nChina. So say goodbye to your jobs. We are taking them to China.\n  Is that what we want for our country? Is that what we are willing to \nstand for? Well, I am telling you something, year after year after \nyear, the majority of the people in this Chamber are willing to stand \nfor it. At some point we better get a backbone to stand up and insist \nand demand that there is an admission price to the American \nmarketplace. We are open and free, but we require fairness.\n  There are thousands of examples like the one involving Huffy \nbicycles, all over this country--of someone coming home saying to their \nhusband or wife: Honey, I have lost my job. They are shipping our \nmanufacturing to China, or Indonesia, or Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka. Why? \nBecause I didn't do a good job? No. Because I am making $11 an hour, \nand they say that is too much. They can get it for 15 cents an hour or \n31 cents an hour somewhere else.\n  This is not going to save the American consumers any money; they will \ncharge the same price for the products. It is about profit--\ninternational profit.\n  This is hurting our country. These trade rules injure this country \nand we have to change them. I serve notice again that, as we negotiate \nthese new trade agreements--and they are being negotiated in Australia, \nthe free trade agreement with the Americas, and others. Be aware that \nsome of us in the Senate are going to continue to fight as hard as we \ncan possibly fight to say that what is happening to American jobs is \nwrong.\n  If we are inefficient and cannot compete, that is our problem. But \ndon't tell me the workers in Ohio making $11 an hour, building a good \nbicycle, with an American flag insignia on the front of it, are \ninefficient.\n  We fought for a century over these issues--fair pay, safe workplaces, \nthe ability to organize as a labor union. We worked for a century on \nthese things, and now you wipe it all out by pole-vaulting over those \nnettlesome little laws in the United States and say: We can avoid that. \nWe will ship our bicycle production to--in this case, China; it could \nhave been Sri Lanka or Indonesia.\n  We ought to think long and hard about how to save our jobs in this \ncountry. Our marketplace can certainly be enhanced by having goods and \nservices come from other countries, but only when they are produced \nunder some basic element of decency and fair play.\n  There is an organization I want to give credit to that has done \nexcellent work in this area. The National Labor Committee investigates \nunfair labor practices in various parts of the world. They have \ninvestigated the dismal labor conditions at the Huffy factories in \nChina, as an example.\n  Look, I think these are really important issues. We talk about the \neconomy, expansion, jobs, and opportunity. All of this, in my judgment, \ncomes down to the basic premise that when American families in this \ncountry have a job, they have security, and they feel good about the \nfuture, our economy thrives. But we are increasingly seeing jobs in \nthis country, which have been the bulwark of support for American \nfamilies, moved overseas and the American families are told: We are \nsorry, you don't have a job anymore, so you can find two or three part-\ntime jobs to make up the difference and have all of the members of your \nfamily working, and you can make it that way.\n  That is a quick way to undermine the strength of this country. No \ncountry will long remain an economic power or world economic power \nwithout a strong, vibrant, growing manufacturing sector. Ours is being \ndecimated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n\n\n                              FOREIGN OIL\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to follow the comments \nof the Senator from North Dakota about jobs going overseas and point \nout another vulnerability we have as a result of dependence overseas, \nand that is our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Today, we are importing over half of our daily consumption of oil. \nThat is moving toward 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil that \nis coming from foreign shores. As a result, not only does that put us \nin a precarious economic position, but it puts us in a precarious \ndefense position. Look at the difference in how we would be able to \noperate in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf region, if we did not \nhave the delivery of that oil. Look at the potential strike of a \nterrorist taking down a supertanker in the 19-mile-wide Strait of \nHormuz and what that would do to the world economy if that oil could \nnot flow out to the industrialized world. Yet what do we do about an \nenergy policy here?\n  The Senator from North Dakota and I tried to do a simple little thing \nsuch as get increased mileage for SUVs phased in over the next decade, \nand we only got some votes--in the thirties\n\n[[Page S13842]]\n\nout of 100 Senators--to do that. When we try to look down the road at \nalternative ways, where is most of our energy consumed? It is consumed \nin the transportation sector. In transportation, where is most of our \nenergy consumed in this country? It is in our personal vehicles. Today, \nwe have vehicles made by Honda and Toyota that are getting in excess of \n50 miles per gallon; they are called hybrid vehicles. It is a computer \nthat runs between an electric motor and a gasoline engine, and they get \nover 50 miles per gallon. They cannot make enough of these for the \ndemand of the American consumer. Yet we do not have a lot of these \nhybrid cars that are offered to the public.\n\n  What are we doing for the future? We could wean ourselves from \ndependence on foreign oil if we started a crash course to develop a \nhydrogen engine that was cheap enough and efficient enough for the \nAmerican people. Years ago, in the early sixties, when this Nation made \nup its mind, after the President declared we were going to develop the \ntechnology and the American ingenuity to go to the Moon and return \nsafely within that decade, don't you think that with that kind of \nperseverance and will, we could have ended up with an engine that would \nhave been an alternative to oil and we would have started to wean \nourselves from our dependence on this foreign oil that leaves this \ncountry all the more vulnerable defensewise?\n  Indeed, we could, but it takes leadership. It takes the will of the \nAmerican people to say there is going to be a different way.\n  I have discussed this issue in terms of defense. I have discussed \nthis issue in terms of economic vitality as well as defensewise, and \ncertainly environmentally it would make a significant difference as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13842-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR BOB GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Madam President, I rise this morning to speak about a \ngrave injustice that has befallen this Chamber, and that is the denial \nby a minority of Senators of the right to an up-or-down vote on four of \nthe President's judicial nominees.\n  Last week, the Senate voted 54 to 43 to move forward with a vote on \nJudge Charles Pickering who now serves on the District Court for the \nSouthern District of Mississippi and who was selected by the President \nas one of his nominees for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Fifty-\nfour Senators--a majority, in other words--voted to allow Judge \nPickering's nomination to proceed to a vote, and yet because of the way \nthe Senate rules are presently being misapplied, a majority of Senators \ncannot even bring about a vote on the merits of a judge. That is wrong, \nand it is unconstitutional.\n  There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a supermajority--\nthat is, three-fifths, two-thirds, or anything more than a simple \nmajority of Senators--to give advice and consent. The Constitution \nspells out only five instances where a supermajority is required. Those \nfive instances are: the ratification of a treaty, impeachment, \nexpulsion of a Senator, the override of a Presidential veto, and \nadoption of a constitutional amendment. These five situations should \noccur infrequently, which is why the Framers of the Constitution made \nthem difficult to achieve.\n  In contrast, the approval of Federal judges should occur frequently; \nI daresay 100 percent of the time, when you have qualified nominees. \nThat is why there is no requirement in the Constitution for more than a \nsimple majority to confirm these nominees. Advice and consent often \nrequires debate, always requires deliberation, and always requires a \ndecision. Each Senator should decide how to vote on a given nominee. \nVote yes, vote no, but vote.\n  For the first time in our country's history, the filibuster is now \nbeing used by a minority of Senators to block the President's nominees \nto the Federal bench. By shirking their duty to make a decision on the \nmerits of the President's nominees--Priscilla Owen, Bill Pryor, \nCaroline Kuhl, and now Charles Pickering--a minority of this Chamber \nkeeps the Senate as a whole from performing its duties under the \nConstitution.\n  It is not as though the Senators who are blocking an up-or-down vote \ncan object to the qualifications of these nominees. Let's go down the \nlist. Let's start with Priscilla Owen who, like Judge Pickering, is \nnominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears appeals on \nFederal cases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n  Justice Owen graduated cum laude from Baylor Law School and then \nproceeded to earn the highest score on the Texas bar exam that year. \nShe practiced law for 17 years before being elected to the Supreme \nCourt of Texas in 1994. Justice Priscilla Owen was elected by the \npeople of Texas, the second most populous State in this country, to its \nhighest court. In her last reelection in the year 2000, she was \nreelected with 84 percent of the vote, along with the endorsement of \nevery major newspaper in the State of Texas.\n  When the opponents of a fair vote on the merits cannot attack a \nnominee's qualifications, they come up with excuses: She is not in the \n``mainstream of legal reasoning.'' Out of the mainstream? The people of \nTexas obviously don't think she is out of the mainstream. She received \n84 percent of the vote in her reelection in 2000.\n  Next we have Caroline Kuhl who is one of President Bush's nominees to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which handles Federal appeals in \nmany of the States out west. Caroline Kuhl has been a State trial judge \nin California since 1995. Judge Kuhl is another well-qualified nominee \nwho is being denied an up-or-down vote on her nomination. But you don't \nhave to take my word on her qualifications. The American Bar \nAssociation, the gold standard, has rated her as ``Well Qualified.'' \nYet, despite her credentials, Judge Kuhl has also been branded as \n``outside the mainstream.''\n  Then there is Bill Pryor, the attorney general for the State of \nAlabama, a dedicated public servant who has shown time and again that \nhe can separate his personal beliefs from his professional duties. \nAgain, ``outside of the mainstream.'' That is, sadly, what you will \nhear about Bill Pryor.\n  It doesn't matter that Thurbert Baker, the attorney general for my \nState of Georgia, Mr. Pryor's counterpart in my State, an elected \nDemocrat, has said that Bill Pryor possesses the qualities and \nexperience needed to serve the people of Georgia on the Eleventh \nCircuit.\n  Earlier this year, Attorney General Baker wrote a letter to Senators \nShelby and Sessions of Alabama to express his support for Bill Pryor. \nIn support of Bill Pryor, Thurbert Baker wrote, and I quote:\n\n\n[[Page S13843]]\n\n\n       Bill has distinguished himself time and again with the \n     legal acumen that he brings to issues of national or regional \n     concern as well as with his commitment to furthering the \n     prospects of good and responsive government. Close quotation.\n\n  Across State lines and across party lines comes this endorsement of \nBill Pryor. Again, you will hear the same, lame excuse: ``He's out of \nthe mainstream.''\n  I mentioned earlier Judge Charles Pickering, who is nominated to the \nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. A few weeks ago, \nin our last Judiciary Committee hearing on Judge Pickering's \nnomination, Senator Kennedy spoke of the important role the Fifth \nCircuit has played during the civil rights struggle, and he is \nabsolutely correct in that. As a lawyer from Georgia who once was a \nproud member of the old Fifth Circuit bar, before that circuit was \nsplit in half in 1980 to create the Eleventh Circuit, I am well aware \nof the tremendous role the Fifth Circuit played in the civil rights \nstruggle.\n\n  It is with a deep and abiding respect for the tradition of the Fifth \nCircuit that I support Judge Charles Pickering's nomination to that \nbench as one who deserves the honor of this service.\n  While Judge Pickering's critics have and will continue to unfairly \nlabel him as a racist and segregationist and, again, ``out of the \nmainstream,'' nothing could be further from the truth. Charles \nPickering has worked to eliminate racial disparities in Mississippi. \nJudge Pickering has not just talked about improving race relations, he \nhas backed up his words with a lifetime of action. For example, in \nMississippi during the 1960s, he testified and helped prosecute Sam \nBowers, the imperial wizard of the Klu Klux Klan, for the murder of a \ncivil rights activist, Vernon Dahmer. He served as a leader in his \ncommunity to integrate the public schools. In 1976, he hired James King \nas the first African-American political staffer for the Mississippi \nRepublican Party. He represented an African-American man falsely \naccused of robbing a 16-year-old girl in 1981. He chaired the Race \nRelations Committee for Jones County, MS, in 1988. He helped establish \na group to work with at-risk African-American youths in Laurel, MS, and \nhe serves on the board of the Institute of Racial Reconciliation at the \nUniversity of Mississippi.\n  Now, I grew up in the South, and for those who did not grow up in the \nSouth, to criticize this man, during a very difficult time in the \nhistory of our country, is not only unfair and unjust, it is almost un-\nAmerican. This man made a commitment to ensure that race relations in \nMississippi would improve every single day of his life, and unless one \nhas walked in the shoes of somebody like Judge Pickering and looked \nrace in the eye as he did, they cannot understand the principle, the \nintegrity, and the character of this man.\n  What he did says a lot about Charles Pickering in and of itself, \noutside of the decisions he has made on the bench as a district court \njudge.\n  Judge Charles Pickering has tremendous bipartisan support from the \npeople back home who know him best, including the top Democratic \nelected officials of Mississippi. This shows that he is well within the \nmainstream of legal thinking in Mississippi today and in the Fifth \nCircuit, just as Priscilla Owen's reelection by the people of Texas, \nwith 84 percent of the vote, shows that she is in the mainstream in \nTexas and in the Fifth Circuit.\n  In September, Miguel Estrada withdrew his nomination after a minority \nof Senators prevented him from getting a vote for 28 months. This is a \nman who came to the United States from Honduras as a teenager, \ngraduated from Columbia undergrad and then Harvard Law School, worked \nin the Justice Department for two administrations, including the \nClinton administration, and was rated ``Well Qualified'' by the \nAmerican Bar Association. So I guess we should not forget Miguel \nEstrada when we tally these filibusters. It is really not four, it is \nfive. I suspect it is about to be six because we have another \nnomination that will likely come out of the Judiciary Committee on \nThursday of this week, and that is the nomination of California Supreme \nCourt Justice Janice Rogers Brown.\n  The American people will not continue to stand for this inaction, and \nthey will not forget this obstructionist game playing. While we can \nstill try to maintain the dignity and tradition of the Senate, I ask my \ncolleagues to vote to give each of these qualified nominees an up-or-\ndown vote. I ask my colleagues to make up their minds. Their \nconstituents deserve it. Let us move forward on the merits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. On behalf of the Senator from Texas, I claim 9 minutes of \nthe time that has been reserved for her and ask that the Chair notify \nme after 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13843-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13843-S13847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPPORT OF AMERICAN TROOPS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise this morning in support of the U.S. \nforces in Iraq and all our forces engaged in the war on terrorism. I am \ndelighted and very pleased that the vast majority of this body voted \noverwhelmingly in support of the supplemental and our ongoing efforts \nto protect our troops to finish the job so we can bring our troops \nhome.\n  Last week, I had the honor of going out to Walter Reed to visit a \nnumber of our wounded soldiers recently returned from Iraq. The spirit \nand enthusiasm of our service men and women serving in the war on \nterror is inspiring. It should remind all of us that our warfighters \nhave the will to win as long as the American people have the will to \nwin.\n  We cannot be defeated by Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden \nmilitarily. They are engaged in a psychological war to break our will. \nThis past weekend brought news of the tragic loss of 16 soldiers in a \nChinook helicopter mishap. No one in this body takes that current \nconflict lightly. Any loss of life is difficult to bear, particularly \nthis tragic situation. Yet we must not forget the losses incurred in \nthe United States on 9/11, and the loss of innocent lives in other \nterrorist attacks, from the marine barracks in Lebanon to the disco \nbombing in Bali.\n  The message we must send, if we are to avoid future catastrophic \nattacks, is that no price is too great for the freedoms we and other \nfreedom-loving peoples now hold dear. The message we need to send our \nenemies is that we will not cut and run.\n  There are critics of U.S. foreign policy who now want us to pull out. \nThey are just dead wrong. Do they think Saddam Hussein was not really \nevil, was not really a threat?\n  Last week, I talked a little bit about the unclassified report \nreleased by Dr. David Kay, the head of the Iraqi Survey Group, who has \nbeen over there looking. He has found a tremendous record of denial, \ndeception, and destruction, which among other things is likely the \nreason we have not found the storehouses of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Dr. Kay believes that people have been distorting his record. I will \nsubmit for the record a copy of his November 1, 2003, piece in the \nWashington Post. It begins:\n\n       The October 26 front-page article ``Search in Iraq Fails to \n     Find Nuclear Threat,'' is wildly off the mark.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. I am going to quote from just pieces of his report, because \napparently a lot of my colleagues who are saying it confirms that there \nwere no weapons of mass destruction have not read the report.\n  Here is what Dr. Kay said:\n\n       With regard to biological warfare activities, which has \n     been one of our two initial areas of focus, ISG teams are \n     uncovering significant information, including research \n     and development of BW-applicable organisms, the \n     involvement of Iraqi intelligence service in possible BW \n     activities, and deliberate concealment activities. All of \n     this suggests Iraq, after 1996, further compartmentalized \n     its program and focused on maintaining smaller, covert \n     capabilities that could be activated quickly to surge the \n     production of BW agents. Debriefings of IIS officials and \n     site visits have begun to unravel a clandestine network of \n     laboratories and facilities within the security service \n     apparatus. This network was never declared to the U.N. and \n     was previously unknown.\n\n  Again, he said two key former BW scientists confirmed that Iraq, \nunder\n\n[[Page S13844]]\n\nthe guise of legitimate activity, developed refinements of processes \nand products relevant to BW agents. Iraq concealed equipment and \nmaterials from U.N. inspectors when they returned in 2002. One \nnoteworthy example is a collection of referenced strains that ought to \nhave been declared to the U.N. Among them was a vial of live C. \nbotulinum Okra B from which a biological agent can be produced.\n  ISG teams have developed multiple sources that indicate that Iraq \nexplored the possibility of CW production in recent years, possibly as \nlate as 2003.\n  Information obtained since OIF has identified several key areas in \nwhich Iraq may have engaged in proscribed or undeclared activities \nsince 1991, including research on a possible VX stabilizer, research \nand development for CW-capable munitions, and procurement concealment \nof dual-use materials and equipment.\n  Officials assert Saddam would have resumed nuclear weapons \ndevelopment at some future point. Iraq did take steps to preserve some \ncapability from the pre-1991 nuclear weapons program.\n  Detainees and cooperative sources indicate that beginning in 2000, \nSaddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges of at \nleast 400 kilometers and up to 1,000 kilometers, and that measures to \nconceal these projects from UNMOVIC were initiated in late 2002, ahead \nof the arrival of inspectors.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kay report be \nprinted in the Record. It talks about several revelations of his \nefforts to obtain ballistic missiles and unmanned air vehicles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       What have we found and what have we not found in the first \n     3 months of our work?\n        We have discovered dozens of WMD-related program \n     activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq \n     concealed from the United Nations during the inspections that \n     began in late 2002. The discovery of these deliberate \n     concealment efforts have come about both through the \n     admissions of Iraqi scientists and officials concerning \n     information they deliberately withheld and through physical \n     evidence of equipment and activities that ISG has discovered \n     that should have been declared to the UN. Let me just give \n     you a few examples of these concealment efforts, some of \n     which I will elaborate on later:\n       A clandestine network of laboratories and safehouses within \n     the Iraqi Intelligence Service that contained equipment \n     subject to UN monitoring and suitable for continuing CBW \n     research.\n       A prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human testing \n     of BW agents, that Iraqi officials working to prepare for UN \n     inspections were explicitly ordered not to declare to the UN.\n       Reference strains of biological organisms concealed in a \n     scientist's home, one of which can be used to produce \n     biological weapons.\n       New research on BW-applicable agents, Brucella and Congo \n     Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), and continuing work on \n     ricin and aflatoxin were not declared to the UN.\n       Documents and equipment, hidden in scientists' homes, that \n     would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment by \n     centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS).\n       A line of UAVs not fully declared at an undeclared \n     production facility and an admission that they had tested one \n     of their declared UAVs out to a range of 500 km, 350 km \n     beyond the permissible limit.\n       Continuing covert capability to manufacture fuel propellant \n     useful only for prohibited SCUD variant missiles, a \n     capability that was maintained at least until the end of 2001 \n     and that cooperating Iraqi scientists have said they were \n     told to conceal from the UN.\n       Plans and advanced design work for new long-range missiles \n     with ranges up to at least 1000 km--well beyond the 150 km \n     range limit imposed by the UN. Missiles of a 1000 km range \n     would have allowed Iraq to threaten targets throughout the \n     Middle East, including Ankara, Cairo, and Abu Dhabi.\n       Clandestine attempts between late 1999 and 2002 to obtain \n     from North Korea technology related to 1,300 km range \n     ballistic missiles--probably the No Dong--300 km range anti-\n     ship cruise missiles, and other prohibited military \n     equipment.\n       In addition to the discovery of extensive concealment \n     efforts, we have been faced with a systematic sanitization of \n     documentary and computer evidence in a wide range of offices, \n     laboratories, and companies suspected of WMD work. The \n     pattern of these efforts to erase evidence--hard drives \n     destroyed, specific files burned, equipment cleaned of all \n     traces of use--are ones of deliberate, rather than random, \n     acts. For example,\n       On 10 July 2003 an ISG team exploited the Revolutionary \n     Command Council (RCC) Headquarters in Baghdad. The basement \n     of the main building contained an archive of documents \n     situated on well-organized rows of metal shelving. The \n     basement suffered no fire damage despite the total \n     destruction of the upper floors from coalition air strikes. \n     Upon arrival the exploitation team encountered small piles of \n     ash where individual documents or binders of documents were \n     intentionally destroyed. Computer hard drives had been \n     deliberately destroyed. Computers would have had financial \n     value to a random looter; their destruction, rather than \n     removal for resale or reuse, indicates a targeted effort to \n     prevent Coalition forces from gaining access to their \n     contents.\n       All IIS laboratories visited by IIS exploitation teams have \n     been clearly sanitized, including removal of much equipment, \n     shredding and burning of documents, and even the removal of \n     nameplates from office doors.\n       Although much of the deliberate destruction and \n     sanitization of documents and records probably occurred \n     during the height of OIF combat operations, indications of \n     significant continuing destruction efforts have been found \n     after the end of major combat operations, including entry in \n     May 2003 of the locked gated vaults of the Ba'ath party \n     intelligence building in Baghdad and highly selective \n     destruction of computer hard drives and data storage \n     equipment along with the burning of a small number of \n     specific binders that appear to have contained financial and \n     intelligence records, and in July 2003 a site exploitation \n     team at the Abu Ghurayb Prison found one pile of the \n     smoldering ashes from documents that was still warm to the \n     touch.\n       I would now like to review our efforts in each of the major \n     lines of enquiry that ISG has pursued during this initial \n     phase of its work.\n       With regard to biological warfare activities, which has \n     been one of our two initial areas of focus, ISG teams are \n     uncovering significant information--including research and \n     development of BW applicable organisms, the involvement of \n     Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) in possible BW activities, \n     and deliberate concealment activities. All of this suggests \n     Iraq after 1996 further compartmentalized its program and \n     focused on maintaining smaller, covert capabilities that \n     could be activated quickly to surge the production of BW \n     agents.\n       Debriefings of IIS officials and site visits have begun to \n     unravel a clandestine network of laboratories and facilities \n     within the security service apparatus. This network was never \n     declared to the UN and was previously unknown. We are still \n     working on determining the extent to which this network was \n     tied to large-scale military efforts or BW terror weapons, \n     but this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving \n     BW expertise, BW capable facilities and continuing R \n     key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming \n     BW  production. The IIS also played a prominent role in \n     sponsoring students for overseas graduate studies in the \n     biological sciences, according to Iraqi scientists and IIS \n     sources, providing an important avenue for furthering BW-\n     applicable research. This was the only area of graduate \n     work that the IIS appeared to sponsor.\n       Discussions with Iraqi scientists uncovered agent R work \n     that paired overt work with nonpathogenic organisms serving \n     as surrogates for prohibited investigation with pathogenic \n     agents. Examples include: B. Thurengiensis (Bt) with B. \n     anthracis (anthrax), and medicinal plants with ricin. In a \n     similar vein, two key former BW scientists, confirmed that \n     Iraq under the guise of legitimate activity developed \n     refinements of processes and products relevant to BW agents. \n     The scientists discussed the development of improved, \n     simplified fermentation and spray drying capabilities for the \n     simulant Bt that would have been directly applicable to \n     anthrax, and one scientist confirmed that the production line \n     for Bt could be switched to produce anthrax in one week if \n     the seed stock were available.\n       A very large body of information has been developed through \n     debriefings, site visits, and exploitation of captured Iraqi \n     documents that confirms that Iraq concealed equipment and \n     materials from UN inspectors when they returned in 2002. One \n     noteworthy example is a collection of reference strains that \n     ought to have been declared to the UN. Among them was a vial \n     of live C. botulinum Okra B. from which a biological agent \n     can be produced. This discovery--hidden in the home of a BW \n     scientist--illustrates the point I made earlier about the \n     difficulty of locating small stocks of material that can be \n     used to covertly surge production of deadly weapons. The \n     scientist who concealed the vials containing this agent has \n     identified a large cache of agents that he was asked, but \n     refused, to conceal. ISG is actively searching for this \n     second cache.\n       Additional information is beginning to corroborate \n     reporting since 1996 about human testing activities using \n     chemical and biological substances, but progress in this area \n     is slow given the concern of knowledgeable Iraqi personnel \n     about their being prosecuted for crimes against humanity.\n       We have not yet been able to corroborate the existence of a \n     mobile BW production effort. Investigation into the origin of \n     and intended use for the two trailers found in northern Iraq \n     in April has yielded a number of explanations, including \n     hydrogen, missile propellant, and BW production, but \n     technical limitations would prevent any of these processes \n     from being ideally suited to these trailers. That said, \n     nothing we have discovered rules out their potential use in \n     BW production.\n       We have made significant progress in identifying and \n     locating individuals who were reportedly involved in a mobile \n     program, and\n\n[[Page S13845]]\n\n     we are confident that we will be able to get an answer to the \n     questions as to whether there was a mobile program and \n     whether the trailers that have been discovered so far were \n     part of such a program.\n       Let me turn now to chemical weapons (CW). In searching for \n     retained stocks of chemical munitions, ISG has had to contend \n     with the almost unbelievable scale of Iraq's conventional \n     weapons armory, which dwarfs by orders of magnitude the \n     physical size of any conceivable stock of chemical weapons. \n     For example, there are approximately 130 known Iraqi \n     Ammunition Storage Points (ASP), many of which exceed 50 \n     square miles in size and hold an estimated 600,000 tons of \n     artillery shells, rockets, aviation bombs and other \n     ordinance. Of these 130 ASPs, approximately 120 still remain \n     unexamined. As Iraqi practice was not to mark much of their \n     chemical ordinance and to store it at the same ASPs that held \n     conventional rounds, the size of the required search effort \n     is enormous.\n       While searching for retained weapons, ISG teams have \n     developed multiple sources that indicate that Iraq explored \n     the possibility of CW production in recent years, possibly as \n     late as 2003. When Saddam had asked a senior military \n     official in either 2001 or 2002 how long it would take to \n     produce new chemical agent and weapons, he told ISG that \n     after he consulted with CW experts in OMI he responded it \n     would take six months for mustard. Another senior Iraqi \n     chemical weapons expert in responding to a request in mid \n     2002 from Uday Husayn for CW for the Fedayeen Saddam \n     estimated that it would take two months to produce mustard \n     and two years for Sarin.\n       We are starting to survey parts of Iraq's chemical industry \n     to determine if suitable equipment and bulk chemicals were \n     available for chemical weapons production. We have been \n     struck that two senior Iraqi officials volunteered that if \n     they had been ordered to resume CW production Iraq would have \n     been willing to use stainless steel systems that would be \n     disposed of after a few production runs, in place of \n     corrosive-resistant equipment which they did not have.\n       We continue to follow leads on Iraq's acquisition of \n     equipment and bulk precursors suitable for a CW program. \n     Several possibilities have emerged and are now being \n     exploited. One example involves a foreign company with \n     offices in Baghdad, that imported in the past into Iraq dual-\n     use equipment and maintained active contracts through 2002. \n     Its Baghdad office was found looted in August 2003, but we \n     are pursuing other locations and associates of the company.\n       Information obtained since OIF has identified several key \n     areas in which Iraq may have engaged in proscribed or \n     undeclared activity since 1991, including research on a \n     possible VX stabilizer, research and development for CW-\n     capable munitions, and procurement/concealment of dual-use \n     materials and equipment.\n       Multiple sources with varied access and reliability have \n     told ISG that Iraq did not have a large, ongoing, centrally \n     controlled CW program after 1991. Information found to date \n     suggests that Iraq's large-scale capability to develop, \n     produce, and fill new CW munitions was reduced--if not \n     entirely destroyed--during Operations Desert Storm and Desert \n     Fox, 13 years of UN sanctions and UN inspections. We are \n     carefully examining dual-use, commercial chemical facilities \n     to determine whether these were used or planned as \n     alternative production sites.\n       We have also acquired information related to Iraq's CW \n     doctrine and Iraq's war plans for OIF, but we have not yet \n     found evidence to confirm pre-war reporting that Iraqi \n     military units were prepared to use CW against Coalition \n     forces. Our efforts to collect and exploit intelligence on \n     Iraq's chemical weapons program have thus far yielded little \n     reliable information on post-1991 CW stocks and CW agent \n     production, although we continue to receive and follow leads \n     related to such stocks. We have multiple reports that Iraq \n     retained CW munitions made prior to 1991, possibly including \n     mustard--a long-lasting chemical agent--but we have to date \n     been unable to locate any such munitions.\n       With regard to Iraq's nuclear program, the testimony we \n     have obtained from Iraqi scientists and senior government \n     officials should clear up any doubts about whether Saddam \n     still wanted to obtain nuclear weapons. They have told ISG \n     that Saddam Husayn remained firmly committed to acquiring \n     nuclear weapons. These officials assert that Saddam would \n     have resumed nuclear weapons development at some future \n     point. Some indicated a resumption after Iraq was free of \n     sanctions. At least one senior Iraqi official believed that \n     by 2000 Saddam had run out of patience with waiting for \n     sanctions to end and wanted to restart the nuclear program. \n     The Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) beginning around \n     1999 expanded its laboratories and research activities and \n     increased its overall funding levels. This expansion may have \n     been in initial preparation for renewed nuclear weapons \n     research, although documentary evidence of this has not been \n     found, and this is the subject of continuing investigation by \n     ISG.\n       Starting around 2000, the senior Iraqi Atomic Energy \n     Commission (IAEC) and high-level Ba'ath Party official Dr. \n     Khalid Ibrahim Sa'id began several small and relatively \n     unsophisticated research initiatives that could be applied to \n     nuclear weapons development. These initiatives did not in-\n     and-of themselves constitute a resumption of the nuclear \n     weapons program, but could have been useful in developing a \n     weapons-relevant science base for the long-term. We do not \n     yet have information indicating whether a higher government \n     authority directed Sa'id to initiate this research and, \n     regretfully, Dr. Sa'id was killed on April 8th during the \n     fall of Baghdad when the car he was riding in attempted to \n     run a Coalition roadblock.\n       Despite evidence of Saddam's continued ambition to acquire \n     nuclear weapons, to date we have not uncovered evidence that \n     Iraq undertook significant post-1998 steps to actually build \n     nuclear weapons or produce fissile material. However, Iraq \n     did take steps to preserve some technological capability from \n     the pre-1991 nuclear weapons program.\n       According to documents and testimony of Iraqi scientists, \n     some of the key technical groups from the pre-1991 nuclear \n     weapons program remained largely intact, performing work on \n     nuclear-relevant dual-use technologies within the Military \n     Industrial Commission (MIC). Some scientists from the pre-\n     1991 nuclear weapons program have told ISG that they believed \n     that these working groups were preserved in order to allow a \n     reconstitution of the nuclear weapons program, but none of \n     the scientists could produce official orders or plans to \n     support their belief.\n       In some cases, these groups performed work which could help \n     preserve the science base and core skills that would be \n     needed for any future fissile material production or nuclear \n     weapons development.\n       Several scientists--at the direction of senior Iraqi \n     government officials--preserved documents and equipment from \n     their pre-1991 nuclear weapon-related research and did not \n     reveal this to the UN/IAEA. One Iraqi scientist recently \n     stated in an interview with ISG that it was a ``common \n     understanding'' among the scientists that material was being \n     preserved for reconstitution of nuclear weapons-related work.\n       The ISG nuclear team has found indications that there was \n     interest, beginning in 2002, in reconstituting a centrifuge \n     enrichment program. Most of this activity centered on \n     activities of Dr. Sa'id that caused some of his former \n     colleagues in the pre-1991 nuclear program to suspect that \n     Dr. Sa'id, at least, was considering a restart of the \n     centrifuge program. We do not yet fully understand Iraqi \n     intentions, and the evidence does not tie any activity \n     directly to centrifuge research or development.\n       Exploitation of additional documents may shed light on the \n     projects and program plans of Dr. Khalid Ibrahim Sa'id. There \n     may be more projects to be discovered in research placed at \n     universities and private companies. Iraqi interest in \n     reconstitution of a uranium enrichment program needs to be \n     better understood through the analysis of procurement records \n     and additional interviews.\n       With regard to delivery systems, the ISG team has \n     discovered sufficient evidence to date to conclude that the \n     Iraqi regime was committed to delivery system improvements \n     that would have, if OIF had not occurred, dramatically \n     breached UN restrictions placed on Iraq after the 1991 Gulf \n     War.\n       Detainees and co-operative sources indicate that beginning \n     in 2000 Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles \n     with ranges of at least 400km and up to 1000km and that \n     measures to conceal these projects from UNMOVIC were \n     initiated in late 2002, ahead of the arrival of inspectors. \n     Work was also underway for a clustered engine liquid \n     propellant missile, and it appears the work had progressed to \n     a point to support initial prototype production of some parts \n     and assemblies. According to a cooperating senior detainee, \n     Saddam concluded that the proposals from both the liquid-\n     propellant and solid-propellant missile design centers would \n     take too long. For instance, the liquid-propellant missile \n     project team forecast first delivery in six years. Saddam \n     countered in 2000 that he wanted the missile designed and \n     built inside of six months. On the other hand several sources \n     contend that Saddam's range requirements for the missiles \n     grew from 400-500km in 2000 to 600-1000km in 2002. ISG has \n     gathered testimony from missile designers at Al Kindi State \n     Company that Iraq has reinitiated work on converting SA-2 \n     Surface-to-Air Missiles into ballistic missiles with a range  \n     goal of about 250km. Engineering work was reportedly \n     underway in early 2003, despite the presence of UNMOVIC. \n     This program was not declared to the UN. ISG is presently \n     seeking additional confirmation and details on this \n     project. A second cooperative source has stated that the \n     program actually began in 2001, but that it received added \n     impetus in the run-up to OIF, and that missiles from this \n     project were transferred to a facility north of Baghdad. \n     This source also provided documentary evidence of \n     instructions to convert SA-2s into surface-to-surface \n     missiles.\n       ISG has obtained testimony from both detainees and \n     cooperative sources that indicate that proscribed-range \n     solid-propellant missile design studies were initiated, or \n     already underway, at the time when work on the clustered \n     liquid-propellant missile designs began. The motor diameter \n     was to be 800 to 1000mm, i.e. much greater than the 500-mm \n     Ababil-100. The range goals cited for this system vary from \n     over 400km up to 1000km, depending on the source and the \n     payload mass.\n       A cooperative source, involved in the 2001-2002 \n     deliberations on the long-range solid propellant project, \n     provided ISG with a set of concept designs for a launcher \n     designed to accommodate a 1m diameter by 9m length\n\n[[Page S13846]]\n\n     missile. The limited detail in the drawings suggest there was \n     some way to go before launcher fabrication. The source \n     believes that these drawings would not have been requested \n     until the missile progress was relatively advanced, normally \n     beyond the design state. The drawings are in CAD format, with \n     files dated 09/01/02.\n       While we have obtained enough information to make us \n     confident that this design effort was underway, we are not \n     yet confident which accounts of the timeline and project \n     progress are accurate and are now seeking to better \n     understand this program and its actual progress at the time \n     of OIF.\n       One cooperative source has said that he suspected that the \n     new large-diameter solid-propellant missile was intended to \n     have a CW-filled warhead, but no detainee has admitted any \n     actual knowledge of plans for unconventional warheads for any \n     current or planned ballistic missile. The suspicion expressed \n     by the one source about a CW warhead was based on his \n     assessment of the unavailability of nuclear warheads and \n     potential survivability problems of biological warfare agent \n     in ballistic missile warheads. This is an area of great \n     interest and we are seeking additional information on warhead \n     designs.\n       While I have spoken so far of planned missile systems, one \n     high-level detainee has recently claimed that Iraq retained a \n     small quantity of Scud-variant missiles until at least 2001, \n     although he subsequently recanted these claims, work \n     continues to determine the truth. Two other sources contend \n     that Iraq continued to produce until 2001 liquid fuel and \n     oxidizer specific to Scud-type systems. The cooperating \n     source claims that the al Tariq Factory was used to \n     manufacture Scud oxidizer (IRFNA) from 1996 to 2001, and that \n     nitrogen tetroxide, a chief ingredient of IRFNA was collected \n     from a bleed port on the production equipment, was reserved, \n     and then mixed with highly concentrated nitric acid plus an \n     inhibitor to produce Scud oxidizer. Iraq never declared its \n     pre-Gulf War capability to manufacture Scud IRFNA out of \n     fear, multiple sources have stated, that the al Tariq Factory \n     would be destroyed, leaving Baghdad without the ability to \n     produce highly concentrated nitric acid, explosives and \n     munitions. To date we have not discovered documentary or \n     material evidence to corroborate these claims, but continued \n     efforts are underway to clarify and confirm this information \n     with additional Iraqi sources and to locate corroborating \n     physical evidence. If we can confirm that the fuel was \n     produced as late as 2001, and given that Scud fuel can only \n     be used in Scud-variant missiles, we will have strong \n     evidence that the missiles must have been retained until that \n     date. This would, of course, be yet another example of a \n     failure to declare prohibited activities to the UN.\n       Iraq was continuing to develop a variety of UAV platforms \n     and maintained two UAV programs that were working in \n     parallel, one at Ibn Fernas and one at al-Rashid Air Force \n     Base. Ibn Fernas worked on the development of smaller, more \n     traditional types of UAVs in addition to the conversion of \n     manned aircraft into UAVs. This program was not declared to  \n     the UN until the 2002 CAFCD in which Iraq declared the \n     RPV-20, RPV-30 and Pigeon RPV systems to the UN. All these \n     systems had declared ranges of less than 150km. Several \n     Iraqi officials stated that the RPV-20 flew over 500km on \n     autopilot in 2002, contradicting Iraq's declaration on the \n     system's range. The al-Rashid group was developing a \n     competing line of UAVs. This program was never fully \n     declared to the UN and is the subject of on-going work by \n     ISG. Additional work is also focusing on the payloads and \n     intended use for these UAVs. Surveillance and use as \n     decoys are uses mentioned by some of those interviewed. \n     Given Iraq's interest before the Gulf War in attempting to \n     convert a MIG-21 into an unmanned aerial vehicle to carry \n     spray tanks capable of dispensing chemical or biological \n     agents, attention is being paid to whether any of the \n     newer generation of UAVs were intended to have a similar \n     purpose. This remains an open question.\n       ISG has discovered evidence of two primary cruise missile \n     programs. The first appears to have been successfully \n     implemented, whereas the second had not yet reached maturity \n     at the time of OIF.\n       The first involved upgrades to the HY-2 coastal-defense \n     cruise missile. ISG has developed multiple sources of \n     testimony, which is corroborated in part by a captured \n     document, that Iraq undertook a program aimed at increasing \n     the HY-2's range and permitting its use as a land-attack \n     missile. These efforts extended the HY-2's range from its \n     original 100km to 150-180km. Ten modified missiles were \n     delivered to the military prior to OIF and two of these were \n     fired from Umm Qasr during OIF--one was shot down and one hit \n     Kuwait. The second program, called the Jenin, was a much more \n     ambitious effort to convert the HY-2 into a 1000km range \n     land-attack cruise missile. The Jenin concept was presented \n     to Saddam on 23 November 2001 and received what cooperative \n     sources called an ``unusually quick response'' in little more \n     than a week. The essence of the concept was to take an HY-2, \n     strip it of its liquid rocket engine, and put in its place a \n     turbine engine from a Russian helicopter--the TV-2-117 or \n     TV3-117 from a Mi-8 or Mi-17 helicopter. To prevent discovery \n     by the UN, Iraq halted engine development and testing and \n     disassembled the test stand in late 2002 before the design \n     criteria had been met.\n       In addition to the activities detailed here on Iraq's \n     attempts to develop delivery systems beyond the permitted UN \n     150km, ISG has also developed information on Iraqi attempts \n     to purchase proscribed missiles and missile technology. \n     Documents found by ISG describe a high level dialogue between \n     Iraq and North Korea that began in December 1999 and included \n     an October 2000 meeting in Baghdad. These documents indicate \n     Iraqi interest in the transfer of technology for surface-to-\n     surface missiles with a range of 1300km (probably No Dong) \n     and land-to-sea missiles with a range of 300km. The document \n     quotes the North Koreans as understanding the limitations \n     imposed by the UN, but being prepared ``to cooperate with \n     Iraq on the items it specified''. At the time of OIF, these \n     discussions had not led to any missiles being transferred to \n     Iraq. A high level cooperating source has reported that in \n     late 2002 at Saddam's behest a delegation of Iraqi officials \n     was sent to meet with foreign export companies, including one \n     that dealt with missiles. Iraq was interested in buying an \n     advanced ballistic missile with 270km and 500km ranges.\n       The ISG has also identified a large volume of material and \n     testimony by cooperating Iraq officials on Iraq's effort to \n     illicitly procure parts and foreign assistance for its \n     missile program. These include:\n       Significant level of assistance from a foreign company and \n     its network of affiliates in supplying and supporting the \n     development of production capabilities for solid rocket \n     propellant and dual-use chemicals.\n       Entities from another foreign country were involved in \n     supplying guidance and control systems for use in the Al-\n     Fat'h (Ababil-100). The contract was incomplete by the time \n     of OIF due to technical problems with the few systems \n     delivered and a financial dispute.\n       A group of foreign experts operating in a private capacity \n     were helping to develop Iraq's liquid propellant ballistic \n     missile RDT and production infrastructure. They worked in \n     Baghdad for about three months in late 1998 and subsequently \n     continued work on the project from abroad. An actual contract \n     valued at $10 million for machinery and equipment was signed \n     in June 2001, initially for 18 months, but later extended. \n     This cooperation continued right up until the war.\n       A different group of foreign experts traveled to Iraq in \n     1999 to conduct a technical review that resulted in what \n     became the Al Samoud 2 design, and a contract was signed in \n     2001 for the provision of rigs, fixtures and control \n     equipment for the redesigned missile.\n       Detainees and cooperative sources have described the role \n     of a foreign expert in negotiations on the development of \n     Iraq's liquid and solid propellant production infrastructure. \n     This could have had applications in existing and planned \n     longer range systems, although it is reported that nothing \n     had actually been implemented before OIF.\n       Uncertainty remains about the full extent of foreign \n     assistance to Iraq's planned expansion of its missile systems \n     and work is continuing to gain a full resolution of this \n     issue. However, there is little doubt from the evidence \n     already gathered that there was substantial illegal \n     procurement for all aspects of the missile programs.\n       I have covered a lot of ground today, much of it highly \n     technical. Although we are resisting drawing conclusions in \n     this first interim report, a number of things have become \n     clearer already as a result of our investigation, among them:\n       1. Saddam, at least as judged by those scientists and other \n     insiders who worked in his military-industrial programs, had \n     not given up his aspirations and intentions to continue to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction. Even those senior \n     officials we have interviewed who claim no direct knowledge \n     of any on-going prohibited activities readily acknowledge \n     that Saddam intended to resume these programs whenever the \n     external restrictions were removed. Several of these \n     officials acknowledge receiving inquiries since 2000 from \n     Saddam or his sons about how long it would take to either \n     restart CW production or make available chemical weapons.\n       2. In the delivery systems area there were already well \n     advanced, but undeclared, on-going activities that, if OIF \n     had not intervened, would have resulted in the production of \n     missiles with ranges at least up to 1000 km, well in excess \n     of the UN permitted range of 150 km. These missile activities \n     were supported by a serious clandestine procurement program \n     about which we have much still to learn.\n       3. In the chemical and biological weapons area we have \n     confidence that there were at a minimum clandestine on-going \n     research and development activities that were embedded in the \n     Iraqi Intelligence Service. While we have much yet to learn \n     about the exact work programs and capabilities of these \n     activities, it is already apparent that these undeclared \n     activities would have at a minimum facilitated chemical and \n     biological weapons activities and provided a technically \n     trained cadre.\n       Let me conclude by returning to something I began with \n     today. We face a unique but challenging opportunity in our \n     efforts to unravel the exact status of Iraq's WMD program. \n     The good news is that we do not have to rely for the first \n     time in over a decade on the incomplete, and often false, \n     data that Iraq supplied the UN/IAEA;\n       Data collected by UN inspectors operating with the severe \n     constraints that Iraqi security and deception actions \n     imposed;\n       Information supplied by defectors, some of whom certainly \n     fabricated much that they\n\n[[Page S13847]]\n\n     supplied and perhaps were under the direct control of the \n     IIS;\n       Data collected by national technical collections systems \n     with their own limitations.\n       The bad news is that we have to do this under conditions \n     that ensure that our work will take time and impose serious \n     physical dangers on those who are asked to carry it out. Why \n     should we take the time and run the risk to ensure that our \n     conclusions reflect the truth to the maximum extent that is \n     possible given the conditions in post-conflict Iraq? For \n     those of us that are carrying out this search, there are two \n     reasons that drive us to want to complete this effort.\n       First, whatever we find will probably differ from pre-war \n     intelligence. Empirical reality on the ground is, and has \n     always been, different from intelligence judgments that must \n     be made under serious constraints of time, distance and \n     information. It is, however, only by understanding precisely \n     what those difference are that the quality of future \n     intelligence and investment decisions concerning future \n     intelligence systems can be improved. Proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction is such a continuing threat to \n     global society that learning those lessons has a high \n     imperative.\n       Second, we have found people, technical information and \n     illicit procurement networks that if allowed to flow to other \n     countries and regions could accelerate global proliferation. \n     Even in the area of actual weapons there is no doubt that \n     Iraq had at one time chemical and biological weapons. Even if \n     there were only a remote possibility that these pre-1991 \n     weapons still exist, we have an obligation to American troops \n     who are now there and the Iraqi population to ensure that \n     none of these remain to be used against them in the ongoing \n     insurgency activity.\n       Mr. Chairman and Members I appreciate this opportunity to \n     share with you the initial results of the first 3 months of \n     the activities of the Iraqi Survey Group. I am certain that I \n     speak for Major General Keith Dayton, who commands the Iraqi \n     Survey Group, when I say how proud we are of the men and \n     women from across the Government and from our Coalition \n     partners, Australia and the United Kingdom, who have gone to \n     Iraq and are carrying out this important mission.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. BOND. We are engaged in a monumental fight against terrorism and \ntyranny on a global scale, one in which all freedom-loving people have \na stake. Other free countries ought to realize this is a battle in \nwhich we all have a stake. The Middle East region has long been marked \nby instability and marred by war, the threat of war and torture, \nterrorism, and ruthless dictators. Saddam Hussein was at the heart of \nit. On September 11 we lost close to 3,000 citizens when foreign \nterrorists attacked innocent civilians. It is a miracle we did not lose \nmore. But we are now fighting that battle against terrorism in Baghdad, \nnot in Boston or Boise or Baldwin, MO.\n  As I said earlier, some argue that Saddam has not been linked to \nterrorism. Well, what David Kay has already described puts the lie to \nthat. Also, tell that to the thousands of Israeli families who have \nlost innocent relatives at the hands of Hamas suicide bombers whose \nfamilies received $25,000 from the Iraqi dictator for each successful \nattack on innocent men, women, and children.\n  Today, on the good-news side, there are close to 100,000 Iraqis who \nare assuming control of essential civil responsibilities such as border \npolice, civil defense, police facilities protection, and as soldiers. \nWith each passing day, more and more Iraqis are taking the lead in \nsecurity and in protecting Iraq. Over 85 percent of Iraq is relatively \nstable, with the exception of the troubled Sunni Triangle.\n  It is no surprise the Sunni Baathists are putting up the most \nresistance, for they have the most to lose. We have seen recently \ndeclassified reports of the Iraqi-sponsored torture, which are too \ndisturbing even to watch. We found mass graves. We know Saddam \nconducted mass chemical attacks against his own people and launched \nchemical attacks against Iran.\n  I believe the President was correct when he said we must take on the \nwar on terrorism, which would take years, not months. This is a global \nconflict against terrorism. The will of the American people is being \ntested. We cannot flinch. If we do not pursue terrorists where they \nlive now, then we will continue to invite more attacks any time U.S. \ninterests collide with the interests of terrorists.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       The Oct. 26 front-page article ``Search in Iraq Fails to \n     Find Nuclear Threat'' is wildly off the mark. Your reporter, \n     Barton Gellman, bases much of his analysis on what he says \n     was told to him by an Australian brigadier, Stephen D. \n     Meekin. Gellman describes Meekin as someone ``who commands \n     the Joint Captured Materiel Exploitation Center, the largest \n     of a half-dozen units that report to [David] Kay.''\n       Meekin does not report, nor has he ever reported, to me in \n     any individual capacity or as commander of the exploitation \n     center. The work of the center did not form a part of my \n     first interim report, which was delivered last month, nor do \n     I direct what Meekin's organization does. The center's \n     mission has never involved weapons of mass destruction, nor \n     does it have any WMD expertise.\n       Gellman's description of information provided by Mahdi \n     Obeidi, chief of Iraq's pre-1991 centrifuge program, relies \n     on an unnamed ``U.S. official'' who, by the reporter's own \n     admission, read only one reporting cable. How Gellman's \n     source was able to describe reporting that covered four \n     months is a mystery to me. Furthermore, the source \n     mischaracterized our views on the reliability of Obeidi's \n     information.\n       With regard to Obeidi's move to the United States, Gellman \n     writes, ``By summer's end, under unknown circumstances, \n     Obeidi received permission to bring his family to an East \n     Coast suburb in the United States.'' The reader is left with \n     the impression that this move involved something manipulative \n     or sinister. The ``unknown circumstances'' are called Public \n     Law 110. This mechanism was created during the Cold War to \n     give the director of central intelligence the authority to \n     resettle those who help provide valuable intelligence \n     information. Nothing unusual or mysterious here.\n       When the article moves to describe the actual work of the \n     nuclear team, Gellman states that `'frustrated members of the \n     nuclear search team by late spring began calling themselves \n     the `book of the month club.' ``But he fails to note that \n     this was before the establishment of the Iraq Survey Group. \n     In fact, the team's frustration with the pace of the work is \n     what led President Bush to shift the responsibility for the \n     WMD search to the director of central intelligence and to \n     send me to Baghdad.\n       One would believe from what Gellman writes that I have sent \n     home the two leaders of my nuclear team, William Domke and \n     Jeffrey Bedell, and abandoned all attempts to determine the \n     state of Iraq's nuclear activities. Wrong again, Domke's \n     assignment had been twice extended well beyond what the \n     Department of Energy had agreed to. He and Bedell were \n     replaced with a much larger contingent of experts from \n     DOE's National Labs.\n       Finally, with regard to the aluminum tubes, the tubes were \n     certainly being imported and were being used for rockets. The \n     question that continues to occupy us is whether similar \n     tubes, with higher specifications, had other uses, \n     specifically in nuclear centrifuges. Why anyone would think \n     that we should want to confiscate the thousands of aluminum \n     tubes of the lower specification is unclear. Our \n     investigation is focused on whether a nuclear centrifuge \n     program was either underway or in the planning stages, what \n     design and components were being contemplated or used in such \n     a program if it existed and the reason for the constant \n     raising of the specifications of the tubes the Iraqis were \n     importing clandestinely.\n       We have much work left to do before any conclusions can be \n     reached on the state of possible Iraqi nuclear weapons \n     program efforts. Your story gives the false impression that \n     conclusions can already be drawn.\n                                  ____\n\n       When Barton Gellman interviewed me last month I stressed on \n     a number of occasions that my remarks related to Iraqi's \n     conventional weapons program. I am responsible for aspects of \n     that program as the commander of the coalition Joint Captured \n     Materiel Exploitation Center. I did not provide assessments \n     or views on Iraq's nuclear program or the status of \n     investigations being conducted by the Iraq Survey Group.\n       On the issue of Iraq's use of aluminum tubes, I did \n     confirm, in response to a question by Gellman, that aluminum \n     tubes form the body of Iraqi 81mm battlefield rockets and \n     that my teams had recovered some of these rockets for \n     technical examination. Further, I stated that the empty tubes \n     were innocuous in view of the large quantities of lethal \n     Iraqi conventional weapons such as small arms, explosive \n     ordnance and man-portable air defense systems in this \n     country. I did not make any judgment on the suitability of \n     the 81mm aluminum tubes as components in a nuclear program.\n       In discussing the disbanding of the Joint Captured Materiel \n     Exploitation Center, I told your reporter that the center's \n     work was largely complete, and I made clear that its role was \n     in the realm of Iraq's conventional weapons and technologies.\n       Gellman attributed to me comments about the effect of U.N.-\n     imposed sanctions. Again, I referred to Iraqi efforts to \n     acquire conventional military equipment. I made no assessment \n     about the effect of U.N. sanctions on Iraq's nuclear program.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I come to the floor this morning a bit frustrated and \nmaybe with a good reason to be angry at some of our colleagues for what \nnow appears\n\n[[Page S13848]]\n\nto be a general intended deceit of the American people. I hope that is \nnot the case and I certainly will take back those words if it is not. \nBut actions are occurring behind the scenes as I speak that suggest I \nam not inaccurate.\n  What am I talking about? This past week the Senate was consumed in \ndebating a bill about healthy forests and trying to develop some degree \nof active management on our public forest lands to reduce the overall \nfuel load that was and has been feeding the fires on our forested \nlands. Of course, last week, while we were debating here on the floor, \nAmerica's attention was riveted in California where people were dying, \nhomes were burning, and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of \nacres were being consumed. Probably that was the worst wildfire this \ncountry has seen in several decades.\n  What happened last Thursday after a very full and robust debate on a \nbipartisan bill that had been crafted in the Agriculture Committee and \nthen recrafted between the Senator from California, a Democrat, the \nSenator from Oregon, a Democrat, myself, a Republican, and a variety of \nothers to build a bipartisan alternative approach to this problem? We \ndebated that bill and we passed it by a vote of 80 to 14. That would \ndemonstrate to the American people that those who opposed us in the \npast somehow had gotten the message. Somehow there was an awakening \nhere in the Senate that there was truly a need to resolve the issue of \nforest health.\n  The poster I have just put up was used last week. It says: \n``California Burns, Democrat Filibuster Continues.''\n  That filibuster was broken. There was a rousing debate and an 80-to-\n14 vote. The Healthy Forests initiative passed, an initiative I had \nworked on for a good number of years as chairman of the Forestry \nSubcommittee. The President of the United States, standing in ashes in \nthe forests of California or Oregon the summer before last, declared \nthis country had to get busy at being better stewards of their public \nlands or we were going to continue to see catastrophic wildfires.\n  All of that finally came together last week. Now, on the morning \nnews, we see a caravan of mourning firefighters as they lay to rest one \nof the firefighters who was killed in those cataclysmic fires of last \nweek in southern California. While there are those laying to rest over \n20 people killed in those fires, and while the Senate last Thursday, on \nan 80-to-14 vote, passed out a Healthy Forests initiative, now, \nquietly, behind the scene, the Democrat leaders are saying: No more. We \nwill not allow the bill to move any further. We will not allow the bill \nthat passed by a bipartisan vote to go to conference with the House to \nwork out our differences, to actually make it law.\n  Do you understand what I am saying? I am saying the debate last week \nand the cataclysmic fires in California somehow have not changed \nanybody's mind; they have not changed or are not going to allow public \npolicy to change; that behind the scenes there is now a silent, \ninvisible filibuster on the part of Democratic leadership that will not \nallow this bipartisan bill to go to conference because, if it doesn't \ngo to conference and the House and the Senate can't work out their \ndifferences, it will not become law. If it is not law, we cannot begin \nto deal with the 20 million acres of urban/wildland interface that are \naddressed within this legislation so that we will thin and clean and \nmake them less susceptible to fire.\n\n  What is the picture here? Am I getting this wrong? Is this scenario I \nhave on this picture now replaying itself? The fires are out in \nCalifornia, or at least we hope they are nearly out. But they will come \nagain. Here is the reason they will come again. Here is a map of the \nUnited States. All these red areas----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The red on this map demonstrates not 20 million acres but \n90 million acres of class 3 lands that are dead and dying and \nphenomenally susceptible to fire. See right down here in southern \nCalifornia where the fires burn, that red land that was looked at in \n2000, which we said was going to burn? It burned: 3,400 homes, 20 \nlives, billions of dollars worth of assets. Now a silent filibuster on \nthe part of Democratic leadership says we will not allow the bill to go \nforward? I hope I am wrong. I was not wrong yesterday. I understand \nthey are still blocking a unanimous consent request to appoint \nconferees so the House and the Senate can work out their differences, \nso we can get at the business of being the good stewards of our public \nlands the public wants us to be and somehow, some way, treat our lands \nand deny wildfire to other areas of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Senator from Idaho is entirely \ncorrect. What is going on here is a filibuster over naming of \nconferees. As a part of the normal legislative process, you send \nMembers to a conference with the House to resolve the differences. In \neffect, a Healthy Forests bill is now being filibustered without the \nnaming of conferees. The differences between the Senate and the House \ncannot be resolved. Unless conferees are named, the 80-to-14 vote we \nhad here in the Senate just last week is meaningless, absolutely \nmeaningless. No legislation to protect our forests, our people, our \nfirefighters, and our homes can move forward while the appointment of \nconferees is being filibustered.\n  While efforts to solve this critical legislation may seem illogical \nor even callous in the face of the disaster we have witnessed in \nCalifornia on the nightly news, mind you, what is simply unbelievable \nis that the legislation to prevent catastrophic fires such as these was \nfilibustered just over a year ago. Last year when the risk of \ncatastrophic forest fires was clear and immediate and action was \nneeded, there was an effort to block even the consideration of \namendments to the Interior appropriations bill that would have reduced \nthe sort of hazardous fuels that have set ablaze southern California. \nWe knew this was a problem last year. We knew it needed to be \naddressed. But time and time again we have been prevented from moving \nforward. That was then and this is now. Now that 22 lives have been \nlost, 800,000 acres have been burned, and 3,400 homes have been \ndestroyed, you would expect Congress might have gotten the message to \nget the lead out and get the job done. But some in the Senate just do \nnot get it.\n  As the Senator from Idaho pointed out, the American people have a \nright to basic safety and security, which this bill provides. After all \nwe have seen, they have the right to ask: Why in the world is this bill \nbeing delayed by 1 second? We saw this bill move at lightning speed by \na huge majority last week. Now it is stalled and likely to fail in this \nsession of Congress.\n  How many acres must incinerate, how many homes must burn, and how \nmany lives must be lost before we move forward on the Healthy Forests \nconference?\n  During the last year, 27 firefighters lost their lives fighting \nblazes such as those this bill intends to diminish. Would it be today \nthat my friends in the Senate will move forward to appoint conferees \nand finally pass this much-needed legislation into law or will the \nSenate, like Nero, fiddle while the Nation burns?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13848-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Healthy Forests\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I see the chairman of the committee is \nhere. I will speak for a minute while he is getting affairs in order to \nrespond briefly to the Senator from Kentucky about the Healthy Forests \ninitiative.\n  The statement has been made that hundreds of thousands of acres have \nburned in the last few years. But we have had millions of acres burned. \nWe understand what it means to have wildfires. As a neighbor to \nCalifornia, Nevada sent 500 firefighters and dozens of pieces of \nequipment to help fight the fires in California. We in Nevada \nunderstand what fires are all about. I think most everyone in the \ncountry understands how devastating these fires have been. But for \nanyone to come to the floor and suggest we are fiddling while Rome \nburns, that is simply untrue.\n  Here is what we are concerned about. We have a situation where we \nhave been eliminated from the conference process. Remember that the \nSenate is 49 to 51. It is not as if there is a huge majority. We have \nbeen eliminated from conferences. People are saying, Isn't it nice that \nthe Medicare conference is allowing two Democrats in on the conference. \nBut for any other Democrats to come, the conference is closed. For most \nconferences, we don't have anybody.\n  What we have suggested on this bill and on the CARE Act and a number \nof other matters is that we go ahead and send what has been passed in \nthe Senate to the House. If the House doesn't like it, they can send it \nback with amendments. We have done that many times. This is not an \nunusual procedure. We need only look at what we did last night with the \nFallen Patriots Tax Relief Act. That is how that happened. There was no \nbig cry of concern about that.\n  We haven't had the opportunity to do complete research. H.R. 1584, \nthe Clean Diamond Trade Act; H.R. 1298, AIDS Assistance Bill; H.R. 733, \nMcLaughlin House National Historic Site Act; H.R. 13, Museum Library \nServices Act; H.R. 3146, TANF Extension; and H.R. 659, Mortgage \nInsurance Act--these are just a few of the pieces of legislation we \nhave handled in this manner.\n  If the majority wants this act to pass--and I am sure they do--the \nbest thing to do would be to take what has taken place here in the \nSenate and send it across the hall to the House. If there is something \nthey do not like about it, send it back to us with an amendment. It \nhappens all the time. It is not unusual. In fact, in years past that is \nhow it was done. Conferences were not used as much as they are used \nnow.\n  The way we have been treated with conferences, they are going to have \na lot less because you can't have conferences where there is no \nconference. Basically, the majority meets in secret, and when they \ncomplete their secret meetings, they bring the conference report and \nsay take it or leave it. That is the wrong way to do things.\n  That is what this is all about. We want the Healthy Forests \ninitiative to pass. We wanted it to pass yesterday--not tomorrow but \nyesterday. It is an important piece of legislation. That is indicated \nby the vote that came out of the Senate.\n  Therefore, take what we passed, send it to the House, and if they \ndon't like it, they can send it back with amendments.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is it not true what I said on the floor, that you are \nobjecting to appointing conferees to the Healthy Forests initiative so \nit can go to conference between the House and Senate? Is that not true?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. It is absolutely true. That is the point I tried to \nmake last night dealing with the CARE Act and today. I apologize; I was \nin a meeting with Senator Daschle and I was unable to listen to your \nspeech. But the answer is absolutely yes. That is the point I was \nmaking.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The point is the bill is not moving because your side is \nobjecting to what is a normal process here in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. No. I say to my friend the bill is not moving because the \nmajority has decided to harp on the fact that there is not a conference \nnamed----\n  Mr. CRAIG. I guess my point is made.\n  Mr. REID. Please. I have the floor. The fact of the matter is \nconferences have been held around here. What I am saying is the \nmajority has a choice. If they want the healthy initiative bill--which \nwe badly want--then I think what we should do is take what has been \npassed and send it to the House. If they don't like it, let them bring \nit back with amendments.\n  There are two ways of doing it. One way is the way the Senator from \nIdaho suggests. The conferees could be appointed and take it over to \nthe House, and we meet someplace else. That is the normal way.\n  Frankly, since we have lost control of the majority, we haven't held \nconferences. I have talked about that at some length on previous \noccasions. I touched on it briefly here today.\n  We want a bill passed.\n  The Senator from Idaho is absolutely right. The Democratic leader, in \nrepresenting the Democratic caucus, has said let us not do a conference \nbecause it is meaningless, anyway. Let us take our bill we have passed \nand work on it. We had a big vote here. Send it to the House, and they \ncan come within a matter of hours with something they don't like about \nit, and we will be happy to review that when it comes back in a matter \nof hours.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I want to tell my friend from Alabama how much I appreciate \nhis patience while we finished this little scrum on the floor today.\n  I look forward to this most important piece of legislation. This is \nbrought to the floor on a bipartisan basis. We have spent time speaking \nwith the Senator from Alabama at some length in getting the bill here, \ndealing with the same problem we are having in the conferences.\n  I wish that all Senators had the sense of what legislation is all \nabout as does the Senator from Alabama. He, in my mind, is truly a \nlegislator. I have enjoyed working with him in the House and in the \nSenate. There is no question that this bill is here as a result of his \nreaching out to the Democrats on the committee. They have told me that. \nThere are Democratic amendments in the mark now before the Senate. On \nbehalf of those in the minority, through the Chair, we express our \nappreciation to the Senator from Alabama, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2053\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2053.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SHELBY. It is our intention to adopt the substitute and ask it be \ntreated as original text but we will wait for the other side before we \nadopt the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate S. 1753, the \nNational Consumer Credit System Improvement Act of 2003. This bill was \nunanimously approved by the Senate Banking Committee on September 23 of \nthis year by a voice vote.\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act, is a very important, highly complex \nlaw that governs crucial aspects of the consumer credit system. This \nnational system is huge--involving trillions of dollars and millions of \npeople, and is at the heart of the economic well being of this country. \nThe bipartisan bill before the Senate is the product of extensive \nhearings and deliberations by the Senate Banking Committee. Over the \ncourse of the past 5 months, the Banking Committee held six hearings \nrelated to the reauthorization of the seven expiring FCRA national \nstandards as well as the effectiveness and efficacy of the FCRA as a \nwhole.\n  The committee's process helped us identify key areas that required \nreform or improvement, while at the same time, reinforcing the \nimportance of our national credit reporting system to the operation of \nour financial markets and economy as a whole. The committee bill \nincorporates many important reforms while creating permanent national \nstandards. This bill reflects a\n\n[[Page S13850]]\n\ncareful balance between ensuring the efficient operation of our markets \nand protecting the rights of consumers.\n  Over the 6 years since the FCRA was last amended, significant changes \nhave occurred in our credit markets. There are now participants, new \ntechnologies, new underwriting practices, and new products. Indeed, \nthere is more that has changed than has remained the same in the \noperation of the credit markets since the last time Congress considered \nthe FCRA. These changes have been largely positive. They have expanded \naccess to credit to more Americans and permitted loan approvals in \nhours rather than weeks.\n  However, these new developments have had some unintended \nconsequences.\n  Identity theft. As our economy has grown more automated, more \nelectronic transactions occur without the lender and borrower ever \nmeeting face to face. As a result, the transfer of information has \nbecome much more pervasive, and a new crime has emerged that takes \nadvantage of this flow of information. This crime is called identity \ntheft, and the incidence of this crime has grown geometrically in \nrecent years.\n  Identity theft involves a person using someone else's personal \ninformation without their knowledge to commit fraud or theft. \nPractically speaking, the crime involves misappropriation of such \npersonal information as a victim's name, date of birth, and social \nsecurity number. Identity thieves then use this information to open new \ncredit card accounts, to divert current accounts from victims to \nthemselves, and to open bank accounts in victims' names, among other \nthings. The bad charges and the hot checks usually happen while the \nvictims, banks, credit card companies and other firms are unaware that \nsomething is amiss.\n  In the wake of unauthorized activity and skipped payments, the \ncreditor usually takes action and ultimately cuts the thief off. At \nthis point, the creditor's losses are curtailed, but the nightmare is \njust beginning for the ultimate victim of identity theft--the \nindividual whose identity the thief assumed. In most instances, the \nvictims first become aware of the fact that they have been targeted \nwhen the creditor seeks payment. It is also when they begin to \nexperience the negative consequences--dealing with law enforcement and \nthe collection agencies.\n  Thereafter, when the results of the criminals' handiwork shows up on \ntheir credit reports, they face the considerable task of restoring \ntheir good name and credit rating.\n  This bill attempts to combat this growing crime while also helping \nconsumers restore their credit standing and give victims assistance. \nThe bill contains a number of provisions that deal with identity theft:\n  S. 1753 directs Federal banking regulators, the National Credit Union \nAdministration and the Federal Trade Commission to develop guidelines \nand regulations to identify and prevent identity theft;\n  The bill mandates the inclusion of fraud alerts in credit files, to \nnotify users of credit reports that a consumer could be a victim of \nidentity theft;\n  The bill will restrict the amount of information available to \nidentity thieves, by requiring the truncation of credit and debit card \naccount numbers on electronically printed receipts; and\n  S. 1753 increases the punishment of identity theft crimes.\n  S. 1753 also provides victims of identity theft with meaningful \nassistance something they do not really have today:\n  The bill requires the FTC to prepare a summary of rights of identity \ntheft victims;\n  S. 1753 establishes procedures to block the reporting of and the \nrefurnishing of identity theft-related activities; and it requires the \nnational credit reporting agencies to coordinate and share identity \ntheft complaints.\n  Another aspect of this bill is accuracy. The committee also focused \nits attention on how best to ensure the accuracy of credit information. \nAccurate credit reports are absolutely crucial to the efficient \noperation of our credit market. Indeed, the changing nature of our \ncredit markets has made accuracy more important than ever. Credit \nreport information is increasingly used as the key determinant of the \ncost of credit and insurance in this country.\n  In addition, technology has permitted lenders to use credit \ninformation to more precisely assess risks posed by borrowers. Gone are \nthe day when lenders merely stamped loans as ``approved'' or ``not \napproved.'' Today, the lenders employing credit history data, use \nmathematical models to analyze credit risk and create risk-based prices \nfor credit cards, mortgages and other products. Use of risk-based \npricing allows lenders to extend credit to a broader range of borrowers \non credit terms, which match the credit risk they pose. Additionally, \nits use results in very few credit applicants being rejected. Again \nthis is a very positive development, but not one without a cost.\n  Currently, credit applicants who are rejected received adverse action \nnotices and access to a free credit reports. This allows such consumers \nto review the accuracy of their credit report information. Due to risk-\nbased pricing, consumers are often not given the adverse action notice \nwhen information contained in their credit report significantly impacts \nthe cost of the credit offer. Rather, they receive a counteroffer with \ncredit offered at a higher price or with more restricted terms.\n  This development presents a huge concern. The adverse action notice \nis the primary tool in the FCRA to ensure mistakes in credit reports \nare discovered. To address this situation, the committee bill requires \nregulators to promulgate rules to provide consumers notice when, \nbecause of information contained in a consumer's credit report, the \ncreditor makes a counter offer to the consumer on terms that are \nmaterially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a \nsubstantial portion of consumers.\n  These notices will make consumers aware of the need to check their \nreports to ensure their accuracy. The need for ensuring the greatest \npossible accuracy in credit information does not end with these new \nnotices. For example, in large credit transactions, such as mortgages, \nrate differences, as the Presiding Officer knows, can translate into \nhundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Even in \nsmaller dollar credit transactions, such as credit cards, rate \ndifferences can mean large amounts of money.\n  With the practice of credit card companies reviewing credit reports \nand adjusting rates in real time becoming more prevalent, the \napplication of risk-based pricing to consumer finances is practically \nan everyday event.\n  Credit reporting information is increasingly used as the key \ndeterminant of the cost of credit or insurance. With the rewards for \ngood credit so meaningful in this country, and the penalties for bad \ncredit so costly, it is more critical than ever before that credit \nreports accurately portray consumers' credit histories.\n  The committee bill addresses this in several ways. One, the bill \nprovides consumers the right to obtain a free copy of their credit \nreport annually through a centralized system and request of their \ncredit scores or information about credit scores in certain \ncircumstances. This is a big change.\n  S. 1753 directs the Federal banking regulators, the National Credit \nUnion Administration, and the Federal Trade Commission to develop \nguidelines to ensure greater accuracy and completeness of information \nin credit reports.\n  Furthermore, it directs the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal \nReserve to conduct ongoing studies on the accuracy of consumer reports \nand the resolution of consumer complaints.\n  Privacy protections are addressed in this bill. S. 1753, the bill \nbefore us, contains a number of important new privacy protections for \nconsumers. The committee-designed protections are based on our \nextensive deliberations and focus on core areas of concern in the \nprivacy arena; namely, direct marketing and medical information.\n  The bill contains important new medical information protections which \nsignificantly limit creditors' use of consumer medical information and \nrestrict the dissemination of medical information in credit reports. \nThese provisions require the coding of medical information that is \nincluded in credit reports and prohibits creditors from obtaining or \nusing medical information in determining a consumer's eligibility for \ncredit.\n  S. 1753 also requires affiliated companies to give consumers notice \nand an\n\n[[Page S13851]]\n\nopportunity to opt out of direct marketing. In addition, the bill \nrequires the regulators to study information-sharing practices of \naffiliated companies and the level of consumer understanding.\n  Financial literacy was another topic of our committee deliberations. \nThe committee understands that informed, knowledgeable consumers are \nbest positioned to take advantage of new credit products and to reduce \nthe likelihood of falling prey to negative developments, such as \nidentity theft. Financial education is crucial to the effective \noperation of our credit markets since the Fair Credit Reporting Act \nplaces significant responsibility on the consumer to ensure the \naccuracy of their credit reports. For these reasons, the bill \nestablishes the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to review \nand create Federal programs and coordinate the existing financial \nliteracy efforts already established.\n\n  The committee has devoted a significant amount of time and energy in \nthis bill to build a complete and thorough record on the highly complex \nissues involved with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The legislation we \nare considering today, which was passed unanimously out of the Banking \nCommittee, reflects the time and consensus achieved during that \nprocess.\n  It contains language that was developed by a number of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, and I thank all of them for their efforts. \nI also particularly thank the ranking member and former chairman, \nSenator Sarbanes, for his insight and the significant contributions he \nand his staff have added as we have moved through this process over the \ncourse of the year.\n  I believe we have achieved the difficult objective of striking the \nproper balance between enhancing the rights of consumers and improving \nthe efficient operation of our credit markets.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Maryland, the ranking Democrat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join this morning in \nbringing to the floor of the Senate, along with my able colleague from \nAlabama, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs Committee, S. 1753, the National Consumer Credit \nReporting System Improvement Act of 2003.\n  This legislation is important to millions of Americans as we work to \nensure fair, accurate, and effective credit reporting practices, and \nthis legislation is designed to accomplish that objective.\n  First, I acknowledge and actually commend the distinguished chairman \nfor the comprehensive series of six hearings on this legislation that \nwere held in the Banking Committee. Chairman Shelby structured \nextremely productive hearings. There was a systematic approach to \nexamining all aspects of this issue, and we heard from a broad range of \ninterests in the witnesses who came before the committee. I think it is \nfair to say we covered all the bases.\n  Not all the bases got what they wanted. It never quite works that way \nwhen you do legislation. But I think we had a very open, transparent \nprocess, with people having an opportunity to present their positions. \nThey were very carefully and thoughtfully considered. In the end, the \nlegislation was reported out of the committee, on a voice vote, \nunanimously on September 23. I think that vote reflects the response to \nthe chairman's willingness to work with all members of the committee.\n  Now, it goes without saying, each of us, if we could write the bill \nby ourselves, would have somewhat different aspects to the bill. There \nare areas where I would have sought to do more with respect to some \nconsumer issues. But I think we sought to craft a balanced package \nhere. We understand the need for a national credit reporting system for \nAmericans all across the country. It means an opportunity to carry out \ntheir economic transactions swiftly, efficiently, and effectively. At \nthe same time, of course, you have to be very alert to ensuring there \nare protections so people cannot be abused or taken advantage of in the \nprocess.\n  One of the things this legislation does--and I am going to refer to \nit in some detail very shortly--is it really seeks to address this \nissue of identity theft which has provoked so much misery and grief for \npeople who are hit by it. It is really the central focus of people's \nattention now when they consider problems they are having with consumer \nfinancial matters. This legislation has some very significant \nprovisions in that regard, and we were able to move those forward with \nthe strong support of the members of the committee.\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act, which this legislation, of course, \naffects provides for the ways in which credit information is gathered, \ndisseminated, and used.\n  During the hearings, we received a number of recommendations for \nimproving the operation of the act.\n  Among other things, the suggestions addressed: combating fraud and \nidentity theft, protecting consumers' financial privacy, clarifying the \ncredit scoring process and the use of credit scores, enhancing \nregulatory and enforcement authority, improving the accuracy of credit \nreports, improving consumers' understanding of the credit reporting \nprocess, combating abusive marketing practices, and finding ways to \nimprove the financial literacy and education of all consumers.\n  I believe we have taken important steps to address all of these \nissues. The Senate bill includes a number of provisions that will \nresult in enhanced consumer protections by helping to ensure accuracy \nof credit report information and fair practices in the collection and \nuse of credit information and in the granting of credit.\n  Among other things this legislation will: provide consumers with free \ncredit reports annually from the national credit bureaus and provide \nconsumers with an easy method to obtain their free credit reports. This \nhas heretofore not been available. It will require a summary of \nconsumers' rights to opt out of prescreened offers; provide for \naccuracy guidelines; lengthen the statute of limitations for all FCRA \nviolations; enhance identity theft penalties; extend the situations in \nwhich adverse action notices are provided to consumers; prohibit the \nsale, transfer, or collection of identity theft debt, so that such bad \ndebt will not be perpetuated in the credit system; provide consumers \nwith the right to opt out of marketing that results from affiliate \ninformation sharing, with certain exceptions to that right. Finally, of \ncourse, it will help enhance the financial literacy of all Americans.\n  Let me discuss some of these items in a little more detail.\n  First, accuracy. I don't think it needs much elaboration for people \nto understand that accuracy of credit reporting information is integral \nto our reporting process. Erroneous information on credit reports can \noften take a significant investment of time and money to remove. They \ncan be extremely costly to consumers by significantly raising borrowing \ncosts. Insurers, mortgage banks, and other financial institutions rely \nsignificantly on credit scores to make credit decisions. Therefore, \ninaccuracies in the underlying credit reports can make it more \ndifficult and more expensive for Americans seeking to make major \npurchases. Yet we heard testimony in those extensive hearings, to which \nI referred earlier, that credit report inaccuracies is one of the major \nproblems that plague consumers. This legislation addresses that with \nsubstantial measures in that regard.\n  In order to enhance the accuracy of credit reports, the bill directs \nthe Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Association, \nand the Federal Trade Commission to issue guidelines and promulgate \nregulations with respect to the accuracy and completeness of credit \nreport information.\n  Second, free credit reports. The bill allows consumers to receive a \nfree credit report annually from each of the three national credit \nreporting agencies. The bill also requires the FTC to take steps to \nmake it easier for consumers to obtain their free report, including: \nsetting out rules requiring that a centralized, streamlined method be \nestablished so consumers can easily obtain free reports, and actively \npublicizing and conspicuously posting on its Web site--the FTC Web \nsite--the rights available to consumers under the FCRA, including the \nconsumer's right to a free report.\n\n  The provision of free credit reports is a significant step in helping \nconsumers\n\n[[Page S13852]]\n\nto ensure the accuracy of their credit report information, and helping \nthem identify possible instances of identity theft.\n  As to prescreening, under the FCRA, credit reporting agencies may \ngenerate for creditors prescreened lists of individuals with certain \ncredit characteristics to be targeted to receive a direct mailing. This \nprescreening process results in much of the unsolicited mail credit \noffers that consumers receive and about which they often complain.\n  The success of the FTC's Do Not Call Registry has highlighted the \nfrustration of Americans with unsolicited telephone offers. Under the \nSenate bill, creditors making such unsolicited offers of credit to \nconsumers by mail will be required to include a summary of the \nconsumers' rights to opt out of prescreening in their offers to \nconsumers. In addition, this Senate bill increases the effective period \nof the telephone opt-out of prescreening from 2 to 7 years.\n  With regard to adverse action notices, under the current law, the \nFCRA, a consumer receives an adverse action notice after denial or \ncancellation of insurance, a denial of credit, or a denial of \nemployment, based on information in the consumer's credit report. This \nadverse action notice then triggers a consumer's right to a free credit \nreport and other of CRA disclosures.\n  Those are the provisions that have heretofore been in the law. What \nhas happened, of course, is that, as the industry has grown more \nsophisticated in the technology, we are having a move to risk-based \npricing. So there are many circumstances in which a consumer may apply \nfor credit, but rather than receiving an outright denial, which is what \nhappened in earlier days, which then was an adverse action and gave the \nconsumer certain rights, the consumer may receive credit at an elevated \nrate or cost because of information on the consumer's credit report. In \nthese situations, because a consumer has received credit, albeit at \nmore rigorous terms, the consumer is not considered to have experienced \nan adverse action. Therefore, no FCRA rights are triggered.\n  This legislation now before us incorporates a recommendation made to \nus by the Federal Trade Commission to update the provision of adverse \naction notices so consumers are aware that information in their credit \nreport is negatively affecting the rates they are paying for credit. \nTherefore, because they become aware of it, it gives them an \nopportunity to examine that information and to correct it if, in fact, \nit should be inaccurate.\n  Finally, in addition, the Senate bill takes important steps to \nimprove the financial literacy of consumers by establishing a financial \nliteracy and education commission within the Federal Government, which \nwill coordinate the promotion of Federal financial literacy efforts, \nand will develop a national strategy to promote financial literacy and \neducation.\n  I commend Senators Enzi and Stabenow, along with Senators Corzine and \nAkaka, and many others, for their leadership in this important area of \nfinancial literacy. Senator Enzi and Senator Stabenow and Senator \nCorzine and Senator Akaka, for a long time--really, since I have known \nthem--have been interested in this issue. We are pleased there is a \ntitle in the bill that carries forward important efforts in this \nregard.\n  Let me turn to identity theft. I indicated at the outset that this \nwas an issue of increasing concern across the country. Before I do \nthat, I will simply mention a step that we took in this legislation \nwith respect to affiliate sharing. This legislation contains provisions \nrelating to the ability of financial companies to market to their \ncustomers based on private financial information of the customer that \nhas been shared among affiliates.\n  The bill would require affiliates who share customer information for \nsolicitation or marketing purposes--and most of the concern we have \nheard in this area has been with the use of this information for \nsolicitation or marketing purposes--to disclose such sharing to \nconsumers and to provide them with an opportunity to opt out of the \nmarketing resulting from such sharing of information.\n  There are exceptions in the legislation with respect to this \nprovision for preexisting customers, for service providers, and for the \ninstitutions responding to a consumer request. So on the solicitation \nfor marketing, we are trying to address much of the concern that has \nbeen expressed to us, but we have been trying to do it in a very \ncareful way so that the basic purposes of the legislation can be \ncarried forward.\n  I want to spend just a few moments on identity theft because it is \nsuch an important issue now. We heard some absolute horror stories \nbefore the committee from witnesses who had experienced identity theft \nand what it has done to their lives--virtually destroyed their lives. \nObviously, we have to deal in every way that is reasonably possible \nwith this issue. It has become an increasing problem in recent years.\n  The Federal Trade Commission reported that the number of identity \ntheft complaints it received last year far exceeded complaints about \nany other type of consumer fraud. Americans have serious concerns about \nthis issue. Businesses incur significant costs dealing with identity \ntheft. Honest citizens who are victims of identity theft incur very \nhigh costs in money, in time, in anxiety, and in an effort to correct \nand restore their spoiled credit histories and good names. Someone \nsteals their identity and then uses it, and their whole credit record \nis being destroyed. Then it is almost impossible for them to function \nin a normal economic way in our society.\n  This bill contains a number of important provisions that will address \nidentity theft, and I commend not only the chairman but the members of \nthe committee--all of the members of the committee--who were prepared \nto focus on this issue and give it a very high priority as we sought to \nmove this legislation forward.\n  The bill will allow consumers to place fraud alerts on their consumer \nreports. It will allow military personnel to place alerts on their \nreports indicating their active duty status. So there is a special \nconcern for our men and women in the military.\n  The bill provides for free credit reports after a fraud alert. \nConsumers will be able to get two free credit reports in the year after \na fraud alert is placed in their file, as they seek to clean up the \nsituation and to remedy it.\n  As to account blocking, the bill will allow identity theft victims to \ndirect consumer reporting agencies to stop furnishing information \nregarding the accounts associated with identity theft.\n  ``One call'' policy: The bill will require that the national credit \nreporting agencies that receive consumer calls about identity theft \ndirect the complaint to the other national agencies so that identity \ntheft victims need not contact each agency separately. They can make \none contact, and then the information is disseminated on identity \ntheft.\n\n  With regard to notification of fraudulent information, the bill will \nrequire debt collectors who learn that information in a consumer report \nis fraudulent, maybe the result of identity theft, to notify the \ncreditor of the fraudulent information.\n  On truncation of account numbers, the bill will require that \nbusinesses truncate credit or debit card numbers on electronic \nreceipts.\n  And on prohibition of the sale of identity theft, the bill protects \nconsumers by prohibiting the sale, transfer, or collection of a debt \nwhere a consumer is an identity theft victim with respect to that debt. \nThis will help to prevent identity theft debt from being perpetuated \nwithin the credit system.\n  I want particularly to note the leadership of Senator Cantwell with \nrespect to identity theft. Her identity theft legislation actually \npassed on the floor of the Senate last year, and this bill incorporates \nmany of the provisions that were in her legislation, including an \nextension of the statute of limitations and the blocking provisions. I \nknow she has worked closely with Senator Enzi in that regard in trying \nto address this identity theft issue.\n  I also want to acknowledge the work that Senator Feinstein has also \ndone on the identity theft question. We are most appreciative of her \nefforts in this regard as well.\n  This is just a summary of a number of the provisions of this \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S13853]]\n\nwhich I think extends important protections to consumers. The bill \nprovides a number of important improvements in the credit reporting \nsystem.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this legislation was voted out of the \ncommittee on a voice vote. There are certain provisions of the existing \nlegislation that will expire on January 1, 2004. Therefore, it is \nimportant this legislation be enacted before the end of this session.\n  I close by again thanking the chairman for the very fair and balanced \nway in which the hearings were conducted and in which the markup took \nplace. We sometimes put down or minimize the importance of process. It \nis not a very catchy word, ``process,'' but a good deal of what we try \nto do here and when you try to make this democratic process work \ninvolves process. It involves how you go about considering issues and \nhow open and fair you are in doing it; how the majority treats the \nminority and how the minority responds to the treatment it receives \nfrom the majority. I believe a good process contributes to good \nlegislation, that it is an important part of formulating legislation \nand arriving at the building of a consensus to address important \nproblems.\n  I simply want to say to my colleagues that I think the process that \nwas followed in this instance was as it should have been, and I think \nthe fact we bring this legislation to the floor out of the committee \nwith a unanimous vote is, in part, a consequence of that process. I \nagain thank and commend the chairman in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am in strong support of S. 1753 to renew \nuniform national standards for managing consumer credit information. \nThese provisions are due to expire January 1, and this legislation is \nvitally important so that economic empowerment can become a reality for \nall Americans.\n  Since it was first enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act has \nserved an important role in this Nation. Indeed, it is astounding to \nconsider the fundamental changes which have occurred in our credit \nsystem.\n  In 1970, credit card charges over $20 required the store owner to \ncall the creditor who would then have an employee go through a card \ncatalog system to approve the transaction. Today, it takes just \nseconds, even when you are on the other side of the world. While we \ntake this innovation for granted, it demonstrates how much our system \nof payments has changed.\n  In addition, the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act have \nalso been responsible for many of the advancements in how we choose \nfinancial products which best meet our needs. Today a fairer and faster \nsystem of assessing an individual's financial responsibility means that \nconsumers now have quick access to competitive offers for credit, \ninsurance, or other financial products.\n  Clearly, our current credit system has benefited individuals at every \nlevel of the economic ladder, and that has meant new opportunities for \npeople who never before had access to credit. Judgments based on race \nand gender have been taken out of the equation of creditworthiness.\n  No longer is collateral necessary when qualifying for a loan. People \ncan now move on to the ladder of economic success simply by proving \nthey can responsibly handle their financial affairs. Given this \nopportunity to reauthorize the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we must \nensure that our actions do not result in increases to the cost of \ncredit or lower access to credit. Both would have harmful effects on \nour recovering economy. At the same time, we must ensure that the law \napplies to everyone fairly and that the system to protect consumers \nagainst questionable material on credit reports operates efficiently \nand effectively.\n  Recently, in the Banking Committee, we heard testimony about the harm \ncaused to consumers who had false information on their credit reports \nas a result of mistakes or fraud. The legislation before us contains \ninitiatives to increase the accuracy of credit reports, including \nproviding consumers with one free credit report each year. This free \nreport will give consumers a better understanding of the factors \nfinancial institutions take into account when pricing a product and \nwhen deciding whether to extend credit.\n  Free credit reports will also ensure the accuracy of reports since \nconsumers are best able to identify incorrect and false information. \nThis will go a long way in stopping identity theft, a destructive crime \nthat is, unfortunately, growing more common each day.\n  This legislation also continues one of the most important provisions \nfrom the 1996 act, and that is affiliate sharing. Consumers clearly \nbenefit when they are able to call a single person in their financial \ninstitution and that customer service agent is able to access each of \ntheir different accounts at once. We all know the frustration of being \ntransferred from person to person when we are attempting to get \nquestions answered. With these provisions, more institutions are able \nto develop systems to minimize the need to transfer customers from \ndepartment to department. It also saves consumers time and money when \nfinancial institutions are able to realize greater efficiencies by \nconsolidating customer service and administrative functions for their \naffiliate businesses.\n  Let me be clear. Privacy of personal information is extremely \nimportant, and I continue to work to implement reasonable protections. \nHowever, we must strive for a balance and we must not sacrifice the \nefficiency of our credit system in the name of privacy. In many ways, I \nbelieve our responsibility is like that of doctors in the Hippocratic \noath: First do no harm.\n  Just as importantly, affiliate sharing assists financial institutions \nin their antiterrorism efforts by helping them detect and prevent money \nlaundering. A customer service agent who can review all of the \nconsumers' accounts is more likely to spot potential problems or \nconcerns.\n  The average American moves every 6 years. This is about 17 percent of \nthe U.S. population, more than two-thirds higher than any other \ncountry. Our national uniform credit system plays a significant role in \nincreasing the mobility of labor and in the ability of consumers to \nmove while keeping portable credit reputations that preserve their \naccess to low-cost credit. Advances such as these have ripple effects \nthat help our communities tremendously. The families served find \nthemselves with more money since the costs of their financial needs \ndecrease, they have access to credit and loans to meet the needs of \ntheir families, and they are able to establish a good credit record so \nthat they are eligible to obtain a home mortgage.\n\n  Because of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, families are able to build \nwealth, many for the first time. They are able to provide greater \nstability for their families, and in turn they become more involved in \ntheir communities. It is the modern American dream so many consumers \nare beginning to realize because of our efficient and effective credit \nsystem. It is important that Congress act quickly to renew these \nuniform national standards for managing consumer credit information. \nConsumers and the financial sector will most definitely feel the impact \nif these provisions expire. The benefits to our communities and our \neconomy are endless.\n  I certainly thank Chairman Shelby for his excellent work on this \nlegislation. His ability to resolve issues and work with all the \nparties is a true testament to his leadership. It is a privilege to \nserve on his committee.\n  I also thank Senator Sarbanes for his tireless advocacy on behalf of \nconsumers. Similar legislation has already passed overwhelmingly in the \nHouse. I urge all of my colleagues to join this truly bipartisan \ncoalition of Senators in acknowledging the benefits the Fair Credit \nReporting Act has brought to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \npermitting me to do this. I ask unanimous consent that the substitute \namendment be adopted and considered original text for the purposes of \nfurther amendment and that no points of order be waived by this \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the leadership for moving to \nfloor consideration of S. 1753, which amends the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct.\n\n[[Page S13854]]\n\nThis bill, which was approved unanimously by the Senate Banking \nCommittee, will ensure that millions of Americans continue to have \naccess to affordable credit under a uniform national standard that \nincludes significant new consumer protections.\n  Similar legislation was passed out of the House of Representatives \nrecently by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 392 to 30. Only \noccasionally do we have the chance to vote for a bipartisan bill that \nso ably balances the needs of consumers and business.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Shelby and ranking member Sarbanes, \nwe have achieved a product that is good for everyone. In the area of \nconsumer credit, we have a rare convergence of interests. What is good \nfor consumers helps business to expand, which in turn helps to give \nconsumers more choice. The end result is a stronger economy.\n  I urge my colleagues not to squander this opportunity to send a \ndecisive message that we are committed to protecting and improving a \npillar of this Nation's economy, and that is the consumer credit \nmarket.\n  It is a testament to the success of our national credit reporting \nsystem that few people have heard of the Fair Credit Reporting Act or \nFCRA. FCRA is the statute that governs the collection and use of \npersonal credit data that make up an individual's credit report. That \ncredit history, in turn, allows Americans to access the credit markets \nin whatever form meets their needs. For example, millions of Americans \nhave refinanced their mortgages over the past year to take advantage of \nhistorically low interest rates. Others have applied for low-cost auto \nfinancing. Most Americans have some form of revolving credit line that \nhelps them to meet certain payment needs.\n  Very rarely do we stop to ask ourselves why is it that we can walk \ninto a bank, walk into a store or credit union, or apply over the phone \nor the Internet for credit with a mortgage broker and a few minutes \nlater get approval. These people do not know us, they have never seen \nus, and yet they have the information they need to make an objective \nand sound credit-granting decision.\n  When I was growing up, if you needed a loan, you had to walk down the \nstreet to the local banker, who had probably known you your whole life. \nHe lent you money because he knew your family, he knew you were a hard \nworker, and he trusted you to make a good loan. Or maybe because the \nbanker had certain preconceived notions about you or your family, you \ndid not get credit that you deserved.\n  Today, that has all changed. Today, the national marketplace for \ncredit has transformed this loan-granting process. Uniform credit \ninformation allows lenders, big or small, to make sound lending \ndecisions based on an objective evaluation of past credit performance. \nThese objective indicators are critical to the safety and soundness of \nour financial institutions.\n  Poor lending decisions affect all of us through institutional \ninstability and an increased cost of credit.\n  The FCRA, which was passed in 1970 and amended in 1996, has created a \nnational credit marketplace based on standardized information related \nto consumer credit histories for all of us, regardless from which state \nwe come. That same statute has standardized consumer rights related to \naccuracy and access. And the reason we are here today on the floor of \nthe Senate is to improve and to protect this system.\n  Unless Congress acts, important preemption provisions of the FCRA \nwill expire on January 1, 2004. Under the pressure of that deadline, \nBanking Committee Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes have done \nan extraordinary job of creating an exhaustive hearing record on this \nlaw, and putting together a bill that both enhances the underlying \nstatute and also permanently extends the preemption provisions to \nguarantee uniformity, to the benefit of consumers and businesses alike. \nWhen I introduced the first reauthorization bill, S. 660, back in \nMarch, I had no idea the process would move forward with such \nbipartisan spirit, with unanimous approval from the Senate Banking \nCommittee, and a 392-30 vote out of the House. But these votes are \ntestament to the critical importance: the urgency of this legislation.\n  The United States is unique in having what is known as ``full file'' \ncredit reporting. Unlike in other countries, where only consumers with \nnegative credit history have any kind of record, our system encourages \ndata furnishers to report both negative and positive credit history--\nall on a voluntary basis. This information allows lenders to make \ninformed decisions about a given consumers credit risk, and to make \nbetter, safer, and more objective lending decisions.\n  This means that when you pay on time, this positive payment history \ngets reported to centralized credit bureaus. Of course, of you're late \nor you miss payments, that information goes into your file as well. But \nunlike the ``no news is good news'' system that exists in so many \ncountries, our full-file reporting system means that consumers can \nbuild up a solid credit history through on-time and responsible \npayments, and that history will follow us wherever we go. So when the \ntime comes to apply for a mortgage or other loan, a lender can see that \nyou know how to handle your finances.\n  This full-file reporting system has led to another critical \ndevelopment in our credit markets, and that is risk-based pricing. \nUntil fairly recently, credit granting was a binary business. In other \nwords, either you qualified for credit or you didn't. Now, lenders can \ntake a chance on a borrower by charging a higher interest rate to \naccount for that risk instead of simply rejecting a loan application. \nThis type of pricing has helped to fuel America's small businesses. It \nhas also helped those with impaired credit histories or with little \nhistory at all to enter the mainstream credit markets, opening up new \nopportunities.\n  I would like to spend just a few minutes highlighting the magnitude \nof what's at stake today with some statistics.\n  A recent study of the consumer credit marketplace shows the growth of \ncredit card access over the last 30 years, and the results are \nstriking. In 1970, only 2 percent of families in the lowest income \nbracket had a credit card. In 2001, that number stood at 38 percent. In \nthe highest bracket, the 33 percent of households that had at least one \ncredit card in 1970 had risen to 95 percent.\n  Even more striking are the statistics related to access to credit by \nrace. Between 1983 and 2001, the number of white families who held \ncredit cards increased by 69 percent. During the same period, the \nnumber of Hispanic families increased by 85 percent, and the number of \nAfrican-American families increased by 137 percent.\n  It is worth noting the significance of these figures extends far \nbeyond simple borrowing power. Today, you can't rent a car without a \ncredit card. You can't buy movie tickets over the phone without a \ncredit card. And with only a few exceptions, you can't shop on the \nInternet without a credit card.\n  The results are just as noteworthy in the area of mortgage lending. \nOver the last three decades, white non-Hispanic families experienced a \n20 percent increase in access to mortgage loans, while minority groups \nexperienced a 65 percent increase over the same period. Those rates \ncoincided, not surprisingly, with a parallel increase in homeownership \nrates. I think we all understand the important social and economic \nbenefits of homeownership.\n  The study also notes the critical role that automated underwriting \nhas played in democratizing our credit markets. Automated underwriting, \nwhich would be next-to-impossible without a uniform national credit \nstandard, now accounts for over 90 percent of mortgage lending, up from \n25 percent in 1996. According to this report, and this is an \nastonishing statistic:\n\n       Before the advent of automated underwriting, approving a \n     loan application took close to three weeks; in 2002, over 75% \n     of all loan applications received approval in two or three \n     minutes.\n\n  Even more important, the automated underwriting systems greatly \nreduce racial and gender bias that in the past resulted in redlining, \nwhich unfairly prevented certain groups from owning homes, and which \nkept too many financial services companies out of markets inaccurately \nand unfairly deemed to be high risk.\n  This study also concludes that certain changes to FCRA, and in \nparticular restrictions on the type of data\n\n[[Page S13855]]\n\nthat might be reported about a consumer, would be especially harmful to \nconsumers at the lower end of the credit spectrum. In particular, \nminority, lower-income and younger borrowers would be the hardest hit. \nThis conclusion is critical, and gets to the heart of what a uniform \nnational credit reporting system is about. The last thing we want is to \nreintroduce discrimination into the lending system, which would mean \nthat minorities and low-income people would be forced to high-cost \nunregulated lenders for credit.\n  Failure to maintain a uniform national standard would also have a \nstaggering impact on the cost of credit. Even credit cards, which often \ncarry higher interest rates than other types of non-revolving lines, \nhave seen significant decreases in cost, which the study attributes \nlargely to the competition in the market and to prescreening, which is \nmade possible on a large-scale basis by the FCRA. For example, in 1990, \nonly 6 percent of all credit card balances paid interest rates under \n16.5 percent. By 2002, 15 percent of all card balances paid rates below \n5.5 percent, and 71 percent of all credit card balances carried \ninterest rates under 16.5 percent. In 1990, while more than 93 percent \nof all credit card balances paid interest rates over 16.5 percent, that \nnumber had plummeted to 29 percent in 2002.\n\n  I note here that consumers who do wish to receive pre-screened offers \nhave the right to opt out of the system. In fact, S. 1753 makes that \nopt-out even easier and long-lasting.\n  While some of these interest rate declines may be due to a general \ndrop in interest rates, much absolutely has to do with companies' \nability to differentiate risk among borrowers and to price credit \naccordingly. Credit scoring models have increased in their predictive \npower and one result is increasingly competitive cost of credit. Any \nreduction in the type of information available to lenders would \nsignificantly degrade the predictive power of most models.\n  The study further indicates an increasingly efficient marketplace, \nleaving aside the role of interest rates. One chart shows mortgage \nrates back in the early 1980s hovering around 3.5 percentage points \nabove the 10-year Treasury bill. In the last few years, spreads have \nclosed to about 2.5 percentage points. The national credit marketplace \nhas increased competition, with all the positive effects we learned in \nEconomics 101. One of the main reasons we have a competitive national \nmarketplace is because we have a national credit reporting standard \nthat permits consumers, no matter where they live, no matter where they \nmove, to apply for credit and to receive an answer in a matter of \nminutes. America is the envy of the world in terms of immediate access \nto credit for all of our citizens.\n  There are ongoing attempts to mischaracterize the fundamental nature \nof the FCRA as a privacy statute. And while there are certainly \nimportant privacy components to this statute, components which the \nBanking Committee bill strengthens significantly, the FCRA \nfundamentally is about the economy. And all too many of us know \nfirsthand that the last thing our economy needs now is an attack on the \nconsumer credit markets.\n  Under the able leadership of Senators Shelby and Sarbanes, the \nBanking Committee's bipartisan legislation takes groundbreaking new \nsteps to give consumers greater control over their financial lives; \nfight the growing crime of identity theft; and promote much needed \nfinancial literacy and education efforts. Under the act, every American \nwill be able to get one free credit report a year--a significant \nmilestone. The public will also know that their private medical \ninformation will never be used inappropriately in making credit-\ngranting decisions. And the act takes important new steps to empower \nconsumers to reduce unwanted credit solicitations.\n  It is my understanding that some Members may be offering amendments \nthat include wholesale replacement of significant portions of this \ncarefully-crafted bill with a substitute proposal that has moved \nthrough a State legislature under a highly charged and political \natmosphere. While I look forward to discussing these proposals, I am \nfrankly very concerned that we not get into a situation where we are \nplaying politics with access to credit. One of these amendments in \nparticular is drafted in such a way that we would end up catching labor \nunions, churches, universities, charities, and a host of other groups \nin the FCRA net, a consequence that is clearly unacceptable.\n  As we move forward with this legislation to strengthen and protect \nour consumer credit markets,I would urge my Senate colleagues to look \nto the model of bipartisan lawmaking that has surrounded \nreauthorization of key provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act: a \nunanimous vote out of the Banking Committee and an overwhelming House \nvote of 392-30 on final passage. We owe it to our constituents to \ncontinue working together to secure final passage of this critical \neconomic bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, which is so important to America's consumers and \nbusinesses alike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fair Credit \nReporting Act which we are debating on the floor today. I think it is \nimportant as we move through this debate and take up amendments to the \nlegislation that we continue to ask the question, Why do we need this \nlegislation in the first place? What are we trying to accomplish with \nthe bill?\n  First and foremost, this is legislation that is intended to serve and \nprotect the interests of consumers in the United States of America. In \nthis legislation we are providing consumers access to a national credit \nsystem. If we look at the financial services, or our commerce system \nacross the entire country, it is our job to look out for the interests \nof consumers where interstate commerce and business is concerned, and \nthis legislation does just that. It provides access to a national \ncredit system, and it does so at a reasonable cost. We strike a balance \nbetween the needs of the consumers and the impact on our economy so \nthat in the long run both consumers and America's economy are well \nserved.\n  We work to ensure consistency and fairness in the legislation. Any \nbill we take up here which might affect consumers or any other \ninterests in the country, we would want to work to ensure it is \nconsistent, it is fair, and that it creates a level playing field \nwherever possible.\n  As indicated and described by Senator Johnson in his remarks, the \nexistence of this national credit system has resulted in speedy \napproval for consumer decisions and requests and credit cards and other \nfinancing mechanisms. As a result, we have seen access to credit \ndramatically increase since 1970 when the first credit acts were signed \ninto law.\n  That improvement in access to credit markets and credit opportunities \nhas been most dramatic for those at the lowest end of the income \nladder. That is something we should recognize as being good for all of \nthose consumers but also for our country as well. The reason we are \nhere is for those consumers.\n  If we look at the result of the work that was done beginning in 1970, \nthe Credit Reporting Act in 1996, and now with this legislation to \nreauthorize that legislation, the results have been a more accurate \nsystem, a stronger economy as described in detail by a number of the \nprevious speakers, and now with some of the new provisions we will also \nhave greater protection from identity theft and a system that is \nadapted and modernized to meet the new technologies and the new \nopportunities that exist today.\n  Senator Sarbanes described the details of the legislation. I will not \ngo through all of the provisions that enable us to enjoy these very \npositive results, but I will reemphasize the fact that this is strong \nbipartisan legislation. Chairman Shelby and ranking member Sarbanes \nworked through six hearings in our committee to conduct exhaustive \ninvestigation as to the results of the legislation that has been \nenacted before, the new opportunities created by technology, and \ndifferent opinions on different provisions. We have a very strong \ncommittee record. I am pleased to have participated in most of those \nhearings to ensure that we are taking the disparate views into \nconsideration and improving the strong legislation that is already on \nthe books.\n  We want to avoid having 50 States adopting 50 different standards in \neach\n\n[[Page S13856]]\n\nof the areas that have been discussed--whether it is enforcement, \naccess for consumers to credit reports, information sharing, or \nwhatever the issue. We don't want to have 50 different systems for each \nof these areas. That would be a more costly system for consumers. That \nwould mean we would have a less accurate system. That would also mean--\nI think this is an important point--we would come back to this debate \nwith a disparate patchwork, and it would also mean greater \nsusceptibility to identity theft.\n\n  When we are looking at the issue of information sharing or opt-ins \nand opt-outs, some of the privacy issues that are very important, we \nhave to be sure we at least give law enforcement the same level playing \nfield criminals have in that we at least ensure law enforcement has the \nmost consistent system possible to do its job in protecting against \nidentity theft. A patchwork of laws and legislation would increase the \nrisk of identity theft, not decrease it.\n  At the end of the day, this is a consumers' bill. That is exactly \nwhat we want it to be. We give consumers greater access to reports. We \nhave all been frustrated with mistakes, or errors, or oversights in our \nown credit reports. We want to make sure consumers have that access. We \ngive them the protection from identity theft. We improve the \nenforcement mechanism for those who commit crimes involving credit \nreporting or identity theft. We have very commonsense provisions for \ninformation sharing among affiliates that exist so they can make sure \nthe information they are acting on is accurate and fair and adequately \nrepresents the consumers' interests in these.\n  Again, I give great credit to the staff of the committee and to the \nchairman and ranking member for the work they have done.\n  I look forward to this debate. I hope we can quickly conclude the \nwork on this legislation so our national credit system can remain \nstrong as it has been for decades, but also so it can be improved to \nrespond to what is in a changing world.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1753, the \nNational Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003.\n  As we all know, reauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is a \nvery important issue for the financial services industry and for \nconsumers.\n  When I talk to my friends in this sector, it is always the first \nthing they ask about. It touches everyone and their money and our \nnational economy. It's critical that we act on it before adjournment.\n  I believe that the Banking Committee, under the leadership of \nChairman Shelby, has created a fair, bipartisan bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues go support it.\n  We have been talking about this issue for several years. We have held \na number of hearings on it. We looked it over pretty thoroughly, and I \nthink we have come up with a reasonable approach.\n  Most importantly, we have to act now because this bill is also \nimportant to our overall economy.\n  Last week, we had great economic news. Our economy is roaring back \nand that is good news for everyone. But if we fail to pass this bill, \nit could end up being a serious speed bump on the road to a better \neconomy.\n  If there is one thing that markets hate, it is uncertainty. They want \nto know where we are and where we are going.\n  For better or worse, the markets think we are going to pass this \nbill.\n  They think we are going to outline a stable path for financial \ninstitutions when it comes to the sharing of information.\n  Any talk or any sign from Congress that makes the markets think that \nwe are not going to pass this bill would create a great deal of \nuncertainty in the financial markets.\n  Now that our economy is really coming to life, that is the last thing \nwe need.\n  If the markets think we are going to let the FCRA lapse, they are \ngoing to get very jittery very quickly. I can understand that. This is \na sensitive, complicated area. I don't think any of us wants the FCRA \nto lapse.\n  We need Federal preemption in this area. I think it would be a \nmistake to let States and localities all try to impose their own \nprivacy rules.\n  There are trillions of dollars at stake. We have to be very careful.\n  But if we fail to pass this bill, we open a Pandora's box of States \nand localities writing their own rules, and the markets and financial \ninstitutions just are not prepared for that.\n  We can't let that happen. We don't need that uncertainty now. Who \nknows what would happen.\n  On a personal note, I am very pleased that the bill contains strong \nidentity theft and privacy protections, including my amendment on \nsocial security number truncation that will help prevent thieves who go \n``dumpster diving'' or try to steal credit reports from mail boxes.\n  Identity theft is a growing problem in America. The internet is \nmaking it easier for thieves to access consumer information.\n  My amendment will help fight this growing menace. Under this bill, \nconsumers can block out their social security number on their credit \nreports.\n  It's just the sort of simple, commonsense approach that will help \nconsumers without burdening business.\n  I would also like to talk about the amendments that are going to be \noffered by my colleagues from California. They are based, in large \npart, on a California bill, SB1.\n  I am sure California has a fine legislature. And I am sure there \nrepresentatives try their best to represent their California \nconstituents. But I do not think the California Legislature represents \nthe people of Kentucky or the other States very well. That's not their \njob.\n\n  If we adopt the amendments to be offered by my friends, it would have \nthe effect of imposing California's rules on the rest of the Nation.\n  That's a bad idea that will only lead to the economic uncertainty we \nhave to avoid.\n  If California wants to try to craft their own rules and work with \nFederal regulators, I say more power to them--but not if it puts a \ncrimp on the national economy or starts rewriting the rules for the \nother 49 States.\n  Our credit system is a national system and it needs a national \nstandard. Standards that may work in California or Kentucky may not \nwork for the country as a whole.\n  Usually I am all for taking power away from Washington and sending it \nback to the States and local government. But on this bill, we cannot \nignore the fact that credit rules and markets and money are all part of \na broader, national economy that requires a unified, Federal approach. \nTo let States undermine that would be a recipe for disaster.\n  S. 1739 is a fair and balanced bill that sets a fair and balanced \nstandard for our entire Nation.\n  It's bipartisan, it's common sense, and it's a prudent solution to a \npressing problem for our financial institutions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I commend Senators Shelby and Sarbanes on a strong, \nbipartisan bill.\n  Reauthorizing the Fair Credit Reporting Act is vital to our national \ncredit markets, to the broad credit access American consumers enjoy, \nand to the businesses that provide that credit. Indeed, it may be the \nmost important piece of legislation that we enact in 2003.\n  Like all great pieces of legislation, this bill strikes a balance \nbetween those who would like to see more change and those who would \nlike to see less. It is a true compromise between competing interests.\n  While preserving some of the structure of how businesses operate, it \nadds significant new consumer protections and disclosure rights--\nenhanced protection from identity theft, distribution of free credit \nreports annually, better notice when adverse actions are taken.\n  I want to speak for a minute about identity theft.\n  While our national credit system--and the digital age we now live \nin--has brought great benefits, it also has a dark underside: identity \ntheft.\n  It is now so easy for credit histories to be accessed, that the \nsecurity of some of our most private data is easily compromised. As a \nresult, becoming a victim of identity theft is as easy as saying your \nABCs.\n  So what is identity theft? It sounds like something out of an Isaac \nAsimov\n\n[[Page S13857]]\n\nscience fiction novel but it is a very real crime that could affect all \nof us. Anyone who has ever applied for a credit card, a driver's \nlicense, a social security number, even a cell phone, could become a \nvictim.\n  Last year, the Federal Trade Commission received twice as many \ncomplaints about identity theft as it did in 2001. And ID theft is \nprojected to grow in the future. Some forecasts predict that by 2006, \nbetween 500,000 and 700,000 Americans will be victimized annually.\n  This issue is of particular concern to New York State. New York has \nthe second highest number of cases of ID theft of any state in the \ncounty. And my hometown, New York City, has the unfortunate distinction \nof being the identity theft capital of the United States--it suffers \nmore identity theft than any other city in the nation. New York \nbusinesses also suffer as the financial costs of identity theft \nnationwide often fall on the financial institutions based in New York. \nID theft costs businesses millions of dollars each year because \ncriminals use false pretenses to purchase goods, leaving businesses to \nfoot the bill. Identity theft is a scourge on New York consumers and \nNew York businesses. And it is high time we fixed this problem.\n  Victims of identity theft often spend hundreds if not thousands of \ndollars and years repairing their financial lives. But there is more at \nstake here than just money. By destroying a person's credit rating, \nidentity theft jeopardizes an honest person's ability to get a credit \ncard, receive approval for a loan, get a job, or even buy a house.\n  Identity theft doesn't just mean having to replace an ATM card, it \nmeans having to rebuild a life.\n  So I am glad we are addressing ID theft in a strong manner in this \nbill and commend my colleagues for their leadership on this issue.\n  I also want to speak about another critical part of the bill--\nimproving consumer access to their credit scores, the principle factor \nin determining a person's credit worthiness and the loan terms they \nreceive. For years, consumers have been kept in the dark about what \ntheir credit score is and how it is computed. At long last, this \nlegislation lifts the veil of secrecy over credit scores and creates \ngreater opportunity for securing a home mortgage at considerably less \nexpense.\n  The legislation that Senator Allard and I worked on with our Chairman \nand ranking member will finally put an end to this practice by ensuring \nthat consumers have access to their credit score. This will level the \ninformation playing field between consumers and lenders.\n  Specifically, S. 1753 would require credit bureaus to disclose a \nconsumer's credit score upon application for a mortgage. The bill also \nwould require any bank using a credit score to service a mortgage to \nprovide the borrower with the information used to create this credit \nscore. And the credit score, whether obtained from a credit bureau, \ngenerated internally by the lender, or created by a third party, would \nhave to be accompanied by a description of credit scores and the data \nused to generate them. This will go a long way toward demystifying \ncredit scores for consumers. I think it is a real victory for \nconsumers. And, again, I am proud to have worked with my colleague \nSenator Allard on this section of the bill.\n  So in conclusion let me say that I think the bill maintains the key \nfoundation of the national credit system which has served consumers and \nthe country so well--the ability to get instant credit, to get world \nclass customer service, and to get some of the lowest credit rates in \nthe world. And it enhances some of the new rights consumers need in \nthis digital age we now live in.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \ncurrently being considered, ``The National Consumer Credit Reporting \nSystem Improvement Act of 2003.''\n  Before I get into the substance of the legislation, I would like to \nacknowledge the stewardship and leadership of Banking Committee \nChairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes in developing this \nbipartisan proposal--which passed unanimously out of the Senate Banking \nCommittee. Their efforts, and the work of their respective staff, are \nto be commended.\n  Through a series of six hearings they took a thoughtful, deliberative \napproach toward the myriad issues involved in fashioning this \nlegislative proposal. In those hearings we heard from a variety of \nsources--regulators, industry participants, consumer advocates, and \nmost importantly consumers themselves. Those hearings proved an \ninvaluable tutorial to me and I imagine all the other members of the \nBanking Committee. More importantly, those efforts, and the comity \nshown by Senator Shelby, created an environment of bipartisanship in \nthe effort to enhance our national consumer credit reporting system--\nwhich is embodied in the bill now before the full Senate.\n  The Fair Credit Report Act has been central to the provision of \ncredit in America. It has improved access to credit, and enhanced the \nsecurity and accuracy of consumer financial information used in \nassessing creditworthiness. The expansion of our credit system, which \nthe FCRA has helped drive, has proved enormously beneficial to our \nnation and our economy. It provides consumers with the ability to \nfinance purchases of a car, pay a child's college tuition, purchase a \nnew home, open up a new business or pursue some other lifelong dream.\n  Credit is the grease that makes the wheels of the economy turn--\nparticularly our consumer-oriented economy which accounts for nearly 10 \npercent of our overall GDP. And the FCRA has provided millions more \nAmericans, many of whom lacked the financial resources to pursue their \ndreams and those who historically have been shut out, with access to \nour credit system--particularly minority and low-income households.\n  But we should not lose sight of the fact there's a great deal more \nthat we can do before we claim that the playing field is truly level. \nWith several of its provisions set to expire at the end of this year, \nit is imperative that Congress act now to reauthorize the FCRA, lest we \nrisk a severe disruption to our economy that could result from a \nbreakdown in our national credit system.\n  This legislation does that. In fact, it does more than just \nreauthorize the FCRA--a worthy objective in its own right. It enhances \nthe obligations of those who use and store consumer credit information, \nit strengthens consumer control over their personal financial and \nmedical information, it strengthens consumer protections against \nidentity theft, and importantly it promotes consumer financial \nliteracy. And this legislation includes important provisions that will \nstrengthen consumer protections against the serious, and growing, \nthreat of identity theft.\n  It's a serious crime and is rapidly becoming an epidemic. In fact, \nidentity theft is the single largest consumer crime in America, as \nreported by the Federal Trade Commission. People whose identities have \nbeen stolen can spend months or years, at considerable cost, cleaning \nup the mess thieves have made of their good name and credit record. And \nwhile doing so, victims lose employment opportunities, can be refused \nloans, education, or even be arrested for crimes they didn't commit.\n  This bill directs federal banking regulators to develop guidelines \nand regulations to fight identity theft. It allows consumers who have, \nor may have, been a victim of identity theft to put banks and others on \nnotice to guard against the continued use of their stolen identity \nthrough the use of ``fraud alerts.'' It prohibits debts resulting from \nidentity theft from being sold or transferred for collection, and it \nenhances criminal penalties for identity theft. It requires financial \ninstitutions to disclose when their customer data systems have been \ncompromised. And the bill provides consumers with access to one free \ncredit report per year from the credit reporting bureaus.\n  This access will allow consumers to monitor the accuracy of the \ninformation contained in their credit files and ensure that information \nresulting from identity theft does not end up destroying their \nfinancial reputation. These are all important provisions, and they are \nsorely needed.\n  I also want to speak to an element of this bill that has received \nlittle public attention, but will, I believe, be particularly \nbeneficial in the long run--that is the provisions of the bill which \npromote consumer financial literacy. The Chairman and Ranking Member of\n\n[[Page S13858]]\n\nthe Banking Committee noted the importance of the financial literacy \nprovisions in their opening statements. They, and others, including \nSenators Stabenow, Akaka and Enzi, deserve recognition for their \ncommitment to improving the financial literacy of Americans young and \nold.\n  This bill seeks to harmonize the currently fragmented approach the \nfederal government has taken towards promoting financial literacy. It \nestablishes a Financial Literacy and Education Commission to streamline \nand improve financial literacy and education programs of the Federal \nGovernment, including curriculum development, for the benefits of all \nAmericans.\n  And by providing consumers with a free credit report, and access to \nthe information used by creditors to judge their creditworthiness, this \nbill equips consumers with the tools to competitively shop for sources \nof financing and will lead consumers to make better informed, more \njudicious, credit-related decisions. And, I might add, improved \nfinancial literacy will also help consumers protect themselves against \nidentity theft.\n  The various elements of this legislative proposal that I've just \noutlined will prove beneficial to consumers, our credit system and our \neconomy. It's a bipartisan bill that does a lot of very good things, \nand was put together in a balanced manner. Is it a good piece of \nlegislation? Yes. Is it perfect to me? Certainly not. I personally \nthink more can be done to give consumers greater control over the ways \nin which financial institutions share their personal information with \ntheir affiliates, for marketing, solicitations and other purposes. And \nI think we will need to revisit FCRA at some point to look at issues \nrelated to the increased use of credit scores as a determinant of one's \nsuitability to gain employment, obtain car or medical insurance or rent \nan apartment.\n  In that regard, I want to thank Chairman Shelby for graciously \nincorporating into this bill language I offered in committee that calls \nfor a study of the impact credit scores and credit-based insurance \nscore have on the availability and affordability of financial products \nso that we can explore this issue more broadly as we move forward.\n  But whatever issues I, or other members, may wish to raise with \nregard to S. 1753, there is no doubt that this legislation makes \nsignificant improvements to current accuracy and security standards of \nour consumer credit reporting system and our efforts to fight identity \ntheft.\n  The standards contained in the legislation will make our credit \nsystem more robust and provide access to credit to even more Americans \nwho seek it. In doing so, this legislation will prove beneficial not \nonly to consumers, but also more broadly to our nation's economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1753 when it comes up for final \npassage.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National \nConsumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003, which would \nreauthorize expiring provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I \ncommend Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes for their hard work in \naddressing this issue and for putting forward a bipartisan bill to \nstrengthen our Nation's credit system. The Banking Committee has held \nnumerous hearings on all aspects of this issue over the past year that \nhave highlighted the concerns of consumers, regulators, and private \ncompanies.\n  One of the cornerstones of our national economy is consumer access to \ncredit. Access to credit allows for smooth functioning of our national \neconomy with consumers able to get loans for homes, cars, and \ncommercial purchases.\n  This is all made possible by having a national credit system, as \nfirst put into place by the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970, and then \nstandardized by the 1996 amendments to the act. Uniform national \nstandards have improved the efficiency of the system by reducing the \nregulatory burden on lenders, thereby allowing them to pass on better \nservice and lower costs to consumers. Automated underwriting systems \ntranslate to quicker credit decisions and more convenience for \nborrowers and lenders alike, while making risk-based decisions more \naccurate.\n  Failure to reauthorize national standards would balkanize our \nnational credit system and potentially hurt every consumer in America. \nThe Banking Committee recognized this and voted unanimously to report \nS. 1753.\n  This important legislation includes numerous consumer protections \nagainst identity theft. I am alarmed by the abuses that have resulted \nin identity theft. With more and more financial and personal \ninformation being exchanged through electronic channels, there is an \ninevitable trade-off--sensitive information can fall into the wrong \nhands.\n  Over the past several years, identity theft has become a significant \nproblem in the United States. According to a recent survey by the \nFederal Trade Commission, 9.9 million Americans were victims of \nidentity theft in 2002, at a tremendous cost to consumer victims of $5 \nbillion in out-of-pocket expenses and $48 billion in losses to business \nand financial institutions. Indeed, complaints to the FTC about \nidentity theft have nearly doubled every year for the past 5 years.\n  By its very nature, this challenge requires coordination between the \npublic and private sectors and between local, State, and Federal \ngovernment. Identity theft is costly to consumers, costing New England \nalone over $44 million in 2001. The impact on private financial \ninstitutions should be no less obvious, and these companies are \nessential to any attempts at prevention and consequence management.\n  S. 1753 represents a major step in this public-private effort to \ncombat identity theft. Among many provisions, it would allow victims of \nidentity theft to place fraud alerts in their credit reports, block \nfraudulent transactions from being reported, and prevent false \ninformation from ``repolluting'' credit reports in the future. It would \nrequire businesses to truncate credit and debit card account numbers on \nprinted receipts. And it empowers consumers to ensure the accuracy of \ntheir own credit history by granting them a free annual credit report \nfrom national credit reporting agencies.\n  These are good steps. However, I believe that S. 1753 can be improved \nto address several other closely related consumer and privacy issues. \nWe are seeing an increasing number of successful breaches of security \nat banks and processing companies, and we should address this trend \nhead on in this debate. Just this past February, a computer hacker \naccessed 10.2 million credit card and debit card account numbers by \nbreaking into a database maintained by a third-party transaction \nprocessor. This was the biggest credit card security breach ever in \nterms of the number of cards affected.\n  Citizens Bank, located in my home State of Rhode Island, felt that \nthis breach posed a significant enough risk to cancel the debit cards \nof nearly 8,800 customers and issue them new cards. I applauded this \nquick effort to protect consumers. Unfortunately, not every bank \nmatched Citizen's level of consumer care, and many decided that the \ncost of reissuing cards or informing their customers exceeded the risk \nto consumers.\n  In light of this less than comprehensive response, I would like to \nhighlight one particularly troubling practice during this incident. \nAccording to media reports, even though some credit card issuers \nlearned of the database intrusion early in February, they waited \nseveral weeks before disclosing the incident. Even with the zero-\nliability policies for the vast majority of major credit cards, debit \ncard holders could see their bank accounts depleted, and all affected \ncustomers still run the risk of being victims of identity theft, even \nmonths or years after the security breach occurred.\n  Senator Corzine has introduced an amendment that would require \nfinancial institutions, creditors, and users of credit reports to \nnotify the FTC when the security of consumer financial information is \naccessed in an unauthorized manner. A mandatory and timely disclosure \nof such breaches will allow the Federal Government, along with the \ninstitutions and consumers, to closely monitor transaction information \nand mitigate the resulting damage from the breach.\n  An amendment from Senators Cantwell and Enzi would further enhance \nthese identity theft provisions with language from a bill passed \nunanimously by the Senate last year. Their\n\n[[Page S13859]]\n\namendment would establish a single uniform procedure for individuals to \nestablish that they are victims of identity theft, requiring a \nnotarized FTC affidavit, a government identification, and a police \nreport. It then gives these victims access to any business records \nrelated to their identity theft-related fraud, which today is a time-\nconsuming and difficult task.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not address the much broader topic of \nprivacy, a topic that is one of the most important issues to the \nAmerican public. Privacy is important to Americans, as evinced by the \noverwhelming outpour of support for the national do-not-call registry, \nfinancial privacy legislation in California, and the Senate's unanimous \nvote against email spam. Indeed, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis \nchampioned the right to privacy, calling it ``the right to be let \nalone, the right most valued by a civilized people.'' I believe that we \nmust continue the privacy debate that we began with the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act and find the appropriate balance between consumers' privacy \nand the efficient operations of financial institutions.\n  I commend Senators Shelby and Sarbanes for including a targeted opt-\nout for affiliate sharing for marketing purposes in this bill, but I am \nnot convinced that this step is sufficient. When Congress passed the \namendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996, affiliate sharing \nhad a very different meaning. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act had not yet \nbeen passed, and massive financial services holding companies had not \nemerged. Today, according to the Federal Reserve's National Information \nCenter, the largest bank holding company has at least 1639 affiliates \nas of June 30, 2003. The meaning of affiliate sharing has changed, and \nwill likely continue to change as the financial services industry \nadapts to changing times.\n  In its report to Congress on the economics of financial privacy, the \nCongressional Research Service argues that in a world with imperfect \ninformation, financial institutions would have an incentive to offer \nsome compensation to their customers if they had to obtain their \nconsent to use and share their information. The CRS report makes a good \npoint. Consumers' financial information is inherently valuable, and \nthey should have the right to prevent it from being shared for \nmarketing or other profitable purposes. Indeed, as personal financial \ninformation gets passed from affiliate to affiliate and is handled by \nan increasing number of people, consumers will be placed at a higher \nrisk of becoming victims of identity theft. The choice of how that \ninformation is spread should ultimately be theirs.\n  Senators Feinstein and Boxer have put forward a reasonable compromise \non the matter of privacy and affiliate sharing. This amendment on \naffiliate sharing was drawn from the California Financial Information \nPrivacy Act, which was negotiated over the course of four years with \nindustry and consumer representatives. There is no reason for me to \nbelieve that the situation has changed dramatically since the \ninterested parties supported that legislation.\n  Finally, I would like to speak in support of one of Senator \nFeinstein's other amendments on medical information. Even more than \nfinancial data, health-care related information should enjoy a special \nprotection so that individuals will feel free to seek appropriate \nmedical interventions and share all pertinent information with their \ndoctors. Senator Feinstein's amendment would fix the definition of \nmedical information in S. 1753 to include mental and behavioral health \ninformation and health-related information that was collected for other \npurposes like for worker's compensation or casualty and property \ninsurance.\n  As we debate S. 1753 and vote to strengthen our Nation's national \ncredit system, we must renew our commitment to working to ensure \nconsumer privacy amidst changing practices and standards in the market. \nWith this in mind, I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the bill we have before the Senate, the \nNational Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003, is \nclearly a bipartisan effort recognizing that our credit system has \ntruly developed into a national market. The bill will provide consumers \nwith greater tools to improve the accuracy and correctness of \ninformation contained in their credit reports as well as to provide \nimportant tools for consumers in combating identity theft. This bill is \na very proconsumer bill and goes a long way towards enhancing consumer \nprotections in our credit markets.\n  When the Fair Credit Reporting Act was first adopted in 1970, \nconsumers spending had reached 566 billion dollars. At the time, that \nwas quite an outstanding figure. By 2002, that figure had risen to over \n$7 trillion.\n  In just this past decade alone, we have seen tremendous growth in the \navailability of credit. Much of this can be attributed to the \ntechnological advances in the way consumers can apply for credit, the \nreview of credit applications by financial institutions, and the \ndevelopment of new and unique financial products. The incredible growth \nin the availability of credit in the housing, consumer, and small \nbusiness markets is a testament to our financial markets. Accordingly, \nit also is a symbol of the national structure of our credit markets. I \nbelieve that this bill will further enhance the credit markets and \nprovide significant consumer protections.\n  Two areas that I would like to focus on are financial literacy and \nidentity theft.\n  With respect to financial literacy, I have witnessed how financial \nliteracy programs can make a difference for individuals who wish to, \nbut never thought they could, purchase a home. In Wyoming, I have \nworked with a consortium of financial institutions, real estate \nprofessionals, colleges and universities, and non-profits to provide \ncompressed video classes on how to buy a home. These classes have \nproven to be vital in reaching home-buyers and families in the rural \nareas of the State. To date, more than 4,000 families and individuals \nhave taken part in the classes. The great success of this program has \ndemonstrated to me the power that we can give to individuals and \nfamilies over their finances if we gave them the tools.\n  In addition, I also worked with consumer credit counseling services \nthat helped over-extended individuals and families to rearrange their \nlife and breakout of debt. Credible advice makes a difference for \nfinancial power.\n  The Federal Government has a vast variety of financial literacy and \neducation programs for Americans of all ages. Unfortunately, consumers \nhave to struggle through the many Federal agencies' programs and \ninitiatives to find the right financial literacy material for their \nneeds. Title V of this bill will provide a one-stop-shop for consumers \nto reach the many, various financial literacy programs that the Federal \nGovernment provides. In addition, the Title will help bring consistency \nand focus to the Federal Government's overall financial literacy \ngoals--something that does not appear apparent at this time.\n  Title V is built upon the successful model of the Trade Promotion \nCoordinating Committee in that it would being the appropriate Federal \nagencies together to review and evaluate current financial literacy \nprograms by the Federal Government. The Financial Literacy and \nEducation Commission will make recommendations on how to coordinate and \nimprove existing programs as well as how to reduce redundant and \nduplicative programs. I believe that the long-term cost savings to the \nFederal Government as a result of this review will be great. In \naddition, the commission will set forth a national strategy \nrecommending changes to the President and Congress on how the Federal \nagencies can improve their financial literacy efforts.\n  I thank Chairman Shelby for incorporating the bipartisan effort to \npromote financial literacy as Title V of the bill. In addition, I thank \nSenators Sarbanes and Stabenow as well as the other members who \nsupported this effort.\n  With respect to identity theft, the FTC recently released a study \nshowing that more than 27.3 million consumers have been a victim of \nidentity theft in the past five years and that the number is growing \nquickly. A little more than a month ago, one of my own staff became a \nvictim of this crime. As you know, Senator Cantwell and I have \nintroduced identity theft legislation to\n\n[[Page S13860]]\n\nhelp victims to recover their identities, that legislation passed the \nSenate last Congress.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft is the \nfastest growing crime facing consumers today. Victims are faced with \npotential financial ruin when their identities, bank accounts, and \ncredit histories are taken away from them by unscrupulous criminals.\n  Unfortunately, many victims face an uphill battle to restore their \nidentities. In addition, Federal and local law enforcement officials \nare placed at a disadvantage by not having all of the available \ninformation to discover identity theft rings or patterns of id theft \ncriminals.\n  I believe that the provisions in the bill before us take a great step \nin helping the victims of this crime recover as well as providing \nproactive tools to help consumers prevent their identities from being \nstolen. In addition, the bill will give greater significant to the \nIdentity Theft Affidavit and to the collection of information to combat \nidentity theft crimes.\n  The National Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003 \nis one of the most important pieces of consumer legislation that we \nhave seen in years. It is truly a bipartisan bill that will enhance the \nfundamental structure of our credit markets as well as providing \nconsumers with the necessary tools to use the credit markets and to \nprotect against identity theft. I urge my colleagues to pass quickly \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment that I \nhave filed, but will not call up today in the interest of moving this \nlegislation forward, with regard to Title V of S. 1753, the Fair Credit \nReporting Act, FCRA, bill. I would like to thank my colleagues, \nSenators Sarbanes, Enzi, Stabenow, and Corzine, for their diligent work \non Title V to establish a Financial Literacy and Education Commission. \nThis commission will help tremendously toward coordinating the myriad \nefforts of Federal agencies to increase financial literacy in this \ncountry and creating a comprehensive national strategy as an important \nblueprint to follow.\n  As a part of this effort, I believe its important to emphasize the \nneed for public awareness about the importance of financial and \neconomic literacy. My amendment is similar to a bill introduced in the \nother body by the gentleman from California, Representative David \nDreier, and cosponsored by several colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, that would establish a pilot national public service multimedia \ncampaign to enhance the state of financial literacy in this country. It \nwould authorize $3 million over 3 years for this purpose.\n  My amendment differs in that it coordinates this public service \nmultimedia campaign with the Federal Commission created by S. 1753 and \nthe national strategy that would be produced by the commission. It \nwould authorize the commission to work in collaboration with an entity \naccomplished in public service campaigns that has secured private \nsector funds to supplement federal funding and community organizations \nwell-qualified by virtue of their experience in the field of financial \nliteracy and education. My amendment also requires that performance \nmeasures be developed to measure the effectiveness of such a public \nservice multimedia campaign, via positive changes in behavior with \nrespect to personal finance. It is paramount to be able to assess the \neffectiveness of the campaign and other financial literacy efforts so \nthat we understand what works and does not work, and can replicate our \nsuccesses into the future.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Banking Committee \nand their counterparts in the other body to include the language in my \namendment in FCRA legislation during their negotiations following \nSenate passage of S. 1753. It is important that we continue our \ncoordinated efforts to ensure that Americans are financially literate, \nwhich will encourage better decisionmaking by individuals, stronger \nfamilies, better-functioning markets, and a more secure future for our \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2054\n\n      (Purpose: To make an amendment regarding affiliate sharing)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself, \nas well as Senators Harkin, Feingold, Durbin, Lautenberg, and Nelson, I \nsend an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California, [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     and Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2054.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate in its \ncurrent form allows huge conglomerates, with just limited restrictions \non marketing, to freely share vast quantities of personal customer \ninformation with commonly owned companies even if a consumer asks that \nthe information not be shared.\n  Let me list the types of information we believe could be shared among \ncompanies that have common ownership--called affiliates--under the \nbill: Information mined from your check and credit card payments such \nas your political or charitable contributions, your magazine \nsubscriptions, your liquor purchases, the location and identity of \nstores you frequent; the stocks you own and stock trading patterns; the \ncash you have in the bank; when your certificates of deposit mature; \nhow much you owe on a credit card and what rate you get; your insurance \nclaims history such as whether you pay your premiums on time, how many \nclaims you have made and whether claims were paid out; how many times a \nconsumer called the company's call center or complained about the \ncompany's service; an employee's work history, including performance \nratings, use of sick days, vacation, and salary.\n  To make matters worse, the bill permanently preempts States from \ntaking stronger action.\n  What we have before the Senate today is a weak privacy standard built \nfor businesses at the expense of consumers which legislatures in all 50 \nStates are forever barred from improving.\n  I am particularly concerned that financial institutions in \nCalifornia, with the lone exception of the California Credit Union, \nnegotiated and signed off on State legislation resolving this issue, \nand now the same financial institutions are trying to eliminate the \nCalifornia law with national legislation.\n  I will spend just a moment on that because it is important. \nEssentially, the banks and financial institutions in California worked \nwith the State legislature in crafting the Californlia law that has an \nopt-out for affiliate sharing. The reason they did so was because \nwaiting in the wings was a well-funded initiative to pass an even \nstronger privacy law. They knew the people of California would pass \nthat privacy law.\n  Senator Jackie Speier, who was the author of the California privacy \nbill, has sent Senator Boxer and I a letter. I will read two paragraphs \nfrom the letter.\n  ``It has recently come to my attention that the financial services \nindustry has been criticizing the contents of your amendment to S. \n1753, substituting the newly-enacted and stronger California privacy \nstandard on affiliate sharing in the `corporate family of companies,' \nas unworkable and unreasonable. This same industry recently called my \nCalifornia bill `workable and reasonable,' specifically removing their \nopposition to my measure and lavishing praise upon it, even helping to \ngather votes. Industry made it clear that my bill met their workability \nconcerns, progress made with their active participation. If my bill was \nworkable for industry in California, then why shouldn't it be the \nnational standard?''\n  ``One industry representative stood with me on that day and said my \nbill `encompasses all aspects of the workability needed to ensure \nprotection of consumers' privacy,' while another called it `a balanced \nmeasure that will provide meaningful privacy protections to consumers \nwhile also addressing the workability concerns.' . . . Now the story is \ndifferent, as industry sees a political opportunity to preempt \nCalifornia's standard on affiliate sharing with a weaker one.''\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S13861]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      California State Senate,\n\n                                                 October 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Boxer, I wish to thank you for \n     your efforts on behalf of consumer privacy rights, and urge \n     you to continue to do all that is possible to protect \n     California's hard-fought consumer privacy gains.\n       It has recently come to my attention that the financial \n     services industry has been criticizing the contents of your \n     amendment to S. 1753, substituting the newly-enacted and \n     stronger California privacy standard on affiliate sharing in \n     the ``corporate family of companies,'' as unworkable and \n     unreasonable. This same industry recently called my \n     California bill ``workable and reasonable,'' specifically \n     removing their opposition to my measure and lavishing praise \n     on it, even helping to gather votes. Industry made it clear \n     that my bill met their workability concerns, progress made \n     with their active participation. If my bill was workable for \n     industry in California, then why shouldn't it be the national \n     standard? A transcript of their August 14, 2003, public \n     comments bear this out and is attached.\n       One industry representative stood with me on that day and \n     said my bill ``encompasses all aspects of the workability \n     needed to ensure protection of customers' privacy,'' while \n     another called it ``a balanced measure that will provide \n     meaningful privacy protections to consumers while also \n     addressing the workability concerns'' that industry had. Now \n     the story is different, as industry sees a political \n     opportunity to preempt California's standard on affiliate \n     sharing with a weaker one.\n       The financial services industry appears to be acting in bad \n     faith--it seems willing to say and do anything to erode \n     California's recent progress on behalf of consumers, first to \n     avoid a costly initiative battle and local ordinances \n     limiting third-party sharing, now to pull the wool over \n     Congress' eyes. Does the financial services industry really \n     believe that millions of American consumers don't deserve a \n     choice over what happens when their personal financial \n     information, their financial DNA, is shared with thousands of \n     affiliated companies? The industry's position is flawed \n     public policy, weaker than their own standards abroad, and \n     the kind of business practice that erodes consumer \n     confidence.\n       I urge you to continue your efforts in making California's \n     privacy standards those of the nation. California's affiliate \n     standard was good enough for the financial industry two \n     months ago; it certainly is acceptable now. Thank you again \n     for your efforts; I stand ready to help you in any way \n     possible.\n           All the best,\n                                                    Jackie Speier,\n                           California State Senator, 8th District.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, while I was in California, I met with \nthe CEOs of the major banks. It became very clear to me at that time \nwhat they were going to do. They were going to come back here and they \nwere going to get a national standard that clearly preempted the \nCalifornia opt-out.\n  Incidentally, we have modified the amendment I have sent to the desk. \nI know there was some criticisms of the amendment. We have tightened it \nup. I think it will stand the test of scrutiny. This amendment protects \nAmerican consumers' basic privacy rights. It creates a national opt-out \nstandard for affiliate sharing. This would give consumers the choice of \nwhether their personal information can be shared among unrelated \ncompanies in a corporate family of companies.\n  Under the amendment, a company would have to notify a consumer that \nit intended to share the consumer's information with unrelated \naffiliates and give the consumer the opportunity to opt out of this \nsharing. If the consumer does nothing, the institution is perfectly \nfree to share the information.\n  This amendment is fully sensitive to the real-life demands of \nbusiness. Where there is a legitimate business need for the \ninformation, this amendment provides exceptions to the opt-out.\n  First and foremost, related affiliates--which are defined as \naffiliates in the same line of business with the same functional \nregulator and with the same brand name--are exempt from the opt-out.\n  Second, the amendment does not affect the ability of companies to \nhave common databases with their affiliates so long as the information \nis not accessed, disclosed, or used by the affiliate. This is one of \nthe arguments they have raised that this exception is a big loophole. \nAnswer, untrue. While a common database can exist, the amendment \nexplicitly states that an affiliate cannot access or use the \ninformation in a manner inconsistent with the consumer's opt-out.\n  Third, to use consumer information to complete transactions; fourth, \nto protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or identity; \nnext, to comply with Federal, State, or local laws and to do data \nprocessing, billing, or mailing. This amendment does not affect the \nability of affiliated companies to do any of these six things. There \nare a number of other standard exceptions.\n  Before I go into detail describing the amendment. I will spend some \ntime talking about the shortcomings of the ``National Consumer Credit \nReporting System Improvement Act'' with respect to a person's natural \nprivacy and why this amendment is needed.\n  At the outset, I recognize the author of the bill, Chairman Richard \nShelby. He has met with me and I am grateful for that meeting. He has \nlistened to my concerns. He has made longstanding efforts to balance \nthe rights of individual privacy with legitimate business needs. I \ndeeply respect the commitment of Senator Shelby to consumer privacy. It \nis well known. He deserves recognition for his work to strengthen the \nprivacy provisions of the Driver's Privacy Presentation Act and for \nintroducing legislation to require an opt-in for affiliate sharing in \nthe 106th Congress.\n  In the 107th Congress, he joined me as a cosponsor of the Identity \nTheft Prevention Act. Many of these provisions he has incorporated in \nthe bill on the floor today, and I thank him.\n  I also thank Senator Sarbanes. I think his record on privacy is \nequally impressive. He fought hard to create the opt-out standards for \nnonaffiliated third parties during enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley \nfinancial services modernization law. I have the utmost respect for his \nwork on privacy legislation. He is a champion of consumer privacy.\n  The American people should know this about both of these Senators. It \nis just that Senator Boxer and I have a very strong view on the need to \ngive consumers this opt-out on affiliates.\n  I also recognize this bill has a number of provisions I strongly \nsupport. It entitles every consumer to a free credit report. That is \ngreat. It creates fraud alerts. Great. It creates a national standard \nfor truncating credit card numbers on store receipts. That is great.\n  I was delighted, because when I introduced identity theft legislation \nearlier this Congress, the chairman and CEO of Visa, Carl Pascarella, \ncame and held a press conference and indicated that Visa was not going \nto wait for the bill, they were going to go ahead and truncate all but \nthe last four digits, in any event, on their credit cards. As of June, \nall the new merchant terminals using the VISA system--affecting tens of \nmillions of Visa credit cardholders--do have that truncation. Shortly, \nVisa will have all other stations truncating as well.\n  This morning Senator Kyl and I held a hearing on hackers getting into \ndata bases and how you prevent that from happening. Visa testified, and \nit is clear they have taken this very seriously with a very elaborate \nsystem to get at the problem and to use technology to solve it.\n  So all these provisions were included in legislation that I have \noffered over the last 4 years, and I am very grateful to both the \nchairman and ranking member, who are here on the floor, that they have \nbeen incorporated into this bill. So I say, thank you, Senator Shelby; \nthank you, Senator Sarbanes.\n  Now, I think, though, that some of these needed provisions just \nbecome window dressing, if you really can't protect a person's privacy. \nThe affiliate sharing provisions of the legislation would set that back \nbecause the information age is going to move ahead rapidly. That is one \nof the problems: Technology finds a way of moving ahead so fast before \nwe have a chance to see that there is an appropriate regulatory system \nin place.\n  So the debate today over this bill is really part of a great struggle \nover whether Americans--ordinary Americans--will have basic control \nover the most elemental parts of their identity, and whether we can \nstop the misuse and commercialization of their most personal \ninformation.\n\n[[Page S13862]]\n\n  Most Americans, I believe, consider their personal information their \nprivate property. I do. I consider my health data my personal data, my \nfinancial data my personal data. When I do business with a bank, I do \nnot expect to see my mortgages purchasable on the Internet for $15 or \n$20. I do not expect somebody to buy my Social Security number over the \nInternet, or anything of that kind. Nor do I expect the bank with which \nI do business to give my data to a thousand--and it can be a thousand--\nof their affiliates so their affiliates can contact me about traveling \nwith them, investing with them, that they have a better scheme than my \nchecking account. I do not expect that, and guess what. I do not think \nthe majority of Americans do, either.\n  To give you a sense of the groundswell of public support for privacy, \nI would like to mention a survey of California voters by Fingerhut \nGranados Opinion Research on February 7 of this year.\n  The statewide survey found that by a massive 91-to-7 percent margin, \nCalifornia voters would favor a ballot proposition--and let me quote \nwhat it would say--that ``would require a bank, a credit card company, \ninsurance company, or other financial institution to notify a customer \nand receive a customer's permission before selling any financial \ninformation to any separate financial or non-financial company.''\n  Mr. President, 91 percent would support an initiative to do just \nthat. So they are supporting not opt-out, which is a lower, lesser \nstandard, but they are supporting opt-in when it comes to affiliate \nsharing. Similar polls across this great land have reflected a \nlandslide of support by Americans for stronger privacy laws.\n\n  In my 10 years in this Senate, I have never seen anything like it. \nThere is a groundswell out there, let there be no doubt.\n  Here in the Senate we have taken some strong action to protect \nprivacy in recent months. In one day, the Senate drafted and passed a \nbill upholding the ``National Do Not Call'' list. Recently, we passed \nlegislation limiting e-mail spam. In each of these cases, Congress \naccepted the near unanimous will of the public that there should be \nlimits on when and how commercial entities can invade ordinary \nAmericans' privacy--be it at their homes from telemarketing calls or on \ntheir computers from endless e-mail spam.\n  These concerns are equally present in the debate over affiliate \nsharing, except the dangers to privacy are so much more insidious. \nAmericans are fully aware of telemarketing calls because their dinners \nand evenings at home are interrupted by them. Americans are fully aware \nof spam because their e-mail is clogged with them. In the case of \naffiliate sharing, most Americans are not aware that their personal \ninformation travels from their bank to hundreds or even thousands of \nother companies.\n  What is an affiliate and why should we be concerned about the sharing \nof information among affiliates?\n  Affiliates are companies related by common ownership. As one example, \nTravelers Insurance, Diners Club International, Citi Financial, and \nSalomon Smith Barney are all affiliated companies owned by Citigroup. \nSo the types of businesses that financial institutions can be \naffiliated with run the gambit: insurance companies, so you can be \nbugged by insurance companies; securities brokerages; mortgage lenders; \ntravel agencies; retailers; automobile dealers; collection agencies; \nfinancial advisers; tax preparation firms. I even think they buy them \njust for this reason.\n  In 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed \nportions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibited banks from entering \ninto affiliations with other lines of business. So it became fair game. \nThese financial institutions have moved, in a major way, to affiliate \nthemselves with a tremendous array of businesses. These include \ninsurance and securities brokerages, as I said, mortgage lenders, ``pay \nday'' lenders, finance companies, and on and on and on.\n  It could include investment advisers who are not required to register \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. These are not mom-and-pop \ncompanies. The top dozen U.S. banks and financial institutions alone \ncontrol thousands of health and life insurance companies, home mortgage \ncompanies, car loan lenders, housing developments, securities brokers, \nand other businesses.\n  Take a look at this. Citibank alone has 1,736 affiliates which they \nown. They own a mortgage company, an insurance company, a student loan \ncorporation, Travelers Life and Annuity, Diners Club International, and \nSalomon Smith Barney holdings. This becomes a veritable goldmine of \ninformation trading for them, and the information that is traded is \nyour personal information that lets an insurance company, or a mortgage \ncompany, or an investment banking company know where to go to get \nbusiness.\n  Morgan Stanley has 628 affiliates, including the Discover Card, Dean \nWitter Realty, Southeastern Energy Corporation, and a number of \ninsurance companies.\n  Wells Fargo, headquartered in my city of San Francisco, has 777 \naffiliates, including, again, a mortgage company, Advance Mortgage, \nDial Finance Company, Pacific Rim Health Care Solutions, Tower \nSpecialists, Norwest Auto Finance, and Auto Risk Managers. Again, a \nveritable treasure trove, a goldmine for the sharing of private, \npersonal information.\n  Bank of America has 815 affiliates, including T-Oak Apartments, \nStanton Road Housing, NationsBanc Insurance Agency, and General and \nFidelity Life Insurance. By mining data from their affiliates, these \ncorporations can compile vast dossiers on consumers to use to their \ncommercial advantage. An affiliated company can call you up with full \nknowledge of your financial history and offer you credit cards, \nsecurities, loan consolidation, whether you need it or not, and you \nhave no way to prevent the company from using your most intimate \npersonal information.\n  Consider the following case: Several years ago, Nationsbank paid \nfines of $7 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other \nagencies over its sharing of confidential customer financial statements \nand account balances with affiliated securities firms. \nNationssecurities used the account information to identify those bank \ncustomers who had expiring certificates of deposit. Sales \nrepresentatives then marketed to these customers highly leveraged \ninvestments, mischaracteriz- \ning them as straightforward U.S. Government bond funds. Investors, 65 \npercent of whom were over 60 years old, lost millions of dollars from \nthis practice.\n  While Nationsbank paid a fine for its false and misleading sales \npractices, its sharing of customer information was perfectly legal \nunder existing law. We need stronger laws to protect us from the \npotential predations of affiliate sharing. Unfortunately, the Senate \nbill does not rise to this test.\n  The 1996 Fair Credit Reporting Act standard on affiliate sharing, \nwhich is, for the most part, preserved in S. 1753, is not a strong \nnational standard. The 1996 act permits financial institutions to share \n``transaction and experience'' information with affiliates without \nrestrictions. This experimental standard has proven vague and \nunworkable. Even though the 1996 act has been in effect for 7 years, no \none can definitively say what the terms ``transaction and experience'' \ninformation mean.\n  When I asked the CRS to explain the FCRA standard, here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       The [Fair Credit Reporting Act] does not offer a definition \n     of a phrase, nor does the act provide any guidance with \n     respect to what types of information may be included. \n     Furthermore, none of the Federal bank regulators, nor the \n     Federal Trade Commission, have promulgated regulations \n     regarding the definition of ``information solely as to \n     transactions or experiences'' or what information may be \n     included in such.\n       Finally, discussions with industry representatives did \n     articulate a consistently used definition of what constitutes \n     a ``transaction or experience'' information.\n\n  In essence, both the House bill and the Senate bill maintain an \nexemption for the sharing of personal information, which nobody has \ndefined.\n\n  Seven years after passage of the 1996 FCRA amendments, neither \nCongress, nor the Federal Trade Commission, nor any other agency has \ndefined the term. An empty standard is a nonenforceable standard. I \nthink America's personal privacy deserves better protection.\n  Consider again the sensitive information which could be shared among \nunrelated corporate affiliates if we allow the current standard to \nstand. This\n\n[[Page S13863]]\n\nchart refers to the information I have just been over: an employee's \nwork history, including performance ratings, sick and vacation days, \nsafety, whether the consumer is a complainer or not, can go out to all \naffiliates, your certificates of deposit maturity dates, so somebody \ncan contact you when that certificate matures; stocks you own, so \nothers can approach you. Then there are the personal things, such as \npolitical contributions, charitable contributions, your magazine \nsubscriptions.\n  Think about that. These companies develop a personal profile on who \nyou are and what you like, and then tell other companies about you. \nToday, I heard testimony at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about \nsomeone who shopped at Victoria's Secret who had their personal \ninformation used in that way. That is what this allows.\n  The collection of this information is not hypothetical. In Great \nBritain, unlike the United States, companies are required by law to \nfile a report with the Government on the type of information they \ncollect about consumers.\n  Here is what Citibank reported to the British Government about the \ntype of information it was collecting about British citizens for \nmarketing purposes. I think it is likely they collect the same \ninformation about United States customers. This information includes: \npersonal identifiers, financial identifiers, identifiers issued by \npublic bodies, personal details, habits, current marriage or \npartnerships, details of other family, household members, other social \ncontacts, accommodations or housing, travel movement details, \nlifestyle, academic record, membership of professional bodies, \npublications, current employment, career history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If I may propound a unanimous consent request, the \nSenator from California is going to speak for approximately another \nhalf hour or thereabouts. Following that, Senator Durbin and Senator \nMcCain wish to speak on matters unrelated to the matter now before the \nSenate.

It is up to the \nleadership.

I don't \nsuggest anyone doing so. It could happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, is it possible for me to yield for 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2054\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment \nof the Senator from California and to point out that I think the \ncommittee has done a very good job on the underlying bill. They address \nthe question of medical privacy in the bill where a big holding company \nmight have a subsidiary company, such as an insurance company, and an \nindividual, when they get a life insurance policy, will have to get a \ndoctor's examination, so that in the bosom of that health insurance \ncompany would be medical records. That health insurance company may be \nowned by a bank.\n  What the underlying bill does is protect against someone having their \npersonally identifiable medical information shared throughout that \nholding company and shared with those who would want to market that \npersonally identifiable medical information.\n  However, the underlying bill does not protect on the personally \nidentifiable financial information, so that one part of a holding \ncompany could have personally identifiable financial information such \nas how much you take out of your ATM, what kind of purchases you make \non your credit card, what time of day or what time of the week you go \nand make deposits in your ATM or take out from your ATM. Those things \nthat are personally identifiable ought to be private unless the \nindividual consumer says they are willing to have that information \nshared among the holding companies.\n  That is one of the things the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia addresses which, if we are going to take privacy seriously, \nwe need to address. That is why I support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Florida and I thank the \nChair for allowing this opportunity for the Senator to make a \nstatement. I think he is referring to an amendment that I will \nintroduce at a later time having to do with clearing up the health \ndefinition in the bill.\n  The health definition in the bill is archaic. The vast majority of \nstates have adopted more fully inclusive definitions, and we would like \nto have that definition in the bill.\n  Prior to the break for lunch, I was beginning to explain why the bill \nbefore us has a weak privacy standard on affiliate sharing. \nSpecifically, the underlying bill permits financial institutions to \nshare a customer's transaction and experience information with \naffiliates with few, if any, restrictions. As I stated, transaction and \nexperience information could include extremely sensitive information \nabout individuals such as their bank account balance and data mined \nfrom their check or credit accounts or where they buy goods.\n  If consumers cannot preserve the privacy of their bank balances or \nthe places they go to make purchases, they do not have meaningful \nprivacy protections. That is the weak privacy standard that will become \nthe national norm if this bill passes the way in which it is \nenvisioned.\n  Supporters of the existing weak standard argue that America's credit \nenvironment has thrived since 1996. So they say, why mess with a system \nthat is working? I challenge that assertion.\n  First, because transaction and experience information remains \nundefined. As I pointed out before lunch, we asked the CRS to look at \ncurrent law. We asked them how they would define ``transaction and \nexperience'' information. They said it has never been defined. So it is \nquestionable whether any privacy regime at all exists for the bulk of \naffiliate-sharing practices.\n\n[[Page S13864]]\n\n  Secondly, identity theft has emerged as a national epidemic in the \nlast 7 years. Both the chairman and the ranking member of this \ncommittee have done their utmost and been very receptive to trying to \nenact legislation to prevent identity theft.\n\n  The Federal Trade Commission recently published a study that \nsuggested 9.9 million Americans are victims of identity theft every \nyear. The cost is $50 billion annually. Studies have shown that much \nidentity theft occurs in the workplace. So increased affiliate sharing \nwill likely facilitate this crime. Potentially, thousands of employees \nin affiliated businesses will have increased access to the currency of \nidentity theft, and that is Social Security numbers and other sensitive \nidentifying information, such as date and place of birth and mother's \nmaiden name.\n  In her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Vermont \nAssistant Attorney General Julie Brill directly linked affiliate \nsharing to identity theft. Here is what she said:\n\n       Many identity fraud cases stem from the perpetrator's \n     purchase of consumers' personal information from commercial \n     data brokers. Financial institutions' information sharing \n     practices contribute to the risk of identity theft by greatly \n     expanding the opportunity for thieves to obtain access to \n     sensitive personal information.\n\n  So that is what we are doing here. Now, this is a prosecutor who \nshould know. This is what she deals with. So why broaden the scope and \nopportunity for identity theft to take place?\n  Assistant Attorney General Brill also cited work by researchers at \nMichigan State University who studied 1,000 cases of identity theft and \nfound that 50 percent of the victims traced the theft of information to \nan employee of a company compiling personal data on individuals.\n  Third, it is an open question whether affiliate sharing has offered \nany price or service advantage to customers. According to an article by \nJanet Gertz in the San Diego Law Journal, there is some evidence that \nbusinesses use affiliate sharing to extract concessions from consumers. \nLet me quote her:\n\n       By profiling consumers, financial institutions can predict \n     an individual's demand and price point sensitivity and thus \n     can alter the balance of power in their price and value \n     negotiations with that individual. Statistics indicate that \n     the power shift facilitated by predictive profiling has \n     proven highly profitable for the financial services industry. \n     However, there is little evidence that any of these profits \n     or cost savings are being passed on to consumers.\n\n  Just recently, for example, the Federal Reserve issued a report on \nfinancial service fees and services showing that fees at larger \ninstitutions are generally increasing and services are decreasing.\n  So we are letting exist this whole area where businesses buy other \nbusinesses just to share consumers' data? And the consumer has no \ncontrol over their personal data. That is wrong.\n  My colleagues may hear during the debate on this amendment that the \naffiliate sharing problem is addressed because S. 1753 allows consumers \nto opt out of certain marketing solicitations by affiliates.\n  I want to go into this because this has been widely circulated by the \nfinancial institutions. Senator Boxer and I were just questioned about \nit at a press conference we held. In truth, these restrictions that \nthey say are there are grossly inadequate, and they barely scratch the \nsurface of the problem.\n  Let me describe some of the uses of affiliate sharing that the bill \ndoes permit. First, internal credit reports: The bill permits companies \nto use transaction and experience information to create internal credit \nreports.\n  Martin Wong, general counsel of Citigroup's Global Consumer Group, \ntestified before the Senate Banking Committee in June that:\n\n       Citigroup is able to use the credit information and \n     transaction histories that we collect from affiliates to \n     create internal credit scores and models that help determine \n     a customer's eligibility for credit.\n\n  In other words, a bank can use transaction and experience from its \naffiliates to determine if it is going to charge a higher interest rate \nto certain credit card customers and give perks to others or to deny a \ncredit applicant a credit card.\n  In contrast to a traditional credit card report, a consumer has no \nright of access to transaction and experience information used by a \nbank to deny him or her credit. Nor would a consumer have any right to \ncorrect any errors made in compilation of these internal credit \nreports. So one can have their credit changed even without their \nknowledge. It can be wrong, and the person would not know about it. It \nall happens in this secret world of affiliate sharing.\n  Similarly, a health insurer could deny a customer a health insurance \nor life insurance policy based on transaction and experience \ninformation. For example, a life insurer might reject an insurance \napplicant because of evidence in his card or check transaction record \nthat he visits liquor stores frequently, buys products at stores \nselling mountain climbing equipment and therefore is at risk of injury, \nor has purchased a gun.\n  These are just indications. These are just areas. But you can see \nwhere this thing is going. Essentially, consumers can be denied \nproducts or services and they will have no ability to determine why the \ndenial occurred.\n  The bill would permit prospective or current employers, without an \nindividual's knowledge or consent, to mine information about the \nindividual from other affiliates with whom the individual does \nbusiness. This could be used for hiring decisions, disciplinary action, \njob evaluations, or other employment purposes. Again, all of this goes \non simply because you bank with a given bank. You think all these \nthings are protected and in fact they are data-mining checks, where you \ngo, who you are paying. This information is going out to a whole host \nof other companies, sometimes thousands of companies.\n  Some affiliates are offshore and American consumer protection laws do \nnot apply to those countries. As United States companies continue to \nacquire affiliates overseas, consumers may not even be able to depend \non existing consumer protection laws to protect information that is \nshared with an affiliate.\n  Earlier this month, and many of us read about it, a woman in \nPakistan, transcribing medical files for the University of California \nMedical Center in San Francisco, threatened to post patient medical \nrecords on the Internet unless she was paid more money. While we have \nstrict laws governing medical files in the United States, these laws \nare virtually unenforceable overseas.\n  The Senate bill does not prevent affiliated companies from \naccumulating and sharing uncomplimentary information about customers, \nsuch as if they have filed for bankruptcy, do not pay their credit on \ntime, or complain a lot. This information can be used to push \nunprofitable customers into a different tier of customer services. \nExample, where there are longer waits for a customer representative, or \neliminate the customer altogether. All of this happens because of the \nease with which this information can be shared among commonly held \ncompanies.\n  Let me give an example. Business Week magazine has reported that \nSanwa Bank gives A's to its best customers, but those whose profiles \nshow they will generate less revenues get C's from the bank. The bank \ntends to charge those earning C's more fees, and is more likely to put \nthem on hold when they call in for service. This type of profiling \ncertainly can occur in the context of affiliate sharing.\n  Even in the area of marketing, this bill is grossly inadequate. It \npurports to give consumers the right to opt out of the sharing of \ntransaction and experience information for marketing, but there are \nloopholes. The institutions are going around the Hill today, pointing \nout they already do protect this.\n  Let me talk for a minute about the loopholes. The bill excludes \ncompanies from the opt-out if they have a preexisting business \nrelationship with the consumer.\n  What is a preexisting business relationship? Your guess is as good as \nmine because the bill doesn't define it. Presumably, a bank could argue \nit has a preexisting relationship with a consumer if a consumer came \ninto the bank 5 years ago to cash a check, or even just made an inquiry \nabout an account. Additionally, if a consumer does exercise the opt-out \nfor marketing, which is in the bill, the opt-out expires after 5 years. \nAt that time, affiliates can then start marketing again to the \ncustomer.\n\n[[Page S13865]]\n\n  I find it disturbing that the supporters of the bill want to \npermanently preempt States from enacting stronger affiliate-sharing \nlaws for credit reporting purposes, but only think customers' \npreferences should be recognized for 5 years.\n  Last, but perhaps most fundamental, the Senate bill denies the \nconsumer the ability to define the parameters of his or her \nrelationship with a company, and this, I think, is really important. \nUnder the current bill, when a consumer purchases a product from a \nmegacorporation, the consumer automatically, without his or her choice \nor consent, makes his or her information available to hundreds of \ncompanies. Lawyers call this type of relationship, where one side has \nall the bargaining power, an adhesion contract. Some courts rule these \ntypes of contracts invalid because they do not reflect arm's-length \nnegotiation and could result in unconscionable terms for the consumer.\n\n  Our amendment is a substitute to the affiliate-sharing language in S. \n1753. Supporters of the underlying bill claim the Government needs a \nviable national standard to ensure the efficiency of our credit market. \nThis amendment provides such a standard. It gives consumers all across \nthe country--in Alabama, in Maryland, in Kentucky, in Colorado, in \nWashington--the opportunity to have some say, some choice in how their \npersonal data is shared. With the privacy of Americans more at risk \nbecause of the latest technological developments and identity theft, \nwith privacy invasions at its core becoming the fastest growing white-\ncollar crime in the United States, we believe strong national standards \nare critical.\n  Our amendment reflects the terms of the California privacy law, which \nthe California Bankers Association just a very short time ago called \nreasonable and workable, and are now lobbying against.\n  I read the letter of the author of the California bill, which I think \nirrefutably states the turnaround the financial institutions have done \nin this opt-out provision. Jim Bruner of the Securities Industry \nAssociation stated at the press conference announcing the agreement on \nCalifornia law on August 14, just a short time ago:\n\n       ``While we would have preferred a national standard,'' [the \n     California law] ``encompasses all aspects of the workability \n     needed to ensure protection of consumers' privacy.''\n\n  And then they turned around and did a 180.\n  Jamie Clark of the California Bankers Association said at the same \npress conference that the banks:\n       ``. . . have no objection to the measure passing'' and \n     would tell its supporters to vote for the bill.\n\n  Clark added:\n\n       ``We prefer a national standard so that you have a uniform \n     operating environment.''\n\n  But they didn't tell anyone in California, which has just passed a \nnew law which provides opt-out, that they could not live with the opt-\nout standard.\n  They did not come back here saying the law was sloppily drafted. They \nliked it then. When you do the law back here, all of a sudden it is \nsloppily drafted.\n  Diane Colborn of the Personal Insurance Federation called the \nCalifornia bill ``a balanced measure that will provide meaningful \nprivacy protections to consumers while also addressing the workability \nconcerns that our members and customers had.''\n  The California credit unions supported this legislation and still do. \nI thank them for their support.\n  This amendment offers businesses in California and around the country \nthe chance to get a moderate, reasonable, uniform national standard on \npersonal privacy.\n  Under the amendment, companies would be required to give consumers \nnotice of their intent to share transactions and experience and other \ninformation with their affiliates. Consumers would then have the \nopportunity to opt out--to say, I don't want you to do it, or to do \nnothing at which point the information could be shared. The company \nwould be notified and would give them, I hope, a choice of whether \ntheir most personal information is shared among affiliates.\n  This amendment would also allow closely related affiliates in the \nsame line of business to share information with each other. \nSpecifically, companies would not need to provide an opt-out choice if \none, the affiliate is regulated by the same functional regulator--an \nexample of that is institutions that regulate financial service \ninstitutions such as the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency would be considered the same functional \nregulator; two, the affiliate engages in the same line of business. An \nexample of that is the selling of securities, banking services, and \ninsurance would all be considered independent lines of business; three, \nthe affiliate shares a common brand identification; and four, the \naffiliate is a wholly owned subsidiary of the same company.\n  The amendment also has numerous other exceptions that were ironed out \nafter 4 years of negotiation in California to meet the practical needs \nof business. The exceptions include the following: No. 1, information \nmaintained in common databases. This is another false rumor that is \nbeing spread on this bill. This amendment allows employees of an \naffiliate to have access to information maintained in a common \ninformation system or database so long as the information is not \naccessed, disclosed, or used.\n  That is the key. It doesn't require new databases. It doesn't mess up \ntheir database. It just says you can't access it if the individual opts \nout.\n  This exception is necessary because we don't want to disadvantage \ncompanies that have streamlined operations by combining databases and \nother information technology resources. On the other hand, this \namendment still permits consumers to have a choice over whether \ninformation in the database can be used for secondary purposes.\n  This amendment, as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley and California law, has an \nexception for transactional uses of information.\n  Information sharing ``necessary to affect, administer or enforce a \ntransaction requested or authored by the consumer'' or ``with the \nconsent or at the direction of the consumer'' is excluded from the opt-\nout.\n  Our amendment has exceptions for affiliate sharing of personal \ninformation that is necessary for companies to effectively manage their \noperations. For example, for security purposes, institutional risk \ncontrol, and to respond to customer disputes or inquiries.\n  Proponents for unrestricted sharing of affiliate information argue \nthat it is needed to solve identity theft. They correctly point out \nthat companies can track unlawful purchases or suspicious activity by \nmonitoring unusual account activity, change of address requests, and \nother suspicious behavior.\n  This amendment explicitly allows for affiliates to share information \n``to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud, identify \ntheft,'' et cetera.\n  In addition, the amendment has exceptions relating to a business, a \nmerger, a sale, a transfer; to comply with Federal, State, or local \nlaws; for outsourcing functions with vendors such as data processing or \nbilling; and, to identify or locate missing and abducted children, \nwitnesses, criminals and fugitives, parties to lawsuits, parents \ndelinquent in child support payments, organ and bone marrow donors, \npension fund beneficiaries, and missing heirs, or to report known or \nsuspected instance of elder or dependent adult financial abuses; and an \nexception is also carved out for the United States of America PATRIOT \nAct.\n  I deeply believe that without this opt-out the National Consumer \nCredit Reporting System Improvement Act would create a permanent and \nunworkable Federal standard that would set back the privacy of personal \ninformation and allow sensitive personal data to be moved through \ndozens, hundreds, and, in some cases, thousands of other companies.\n  This amendment is quite simple. It is about consumer choice.\n  I am puzzled at the ferocity with which the financial institutions \nand the banks are lobbying against this amendment. They serve people. \nThat is what they are there to do--serve people. Shouldn't someone know \nif this information is being marketed within the loophole? Shouldn't \nsomeone have the opportunity to say, I don't want you to use my \ninformation? In fact, I think I am going to change banks, if they do \nthis. Find a bank that won't do it. That would be my advice to \neverybody.\n  I think consumers should be given the opportunity to tell a bank they \ndon't want their information shared with other companies. This is \nAmerica. We should have that freedom. We should have that right. If you \nvote for this amendment, Americans will.\n  Do I have a few more minutes? If I could quickly set aside this \namendment and send one other amendment to the desk, I will not speak to \nit.\n  I am happy to wait. I will yield the floor at this time and do it \nlater.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't mind waiting a few minutes if the \nSenator from California wishes to proceed.\n\n[[Page S13866]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. That is all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona has the floor. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                        U.S.-Russia Relationship\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a creeping coup against the forces of \ndemocracy and market capitalism in Russia is threatening the foundation \nof the U.S.-Russia relationship and raising the specter of a new era of \ncold peace between Washington and Moscow. The new authoritarianism in \nRussia is more than a test of America's ability to defend universal \nvalues that have taken shallow root since the Soviet empire collapsed. \nIt presents a fundamental challenge to American interests across \nEurasia. The United States cannot enjoy a normal relationship, much \nless a partnership, with a country that increasingly appears to have \nmore in common with its Soviet and czarist predecessors than with the \nmodern state Vladimir Putin claims to aspire to build.\n  On October 25, masked Russian security agents from the FSB, the \nsuccessor to the KGB, stormed Russian businessman Mikhail \nKhodorkovsky's private plane during a stop in Siberia. He now sits in \nprison awaiting trial, accused of tax evasion, fraud, forgery, and \nembezzlement. Russia's richest man, founder and chief executive of its \nmost successful private company, a leader in incorporating Western \nprinciples of accounting and transparency into business practice, and a \ngenerous donor to charity, Khodorkovsky had committed what in the \nKremlin's eyes is the worst crime of all: supporting the political \nopposition to President Putin. Such an alternative center of power \ncould threaten the Kremlin's supreme political control.\n  Upon assuming power in 2000, President Putin announced a now-famous \nultimatum to Russia's top business leaders, whose fortunes were made by \nacquiring control of Russian assets privatized at fire-sale prices in \nthe 1990s. President Putin said to them: stay out of political life and \nkeep your fortune, or risk it by engaging in political activity. Most \nof the oligarchs chose to remain quiet. Three did not. Business tycoons \nBoris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky were forced into exile as a \nresult of their support for opposition political parties and free \nmedia. Mikhail Khodorkovsky actually attempted to exercise basic \npolitical freedoms guaranteed, in theory, for all Russians. He has been \nthrown into jail as a result.\n  Admittedly, Messrs. Gusinsky, Berezovsky, and Khodorkovsky may not \nprovide to proponents of democracy and free markets in Russia the most \nlaudable personal histories upon which to wage a resolute defense of \nour democratic principles. But failure to defend them would acknowledge \nexactly what the Kremlin cynically alleges: that they are being \nprosecuted because of the way they made their money. What has caused \nthese three Russian tycoons to be singled out are their activities in \nsupport of opposition political parties and free media. In reality, a \nconcerted campaign to clean up Russian politics and society would reach \ninto every corner of the Kremlin and every boardroom in Russia, but \nthat is not happening. For better or for worse, there is a consensus in \nRussian society that the past should remain in the past as Russia moves \nforward. If Russian business and government leaders are in fact going \nto be prosecuted for their conduct a decade ago, then perhaps the \nformer KGB officer named Vladimir Putin who assisted Stasi leaders and \nEric Honnecker in oppressing the German people should answer for his \ncrimes.\n  Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest, like the politically motivated \nindictments of Berezovsky and Gusinsky, should be seen not as \nprosecution for financial dealings done a decade ago--which would \nimplicate thousands of Russian businessmen and political figures--but \nas part of a larger contest between the forces of statist control and a \nliberal-oligarchic elite. Who wins will go a long way toward \ndetermining whether Russia reverts to the traditions of its czarist-\nimperial past or charts a new course as part of an integrating, liberal \ninternational order. The consequences of this struggle, for both the \nRussian people and the world, will be profound.\n  For the Russian people, President Putin's rule has been characterized \nby the dismantling of Russia's independent media, a fierce crackdown on \nthe political opposition, and the prosecution of a bloody war against \nChechnya's civilian population. The ascent of former KGB officers \nthroughout Russia's ministries and in the Kremlin has enabled Putin to \nuse the long arm of the state to crush internal dissent, silence \nopposing political voices, and subdue free media. During the first \nChechen war, more Russians got their news from Vladimir Gusinsky's \nindependent NTV than from state media. Today, there is almost no free \nmedia in Russia. Intimidation, coercion, assassination of journalists, \nand armed raids by the security services have put most independent \nmedia outlets out of business. Beatings and assassinations of \njournalists recall not the new Russia but the dark legacy of the Soviet \npast. Those independent media outlets that remain feel forced to \npractice the kind of self-censorship that characterized the Soviet \nUnion. Today, most Russians who read newspapers or tune into television \nor radio hear only the voice of the Russian state--as they did under \ntotalitarian rule.\n  In a land where financial support for opposition political parties \ncomes largely from business, the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, like \nthe indictments of Berezovsky and Gusinsky, sends a chillingly clear \nmessage to Russia's business community that their assets are safe only \nif they steer clear of politics. Putin himself made this same threat to \nthe oligarchs in 2000; it is clear that his government is carrying it \nout, and that Khodorkovsky is the latest victim.\n  Political assassinations also demonstrate the risk of speaking out \nagainst state power. Earlier this year, State Duma deputy Sergei \nYushenkov, who had been investigating potential connections between the \n1999 Moscow apartment bombings and the start of the second Chechen war, \nwas killed outside his Moscow apartment. State Duma deputy Yuri \nShendoshokhtin, who had been looking into the role of the FSB in the \nMoscow bombings as well as a scandal surrounding the involvement of FSB \nofficers in illegal trade, was also killed in mysterious circumstances. \nBoth crimes remain unsolved. In today's Russia--as in Soviet Russia, as \nin czarist Russia--the state uses its power to suppress political \ndissent. The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky fits in a long tradition of \npolitical arrest and persecution stretching across the vast dictatorial \ntundra of Russian history.\n  Under President Putin, Russian citizens in Chechnya have suffered \ncrimes against humanity at the hands of Russian military forces. It was \nduring Mr. Putin's tenure as Prime Minister in 1999 that he launched \nthe Second Chechen War following the Moscow apartment bombings. There \nremain credible allegations that Russia's FSB had a hand in carrying \nout these attacks. Mr. Putin ascended to the presidency in 2000 by \npointing a finger at the Chechens for committing these crimes, \nlaunching a new military campaign in Chechnya, and riding a frenzy of \npublic anger into office. Since then, between 10 and 20,000 Chechen \ncivilians have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced by \nRussian security forces. At Putin's direction, the Kremlin recently \nstage-managed an ``election'' in Chechnya that put Moscow's hand-picked \ncandidate in power. The principal voters were Russian conscripts forced \nto serve in Chechnya. Moscow has made no effort to address the \npolitical grievances of a population increasingly radicalized by the \nbrutality of Russian rule. Yes, there are Chechen terrorists, but there \nare many Chechens who took up arms only after the atrocities committed \nby Russian forces serving first under Boris Yeltsin's and then Putin's \norders.\n\n  In short, Mr. President, I am worried that what we are seeing in Mr. \nPutin's government is a continuation of 400 years of autocratic state \ncontrol, and repression. Since the end of the Cold War, many Western \nobservers have optimistically argued that the way Russia is governed \nhas fundamentally changed. Sadly, this appears not to be true. Whether \nruled by the czars, Stalin, Brezhnev, or Putin, the Russian state has \nremained supreme within Russian society. It seeks fundamentally to \ncontrol society, not to answer to it. The people serve the government,\n\n[[Page S13867]]\n\nnot the reverse. This is not the behavior of a modern European nation; \nit is a form of unenlightened despotism cloaked in the mantle of \ninternational respectability, which Russia derives principally from its \nrelations with other great powers--particularly the United States.\n  The ascent of former KGB officers to positions of power throughout \nthe structures of the Russian state underscores this trend. Apparently \nKGB veterans Igor Sechin and General Viktor Ivanov, both deputy chiefs \nof presidential administration in the Kremlin, masterminded the assault \non Mr. Khodorkovsky. I would like to congratulate the KGB for arresting \none of the most pro-Western business figures in Russia today--someone \nwhose personal and corporate behavior, through charitable giving and \nadopting Western standards of business, have brought more credit to \nRussia in the last three years than anything the Russian government has \ndone. Meanwhile, the FSB has been unable to solve the murder of leading \nindependent journalists. It has failed to bring to justice any suspects \nin the murder of democratic politicians. It has not been able to \nidentify a single case of corruption inside the Russian government. Not \na single Russian has been held to account for committing crimes against \nhumanity in the Soviet Gulag. The FSB can't do any of that--but it can \narrest Mikhail Khodorkovsky. What brave men they must be to kick down \nthe doors of a private airplane and arrest an unarmed man.\n  The FSB's dominance in the Russian Government has renewed the specter \nof the imperial temptation that has guided Russia's external relations \nfor centuries. For too many of Russia's neighbors, it is like the old \nBeatles song: ``Back in the USSR.'' Under President Putin, Russia has \nrefused to comply with the terms of the Treaty on Conventional Forces \nin Europe. Russian troops occupy parts of Georgia and Moldova. Russia \nhas effectively annexed the Georgian province of Abkhazia, which it has \noccupied for a decade. Moscow has supported attempts to overthrow \nneighboring governments that appear too independent of Russia's \nembrace. Russian naval forces recently attempted to assert control in \nthe channel connecting the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea from Ukraine. \nRussian secret services are credibly accused of meddling in elections \nin Azerbaijan and Georgia. Russian agents are working to bring Ukraine \nfurther into Moscow's orbit. Russian support sustains Europe's last \ndictatorship in Belarus. And Moscow has attempted to cynically \nmanipulate Latvia's Russian minority and enforced its stranglehold on \nenergy supplies into Latvia in order to squeeze the democratic, pro-\nAmerican government in Riga.\n  Under President Putin, Russia has pursued a policy in its ``near \nabroad'' that would create an empire of influence and submission, if \nnot outright control. On October 9, Russian Defense Minister Sergei \nIvanov declared that Russia reserves the right to intervene militarily \nwithin the Commonwealth of Independent States in order to settle \ndisputes that cannot be resolved through negotiation. At the same press \nconference, President Putin declared that the pipelines in Central Asia \nand the Caucasus carrying oil and natural gas to the West were built by \nthe Soviet Union, and said it is Russia's prerogative to maintain them \nin order to protect its national interests, ``even those parts of the \nsystem that are beyond Russia's borders.'' In the runup to the war in \nAfghanistan, President Putin was given great credit for ``allowing'' \nthe United States to use the military facilities and airspace of \nsovereign countries in Central Asia. But Russia has no more right to \nspeak for these countries than we do. The Putin Doctrine, asserting a \nright to imperial intervention in Russia's ``near-abroad,'' coupled \nwith the ascendancy of the FSB, recalls a discredited Russian imperial \npast whose victims number in the millions. Russia's assertion of \npolitical control over its neighbors speaks not to a modern vision of \nRussian reform and renewal, but appears to reflect a czarist impulse to \ndominate neighboring populations. It is the international dimension of \nrising state control at home.\n  The dramatic deterioration of democracy in Russia calls into question \nthe fundamental premises of our Russia policy since 1991. American \nleaders must adapt U.S. policy to the realities of a Russian Government \nthat may be trending towards neo-imperialism abroad and authoritarian \ncontrol at home. It is time to face unpleasant facts about Russia. \nRussia is moving in the wrong direction--rapidly. While the United \nStates undertakes a necessary and comprehensive review of our policy, I \nbelieve Russia's privileged access to critical Euro-Atlantic \ninstitutions should be suspended. This access was obtained with the \nunderstanding that President Putin was committed to free markets, the \nrule of law, pluralist democracy, journalistic freedom, and the lawful \nconstraint of the intelligence and security services. These now appear \nto be false premises.\n  The Russian Government is not behaving in a manner that qualifies it \nto belong in the club of industrialized democracies. The United States \nis hosting the next G-8 Summit at King Island, Georgia, in June 2004. \nRussia has been invited to participate and has been working its way in, \nbut President Putin's conduct at home and abroad has worked Russia out. \nPutin's Russia should have no place at the next G-8 Summit.\n  Congress should not consider the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment for Russia. It would be incomprehensible to consider easing a \nlaw created in response to Soviet repression when the Russian \nGovernment is continuing a similar pattern of behavior. I will oppose \nany effort to repeal Jackson-Vanik as long as Russia is moving in the \nwrong direction.\n  To any American businesses contemplating investment in or trade with \nRussia, I would simply say that this is not a place where the rule of \nlaw and Western codes of conduct prevail. You invest at your peril. \nMany Members of Congress have heard from U.S. businessmen who have lost \nmoney in Russia due to the absence of the rule of law. The American \nbusiness community should consider itself warned: the Kremlin's recent \nbehavior is a clear signal that your investments are not safe. I call \non my own Government, including the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, to cease all guarantees of investment \nin Russia due to the unacceptable risk of state interference and \nexpropriation, as demonstrated by the Russian Government's actions. \nAmerican taxpayer dollars should not be used to subsidize U.S. \ninvestment in Russia as long as the rule of the FSB prevails over the \nrule of law.\n  Clearly, in personal meetings, the President of Russia attempts to \nreassure the President of the United States that he is a fellow \ndemocrat. An accumulation of evidence forces me to draw the opposite \nconclusion. I hope I am wrong, but I am increasingly concerned that in \nMr. Putin's soul is the continuity of 400 years of Russian oppression. \nUnder President Putin's leadership, Russia looks to the West for \nprosperity, technology, and modernity, but seems to be striving in \nevery way to keep the values of the West out of Russia. Far from having \na vision for Russia in which democracy and freedom and the rule of law \nthrive, I fear President Putin may have a vision for Russia in which \nthe capricious power of the police at home, and the menacing weight of \nsubversion and intimidation abroad, guide the state. Administration \npolicy must recognize the cold realities of Putin's Russia.\n  The responsibilities that follow from this are clear: it is time for \na hardheaded and dispassionate reconsideration of American policy in \nresponse to the resurgence of authoritarian forces in Moscow. It is \ntime to send a signal to President Putin's government that undemocratic \nbehavior will exclude Russia from the company of Western democracies. \nThe wholesale suppression of free media and political opposition cannot \nbe ignored. American policy must reflect the sobering conclusion that a \nRussian Government which does not share our most basic values cannot be \na friend or partner and risks defining itself, through its own \nbehavior, as an adversary.\n  Mr. President, I thank the forbearance of my colleagues. I yield back \nthe remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Illinois is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S13868]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the indulgence of \nChairman Shelby and Senator Sarbanes for this opportunity.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield to me for just 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we are having two major statements on \nunrelated issues. We have an amendment pending. We are trying to work \nthrough these amendments. We think there is an opportunity to dispatch \nthem in good order. So I certainly encourage people who want to speak \non the pending Feinstein amendment to come to the floor so they can be \nheard and we can complete that debate and then move to a vote on or in \nrelationship to that amendment and then follow on with the other \namendments and move this bill toward completion.\n  I know there is no one in the Chamber wishing to speak now, and we \ncertainly think the Senator from Illinois ought to be able to offer his \nstatement, so this is not directed at him. I want to certainly assure \nhim of that. But as we proceed, thereafter, if we could follow along, I \nthink it would be very helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Honoring and Protecting Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, America's burden in Iraq grew heavier over \nthe last 7 days. In that period of time, 27 American servicemen were \nkilled and 35 wounded. We were awakened to newspaper headlines on \nMonday morning of: ``U.S. Copter Hit, With 16 Dead.''\n  On Sunday, I received the sad news that the National Guard helicopter \nwhich was downed was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division and piloted \nby 1LT Brian Slavenas from Genoa, IL. It was shot down by a surface-to-\nair missile near Falluja in Iraq.\n  Press accounts report that the missile was likely a heat-seeking \nmissile because it hit the engine, but, thankfully, it did not explode. \nThe helicopter went out of control, and First Lieutenant Slavenas \nclearly did the best he could at crash-landing the crippled aircraft. \nQuite possibly he saved the lives of those who survived. Sadly, he did \nnot.\n  This morning, I called the Slavenas family expressing my sympathy for \nthe loss of their son. I have read the press accounts about his short \nbut eventful and full life and the love which his family and so many \nothers had for him.\n  This morning I heard interviews on National Public Radio of his \nfriends talking about a great young man--this 30-year-old helicopter \npilot. He had just graduated from college a few months ago. He enlisted \nin the Army right after high school and, having completed that stint, \nhe enlisted in the National Guard and went to officer training school \nand he became a helicopter pilot. He earned a degree in engineering \nfrom the University of Illinois. Although Brian stood 6 feet 5 inches \ntall, he was a gentle giant. He was an accomplished pianist. His \nbrother Marcus said, ``He was very generous, very patient with people. \nI just loved being with him. He was my favorite person in the whole \nworld.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that these articles of tribute to Brian \nSlavenas be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Chicago Sun-Times]\n\n                           (By Dave McKinney)\n\n       His brothers and his father served in the military, but \n     when 1st Lt. Brian Slavenas was called to active duty earlier \n     this year, his family tried to discourage him from shipping \n     out. He could have resigned his commission in the Illinois \n     Army National Guard and skipped the deployment that carried \n     his aviation unit to Iraq, Despite his family's concerns, the \n     30-year-old helicopter pilot who had graduated from college a \n     few months earlier decided it was his duty to go overseas \n     with his outfit. On Monday, relatives gathered at the family \n     home in the tiny farm town of Genoa to mourn his death spoke \n     with pride--and some regret--about his decision to continue a \n     family tradition of military service.\n       Brian Slavenas died Sunday when his CH-47 Chinook \n     helicopter was shot down by shoulder-fired missiles in a \n     attack that killed 16 U.S. soldiers. ``We know he didn't have \n     to be there. But he chose to go and to serve his country,'' \n     said his oldest brother, Eric Slavenas, 39 a U.S. Army \n     veteran who participated in the invasion of Grenada in 1983. \n     ``I miss him. I wish he were still here,'' Eric added. ``But \n     I'm not going to go against his decision. I back him 100 \n     percent.''\n       Brian wasn't eager to go to Iraq when he left in April, \n     other family members said. He had completed study at the \n     University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in December with \n     an engineering degree and was eager to get on with his \n     career. Still, he felt obligated to go overseas with his \n     unit. ``He wasn't keen on the idea but he said, `Once you're \n     in, you can't cop out,' '' said his dad, Ronald Slavenas, a \n     former Army paratrooper who later served for a time with \n     Brian in the same Illinois National Guard unit.\n\n\n                      Drawn by history, adventure\n\n       During his time overseas, Brian's letters, calls and e-\n     mails home were usually upbeat and often funny, his family \n     said. Brian liked the adventure of being overseas in such an \n     exotic location, Eric said, recalling that in one letter \n     Brian described how he sipped a glass of Tang as he flew over \n     the ancient ruins of Babylon. ``He enjoyed the sights he saw, \n     being in such a historic part of the world,'' Eric said. ``He \n     knew it was dangerous, but it was more of an adventure for \n     him.'' At times, Brian talked of possibly staying in the \n     military as a career, in part because he loved flying. ``I \n     think during the war, he got gung-ho about what he was \n     doing,'' said his brother, Marcus Slavenas, a 33-year-old \n     former U.S. Marine who served in Operation Desert Storm.\n       Brian had already served a stint in the Army, joining after \n     he graduated from DeKalb High School, where he played drums \n     and threw the discus. After finishing active duty, he joined \n     the National Guard, then went to officer school and became a \n     helicopter pilot. Along the way, he also obtained a private \n     pilot's license and earned his degree from the U. of I. \n     Although he stood a towering 6 foot 5 inches tall, Brian was \n     a ``gentle giant,'' according to his father. He was an \n     accomplished pianist and dedicated weight lifter who could \n     get along with just about anyone, his brother said. ``He was \n     very generous, very patient with people,'' Marcus said, \n     adding, ``I just loved being with him. He was my favorite \n     person in the whole world.''\n       Besides his two brothers and father, he is survived by his \n     mother, a stepmother, a stepbrother and stepsister.\n\n\n                          may have saved lives\n\n       Brian, a member of the Peoria-based 106th Aviation Unit, \n     was activated in February and had been serving in Iraq since \n     April, said Brig. Gen. Randal Thomas, adjutant general of the \n     Illinois National Guard. He had been certified to fly the CH-\n     47 Chinook helicopter since 2002 and was flying at 150 mph at \n     about 200 feet off the ground when it was shot down near \n     Fallujah, Iraq. Thomas told reporters in Springfield.\n       ``We're thankful that a number of individuals survived that \n     crash. It would be speculative to say the pilot did his job \n     and got that aircraft down and saved lives, but I'd sure like \n     to believe that,'' Thomas said.\n       The Slavenas brothers say they're upset the Army wasn't \n     taking more precautions to protect the slow-moving Chinook \n     helicopters from missile attacks like the one that killed \n     Brian. Since the attack, the military has banned Chinook \n     flights during the day because the choppers are too \n     vulnerable. ``I support our military. The only thing I \n     question is the tactics that were used in this situation,'' \n     Eric said. ``Someone should have had enough foresight to see \n     ahead that a lumbering aircraft that only flies 180 miles an \n     hour makes a good target.''\n       Saying he ``just didn't believe this was our war,'' Marcus \n     isn't sure the conflict was worth his younger brother's life. \n     ``Personally, I wish these people in Iraq well, but I don't \n     care about them like I do about my brother,'' he said. ``I \n     think maybe I would like to see American military used to \n     defend America and not police the entire world.''\n       And he regrets not trying harder to keep his brother from \n     going to Iraq.\n       ``We all very strongly encouraged him not to go,'' Marcus \n     said. ``In retrospect, I'm going to kick myself--I wish I \n     would have tried harder.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From American Morning (CNN), Nov. 4, 2003]\n\n            Interview With Family of Downed Helicopter Pilot\n\n       Soledad O'Brien, (CNN Anchor). There was more violence in \n     Iraq this morning. Another soldier was killed, the second in \n     as many days. The soldier was killed after an improvised \n     explosive device, or an IED, exploded in Baghdad. Another \n     U.S. soldier was wounded in that blast.\n       The attacks followed Sunday's downing of a U.S. helicopter \n     near Fallujah, the deadliest single attack on U.S. forces \n     since the invasion. According to eyewitnesses, the second of \n     two shoulder-launched missiles hit the CH-47 Chinook, as it \n     flew just a few hundred feet above the ground. The missile \n     struck the rear engine and started a chain reaction that \n     caused the helicopter to crash.\n       Most of the soldiers were heading out to begin a two-week \n     leave when the chopper was shot down. Sixteen soldiers were \n     killed, and among them was the pilot, First Lieutenant Brian \n     Slavenas, a member of the National Guard from Peoria, \n     Illinois.\n       A little earlier today, I spoke to his family about their \n     loss.\n       Mr. Slavenas, if I can begin with you. Brian actually could \n     have avoided deployment, but he chose not to. Tell me why.\n       Ronald Slavenas (Father of Chinook Pilot). Well, that's the \n     kind of person he is. He's a responsible person, and he took \n     on something and he brought it to completion. That's the \n     nature of Brian. He may not like the idea, but he followed it \n     through, and I've got to do it, and he did it.\n\n[[Page S13869]]\n\n       O'Brien. I read that he felt obliged to serve his country. \n     He was a helicopter pilot in the National Guard.\n       Marcus, why don't you tell me a little bit about your \n     brother, the person, not necessarily the military man?\n       Marcus Slavenas, (Brother of Chinook Pilot). Not just \n     because he was my brother, but he was really one of the best \n     people I've ever known. Very clean living, very dedicated to \n     what he did. If he decided to do something he did it. He \n     focused on it and did it until he was excellent at it. He was \n     very kind to people. He was a good person. It was not based \n     on some rules. It wasn't based on religion. It's just the way \n     he was. He cared about those around him and tried hard always \n     to do his best.\n       O'Brien. Tell me--I know that he recently finished school. \n     He'd gone to school for engineering. Give me a sense of what \n     his plans were and his dreams were further down the road.\n       Unidentified Male. Well, we felt that Brian was probably \n     going to get out of the military and pursue a career in \n     engineering. He had a very promising career ahead of him. He \n     did well in his field. I know there were a lot of companies \n     that wanted to interview him. So, we were hoping and we all \n     felt that he was going to continue on with the engineering.\n       O'Brien. Mr. Slavenas, when you first saw the reports--I \n     have to imagine you saw the reports before you heard the news \n     that it was Brian who was actually piloting this chopper. \n     What was your reaction to this? And I've got to ask you, \n     did you think after a certain amount of time that it was \n     indeed your son who was among the lost?\n       R. Slavenas. Well, it crossed my mind. I thought he was \n     further west of the area of where it happened, but he's been \n     flying around all over Iraq, I guess, to Kuwait and back and \n     forth. The Chinook is like a shuttle service for different \n     units. He was flying support for different outfits. The last \n     one for the 3rd Armored Calvary, and I thought he was further \n     west. So, that was my kind of hope that maybe that wasn't \n     Brian, but then later on we found the news that it was Brian, \n     actually.\n       O'Brien. You served in the military, sir, and your three \n     sons all served in the military as well. What are your \n     thoughts about the U.S. involvement in Iraq and the \n     occupation of Iraq right now?\n       R. Slavenas. Well, now that we're in, we have to stay the \n     course. We just can't pull out. If we pull out, we'll have \n     pandemonium. They have so many different factions in Iraq--\n     the Sunnis, the Shiites, the Kurds, and what have you. And if \n     we pull out now without stabilizing the situation, we'll \n     have, as I said before, pandemonium. It would be a \n     revolution. That's my feeling.\n       So, we have to keep a stabilizing cap over it and hopefully \n     getting more help from other nations and other sources.\n       O'Brien. Marcus, you served in the military as well, and I \n     know you have strong opinions on this.\n       M. Slavens. Yes.\n       O'Brien. What's your take on U.S. involvement in Iraq right \n     now?\n       M. Slavenas. I don't believe we need to be there. I wish \n     the Iraqis well, and I hope they can figure out their \n     problems, but I don't want this to happen at the expense of \n     our boys. I would like to see them come home. And as far as \n     the troops go, while they're still there, I'm fully behind \n     them. Fight as hard as you can. Destroy the enemy and keep \n     yourselves alive and come back home. But as far as the \n     government is concerned, please try to get out of that \n     business and bring them back home as soon as possible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 4, 2003]\n\n                    For Families, Sad News Hits Home\n\n                 (By Russell Working and Angela Rozas)\n\n       One soldier was going to visit his wife and three children, \n     the youngest of whom he had never met. Another was on his way \n     home to attend his mother's funeral. A third wanted to \n     surprise her family in California with a two-week visit.\n       On Monday, the Department of Defense began releasing the \n     names of the 16 soldiers killed when a transport helicopter \n     was shot down in Iraq, marking the single largest loss of \n     service members in that country since major combat ended in \n     the spring. Another 20 soldiers were injured. Many of the \n     dead had been heading home for vacation or emergency leave. \n     Around the country, families that had been anticipating happy \n     reunions instead were stunned by unexpected loss. As of \n     Monday evening, 377 U.S. service members had died since \n     military action began in Iraq. In that time, more than 1,836 \n     have been injured as a result of hostile action.\n       Among those killed Sunday in the crash was 1st Lt. Brian \n     Slavenas, 30, an Illinois Air National Guard pilot from Genoa \n     who was one of two pilots on the twin-rotor CH-46 Chinook \n     that was shot down Sunday. Four crewmembers, also National \n     Guardsmen, were from Iowa. They were injured, but survived \n     the crash, said Illinois National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. \n     Alicia Tate-Nadeau. One of the Iowans was the senior pilot of \n     the aircraft, but it was unclear whether he or Slavenas was \n     flying the Chinook when it crashed, she said. Some 120 \n     members of Slavenas' unit, the Peoria-based F Company of the \n     106th Aviation Battalion, are now deployed in Central Iraq. \n     Another 85 Guard soldiers are deployed from an aviation unit \n     housed in Davenport, Iowa.\n       Slavenas was a dedicated student who followed his father \n     and two older brothers into the military. He was so \n     unassuming it took him a week to tell his family he had \n     recently been promoted to first lieutenant, said his father, \n     Ronald Slavenas. His unit arrived in the Persian Gulf in mid-\n     April, and had been based in Balad, Iraq, since July 22, said \n     Chief Warrant Officer Ty Simmons, operations officer for the \n     company. On Monday, they were grieving Slavenas' death and \n     hoping for the recovery of the helicopter's crew, he said.\n       The crews spend their days flying over central Iraq, a \n     dusty desert region better known as the Sunni triangle, where \n     they move everything from Humvees and generators to drinking \n     water and soldiers on leave. During missions, they fly fast \n     and low, seeking to make themselves a more difficult target \n     as they navigate dust clouds, high-tension electric lines and \n     tan-colored towers that blend into the background of the \n     desert, Simmons said.\n       Brian Salvenas deployed with the unit to the Middle East in \n     March. Four months earlier, he had received a bachelor's \n     degree in industrial engineering from the University of \n     Illinois, said his mother, Rosemarie Dietz Slavenas, who \n     lives in Rockford. He studied piano in high school and \n     ``played beautiful, beautiful Chopin nocturnes,'' his mother \n     said.\n       On Sunday, Ronald Slavenas thought of his son as he \n     listened to reports of a helicopter crash in Iraq, and \n     watched through the front curtain as a uniformed man arrived \n     on the doorstep of his two-story brick home in Genoa. ``My \n     heart sank,'' he said. ``I opened the door and said `He's \n     dead, right?' ''\n       On Monday, an American flag hung in the rain from the \n     second floor of his house. ``Brian was just a real \n     perfectionist,'' said Slavenas' brother Eric, 39. ``He wasn't \n     a gung-ho, go-to-war kind of guy.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is another very important issue that \nis associated with this story. I have learned within the last 24 hours \nthat all of the Chinook helicopters in the 106th unit, of which Mr. \nSlavenas was a part, consist of seven helicopters from the Illinois \nNational Guard and seven from the Iowa National Guard. All of these \nhelicopters do not have the aircraft survivability equipment required \nto protect them from the very threat that brought down this helicopter \non Sunday.\n  This is a recurring and troublesome issue. We have heard time and \nagain about National Guard forces which are activated and then \nshortchanged when it comes to the best equipment. We expect the most \nupdated equipment to be given to the units that are in the fight. We \nunderstand that Active Duty troops must receive what they need. But \nconsider where we are in the war in Iraq. It is supposedly a complete \nand seamless integration of National Guard, Reserves, and Active Duty \nforces. We expect the National Guard, under these circumstances, to \nreceive the necessary upgrades in the war theater.\n  These Chinook helicopters are supposed to be equipped with one or \nmore protective systems, such as the ALQ-156 system, to detect surface-\nto-air missiles, along with an automatic flare dispenser as a \ncountermeasure. They are also supposed to be equipped with seat armor \nto protect the pilot and crew.\n  What I have learned within the last 24 hours, from reliable military \nsources familiar with the situation on the ground in Iraq, is many of \nthe Illinois and Iowa National Guard helicopters have flown for almost \n6 months in the theater without the necessary aircraft survivability \nsystems. Some of them have received systems, some partial systems, but \nonly within the last week or two, many of the systems have been \nscavenged from departing Guard units from other States that are leaving \nIraq. Many of the helicopters don't have seat armor. There are reports \nthat the radios don't function properly. Reliable military sources have \ntold me and my office about the level of protection for our helicopters \nin Iraq and what they tell me is unacceptable. They tell me of \nhelicopters ill equipped to deal with the threat of shoulder-fired \nmissiles; units scavenging equipment from helicopters leaving the \ntheater to secure the protective gear they need. They report on \nhelicopters flying without seat armor to protect the pilot and crew, \nand of helicopters flying without equipment designed to protect them \nfrom known infrared missile threats; Guard units scrambling to find the \nparts necessary to equip their craft with protective gear. Is this how \nwe equip our men and women who are called to active duty?\n  Today I am asking Secretary Rumsfeld to see to it the helicopters in \nthe theater are provided with the aircraft survivability equipment \nnecessary to meet the expected threat. If that equipment is not \navailable, I believe Secretary Rumsfeld should protect those\n\n[[Page S13870]]\n\nunits until they are properly equipped or reassess when and where they \nwill fly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter I am sending to Secretary \nRumsfeld be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are concerned about reports that the \n     CH-47 National Guard helicopters attached to the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the unit which included the helicopter \n     shot down by a surface-to-air missile in Iraq on Sunday, may \n     not have had necessary or fully complete aircraft \n     survivability equipment. As you know, 16 military personnel \n     died in that attack, including the pilot, First Lieutenant \n     Brian D. Slavenas, from Genoa, Illinois. The helicopter was \n     from the Iowa National Guard.\n       We understand that, while Guard units that are activated \n     may leave the United States without all the necessary \n     equipment, they are to be upgraded in theater. Sources tell \n     us that a number of the helicopters in the unit in question \n     were flying in Iraq for almost six months without necessary \n     equipment, and were only recently provided aircraft \n     survivability equipment, some of which was not complete. Some \n     may still be lacking this equipment.\n       First, we ask that you immediately ensure that the \n     helicopters in theater are provided with the aircraft \n     survivability equipment necessary to meet the expected \n     threat. If that equipment is not available, you should \n     protect those units until they are properly equipped, or re-\n     assess when and where they will fly.\n       We ask that you investigate, and respond as soon as \n     possible, whether the helicopter that was shot down on Sunday \n     had on board a fully-operational ALQ-156 system with an \n     automatic flare dispenser and whether it had seat armor; \n     whether all of the helicopters in this unit are fully \n     equipped at this time and the precautions being taken to \n     protect the crews and passengers of those not properly \n     equipped. The same questions need to be asked regarding all \n     activated Guard and Reserve helicopter and fixed-wing units.\n       We understand that the ALQ-156 is intended to protect \n     against the expected threat from some surface-to-air \n     missiles, but may not be as effective against other missiles. \n     Is the ALQ-156 adequate for the expected threat in Iraq? If \n     not, we would like to know when the helicopters will receive \n     the upgraded equipment and your assessment of the risk to \n     military personnel of flying without such upgraded equipment.\n       I appreciate your prompt response to this inquiry.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                 Richard J. Durbin\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am also calling on Secretary Rumsfeld to \ninvestigate and respond as quickly as possible on whether the \nhelicopter that was shot down on Sunday had on board a fully \noperational ALQ-156 system with an automatic flare dispenser and \nwhether it had seat armor. I also believe we need to know the status of \nthe other helicopters in this unit in reference to protective \nequipment, and what steps are being taken to protect the crews and \npassengers in those that are not properly equipped. I understand the \nALQ-156 system is intended to protect against the expected threat from \nsurface-to-air missiles, but may not be effective against other \nmissiles in the theater.\n  I am also asking the Secretary if that ALQ-156 is adequate for the \nexpected threat in Iraq. If not, I would like to know when the \nhelicopters will receive the upgraded equipment and his assessment of \nthe risk to military personnel of flying without such upgraded \nequipment.\n  I find the reports I am receiving from military sources about the \nlack of protective equipment on these helicopters to be alarming and \nunacceptable. We know what a dangerous environment Iraq is. The threats \nfrom surface-to-air missiles were well known even before this tragic \ncrash. The helicopter that was shot down was not on a mission directed \nagainst regime remnants or terrorists. It was transporting soldiers to \nthe airport in Baghdad so they could leave for R\n  We will not know for sure how it was shot down or how it was equipped \nuntil the investigation is completed. This tragedy highlights the fact \nthat protective equipment cannot only be reserved for missions in the \nfight. Every mission is in the fight in Iraq today.\n  The Senate passed the Iraq supplemental appropriations conference \nreport yesterday with more than $87 billion for equipment for our \ntroops in Iraq. If the funds are not adequate to protect our troops and \naircraft, the Congress must be advised immediately. If there is a \nshortage of equipment, we must act immediately to secure it.\n  The dangers of war are well documented. Every soldier, sailor, \nmarine, and airman should know this Government has done everything in \nits power to protect them, keep them safe, and give them everything \nthey need so they can complete their mission and come home safely.\n  We have given this administration every dollar for which they have \nasked. Now they must give our soldiers what they need to be safe and \nsuccessful--the protective gear and body armor they need--as they work \non the ground among dangerous situations. Armor is needed for the \nHumvees to protect them from rocket-propelled grenades, and they need \nstate-of-the-art equipment to protect our helicopters from shoulder-\nfired missiles.\n  I call upon the Secretary to address these shortages immediately and \nto investigate fully whether the helicopter that was shot down and all \nof the helicopters in Iraq are adequately protected. We owe this to our \nmen and women in uniform and to their families who pray for their safe \nreturn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, does the Senator from Colorado wish to \nspeak?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Before the Senator begins, I want to renew the call we \nmade a few minutes ago. I know the chairman agrees with me in doing \nthis. To those who want to speak on the pending amendment, we hope you \nwill come to the floor and do so. We hope others who have amendments \nthey want to offer will be prepared, once we dispose of the current \namendment, to present their amendments so we can move along.\n  There is a possibility I think we can finish this bill in good order. \nI know that is what everyone would like to accomplish. I know Chairman \nShelby is anxious to, on the one hand, move things along and, on the \nother hand, ensure people have an opportunity to address these matters. \nIn order for them to do that, we need them to come to the floor, so we \nare putting out that call.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished Senator from Maryland yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am happy to yield to the distinguished leader for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. My concern with this legislation is not as much the \nlegislation itself as it is that Thanksgiving is coming soon. We don't \nhave the luxury of waiting for days. This legislation could take days \nwith the order that is now in effect in the Senate. We have more than \n20 amendments. If we take several hours on each amendment, we are not \ngoing to finish this week. I ask that those people--Senator Feinstein \nwas here and she has indicated on her next two amendments she would \ntake a half hour on each.\n  I ask the floor staff, when they have an opportunity, we probably \nshould probably get two amendments locked in so we have at least time \nlimits on those two. I know Senator Boxer has some amendments. If we \ncould ask those Senators to come forward and agree to time limits on \nthem, that makes it much easier for the two managers to manage the \nbill. I am quite confident that if the two leaders see the work on this \nbill is not going very quickly, it will be an awfully late night \ntonight because I know there are many things the two leaders want to \nfinish on Thursday and Friday. I think there was some expectation and \nhope the bill would be completed by tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and the ranking member for giving me the opportunity to speak \non the bill. To accommodate them, if individuals come to the floor \nwilling to offer an amendment, signal me and I will clear the floor and \ngive them an opportunity to offer their amendment. I agree with their \ngoal of getting us out of here quickly and getting the work done. If \nsomeone has an amendment, I do not want to hold up the process.\n  I rise in support of S. 1753, commonly referred to as the National \nConsumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003. I was pleased \nto support the bill as a member of the Banking Committee, and I am sure \nit will receive\n\n[[Page S13871]]\n\nstrong support on the Senate floor as well.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Shelby and his staff for their hard \nwork. This is a balanced, sensible bill and clearly a product of their \nwillingness to listen to all interested parties. Chairman Shelby \ncompiled an extensive hearing record and provided a comprehensive \nfoundation for crafting this legislation.\n  He crafted a bill that provides a balanced approach to the concerns \nexpressed during the hearings and provides significant improvement, I \nbelieve, to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I thank him for working so \nclosely with committee members to ensure that our concerns were \naddressed in this bill.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of the ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, and his staff. As I mentioned, this bill received \nstrong bipartisan support in committee, and this is certainly due in \npart to the diligence of Senator Sarbanes. His effort and his support \nhave made this a stronger and better bill.\n  Reauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is vital to the \nfunctioning of our Nation's credit markets. I think that goes without \nsaying. Without the FCRA, credit would cost more or, in many cases, \nsimply would not be available to consumers.\n  S. 1753 ensures that the markets will continue functioning smoothly \nby permanently reauthorizing the Fair Credit Reporting Act. As a former \nState legislator and a strong champion of States rights, I do not take \nFederal preemption lightly. In fact, I have a very high threshold for \nFederal preemption. I believe, though, that FCRA meets the necessary \nstandard. The credit markets truly are national, and a patchwork \napproach to credit reporting will quickly disintegrate the necessary \ncomprehensive approach we need.\n  When it comes to credit reports, accuracy is in the best interests of \nboth industry and consumers. I believe this bill will help improve \naccuracy in credit reports. Consumers will have increased access to \ntheir credit information and increased tools to combat identity theft.\n  The framework provided in the bill provides sufficient flexibility \nfor the act to adapt with time and changes in technology. I am \nespecially pleased that S. 1753 includes a bill I have worked on with \nSenator Schumer referred to as the Consumer Credit Score Disclosure Act \nof 2003. This provision would allow consumers applying for a mortgage \nto receive a copy of their credit score. Credit scores are increasingly \nbeing used in deciding whether to extend credit. Yet consumers do not \nalways have access to this information.\n  What I found out about credit scores and heard in reports back from \nmy constituents about things that affect their credit was that few of \nthem realize that the number of times you apply for a credit card, for \nexample, could impact your credit. It does when you look at the credit \nscore.\n\n  I always figure as long as you paid your bills on time or your credit \ncards on time and the more credit cards you had and paid them on time, \nit just showed what a better job you were doing in managing your \nfinances and would actually enhance your ability to get loans. That is \nnot true. If you got carried away and decided to apply for every credit \ncard you received in the mail, you could actually adversely impact your \ncredit rating, particularly as it applies through the credit score.\n  This provision contained in S. 1753 would ensure that consumers would \nreceive the critical information when applying for a mortgage, which is \ngenerally the largest purchase a person will make during their \nlifetime.\n  In addition to their actual numerical score, the consumer will be \nentitled to receive information concerning the factors that helped \ndetermine their score, as well as ways in which they can improve their \nscore. This provision will empower consumers to shop around and help \nprevent them from becoming victims of predatory lending.\n  I believe expanding access to credit scores is an important victory \nfor consumers, and I am pleased it has been included in the bill we are \nconsidering today. I am hopeful this will be the first step toward \ngiving consumers even broader access to credit scores.\n  As chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, I would also like to make a \nfew comments on the impact, the importance of the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct as part of the home buying process. Because FCRA gives lenders \naccess to more accurate and more complete credit information, they are \nable to more accurately price risk. This is important because for most \npeople, a home is the largest purchase they will make. The ability to \naccurately price the risk as reflected in mortgage rates can make the \ndifference of thousands and thousands of dollars over the life of the \nmortgage.\n  The availability of credit information stemming from the FCRA has \nreduced the cost of home ownership for many and opened up previously \nunavailable opportunities to others. In fact, home ownership rates are \ncurrently at record highs. Permanent reauthorization of the Fair Credit \nReporting Act will help us continue on that path. This is especially \nimportant as we work to expand the minority home ownership rates as \nminorities are disproportionately impacted when credit becomes less \navailable.\n  The Fair Credit Reporting Act has been beneficial to consumers, and \nthe improvements contained in S. 1753 will extend those benefits. I am \npleased to add my voice to those in support of the bill, and I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in voting for the National Consumer \nCredit Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2054\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to express my great high regard \nand respect for my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, but I \nmust rise in opposition to the amendment she offered earlier this \nafternoon.\n  I think it is important for us to keep in mind that the Fair Credit \nReporting Act provided for a national preemption going back to 1996. It \nhas been an extraordinary success story for America's consumers, \nparticularly America's middle class and working families who previously \nsuffered the most from a lack of access to credit but now find \nthemselves having access to credit never before imagined and having it \ndone in an instant fashion.\n  The legislation before us is an enormously complex piece of \nlegislation. It takes the 1996 preemption and builds on it, and \nstrengthens consumer rights beyond anything we have ever known before. \nChairman Shelby and ranking member Sarbanes deserve great credit for \nwhat they have been able to do. They put together a bill that had a \nunanimous vote out of the Senate Banking Committee--no easy feat, we \nall know.\n  To now on the floor of the Senate introduce a very complicated and, \nsome would suggest, improperly drafted amendment only serves to slow \nthe process and, in fact, perhaps even to jeopardize passage of the \nreauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, something that must \nbe done before the first of the year, otherwise, the consequences would \nbe catastrophic not only to the business community and to our economy \nbut to American consumers who would be the biggest losers of all if we \nwere unable to pass legislation because of the additional burden put on \nit by the Feinstein amendment.\n\n  I wish to very briefly touch on some problems that this amendment \nposes. The amendment being offered is different from and far more \nunworkable than the affiliate sharing restriction in the California \nlegislation, and I will comment on why this is so.\n  First, the amendment being offered is much broader in scope than the \nCalifornia bill. Despite claims that they fixed the overly broad scope \nbecause of drafting errors, that simply is not the case. Unlike the \nCalifornia amendment SB-1, which applies specifically to financial \ninstitutions, this amendment applies to any institution that has \naffiliates, including retailers, manufacturers, nonprofits, labor \nunions, churches, universities--basically, every type of organization \nin the country that shares certain consumer report information.\n  Yet the most important exception by this amendment being offered is \nprovided only to financial institutions. Clearly, the drafters of the \namendment have spent a lot of time on the California bill, perhaps more \nso than on the FCRA, because there does not seem to be the full \nappreciation of the breadth of the very statute they are amending.\n\n[[Page S13872]]\n\n  The Feinstein amendment provides exceptions to certain institutions \nbased on their functional regulator, a concept we defined in Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley in the Banking Committee and which is specifically defined \nin this amendment. It is limited to financial institutions such as \nbanks, securities firms, and insurance companies.\n  This means while financial institutions can qualify for what \nproponents refer to as the ``silo'' exception, other covered businesses \ncannot. I assume this is probably a drafting oversight, but it simply \nreinforces my concern that this amendment has not been fully vetted by \nthe Banking Committee or by any other presence in the Congress. I doubt \nvery seriously that the sponsors are trying to give large financial \ninstitutions a competitive advantage, but that is one of the \nconsequences of the amendment that has been offered.\n  The FCRA has a sweeping scope by design. Congress believed and still \nbelieves that sensitive information bearing on credit, employment, or \ninsurance risk, no matter who is using it, should be protected. That is \nwhy the FCRA is by no means limited to financial institutions, and \nshould not be.\n  The amendment being offered backtracks on the final version of the \nCalifornia legislation with respect to the so-called common database \nexception that was an integral part of the deal.\n  The amendment contains the original, unnegotiated version of the \ncommon database exception, which was widely understood to be \nunadministratable. This provision, which was intended to assure \ncompanies with large information databases that they would not have to \nundergo major systems revisions, fails to accomplish that goal.\n  The final version of the database exception prohibited information \nfrom a common database to be further disclosed or used by an affiliate. \nThe amendment before us this afternoon prohibits not only disclosure or \nuse but even access itself.\n  What is the point of a common database if it cannot be accessed? I \nunderstand that the California bill has come under fire recently for \nincluding what some view as a giant loophole of the common database \nexception, and I share Senator Feinstein's concern about the loophole \nbut it is not right to make a major change to a central provision and \ncontinue to claim that this amendment mirrors SB-1, the California \nlegislation.\n  Even if all the California exceptions were added, the amendment would \nstill be far less workable than the affiliate sharing provision in the \nunanimously adopted Senate Banking Committee bill.\n  With all the California exceptions, the only sharing not permitted \nwould be affiliate sharing used for solicitation and marketing \npurposes.\n  It is simply not true, as some have suggested, that the California \nopt-out applies to information shared for a broad range of purposes \nother than marketing and solicitation. But if sharing for solicitation \nis all that is subject to the California opt-out, then why not use the \nfar more straightforward approach of the bipartisan Banking Committee \nbill? That is, why not target the opt-out only to solicitations of \nnoncustomers made possible by affiliate sharing?\n  As the Banking Committee has recognized, and as the Senator from \nCalifornia has pointed out many times during today's debate, the real \nconsumer concern is getting bombarded by advertisements from unfamiliar \ncompanies. We all sympathize with that. The bipartisan committee bill \naddresses this concern head on with its targeted, focused provision on \naffiliate sharing, while the pending amendment, even if it added all of \nCalifornia's numerous exceptions, which it does not, is far more \ncumbersome and overreaching on its face. In fact, the committee bill \ngives consumers far more control. S. 1753 allows consumers to opt out \nof all marketing from any affiliate. The pending amendment does not do \nthat.\n  For example, the California silo exception strips away consumer \ncontrol over information shared by affiliates in the same line of \nbusiness. By contrast, we believe consumers should not have to be \nbombarded by marketing materials just because they have chosen to do \nbusiness with a large financial institution.\n  Sharing of information among affiliate entities has a significant \nimpact on the cost and availability of credit in ways that are not \nalways apparent to consumers. This is a critical point that I believe \nhas been lost in the course of this debate.\n  Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testified back in 1997, for \nexample, that consumers could expect ultimate savings of as much as $15 \nbillion per year from the increased efficiencies that affiliation \nprovides.\n  Treasury Secretary John Snow recently testified that affiliate \ninformation sharing serves a critical purpose in the war on identity \ntheft.\n  FDIC Chairman Don Powell has noted that access to credit and the cost \nof credit is far more favorable in the United States than in other \nparts of the world due, in large part, to the relative ease of \ninformation sharing between potential credit customers and potential \nlenders.\n  Finally, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has noted that \ninformation sharing has had ``a dramatic impact on consumers and \nhouseholds and their access to credit in this country at reasonable \nrates.''\n\n  The Senate bill ably balances the legitimate concerns of consumers \nagainst the substantial benefits that information sharing brings to \nthis economy and to all consumers. As Chairman Shelby and ranking \nmember Sarbanes have noted, this is an enormously complicated area of \nlaw, and the committee took great care to guard against unintended \nconsequences, spent literally months on the drafting and formulation of \nthis legislation.\n  Make no mistake, it is hard to imagine that what we are doing here \ntoday is the last word on privacy. Our constituents will continue, \nrightfully so, to demand that we review our current laws as information \ntechnology develops. I believe we intend in a bipartisan fashion to do \njust that.\n  At this point in time, giving consumers the right to opt out of \nmarketing, with no exceptions, is the right rule for American \nconsumers, while at the same time providing immediate and affordable \naccess to credit to all of our consumers, regardless of their economic \nbackground, regardless of racial or other factors is something that I \nthink this Senate can take great pride in and we can take great \nsatisfaction in the quality of this bipartisan legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to mirror the \nbipartisan vote of the Senate Banking Committee and to support the FCRA \nreauthorization and oppose the Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I have listened carefully to the comments of Senator \nFeinstein earlier, and I will make a couple of important points in \nresponse to her amendment.\n  First, as a privacy advocate, I fully appreciate the interest and \nconcern at hand. Indeed, both Senator Sarbanes and I have been very \nsensitive and worked together a lot on privacy concerns. As we took up \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, this was one of the key considerations \nwe sought to balance, even as the law itself requires. We did this in \nwhat was a very comprehensive, transparent, and lengthy review of the \nlaw and issues at hand as we considered reauthorizing our national \ncredit standard.\n  Second, the amendment of the Senator from California makes two basic \nassumptions which ultimately guide her amendment's approach and goal, \nas I understand it. No. 1, that there is something inherently nefarious \nabout the use of affiliate structures; No. 2, that consumers have no \nrights or means to protect themselves with respect to the handling of \ntheir transaction and experience information.\n\n  I believe that our consideration in the Banking Committee would \ntherefore be instructive in understanding the better approach adopted \nin our bill and why I intend to oppose the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California. To the first point: Why do affiliates exist? Companies \nestablish affiliates for a variety of legal, tax, and accounting \nreasons--because laws require them to do it.\n  What do these structures mean for consumers? Some companies choose to \ncreate separate legal entities known as\n\n[[Page S13873]]\n\nseparately capitalized affiliates. Other companies elect to locate all \nof their business lines in a single entity. Regardless of the structure \nthat a firm employs, consumer information is generally used in the same \nfashion. Affiliates or the separate business line share it to service \ntheir customers, fight fraud, or develop new business. The affiliate \nsharing provisions contained in the Fair Credit Reporting Act exist to \nmake it clear that companies should not suffer because they have chosen \na particular corporate structure.\n  From the consumer's perspective, I believe there is no real \ndifference between a company making an internal transfer of information \namong departments and sharing between affiliates. In fact, in many \ncases where affiliate sharing is occurring, most consumers would not \nrecognize that the two parties are involved in the transfer. Rather, \nthey would be under the impression that information is merely being \nmoved within the single entity with whom they have chosen to do \nbusiness.\n  Second, there are real rules and provisions governing the manner in \nwhich transaction and experience information is handled. First, we need \nto consider what exactly transaction and experience information is. \nTransaction and experience information involves checking and saving \naccount balances, credit card balances and repayment history, mortgage \nbalances and repayment history, and mortgage and brokerage account \nbalances and transaction activity. In many instances, the information \nis the very information provided to the consumer reporting agencies \nwhere, as consumer report information, consumers are afforded \nsignificant rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n  More important, however, this is information that is routinely \nprovided to consumers as required by separate laws and regulations. For \nexample, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the \nTruth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, provisions of \nthe securities laws and the Uniform Commercial Code all provide \nconsumers substantive rights with respect to transaction and experience \ninformation. These include disclosures and access rights and error \nresolution procedures.\n  I believe the bottom line is that consumers already have access to \nand rights concerning transaction experience information right now \nunder the law. But at the end of the day, I believe the main concern I \nheard with affiliate sharing uses was the use for marketing purposes. \nAt the end of the day, I believe that is all that is really left \nrestricted, in some way, under California's approach after accounting \nfor the exceptions and exemptions.\n  So after spending more than a year considering the law carefully in \norder to balance the needs of our national credit system, which we all \nbelieve is crucial to the operation and strength of our economy, with a \nneed to protect consumers rights, the Banking Committee identified two \nkey areas for increased Federal protection: The sharing of medical \ninformation and restricting affiliate sharing used for marketing \npurposes.\n\n  This bill does so in the context of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in \na straightforward and narrowly tailored way and does not give \npreferential treatment to certain business models over others.\n  This brings us to a third and very important point. The Fair Credit \nReporting Act deals with more than just financial institutions. The \nsponsors, as you know as a member of the Banking Committee, Mr. \nPresident, seek to impose a model that was tailored strictly for \nfinancial institutions to all furnishers of credit information, subject \nto the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This model is largely based on SB-1, \nthe California Financial Services Law.\n  The amendment's sponsors have tried to graft a banking bill on to the \nFair Credit Reporting Act. This effort, I believe, is misplaced, and \nthis effort does not mesh with how the FCRA, the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct, works and to whom it applies. Gramm-Leach-Bliley made it \npermissible for California and all other States to pass legislation \nthat regulates third party sharing activity. This bill would not affect \nthose provisions in the California law that come because of Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley. With respect to the part of SB-1 that conflicts with the \nFair Credit Reporting Act, the California law was preempted, making it \nunenforceable when it was enacted. This bill does not change or alter \nthat fact in any way.\n  The irony is that, even if we were to assume these provisions were \nviolated, California's attempt to overturn Federal law is actually \nweaker than the Senate bill. The California law, as I have heard here, \nas it is targeted at financial institutions, covers a much more limited \nrange than the broader Fair Credit Reporting Act, which deals with \ninformation, not entities, and therefore includes retailers, auto \ndealers, mortgage providers--anyone who furnishes credit.\n  Furthermore, California's rule is eaten by its exceptions and its \nexemptions. Its provisions provide consumers with no real choices or \nmeaningful protection. The Senate bill covers the areas that consumers \ncare about--marketing and the sharing of medical information--by \nproviding real protection. Unlike the Senate bill, the California law \nstill exempts most of the largest financial service firms they claim \nthe law is intended to address.\n  The Senate bill was carefully tailored to address key concerns in a \nmore clear and a concise way. The Senate bill before us targets \nunwanted solicitations without otherwise preventing sharing activities \nthat provide benefits to consumers. Unlike the California bill, the \nSenate bill is designed to protect consumer interests. The \nunenforceable portions of the California law were designed to promote a \nspecific business model by hobbling others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Feinstein-Boxer \namendment, and I note that there are a number of others on that \namendment as well. I hope colleagues will realize this amendment will \nmake this bill better, will make this bill stronger, and I am going to \ntake a few minutes to explain why in as simple a way as I can.\n  I stand here very proud that my State treasures privacy and they \nacted on that value. After years of struggle, California put into law \nthe most tough financial privacy standard in the Nation.\n  Others can say oh, that is not true, and they can quibble, but the \nfacts are the facts. Every consumer group that you ask, any group that \nis objective on the subject, will tell you that our law is the best and \nis far better--certainly than the House bill, and better than the bill \nthat is before us today.\n  I do want to compliment my friend. You have made some good advances \nhere. I will talk about that in my statement. But we can do better, and \nI offer this amendment with Senator Feinstein in a very friendly way, \nin the hopes that maybe we can make this better.\n  The struggle to pass SB-1, California's financial privacy law, was \nvery long and very transparent. I want to say that State Senator Jackie \nSpeier did an unbelievable job. For 4 years, she worked with banks on \nbehalf of the consumers. The industry invested more than $20 million in \nlobbying expenses and campaign contributions during those 4 years but \neventually a wonderful thing happened. The banks came to the table and \nthey negotiated with Senator Speier. The fact is, there was a reason. \nThey saw the handwriting on the wall. They saw that there was going to \nbe a State initiative. They had already gathered 550,000 signatures \nquickly and Senator Speier's provision for more strict privacy was \nsupported in the polls. How about this? California Democrats in the \npolls supported this initiative by 96 percent; and California \nRepublicans, 88 percent; Independents, 90 percent.\n  So Senator Speier had touched on a very important value of \nCalifornians. I really do believe if you took a poll today, just a \nreally carefully worded one which went into every State in the Union, \nthere would be support for this Feinstein-Boxer amendment to make this \nbill stronger.\n  I will explain it.\n  The committee went ahead and did some good things. It includes fraud \nalerts for consumers and protection for credit card numbers on receipts \nand free credit reports.\n  It is very important they say that you can't go outside and share the \ninformation with outside companies. That is great. I salute Senators \nShelby and Sarbanes for that progress.\n\n[[Page S13874]]\n\n  However, there is one major problem Senator Feinstein and I are \naddressing in this amendment. We are saying, first of all, if a State \nwants to go further than you have, we ought to have that chance. Your \nbill ought to be a ceiling. All good wisdom doesn't reside here. We \nalways like to think it does, but it doesn't.\n  A lot of our States are ahead of us, and they want to do more. Yet \nCalifornia finds itself left out because there is no preemption for our \nState. We know we are not going to get that. We have 35 million people \nin our State. We can't get an exemption. We understand that. We are \nsimply asking you follow the lead of our State on this one because I \nthink it is the fair thing to do.\n  Some people listening today might say, Well, the committee bill says \nyou can't go outside and share information. But you can share it with \nyour own affiliates that are in your little corporate family. What is \nwrong with that? That is a logical question until you look at the \nbanking industry and look at how big these families can get.\n  Let us take a look at some of these families for which this bill \nwould allow affiliate sharing.\n  Let us take a look at Citigroup. They are small? They have 1,630 \naffiliates.\n  Bank of America. How well I remember the proud history of that bank \nin my State. They have 1,323 affiliates.\n  JP Morgan, 967 affiliates; Wachovia Corporation, 886 affiliates; \nWells Fargo, 671; Bank One, 253.\n  When you say to all of these people you cannot share information \noutside your family, you are in essence saying you can share it within \nyour families. We are talking about thousands of affiliates that will \nget every bit of information about you and your financial transactions. \nMy colleagues can stand up here from night until morning and argue with \nme on the point that we are wrong on this. I know we are right. This is \nthe right thing to do to protect our constituents.\n  Let me show you Bank of America affiliates. I want to show it in a \nway that is pretty graphic. I will not read every one of their \naffiliates. I am going to truncate and do this quickly.\n  We have nine charts listing all of these. These are Bank of America \nbanks: Commonwealth National Bank, First National Bank, National Bank \nof Howard County, and American State Bank. I can't even pronounce some \nof these. Bank of America Mexico; Finacero Bank of America. They will \nknow your transactions. That is just the first Bank of America chart. \nLet us look at one other. We do have nine of these. I will go quickly.\n  Here is another one. Let us go to Bank of America insurance companies \nand look at who they own: First National Insurance Services, American \nFidelity and Liberty, Bank of America Insurance Services, Inc., and \nHome Focus Services. I don't know what they do, but they will know what \nyou do. General Fidelity Life. How about Boatman's Insurance \nAgency? You do business with any one of these and more than a thousand \naffiliates will know how much you earn, what your Social Security \nnumber is, how did you pay, if you missed a payment, what your likes \nand dislikes are.\n\n  Let us show a couple of others.\n  Bank of America and other affiliated companies: Oakland Trace \nRedevelopment, Holly Springs Meadows, LLC, East Nashville Housing. You \ngo into a bank in California and East Nashville will know what you are \nworth.\n  Dallas-Ft. Worth Affordable Housing, Old Heritage New Homes, Texas \nCorporate Tax Credit Fund, and it goes on. Michigan, Osbourne Landing \nLimited, it goes on and on. West Wood Manor Development, Elk Ridge \nApartments.\n  The point I am making--and I will show one last chart. We have 9 of \nthese charts listing Bank of America's 1,600 affiliates, for anyone who \nreally cares enough to examine each and every one of these affiliates.\n  Our point is we could go on and on and make our point with each and \nevery chart, but I am going to spare my colleagues. They have worked \nlong and hard already today. Here is the point: Do not share. That is a \nsimple message. This Senate supported ``do not call.'' We said people \ndeserve their privacy. If you don't want to get a call at night, you \nshouldn't have to get a call at night.\n  We are saying if you decide--and our amendment simply says you have \nto opt out automatically under this Feinstein-Boxer amendment--your \ninformation would be shared, you have to take an affirmative step and \nopt out. If you are a person who believes in your right to privacy, and \nyou don't want some company over in The Netherlands to know what you \nare about, because there is one here--Bank of America Netherlands. How \nabout Odessa Park? These are worldwide affiliates. We are very proud of \nBank of America. Good for them. They have all of these affiliates. But \nnot good for them if they start to share information.\n  Under the underlying bill, they can share all sorts of information \nwith every one of these affiliates. Guess what. You get turned down for \na loan, let us say, because of information that was shared among the \naffiliates. You have absolutely no right to know who told who what, \nwhere, and when. What if it was wrong? There is no redress. There is no \nway to correct the record.\n  All I can say is I have heard the debate, and I have heard our \namendment taken out of context: Oh, gee, that amendment will make it \nworse for people. Wrong. I will tell you who is supporting our \namendment--people who have fought their whole lives for consumers and \nfor the rights of people to have privacy. That is who is supporting us.\n  The AARP, which represents many seniors, supports our amendment; the \nACLU fights for civil liberties and privacy; Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumers Union, the National Association of Consumer \nAdvocates, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, Privacy Rights \nClearinghouse, Privacy Times, U.S. PIRG. These are people who \nabsolutely know our amendment is a step in the right direction.\n  I have a couple of other points to make. I will make them as quickly \nas I can.\n  I want to share with you some of the quotes that were made by the big \nbanks when California passed its law. Did they complain about it? Not \nat all. This is what they said.\n  This is Diane Colborn who lobbies for Personal Insurance Federation. \nShe called this workable, reasonable compromise a ``balanced measure \nthat will provide meaningful protections to consumers while also \naddressing the workability concerns that our members and customers \nhad.''\n  Jim Bruner, who lobbies for the Securities Industry Association, \nappeared before our committees in California. He said the measure is a \n``good, workable, reasonable bill.''\n  The ink didn't dry on that bill before they came up here and started \nwining and dining and talking to people--I guess you can't wine and \ndine anymore, and that is a good thing--about why this bill couldn't go \ntoo far. Don't go too far; it is a burden. I am so sorry about that. I \nwas so excited when California passed the privacy protections.\n\n  In closing my remarks, I will read some newspaper editorials.\n  From the New York Times: ``Buyer Beware,'' just written a few days \nago.\n\n       This (affiliate sharing) is a dark and unmapped universe in \n     which banks, credit card companies and insurers have free \n     rein to share detailed records among thousands of affiliates, \n     with customers largely powerless and unknowing. Bank \n     balances, buying habits, investment profiles and more can be \n     tapped into in ways that invite fraud, marketing assaults, \n     identity theft and unfair credit decisions.\n       The Senate measure contains no real solution for \n     indiscriminate data sharing. Far preferable is an amendment \n     to be offered by Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer \n     of California that would require advance notice from \n     businesses so consumers would have a chance to block planned \n     sharings that reached beyond relevant credit issues. \n     Rejection of this amendment would only compound businesses' \n     temptation to be marketers rather than the protectors of the \n     privacy of the American consumer.\n\n  We know in the underlying bill you cannot share for marketing \npurposes, but there is a giant loophole dealing with preexisting \nrelationships, making it confusing and complicated. That is why I \nbelieve the Feinstein-Boxer amendment will cure these problems.\n  From the San Jose Mercury News:\n\n       The financial services industry is guilty of a nasty bait-\n     and-switch on the people of California. Its lobbyists worked \n     with privacy advocates to help shape the law into what the \n     industry called a reasonable and workable compromise. All the \n     industry said it hoped for was a uniform privacy standard \n     across the nation.\n\n[[Page S13875]]\n\n       Yet immediately after the California law was approved, \n     industry lobbyists went to Washington to try to erase it from \n     the boxes. The only national standard they are interested in \n     is one that gives them the unfettered right to sell their \n     customers' personal financial details to the highest bidder. \n     That was the San Jose Mercury News, in the heart of Silicon \n     Valley. This is a newspaper that very often is on the cutting \n     edge of the way we ought to be thinking about financial \n     issues.\n\n  I close with an editorial from The Los Angeles Times, October 29, \nentitled ``Put Privacy on the List.''\n\n       Congress promised voters that it would improve consumer \n     rights with regular reviews of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, \n     initially passed 33 years ago to balance the competing \n     interests of business and consumers. Bills in the House and \n     Senate would make it easier for consumers to see credit \n     reports and report identity theft. But the legislation \n     wouldn't help consumers keep private their bank balances, \n     spending patterns and other sensitive data. Congress could \n     cover this gaping problem by adopting the amendment crafted \n     by Feinstein and Boxer, which keeps alive the protections at \n     the heart of SB 1.\n\n  Colleagues, I know sometimes we get bills where deals have been cut, \ndeals have been made, and everyone has put their hand out like after a \nsports game, saying: OK, on blood oath, we will not take amendments. I \nhave been here long enough to know that.\n  I hope some colleagues will be open to this. We have done the right \nthing. Strong percentages of the American people--if it mirrors \nCalifornia, it would be 80 percent and above--support making sure that \nyour personal-private financial data cannot be shared within a family \nof a company which could include thousands--1,600, 2,000, who knows--as \nmore and more mergers go on. We do not want that information to be \nshared.\n  That is exactly the right course to take. I am hopeful we will get a \nstrong vote on the Feinstein-Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nFeinstein-Boxer amendment to S. 1753 on the sharing of information \namong affiliates. This amendment would give consumers the choice to opt \nout of having their personal ``transaction and experience'' information \nshared among affiliates. The privacy provision in the California law \nrepresented by this amendment was the result of long negotiations among \nconsumer groups and banks, and in the end the banks in California \ncalled this provision ``reasonable and workable.'' Reasonable and \nworkable. I am a cosponsor of this amendment because, in a reasonable \nand workable way, it simply gives consumers some control over their \npersonal information.\n  Let me emphasize just a few key points about this amendment. The \namendment is still about an opt out, not a blanket restriction. It just \ngives consumers the option of keeping their personal information \npersonal. Now the underlying bill also has an opt out, but that opt out \nis minimal: it is just for marketing, just for new customers, and would \nexpire 5 years after the consumer requested it. The Feinstein-Boxer opt \nout, by comparison, is for the exchange of transaction and experience \ninformation; it is for uses other than marketing; it is for current and \nnew customers; and it has no expiration. It, therefore, provides more \nprotection for consumers who are concerned about protecting their \nprivacy.\n  Another thing to remember about this amendment: the amendment does \nnot alter preemption. With this provision States would still be \ndeprived, permanently, of the opportunity of enacting their own \nlegislation relating to affiliate sharing. If we are going to have a \nnational law, we need a reasonable national standard.\n  Mr. President, a lot has been said about this amendment and how it \nwould create all kinds of problems, so let me be clear about what this \namendment would not do.\n  The amendment would not prevent the extension of affordable credit. \nAffiliates could still request credit reports and scores, as always.\n  The amendment would not prevent affiliates working under the same \nname in the same line of business from working together: it contains an \nexception for sharing among such close affiliates. It would not impede \nthe investigation for fraud or identity theft. It would not impede \ntransactions or the servicing of a product requested by the consumer. \nIt would not impede institutional risk control. It would not impede the \nresolution of customer disputes or debt collection. It would not impede \nefforts to locate missing and abducted children.\n  Mr. President, I say again: If we are going to have a national law, \nwe need a reasonable national standard. This amendment is just such a \nstandard. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will be quick because I know the chairman intends to \nmove ahead with respect to this amendment. I will make some very basic \npoints.\n  Some of this discussion has been along the lines that under existing \nlaw this information is shielded and we are taking something away from \npeople. The fact is, under existing law there are no limitations on the \nsharing of information with affiliates. That is the existing law.\n  What the committee has sought to do is place the limitation on the \nsharing of information with affiliates for solicitation for marketing \npurposes, which is the biggest complaint we have heard flowing out of \nthe sharing of information. That is what people have complained to us \nabout. We are trying to provide that protection for the consumer.\n  The California law and the amendment take a different approach. They, \nin effect, say you cannot share information with an affiliate or the \nconsumer has to be given the opportunity to opt out. But the California \nlaw has some exceptions or exemptions from that requirement. The \namendment that is pending has 17 such exemptions.\n  To evaluate this--it is very complex; I agree with my colleague from \nCalifornia when she says this is a complex area; it is very complex--\nbut to evaluate these exemptions, you have to work through all of the \nexceptions and see where that leads as opposed to what is in the \ncommittee bill.\n  Let me give an example. One exception is if a company is in the same \nline of business, a common brand, then the provisions of the amendment \ndo not apply with respect to restricting and sharing of information. \nWhat the committee has reported out would, in fact, apply a limitation, \nan opt-out limitation in that instance for soliciting for marketing \npurposes.\n  As I said earlier, that is generally what we have heard as being the \nsource of people's concern and discontent. In that sense, what is in \nthe bill is for that purpose broader than what is in the amendment.\n  These extensive exceptions will involve a great deal of litigation. \nWe do have a preexisting customer relationship exception, our \nprovision, which we expect the regulators to define, to give it more \ncontent and more meaning.\n  Second, the amendment has an exemption for a common database and the \ninformation that goes into a common database. In fact, it says a person \ndoes not disclose information or share information with an affiliate \nsolely because information is maintained in a common information system \nor database and employees of the person and its affiliate have access \nto that common information system or database. That is another \nprovision in the amendment, a major provision, which in fact restrains \nor restricts the consumer's ability to opt out.\n  I could go on with this form of analysis, but I have probably given \nenough to underscore my thoughts. I appreciate the commitment of the \ntwo Senators from California, Mrs. Feinstein and Mrs. Boxer, on this \nissue. They have been champions and leaders on this issue. Many Members \nhave been with them on these matters and presumably will remain with \nthem.\n  But we are trying to craft a bill to deal with the FCRA. It is not \ncomprehensive. We are dealing with that subject alone. What is in the \nbill from the committee is a significant improvement over existing law. \nI don't think there is any question about that. I think there is an \narguable case that, in fact, it may provide more protection for the \nconsumer than the amendment that is pending. Therefore, I am supportive \nof the chairman and his efforts with regard to this issue.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I now move to table the Feinstein-Boxer \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S13876]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is one more addition to \nthe great underlying Fair Credit Reporting Act that would establish a \nprocess where business records can be accessed by consumers whose \nidentities have been stolen. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes \nfor their work. They have put in a lot of time working through \ndifferent changes in this to make it not only more acceptable but more \nuseful. We appreciate that.\n\n[[Page S13877]]\n\n  I also want to give special mention to Senator Cantwell, the Senator \nfrom Washington, for her perseverance, for her tenaciousness, for her \ninnovation, and for her flexibility. She did a marvelous job of working \non this bill. It is extremely important to the Nation.\n  This is an extremely critical part of fair credit.\n  In today's world of digital transactions and online living, nobody is \nsafe from the fastest growing crime in America known as identity theft. \nLast year alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that nearly 10 \nmillion Americans were victims of this crime, and each paid an average \nof $500 in order to repair the damage done by fraudsters and credit \nabusers. To these millions of American families, $500 means mortgages, \ncar payments, student loans, child support, groceries. In the larger \ncontext, $500 per victim means American families and businesses lost \nmore than $50 billion in recovery costs in 2003 alone. That is a $50 \nbillion drag on our economy--an economy that is just starting to bounce \nback. With the number of identity theft cases increasing at an alarming \nrate, the economic costs will be even higher next year.\n  As such, I rise today in support of an amendment that will make it \neasier for victims of identity theft to recover both economically and \nemotionally from this devastating crime. This amendment is based on a \nbill my colleague from Washington and I introduced in both 2002 and \n2003. Even though the bill passed unanimously last Congress, we have \nmade a number of changes that I believe greatly improve the \nlegislation. I firmly believe this amendment will provide consumers \nwith the right information and businesses with the right safeguards to \nfacilitate quick and cost effective recovery from identity theft.\n  This amendment will allow victims to work with businesses to obtain \ninformation related to cases of identity theft so they can start \nreversing the lasting and damaging effects of this crime. In drafting \nthis legislation we have worked with all of the stakeholders to ensure \nthat the needs of both consumers and the needs of small businesses, \nbanks and other credit agencies were addressed.\n  Our amendment provides consumers with the right to ask businesses for \nrecords relating to a transaction evidencing identity theft. \nBusinesses, in return, have the right to ask for specific kinds of \nidentity verification and clear proof that the individual asking for \nthe information is, in fact, a victim and not another fraudster. Also \nimportant to note, our amendment does not require businesses, to keep \nnew records or seek out information not in their control. It simply \nrequires businesses to share current records with consumers who can \nprove they have been victims of identity theft.\n  I am confident that we have drafted careful legislation that will \ntruly help victims of identity theft recover from this terrible and \nexpensive crime. I commend my colleagues on the Banking Committee who \nhave worked closely with us to make the numerous improvements to this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  In summary, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that nearly 10 \nmillion Americans were victims of identification crime and that each \npaid an average of $500 in order to repair the damage done by the \nfraudsters and credit abusers. That is $50 billion that is taken out of \nour economy each year.\n  This amendment is based on a bill my colleague from Washington and I \nintroduced in 2002 and in 2003. Even though the bill passed unanimously \nthe last time, we have made a number of changes that I believe greatly \nimprove the legislation.\n  I firmly believe this amendment will provide consumers with the right \ninformation and businesses with the right safeguards to facilitate \nquick and cost-effective recovery from identity theft.\n  This amendment allows the victims to work with businesses to obtain \ninformation related to cases of identity theft so they can start \nreversing the damaging effect of the crime.\n  In drafting this legislation, we worked with all of the stakeholders. \nOur amendment provides consumers with the right to ask businesses for \nrecords relating to the transaction. Businesses, in return, have the \nright to ask for specific kinds of identity verification and clear \nproof that the individual asking for the information is in fact the \nvictim and not another fraudster.\n  It is also important to note our amendment does not require \nbusinesses to keep records or seek out information not in their \ncontrol. It simply requires businesses to share current records with \nconsumers who can prove they have been victims of identity theft. I \nthink this will help consumers in a tremendous way.\n  I appreciate the work Senator Cantwell has put in on this amendment. \nThis $50 billion drag on the economy can be solved and will be \nappreciated by consumers.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting it and Senators Sarbanes and \nShelby for statements on the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the managers are prepared to accept this \namendment. I commend Senator Cantwell and also Senator Enzi for the \nwork they have done in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we are happy to take this amendment. I \nwish to echo the chairman in thanking Senator Cantwell and Senator Enzi \nfor their work on this important issue. This is an issue they have been \naddressing for quite some time, and we are very pleased that there are \nimportant identity provisions as the bill came from the committee, and \nI think this is a positive addition.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2059.\n  The amendment (No. 2059) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2060\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I am very pleased to say both Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Shelby have signed off on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 2060.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To address the duration of certain consumer elections and to \n        define the term ``pre-existing business relationship'')\n\n       On page 50, strike line 12 and all that follows through \n     page 51, line 3 and insert the following:\n       ``(3) Duration.--The election of a consumer pursuant to \n     paragraph (1)(B) to prohibit the sending of solicitations \n     shall be effective permanently, beginning on the date on \n     which the person receives the election of the consumer, \n     unless the consumer requests that such election be revoked.\n       ``(4) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     `pre-existing business relationship' means a relationship \n     between a person and a consumer, based on--\n       ``(A) the purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of \n     that person's goods or services, or a financial transaction \n     between the consumer and that person during the 18-month \n     period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer \n     receives the notice required under this section; or\n       ``(B) an inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a \n     product or service offered by that person, during the 3-month \n     period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer \n     receives the notice required under this section.\n       ``(5) Scope.--This section shall not apply to a''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Very briefly, this amendment closes what I consider to be \na little bit of a loophole in the marketing opt-out provision of the \nbill. We do two things. The underlying bill says the marketing opt-out \nexpires after 5 years, unless a consumer opts out\n\n[[Page S13878]]\n\nagain. We make the first opt-out permanent as long as the consumer \nwants it.\n  Secondly, the definition of a preexisting relationship with a \ncompany, with an affiliate, is drawn in such a way, it is very broad. \nSo what we say is, a person will be deemed to have this preexisting \nrelationship with the affiliate if they have purchased, rented, or \nleased a service or good from the affiliate during the 18-month period \nbefore the information sharing takes place or they have inquired about \nan affiliate's product in the 3 months before the sharing takes place.\n  By adopting this simple amendment, we keep financial institutions \nfrom violating consumer rights. I am very pleased that both sides of \nthe committee have signed off on this, and I would be happy to take a \nvoice vote on this at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the managers are prepared to accept this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I actually wish to commend the Senator \nfrom California because she has introduced some specificity into a \nprovision that is in the committee-reported bill. I am very frank to \nsay I think this will be very helpful, and I join the chairman in \nsupporting the amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2060.\n  The amendment (No. 2060) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2061\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf myself, Senator Boxer, and Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2061.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To address restrictions on the sharing of medical information \n               among affiliates, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 81, strike lines 6 through 15 and insert the \n     following: ``to any person related by common ownership or \n     affiliated by corporate control, if the information is \n     medical information, including information that is an \n     individualized list or description based on the payment \n     transactions of the consumer for medical products or \n     services, or an aggregate list of identified consumers based \n     on payment transactions for medical products or services.''.\n       (c) Definition.--Section 603(i) of the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(i)) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(i) Medical Information.--The term `medical information' \n     means information or data, other than age or gender, whether \n     oral or recorded, in any form or medium, created by or \n     derived from a health care provider or the consumer, that \n     relates to--\n       ``(1) the past, present, or future physical, mental, or \n     behavioral health or condition of an individual;\n       ``(2) the provision of health care to an individual; or\n       ``(3) the payment for the provision of health care to an \n     individual.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment essentially updates the \ndefinition of ``medical information.'' It takes a medical definition \nsubmitted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. It is \nthe definition that is used by a majority of our States. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter in support of this definition from the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the \nCalifornia Medical Association, the Community Clinic Consortium, the \nSan Francisco AIDS Foundation, and the AIDS Health Care Foundation be \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, November 3, 2002.\n     Hon.

S. 1753 corrects the potential problems and \n     provides the more complete protections that people deserve.\n       S. 1753 would clarify and strengthen FCRA's definition of \n     medical information. It would also eliminate the false \n     distinction between medical information and medical \n     transaction information. This new definition is critical to \n     protecting the privacy of individuals with chronic illnesses. \n     Even the possibility of breaches of patient medical record \n     confidentiality undermines health care. Patients who know \n     their medical care information could and would be shared with \n     employers, credit organizations and insurance companies will \n     be less forthcoming with their health care providers and, \n     thus, the quality of health care they receive will be \n     compromised; this is neither necessary nor desirable.\n       SFCCC looks forward to continuing to work with you to \n     protect the essential privacy of individuals' medical and \n     health status information; this is a cornerstone of effective \n     health care. Please call (415 345-4233)\n\n[[Page S13879]]\n\n     if you need additional information or assistance on this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John Gressman,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                San Francisco AIDS Foundation,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, October 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The San Francisco AIDS Foundation \n     strongly supports the passage of S. 1753, the Medical \n     Information Privacy Amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting \n     Act (FCRA). While the FCRA attempts to protect consumers from \n     having their medical information used for employment, credit \n     or insurance purposes, the vague definition of ``medical \n     information'' in FCRA creates loopholes in the protection \n     that would prove harmful to people living with HIV/AIDS, \n     mental illness and other stigmatized diseases. S. 1753 \n     rectifies the problems in the underlying legislation and \n     provides the protections these consumers require and deserve.\n       The current definition of medical information in FCRA does \n     not protect the information consumers would supply on \n     documents such as life insurance applications, which ask what \n     medications a consumer is taking. Nor does FCRA protect \n     information obtained without consent. A specific example of \n     this is the reporting of unpaid medical bills from HIV \n     clinics. FCRA does not protect consumers from banks data \n     mining its customers' medical payment transactions to make \n     credit decisions. The majority of U.S. bankruptcies are due \n     to health care costs, which give banks an incentive to \n     determine a customer's creditworthiness based on health. The \n     ties between insurance companies and banks are continuously \n     strengthened as large banks often have hundreds of \n     affiliates, many of whom are also insurance companies. As \n     insurance companies move to electronic forms of payments, \n     they are giving banks large amounts of medical transaction \n     data about their clients. This may include the type of clinic \n     and specific service delivered.\n       S. 1753 would clarify and strengthen FCRA's definition of \n     medical information and eliminate the false distinction \n     between medical information and medical transaction \n     information. This new definition is essential for people \n     living with HIV/AIDS because it provides them with financial \n     privacy. After more than 20 years of dealing with the \n     epidemic, there is still significant cultural stigma attached \n     to HIV disease. Potential disclosure of medical information \n     and breaches in financial privacy create additional health \n     care access barriers. It is therefore essential that the \n     confidentiality of ones health status and medical information \n     be protected from inappropriate use in employment, credit or \n     insurance purposes.\n       The AIDS Foundation looks forward to working with you to \n     promote medical information privacy and health status \n     confidentiality.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein:\n       AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) would like to thank you \n     for sponsoring a legislative amendment to the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act that will protect the privacy of personal \n     medical information in the form of payments for medical \n     services and products and other transactions. As the United \n     States' largest AIDs organization, and provider of medical \n     care to over 12,000 persons in the U.S., AHF is acutely aware \n     of the need to protect consumers from unauthorized use of \n     data pertaining to their medical treatment. Such information \n     is clearly private, and it is highly inappropriate for it to \n     be used for marketing or similar purposes. Such an abuse can \n     only erode the trust patients have in their medical providers \n     and the medical system in general. Thank you, again, for \n     sponsoring this amendment, which AHF is happy to support.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Clint Trout,\n\n                                    Associate Director, Government\n     Affairs-Federal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We applaud you for your efforts to \n     strengthen and improve the medical privacy protections \n     containd in your amendment to expand the definition of \n     ``medical information'' under The National Consumer Credit \n     Reporting System Improvement Act of 2003 (S. 1753).\n       Although the original bill's medical privacy section \n     includes significant new consumer protections that black-out \n     the use of medical information for employment, credit, or \n     insurance purposes, it includes an inadequate definition of \n     the term ``medical information,'' which could result in \n     creating a loophole that weakens the bill's intended \n     objective. By describing ``medical information'' using the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioner's (NAIC) \n     definition, which has been agreed upon and implemented by \n     insurance regulators in a vast majority of states, your \n     amendment closes existing loopholes and eliminates the \n     opportunity for unscrupulous use of sensitive medical \n     information.\n       We also support your amendment because it eliminates the \n     inconsistent differentiation between medical information and \n     medical transaction information, providing greater certainty \n     to the bill's language and to future interpretations of \n     legislative intent. This would be a marked improvement to the \n     underlying bill's definition of medical information, which as \n     currently written does not protect mental or behavioral \n     health information, data provided by consumers on life \n     insurance applications, or medical information obtained \n     without consent, such as the reporting of an unpaid bill from \n     a cancer center. We believe the effect of these harmful \n     oversights can be negated by passage of your amendment.\n       As you know, millions of consumers worry that their health \n     providers or insurers may be sharing their private \n     information with others. Beyond this concern, however, is a \n     feeling that they have less and less control over their \n     sensitive medical files. Medical information should have no \n     place in employment decisions or credit determinations and \n     related corporate entities should not be able to share it--\n     this information deserves the strongest protection under the \n     law, but beyond that, it is important that we give consumers \n     back some control over who can and cannot use this \n     information.\n       Both the National Consumer Credit Reporting System \n     Improvement Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions \n     Act, recently passed by the House of Representatives, contain \n     landmark provisions protecting consumers' private medical \n     information. This amendment builds upon these strides by \n     correcting important deficiencies in the Senate bill, and we \n     strongly urge its adoption by the Senate and its inclusion in \n     the legislation that emerges from the Conference Committee. \n     Again, we congratulate you on your thoughtful and bipartisan \n     amendment, and wish you success in its passage on the Senate \n     floor later this week.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rahm Emanuel,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Walter B. Jones,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe both sides will accept the definition, and \nI would be happy to take a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The managers are prepared to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I join with my colleague in accepting the amendment. I \ncommend the Senator from California. Actually, medical information is \nsomething that people feel very keenly about and the Senator's \namendment will strengthen the provision that was in the bill adopted in \nthe committee. We thank her very much for the amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2061.\n  The amendment (No. 2061) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2062\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follow:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2062.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require reporting to national consumer reporting agencies \n  regarding Federal student loans in order to promote the responsible \n  repayment of such loans and ensure the completeness of information \n            contained in consumer credit reports and scores)\n\n       At the end of section 312, insert the following:\n       (c) Reports to Consumer Reporting Agencies.--\n       (1) Reports.--Section 430A(a) of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1080a(a)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Agreements to Exchange Information.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For the purpose of promoting responsible \n     repayment of loans covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant \n     to\n\n[[Page S13880]]\n\n     this title or covered by a guaranty agreement pursuant to \n     section 428, the Secretary, each guaranty agency, eligible \n     lender, and subsequent holder shall enter into an agreement \n     with each national consumer reporting agency as described in \n     section 603(p) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1681a(p)) to exchange such information as is required by the \n     Secretary concerning each borrower of a loan made, insured, \n     or guaranteed under this title who is served by the \n     Secretary, agency, lender, or holder, respectively, \n     regardless of the default status of the borrower.

Mr. President, I announced my intention to offer this \namendment at an earlier date. Since the announcement of that intention, \nwe have been negotiating with Sallie Mae, the Government-sponsored \nenterprise which is the largest provider of student loans in the \ncountry. The reason for this amendment was a new policy of Sallie Mae, \nas of a few months ago. In fact, about a year ago Sallie Mae decided to \nstop reporting repayment information to two of the three major credit \nbureaus in the United States. It turns out that the Higher Education \nAct, which governs Sallie Mae, required that defaults on student loans \nbe reported to all three national credit bureaus but, by regulation, \npositive repayment information only went to one.\n  As a consequence, many responsible students who had paid off their \nstudent loans were not provided the credit information on their own \nbackgrounds so that it was clear that they paid off their loans. So \nthese students who had turned to a credit bureau for a mortgage or a \nloan on a car would have an outstanding student loan. It worked to \ntheir disadvantage. This decision by Sallie Mae worked a terrible \ndisadvantage to students who had done the right thing.\n  I made it clear to the chairman, Mr. Shelby, as well as Senator \nSarbanes, that I thought this was an injustice that needed to be \ncorrected. Fortunately for me and for the students involved, Sallie Mae \nhas sent a letter. I understand Chairman Shelby, if I am not mistaken, \nhas received a copy of this letter from Sallie Mae; is that correct?\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator will yield, we do have a copy of the \nletter from Sallie Mae.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Sallie Mae, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Shelby and Sarbanes: I am writing to update \n     you on how Sallie Mae reports the credit performances of our \n     customers to the national credit bureaus.\n       Our goal is to ensure that our customers get the credit \n     they have earned. To that end, we have been reporting to one \n     of the national credit bureaus all along, as required by law. \n     When we learned recently that one of our borrowers has not \n     had full access to his credit history, we began negotiating \n     again with the other two credit bureaus so that we could \n     resume reporting to them.\n       I am pleased to let you know that following extensive \n     discussions with the other two credit bureaus, Sallie Mae has \n     agreed to resume reporting to them and will provide each with \n     credit information for our customers. We will keep you and \n     your staffs apprised as we move forward in implementing this \n     decision.\n       We are pleased that the credit bureaus are being responsive \n     to our concerns and we look forward to working with them. \n     Thank you for your interest in this important issue. Please \n     feel free to contact me if you have questions or need \n     additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Rose DiNapoli,\n\n                             Vice President, Government & Industry\n                                            Relations, Sallie Mae.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The letter makes it clear that Sallie Mae is reversing \nits position; that from this point forward they will report repayment \nof student loans to all three major credit bureaus. This is what my \namendment sought to achieve, so I am going to withdraw this amendment \nand thank both Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes for their \ncooperation and urge them to join me in offering an amendment to the \nHigher Education Act which codifies in law this new policy that the \nSallie Mae agency has now decided to implement.\n  There is no reason responsible college students, having paid off \ntheir loans, should be penalized because Sallie Mae refuses to notify \nall three major credit bureaus in America. I am glad with this letter \nthey have decided to change their policy. I hope at a later time to \noffer this amendment to the Higher Education Act and thank the members \nof the committee for their cooperation in this regard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Section 312 of the bill before us is \nentitled ``Procedures to enhance the accuracy and completeness of \ninformation furnished to consumer reporting agencies.'' My Responsible \nStudent Amendment addresses exactly that: the completeness of \ninformation furnished to consumer reporting agencies. My amendment is \ndesigned to ensure that young Americans who have positive credit \nhistories established by responsibly repaying their student loans will \nbe able to take a clean shot at the American dream when they try to buy \ntheir first home. It does so simply by requiring what until recently \nwas standard practice for student loan providers; regular reporting on \nall loan repayments to each of the three major credit bureaus.\n  Until recently, responsible repayment of student loans was rewarded \nas would be expected, with a positive credit history. Responsible \nrepayment was responsibly reported by student loan providers, in the \ntypical fashion, to all three major credit bureaus. One of those \nproviders, the biggest, is Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae was founded in 1972 \nas a government-sponsored enterprise, GSE. In 1997, the company \ninitiated the privatization process. Sallie Mae, in other words, was \nborn and raised on the taxpayers dime. One might hope that it would \ntherefore feel some responsibility to keep taxpayers' interest in mind.\n  About a year ago, however, Sallie Mae, by far the largest provider of \nFederally guaranteed student loans, suddenly stopped reporting \nrepayment information to two of the three major credit bureaus. It \nturns out that The\n\n[[Page S13881]]\n\nHigher Education Act, which established the Federal student loan \nprogram, requires that defaults on student loans be reported to all \nthree national credit bureaus, while positive repayment information \nonly has to go to one. Is this the way we want to reward responsible \nrepayment of student loans? Don't we want a system that rewards \nresponsible repayment, rather than one that shrugs and says that that \ninformation doesn't matter?\n  What is the result of Sallie Mae not reporting to two of the three \nmajor credit bureaus? Thousands of young people--whose main or only use \nof credit has been their student loans from Sallie Mae--suddenly have \nmajor gaps in their credit histories. Stories in the Washington Post \nand the American Banker have described the case of one typical 31 year \nold, named Eric Borgeson. Mr. Borgeson is an architect who lives in \nEdwards, CO. Mr. Borgeson, who graduated from college 10 years ago, had \na perfect credit repayment record on his three Sallie Mae loans. Then, \nmidway through the home-buying process, his credit score dropped by 40 \npoints. Sallie Mae had pulled his perfect repayment records from his \ncredit reports with two of the three major credit bureaus. As a result, \nhe ended up with a lower credit score and a significantly higher \ninterest rate on his mortgage, that he estimates will cost him nearly \n$200 more per month in interest payments.\n  Why has Sallie Mae stopped reporting to two of the three major credit \nbureaus? The answer is simple: pre-screened lists. Credit bureaus \ntypically sell lists of their customers, pre-screened to meet certain \ncriteria based on the information in their credit reports. Sallie Mae's \ncompetitors were using such lists to offer Sallie Mae's customers \nbetter deals. Rather than meet the competition, Sallie Mae simply \ndecided to pull its customers' information from bureaus that wouldn't \nagree to stop selling pre-screened lists.\n  Sallie Mae claims that it is simply protecting its customers from \nunwanted solicitations. Sallie Mae knows, however, that there is a toll \nfree phone number people can call to keep their name off of such pre-\nscreened lists. If it really was concerned about protecting its \ncustomers from unwanted credit card solicitations, it could simply \npublicize that number: 888-567-8688.\n  The group of consumers in question here is a unique group of \nconsumers. Just starting their careers, still paying off their loans: \nif there is any group of consumers that benefits from competition among \nloan providers and consolidators, this group is it. This is a group \nthat often wants to hear from Sallie Mae's competitors. Those still \nrepaying their student loans may get offers from consolidators who will \ncombine all their loans and charge a lower overall interest rate. Those \nwho have finished repaying their student loans are often establishing \nhomes, careers, and families and therefore using credit cards more than \naverage users. They, therefore, may benefit from being able to compare \nthe credit card package they have with the offerings of competitors.\n  By trying to shield its customers from competing offers, Sallie Mae \ndoes them a disservice twice: it punches a big hole in their credit \nhistories, resulting in higher rates on mortgages and other new loans, \nand it prevents them from learning of better deals for other financial \nservices. Each of these alone could cost consumers thousands of \ndollars.\n  My amendment prevents that from happening. It amends the Higher \nEducation Act by adding the word ``each,'' requiring reporting to each \nof the major ``consumer reporting agencies''--credit bureaus--and \nmaking clear that both positive and negative information should be \naccurately reported.\n  Responsible repayment of student loans should be rewarded by \ninclusion in accurate and complete credit histories. This amendment \nwill ensure that result.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2062 Withdrawn\n\n  I need no further time. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from Illinois \nbecause he saw a problem and fastened on it and as a consequence, we at \nleast have a solution, at least at the regulatory level. I understand \nthe Senator may well pursue it statutorily, although Sallie Mae is not \nunder the jurisdiction of our committee, as he understands.\n  I share his concern. I think this was an unacceptable situation which \nexisted. Because of the actions of the Senator from Illinois and also \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl--who also took a keen interest in \nthis issue--I think we have the resolution of it. I appreciate the \nSenator's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I take a minute to commend Mr. Durbin, the Senator from \nIllinois, for his good work in this area. He has recognized this as a \nvery important issue and has done something about it. Whether it is \nSallie Mae or anybody else, what we are interested in is all the \nreporting we can get that would affect someone's credit. I again \ncommend Senator Durbin for the work he has done. I am sure he will \nfollow up and make sure this is part of the law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. My colleague, \nSenator Herb Kohl, shares my feeling on this issue and introduced a \nsimilar amendment and joins with me in saluting this change and making \nit clear we are going to move forward.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Durbin, Shelby \nand Sarbanes in expressing our concern about an issue that could affect \ncountless graduates who work hard to pay off their student loans.\n  A little over a year ago, Sallie Mae--one of the largest originators \nof student loans and the largest secondary market for student loans--\nmade a quiet decision that had a huge impact on college graduates.\n  Sallie Mae refused to report student loan repayment histories to two \nout of three major credit reporting agencies. That means graduates--\nmost of whom have good records of paying on their student loans--have \nhuge holes in their credit histories holes that prevent them from \nestablishing credit or getting the best rates to buy their first home.\n  I recognize that our credit reporting system is essentially \nvoluntary. There is no legal requirement that any private business \nreport information to any credit bureau. However, Sallie Mae is an \nexception. U.S. Department of Education regulations require Sallie Mae \nto report student loan credit report histories to at least one of the \nthree major credit reporting agencies.\n  Until last year, they reported to all three agencies. Then, Sallie \nMae decided to stop reporting to two of the agencies. Some say they \nstopped because those two agencies routinely sold lists of Sallie Mae \ncustomers to competitors who could offer better deals. Sallie Mae \nmaintains that they were protecting their customers from unwanted \nsolicitations.\n  Whatever the reason, the result is clear: students who have worked \nhard to complete their education are hurt by this policy. Graduates \nentering the workforce and attempting to establish credit--even those \nwho may have excellent records paying off their student loans--end up \nwith incomplete credit records. On that basis alone, they may be denied \ncredit.\n  This is a significant problem. Leaving out positive credit \ninformation on student loans can lead to a lower credit score for \nconsumers. Lower credit scores penalize consumers in the form of higher \ncredit card and mortgage interest rates, more expensive insurance, and \neven the risk of being excluded from the marketplace altogether.\n  Sallie Mae's decision has been especially detrimental to new home \nbuyers. Mortgage credit is generally based on a merged credit report \nwhich incorporates information from all three credit repositories. It \ncan only provide an accurate credit history if all three reports are \ncomplete.\n  The Washington Post recently highlighted the story of a 31-year-old \narchitect who applied for a mortgage to buy a new house. Because Sallie \nMae did not report his years of on-time student loan payments to all \nthe credit bureaus, his credit score dropped 40 points--and his \nmortgage rate increased 1.5 points--costing him $200 dollars more per \nmonth in interest payments.\n  After learning of this problem last month, I have been in touch with \nSallie\n\n[[Page S13882]]\n\nMae to urge them to resume full credit reporting to all three of the \nmajor credit reporting bureaus. I have also been in touch with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, and with Senator \nDurbin. I appreciate their willingness to work with me to ensure that \nstudent loan repayment histories are fully reported to all the major \ncredit bureaus.\n  I am especially pleased that today, Sallie Mae announced that they \nhave reached agreement with the credit bureaus and will now begin \nreporting to all three once again. I appreciate their efforts to work \nwith our offices to solve this problem and ensure that their customers \nget the credit they have earned. I commend Sallie Mae for doing the \nright thing and fixing this problem promptly.\n  This is truly a positive step forward, but I think we should take one \nmore at the appropriate time. Congress should codify these new \nagreements in law by requiring Sallie Mae to report to all three major \ncredit bureaus. This will guarantee graduates that their student loan \npayment histories will always be reported and their credit scores will \nbe complete. It will make sure that we do not face further problems in \nthe future.\n  Senator Durbin and I have both been working on amendments that would \ndo just that. While I will not offer an amendment on this bill, I look \nforward to working with Senator Durbin, Chairman Shelby, and Senator \nSarbanes to address this issue in the future.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the two managers are on the floor. I \nwant to bring to their attention that Senator Cantwell has been waiting \nto speak for some time on an amendment which was adopted. If you could \nwork them into the order, I would appreciate it.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my colleague from Wyoming and I tried to \naccommodate Members who were here in the last few minutes, trying to \nget several amendments adopted.\n  I want to spend a few minutes going into more detail about the \nCantwell-Enzi Restore Your Good Name Act that has been incorporated \ninto the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n  I would first like to thank the chairman and ranking members of the \ncommittee for their strong support of this underlying bill that has \nbeen incorporated, along with the last amendment that we just voted on \nby voice a few minutes ago, dealing with business records.\n  It was roughly 2 years ago that the chairman of the Banking Committee \nand I spoke at a national platform for the attorneys general of America \nto address the issue of privacy and some of the biggest challenges to \nprivacy at that time. We both made known our view that this country \nneeded stronger legislation in the area of identity theft.\n  I commend the chairman and the ranking member for their strong step \nforward, a really critical step forward, to protect Americans from what \nis the fastest growing crime in America--identity theft.\n  Unfortunately, even though the Senate passed the Cantwell-Enzi \nlegislation last year, the House failed to act on it and the number of \nvictims has continued to grow. In fact, 9 million Americans have been \nthe victims of identity theft. This underlying bill incorporates some \nof those good ideas that my colleague from Wyoming worked so hard on in \nthe Banking Committee and that we worked through the Judiciary \nCommittee to pass. I certainly commend my colleague, Senator Enzi, for \nhis dedication to this issue. Consumers in America are going to be more \nprotected because of his efforts. It has been a pleasure to work with \nhim on these challenging issues, to make sure those protections are put \nin place.\n  The underlying bill that we have passed changes the framework by \nwhich consumers can now restore their good name and protect their \nidentity. It does so, first and foremost, as Senator Enzi and I \nsuggested, by formulating an affidavit process. So many people in \nAmerica are victims of identity theft. But I can tell you this: it is \nnot a crime for which you can call 911 and get immediate response. The \nbiggest problem, once you are a victim of identity theft, is proving \nthat you are in fact the person whose identity has been stolen.\n\n  I like to say that, in the case of the perpetrator who steals your \ntelevision set right out of your living room, chances are that he is \nsomewhere in the neighborhood. But the crime of identity theft could \ninvolve someone anywhere in the country, or for that matter, outside \nthe United States, working with a ring.\n  So part of what we are trying to do, first and foremost, is to give \nvictims and law enforcement tools to help victims reclaim their \nidentity. The affidavit process that now must be accepted by business \nowners and credit agencies as proof that you are a victim of identity \ntheft is the first step in making sure that your credit record is \ncorrected and perpetrators are prevented from continuing to ruin your \ncredit.\n  Second, the credit provisions that Senator Enzi was successful in \ngetting added in committee represent a tremendous step in solving the \nproblem that so many Americans face when their identity is stolen--that \nthe perpetrators continue to pose as them, running up large credit \nbills.\n  In the case of a constituent I recently met in Washington State, the \nperpetrator who stole the constituent's license succeeded in buying \nfive different vehicles. My constituent has continued to be a subject \nof investigation by law enforcement as she has tried to prove that it \nwas, in fact, her identity that was stolen, that she was the victim. So \na critical part of this legislation is the fact that individuals will \nbe allowed to go to a credit agency and get that information blocked so \nthat their good name is restored.\n  The amendment that we just adopted deals with another aspect of this \nproblem, which is getting access to business records. Law enforcement \nin the State of Washington have been very successful at dealing with \ncrimes of identity theft because identity thieves are often criminals \nwho are involved in larger activities. There is a high correlation \nbetween people who are involved in identity theft--who use that stolen \nidentity to get access to cash and resources in the State of \nWashington--and people who are involved with methamphetamine \nproduction. These criminals are involved in both drug activity and \nidentity theft.\n  With this amendment, police can now get access to business records. \nAny victim, or law enforcement official acting on behalf of the victim, \nwill have access to business records within 20 days after the victim \nprovides identification, an affidavit and a police report to the \nbusiness. This gives consumers a real tool to correct the harm caused \nthem by this crime. This is a very fundamental part of this bill.\n\n  The last aspect of the identity theft bill that is part of the \namendment we just agreed to deals with the statute of limitations. In \nthe 2001 Supreme Court case of TRW v. Andrews, the Court ruled that the \nstatute of limitations in these cases runs for 2 years from the time \nthe crime is committed. But what we have found is that some victims of \nidentity theft don't even realize they are victims until a year or 2 \nyears after the identity theft has occurred. The statute of limitations \ntherefore impacted the ability of victims to get justice. The \nunderlying amendment we just agreed to extends the statute of \nlimitations to give victims of identity theft 5 years from the time the \ncrime was committed.\n  This underlying bill with the amendment we just agreed to represents \na critical first step in dealing with one of the most important issues \nI think we will deal with in this information age, which is the issue \nof privacy. While this body has tried to deal with this issue in myriad \nways by protecting the financial and health records of individuals, and \nby making sure that either opt-in or opt-out legislation have been \ncleared with consumers, I think we have much more work to do in the \narea of privacy. But you can be sure the Fair Credit Reporting Act \nbefore us today and the Cantwell-Enzi amendment and language adopted \nwith it take a very positive step in dealing with one of the biggest \nprivacy threats to Americans today--identity theft.\n  With these tools, law enforcement and individual consumers whose \nidentities have been stolen will have the tools to make the process of \nreporting and resolving identity theft go smoother. While some may have \nsaid businesses would oppose the underlying amendment, or some of the \nfeatures of the Cantwell-Enzi amendment, businesses have seen record \nlosses of $22\n\n[[Page S13883]]\n\nbillion a year from identity theft, and they have joined in this effort \nto make sure we pass strong national legislation.\n  I again thank Senator Sarbanes and Senator Shelby for their hard \nwork, and certainly Senator Enzi for his effort and his stewardship in \nmaking sure we have good legislation in the process that can go on to \npassage and that will better protect consumers in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Sarbanes for the wonderful \njob they did on this legislation. An important measure such as this \nthat sails through the floor in 1 day is a tribute to the statesmanlike \nand fine legislative hand of our new chairman of the Banking Committee \nand, of course, the steady and wise old hand of our former chairman of \nthe Banking Committee and now the ranking member.\n  I have been ready to offer an amendment on an issue related but not \ndirectly on point to this legislation; that is, debit cards. Right now, \nmillions of Americans use debit cards. They are great. You don't need a \ncheckbook when you have a debit card. It solves many problems. It is a \nreal measure of convenience. They are easy and they save a little time. \nYou don't have to go to the bank and get cash. It is a win-win, except \nfor one catch: Most consumers think when they pay with a debit card it \nis free; that it doesn't cost anything. However, many banks are now \ncharging the consumer when he or she uses the debit card as much as \n$1.50. In my State of New York, about half the banks charge anywhere \nbetween 25 cents to $1.50. When I have asked consumers, they don't \nknow. My wife didn't know.\n  What I want to do is what I did in the House on credit cards and what \nI was able to do here in the Senate with ATMs--not eliminate the fees, \nbecause that is up to each bank but, rather, disclose them.\n  There are a couple of problems with disclosure. One is because it is \nnot the banks that own the machines--the ATMs--rather, it is the \nstores.\n  It is a little more difficult to get that information out to the \nconsumer even when the consumer swipes the card. What we have done here \nis ask the Federal Reserve to within 6 months study this issue and show \nus how it can be done.\n  In addition, there is another point our amendment has that we ask the \nFederal Reserve to study; that is, at least putting it on the monthly \nbank statement in clear letters what the fees are for debit cards. That \nis not done now. There are kids in college who were mailed these cards, \nand they used them to buy a Coke. The Coke was a dollar. The fee was a \ndollar. If they knew it cost $1, they probably wouldn't do it anymore.\n  I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  As the chairman knows, after a long fight Congress enacted \nlegislation so that every ATM--no matter if it is run by a bank or \nprivate operator--tells you when you are being charged. Customers have \ncome to know and expect that warning. But there is no warning when you \nuse your card at a store and use it as a debit card. As often as not, \nyou are charged. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator will yield, I understand the concerns. I \nthink it is also true that debit card transactions and ATM transactions \nhave some significant differences. Namely, the retailer owns the debit \nmachine while the bank owns the ATM machine. This makes a ``point of \nsale'' disclosure--as we achieved in Gramm-Leach-Bliley--more difficult \nsince banks cannot easily adjust the equipment and the software.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the letter the chairman, \nthe ranking member, and myself are submitting to the Federal Reserve \nBoard be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n            U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n                                                          Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Alan Greenspan,\n     Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Greenspan: We are writing to request a study \n     by the Board of Governors of the disclosure of fees imposed \n     by financial institutions on consumers in debit card \n     transactions. Our request is outlined in the attached \n     document.\n       As you know, consumers are increasingly using debt cards as \n     an alternative to cash or credit cards. In 2001, there were \n     estimated to be over 250 million bank cards in circulation \n     with a debit function, and today it is estimated that debit \n     payments make up almost 12 percent of retail payments. The \n     reasons for this growth are clear. Debit cards offer \n     convenience for consumers, and they offer substantial cost \n     savings for banks through more efficient electronic \n     processing.\n       Debit cards can be used by a consumer in two ways. In an \n     online transaction, the consumer enters his/her personal \n     identification number (PIN), and the debit occurs through an \n     electronic transfer of funds over a local debit network, \n     e.g., InterLink or Plus, from the consumer's bank to the \n     merchant's bank. In an offline transaction, the consumer \n     signs his/her name on a receipt, and the transaction occurs \n     over a MasterCard or Visa network linked to the bank.\n       However, depending on how the consumer chooses to use his \n     or her debit card, banks charge and make different amounts of \n     money. In an offline transaction, banks charge a merchant \n     from approximately 1.5 percent to 1.99 percent of the total \n     value of the transaction, similar to credit card transactions \n     that utilize the Visa or MasterCard networks. For example, in \n     a $100 transaction, the merchant would be charged up to $2.00 \n     for the processing of the transaction over the Visa or \n     MasterCard network. In an online transaction, banks charge \n     the merchant a flat fee of about thirty cents.\n       As those numbers illustrate, banks typically make more \n     money when consumers use their debit cards in the offline or \n     credit card-like function. In fact, it has been estimated to \n     us that in a typical transaction banks make three to four \n     times more money on offline transactions than on online \n     transactions.\n       In part to make up for this revenue differential, banks \n     have introduced new debit card fees in the form of a charge \n     to the consumer for each PIN-based, online transaction he or \n     she makes. This fee comes on top of the flat fee already \n     charged to the merchant.\n       However, the consumer may be unaware of these fees at the \n     time of the purchase. He or she has no explicit disclosure of \n     the fee at the point of sale, and no option to accept or deny \n     the additional charge, or to pay cash or use a different \n     payment to avoid the fee. The evidence of the debit car fee \n     shows up only later on the consumer's monthly bank statement. \n     The debit card fees are published together with ATM fees, \n     making it difficult for the consumer to distinguish or \n     understand the charges. Many consumers end up calling the \n     retailer to complain about the fee in the mistaken belief \n     that it was the retailer, not their bank, that initiated the \n     charge.\n       The growth of debit cards and the rise in debit cards fees \n     makes this an important issue. The number of parties involved \n     in the debit cards transactions--retailers, consumers, \n     electronic payment networks, and banks--makes this a complex \n     issue. As always we appreciate your support and the diligence \n     and expertise of the staff at the Federal Reserve Board in \n     helping us to consider and to address the disclosure of debit \n     cards fees to consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Shelby,\n       Chairman.\n     Paul Sarbanes,\n       Ranking Member.\n     Charles Schumer,\n       United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chairman, I know you have been in support of the \nFeds doing the study so we can see what to do next year in terms of \nlegislation; I ask if that is amenable to you?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Absolutely. Senator Sarbanes and I agree with Senator \nSchumer and support further study of this issue. We have planned and \ndrafted a letter to the Federal Reserve Board asking them to conduct a \ncomprehensive review of this issue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask the ranking member for his views on this letter \nand what we have to do in terms of disclosure on debit cards.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I share the chairman's view. I think the Senator from \nNew York has spotlighted a very important issue, but probably the best \nway to proceed now is with this joint letter to the Federal Reserve. \nThen we would have the benefit of their study of this issue as we move \nahead to try to address it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the ranking member. We will make progress on \ndebit cards. I will not go into all the details of the study. The \nletter is quite detailed. The Federal Reserve is willing to do it.\n  I make two other points after commending my colleagues on the bill \noverall. I am proud to be a cosponsor and supporter of this bill. There \nare two parts of the bill in which I was particularly interested. One \nis identity theft which has become an epidemic.\n\n[[Page S13884]]\n\nWhen your identity is stolen, it can take years to bring back your \ncredit rating, even through no fault of your own. The criminals are \ngetting very good at identity theft.\n  I introduced comprehensive legislation in this regard much earlier \nthis year. The chairman has added provisions very similar to those I \nhave introduced. As a result, this bill does a good job. Right now, \nbecoming a victim of identity theft is as easy as saying your ABC's. \nWith this legislation, it will be tougher.\n  My hometown, New York City, has the unfortunate distinction of being \nthe identity theft capital of the world. I am glad we were able to do \nsomething quickly in that regard.\n  Second, on credit scoring, this is another issue on which the Senator \nfrom Colorado and myself worked long and hard. We thank the chairman \nand ranking member for incorporating that into the legislation.\n  The bottom line is, consumers have been kept in the dark about what \ntheir credit score is and how it is computed. This legislation, by \nadding the Schumer-Allard provision, lifts the veil of secrecy over \ncredit scores. When a bank is going to charge you more for your \nmortgage, which could mean hundreds and hundreds of dollars every \nquarter, much more money every month, now you will be able to find out \nwhy and if there is incorrect information as to why you are being \ncharged more. Maybe it is because you have a whole lot of credit cards, \nfor instance, even if you pay your bills on time. You will be able to \ncorrect it.\n  This is fine legislation. I am speeding things along here because I \nknow people want to move quickly. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2064\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I have a couple of general remarks \nabout the overall legislation and I have an amendment at the desk which \nI call up, No. 2064.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2064.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require financial institutions and other users of consumer \n reports to provide notice to appropriate Federal agencies in cases in \n               which consumer information is compromised)\n\n       On page 16, line 25, strike the period at the end and \n     insert the following: ``; and\n       ``(C) prescribe regulations requiring each financial \n     institution and each other person that is a creditor or other \n     user of a consumer report to notify the Federal Trade \n     Commission (and any other agency or person that such \n     rulemaking agency determines appropriate) in any case in \n     which there has been, or is reasonably believed to have been \n     unauthorized access to computerized or physical records which \n     compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of \n     consumer information maintained by or on behalf of that \n     entity, except that such regulations shall not apply to a \n     good faith acquisition of information by an employee or agent \n     of such entity for a business purpose of that entity, if the \n     information is not subject to further unauthorized access.''.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I understand the amendment will be agreed to by both of \nthe managers but let me first say that this amendment is about \ndisclosure of breached customer data that may exist in our system. \nFrankly, 85 percent of businesses that have sophisticated computer \nsystems have identified breaches in their system. My amendment asks for \nthe reporting of those breaches to the FTC so we can get a database and \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, the managers are prepared to accept the \namendment offered by Senator Corzine. It is a good amendment and makes \na lot of sense.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey makes a \npositive contribution to this legislation. I am certainly happy to \naccept it.\n  I also thank the Senator for all the work he did in the committee on \nso many provisions in this legislation. He had a major hand in shaping \nthe bill. I deeply appreciate that.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate that recognition.\n  The reality is the chairman and ranking member showed great \nstewardship and leadership to get this bill in a position where it has \nbroad support in this body. It is going to make a big difference in the \nfinancial marketplace for consumers.\n  Both the reauthorization and additional elements embedded in this \nbill have truly improved our credit system, which is already the finest \nin the world. I thank the ranking member. I want to make sure the \nchairman knows that I appreciate the bipartisanship, the cooperation, \nand comity that has accompanied the framing of this bill. I very much \nappreciate the inclusion of the disclosure of breached consumer data as \npart of the bill.\n  There are some elements of this bill that I will highlight that \nothers have given emphasis to. It is particularly important to \nstrengthen the controls on personal, financial, and medical data in \nthis bill; however, nothing is more important, in my view, than someone \nhaving the ability of requesting a credit file on themselves from the \ncredit agencies once a year. People ought to be able to understand how \nthey are being viewed in the system, if ever they are going to correct \nissues. That, to me, is one of the most important controls.\n  Very much to the credit of the ranking member, there is emphasis on \npromoting financial literacy embedded in this legislation that creates \na real foundation for how we can talk to the general public, teach the \nprinciples of proper financial management, which is one of the most \nimportant elements in individual personal finances. When citizens find \nthey are on the short end of their credit reports and they are in court \nto solve a bankruptcy, they wish they had learned more in school \nregarding managing personal finances.\n  The identity theft issue, which is part of why I have offered the \nbreached customer data amendment, is so important. This is an epidemic \nin our society. The number of breaches, the number of extraordinary \ncases of individual pain that has come from people breaching our \ntechnologically connected world today is overwhelming. The protections \nwe have started to talk about--fraud alerts, limitations on transfer of \ndebt, and this free credit report a year--will go a long way toward \ntrying to shape it up.\n  We could go further in this area, in my own view. As the Senator from \nNew York discussed, this is an important piece of legislation. I wish \nwe had done a little more to control the use of financial information, \nparticularly among affiliates in some of our most complex organizations \nwhere there are 1,000 or 1,500 affiliates, some spread out but not as \nbroadly controlled as some Members might think relative to what I know \nis in the case of the world financial markets.\n  But that said, this is a fine piece of legislation. The manager and \nranking member should be congratulated, as should all of the members of \nthe committee, including the Presiding Officer.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, has that amendment been disposed of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2064.\n  The amendment (No. 2064) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill, and at this stage it appears we have two amendments left, both \nfrom the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold. He has agreed, with the \npermission of the managers, to offer one amendment, then offer the next \namendment, and debate both those amendments at the same time; and then \nwe would vote on both amendments following his debate on both \namendments and, of course, the adequate response from the managers of \nthe bill.\n  Senator Feingold is here and he is in agreement with that, so we do \nnot need a unanimous consent agreement, but\n\n[[Page S13885]]\n\npeople should understand what he intends to do at this time, and what \nwe intend to do.\n  Following that, it is my understanding, from speaking to the two \nmanagers, there are no other amendments. I think there may be a \nstatement or two that Senators wish to give on the bill, but other than \nthat, I know of no substantive amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I would anticipate we would be ready \nto go to final passage. I think we can move fairly quickly. I know \nSenators have conflicting demands on them, and we are trying to move \nalong.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have a statement that will take about 3 \nor 4 minutes that I will give at some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2065\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2065.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for data-mining reports to Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DATA-MINING REPORTING ACT OF 2003.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Data-\n     Mining Reporting Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Data-mining.--The term ``data-mining'' means a query or \n     search or other analysis of 1 or more electronic databases, \n     where--\n       (A) at least 1 of the databases was obtained from or \n     remains under the control of a non-Federal entity, or the \n     information was acquired initially by another department or \n     agency of the Federal Government for purposes other than \n     intelligence or law enforcement;\n       (B) the search does not use a specific individual's \n     personal identifiers to acquire information concerning that \n     individual; and\n       (C) a department or agency of the Federal Government is \n     conducting the query or search or other analysis to find a \n     pattern indicating terrorist or other criminal activity.\n       (2) Database.--The term ``database'' does not include \n     telephone directories, information publicly available via the \n     Internet or available by any other means to any member of the \n     public without payment of a fee, or databases of judicial and \n     administrative opinions.\n       (c) Reports on Data-Mining Activities.--\n       (1) Requirement for report.--The head of each department or \n     agency of the Federal Government that is engaged in any \n     activity to use or develop data-mining technology shall each \n     submit a public report to Congress on all such activities of \n     the department or agency under the jurisdiction of that \n     official.\n       (2) Content of report.--A report submitted under paragraph \n     (1) shall include, for each activity to use or develop data-\n     mining technology that is required to be covered by the \n     report, the following information:\n       (A) A thorough description of the data-mining technology \n     and the data that will be used.\n       (B) A thorough discussion of the plans for the use of such \n     technology and the target dates for the deployment of the \n     data-mining technology.\n       (C) An assessment of the likely efficacy of the data-mining \n     technology in providing accurate and valuable information \n     consistent with the stated plans for the use of the \n     technology.\n       (D) An assessment of the likely impact of the \n     implementation of the data-mining technology on privacy and \n     civil liberties.\n       (E) A list and analysis of the laws and regulations that \n     govern the information to be collected, reviewed, gathered, \n     and analyzed with the data-mining technology and a \n     description of any modifications of such laws that will be \n     required to use the information in the manner proposed under \n     such program.\n       (F) A thorough discussion of the policies, procedures, and \n     guidelines that are to be developed and applied in the use of \n     such technology for data-mining in order to--\n       (i) protect the privacy and due process rights of \n     individuals; and\n       (ii) ensure that only accurate information is collected and \n     used.\n       (G) A thorough discussion of the procedures allowing \n     individuals whose personal information will be used in the \n     data-mining technology to be informed of the use of their \n     personal information and what procedures are in place to \n     allow for individuals to opt out of the technology. If no \n     such procedures are in place, a thorough explanation as to \n     why not.\n       (H) Any necessary classified information in an annex that \n     shall be available to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n     the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland \n     Security, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Time for report.--Each report required under paragraph \n     (1) shall be--\n       (A) submitted not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) updated once a year and include any new data-mining \n     technologies.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was \ndesigned to make sure that personal financial information about \nconsumers is fairly maintained and accurately reported by credit \nagencies and provided only to the appropriate people. Maintaining the \nprivacy of the consumer is one of the central objectives of the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act. My amendment will ensure that the Federal \nGovernment is not overstepping its role in obtaining and using this \nhighly personal information.\n  My amendment will require all Federal agencies to report to Congress \non the practice of datamining but it would not impose any limits on the \nuse of datamining. This amendment will provide the American people with \ncritical information about the use of datamining technology and the way \nhighly personal information, such as credit reports and other financial \ninformation, is obtained and used by our Government.\n  The untested and controversial intelligence procedure known as \ndatamining is capable of maintaining extensive files containing both \npublic and private records on each and every American. Periodically, \nafter millions of dollars have been spent, we learn about a new \ndatamining program under development. Congress and the public should \nnot be learning the details about these programs only after millions of \ndollars are spent testing and using datamining against unsuspecting \nAmericans.\n  Coupled with the expanded domestic surveillance undertaken by this \nadministration in the wake of September 11, the unchecked development \nof datamining is a potentially troubling step that threatens one of the \nmost important values that we are fighting for in the war against \nterrorism; and that, of course, is freedom. My amendment would simply \nrequire all Federal agencies to report to Congress within 90 days and \nevery year thereafter on datamining programs used to find a pattern \nindicating terrorist or other criminal activity and how these programs \nimplicate the civil liberties and privacy of all Americans. If \nnecessary, information in the various reports can be classified.\n  The amendment does not end funding for any program, determine the \nrules for use of the technology or threaten any ongoing investigation \nthat uses datamining technology. All it does is ensure that Congress \nhas complete information about the current datamining plans and \npractices of the Federal Government. With this information, Congress \nwill be able to conduct a thorough review of the costs and benefits of \nthe practice of datamining on a program-by-program basis and make \nconsidered judgments about which programs should go forward and which \nones should not.\n  My amendment would provide Congress with information about the nature \nof the technology and the data that will be used. The amendment would \nrequire all Government agencies to assess the efficacy of the \ndatamining technology and whether the technology can deliver on the \npromises of each program. In addition, the amendment would make sure \nthat the Federal agencies using datamining technology have considered \nand developed policies to protect the privacy and due process rights of \nindividuals and ensure that only accurate information is collected and \nused.\n\n  Congressional review and oversight is necessary in order to find out \nwhether and how Government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense, \nplan to collect and analyze a combination of intelligence data and \npersonal information such as individuals' traffic violations, credit \ncard purchases, travel records, medical records, communications \nrecords, and virtually any information contained in commercial or \npublic databases. Through comprehensive data mining, everything from \npeople's\n\n[[Page S13886]]\n\nvideo rentals or drugstore purchases made with a credit card to also \ntheir most private health records could be fed into a computer and \nmonitored and reviewed by the Federal Government.\n  Using data mining, the Government hopes to be able to detect \npotential terrorists. There is no evidence, however, that data mining \nwill, in fact, prevent terrorism. Data mining programs under \ndevelopment are being used to look into the future before being tested \nto determine if they would have even been able to anticipate past \nevents like September 11 or the Oklahoma City bombing. Before we \ndevelop the ability to feed personal information about every man, \nwoman, and child into a giant computer, we should learn what data \nmining can and can't do and what limits and protections are needed.\n  We must also consider the potential for errors in data mining. Most \npeople don't even know what information is contained in their credit \nreports. Subjecting unchecked and uncorrected credit reports to massive \ndata mining makes the prospect of ensnaring many innocents very real. \nIf a credit agency has data bout John R. Smith on John D. Smith's \ncredit report, even the best data mining technology might reach the \nwrong conclusion.\n  Most Americans believe that their private lives should remain \nprivate, especially from the Government. Data mining programs run the \nrisk of intruding into the lives of individuals who have nothing to do \nwith terrorism but who trust that their credit reports, financial \nrecords, shopping habits and doctor visits would not become a part of a \ngigantic computerized search engine, operating without any controls or \noversight.\n  The executive branch should be required to report to Congress about \nthe impact of the various data mining programs now underway or being \ndeveloped, and the impact those programs may have on our privacy and \ncivil liberties so that Congress can determine whether the proposed \nbenefits of this practice come at too high a price to our privacy and \nour personal liberties.\n  Some may argue that this amendment does not belong in the bill before \nus. I respectfully disagree. As we consider legislation dealing with \nindividuals' credit reports and their financial privacy, I think it is \nboth relevant and important that we find out whether and to what extent \nthe Government is reviewing databases containing highly personal \ninformation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this very simple reporting \namendment. All it asks for is information to which Congress and the \nAmericana people are entitled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I intend to oppose this amendment and \nall amendments that are not within the four corners of the Fair Credit \nReporting Act legislation.\n  The committee spent a great deal of time, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, as a distinguished member of the Banking Committee, carefully \nconsidering the reauthorization and reform of the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct national standards.\n  The committee bill is carefully crafted, and it balances protecting \nconsumer interests and ensuring the efficiency of our credit markets.\n  The committee bill was unanimously approved, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, by a voice vote in the committee, which is hard to get. It was \nunanimous.\n  Extraneous amendments, I believe, alter this balance and focus and \nthreaten our ability to maintain the strong, bipartisan consensus \nnecessary to pass this important legislation this year.\n  As a result, the managers of the bill--Senator Sarbanes and I--intend \nto oppose including this amendment and all non-Fair Credit Reporting \nAct-related amendments, regardless of their merit. This might have some \nmerit, but I think it can be better served at another place on another \nday.\n  At the proper time, I will move to table the amendment. Right now, I \nyield to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, if I could respond briefly to the \nchairman, first, I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for \nputting this bill together. I intend to support it. I am pleased to \nsupport it. I recognize the managers had to achieve a balance, and they \ndo not want to disrupt that balance.\n  I think I can pretty confidently assure my colleagues that a mere \nreporting requirement by Federal agencies could not possibly upset the \nbalance they have so skillfully achieved. So I would argue in the case \nof this amendment--and my second amendment, which is also only about \nFederal Government reporting information--that it does no violence to \nwhat they have achieved and actually is, in this case, very consistent \nwith the purposes of the bill that have to do with people's privacy of \ntheir financial records.\n  So I urge the chairman and ranking member to consider that this would \nbe different from many other amendments that could upset the balance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I understand the data mining amendment \nencompasses the legislation which the Senator introduced and which is \npending in the Judiciary Committee, if I am not mistaken. At least I am \ninformed of that. So it is not within the scope of the work of our \ncommittee, I say with all due respect to the Senator.\n  I share some concerns about the issues he is raising, and I think \nthey are worth paying attention to. But we have tried very hard to deal \nonly with amendments that are relevant to the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct. A number of Members on both sides of the aisle, upon hearing that, \nhave refrained or withheld from offering amendments that are outside \nthat parameter, and we are very grateful to them for doing that. \nObviously, it has enabled us to move this legislation along.\n  I think we have had a very open process in dealing with amendments \nthat affect the provisions of the FCRA. We tried to keep it open and I \nthink, in a sense, we have bent over backward to do that. But we have \ntried to dissuade the offering of amendments that are outside that \nscope.\n  I think this amendment falls into that category, and therefore I will \nbe supportive of the chairman in the statement he made. This is not to \nspeak to the substance of the Senator's amendment in any developed way; \nI assure him of that. But it seems to me this is not within the scope \nof what we do in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will briefly respond with great \nrespect. There were a number of other amendments with great substance \nthat I would have very much wanted to offer, but did not in the spirit \nof trying to make sure nothing of great moment occurred on this bill. \nThese are merely reporting amendments.\n  I understand the Senator's point. These are amendments that could \nhave been possibly accepted; they are not particularly controversial. \nIn any event, I respect what the managers have had to do in order to \nget the bill through.\n  I am prepared to move on to the next amendment, unless they want to \ncontinue to debate this. If the managers prefer, we could move on in \nthe next amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote be \ndeferred temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2066\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2066.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To require a report to Congress regarding Federal \n                acquisitions of American-made products)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 712. BUY AMERICAN REPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the end of \n     each fiscal year, the head of\n\n[[Page S13887]]\n\n     each Federal agency shall submit a report to Congress on the \n     amount of the acquisitions made by the agency from entities \n     that manufacture the articles, materials, or supplies outside \n     of the United States in that fiscal year.\n       (b) Content of Report.--The report required by subsection \n     (a) shall separately indicate--\n       (1) the dollar value of any articles, materials, or \n     supplies purchased that were manufactured outside of the \n     United States;\n       (2) an itemized list of all waivers granted with respect to \n     such articles, materials, or supplies under the Buy American \n     Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.); and\n       (3) a summary of the total procurement funds spent on goods \n     manufactured in the United States versus funds spent on goods \n     manufactured outside of the United States.\n       (c) Public Availability.--The head of each Federal agency \n     submitting a report under subsection (a) shall make the \n     report publicly available by posting on an Internet website.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I have come to this floor on several \noccasions this year to discuss the crisis in American manufacturing and \nsome steps that I think Congress should take to stop the flow of \nmanufacturing jobs overseas.\n  One step that I believe we should take to support American \nmanufacturers is to ensure that the Federal Government buys American-\nmade goods whenever reasonably possible. Congress enacted such a policy \nwhen it passed the Buy American Act of 1933. This law was enacted to \nensure that the Federal Government supports domestic companies and \ndomestic workers by buying American-made goods.\n  However, the Buy American Act includes a number of waiver provisions \nwhich allow agencies to buy foreign-made goods in certain defined \ncircumstances. I am concerned that agencies may be using these waiver \nprovisions to get around the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. \nThat's why, earlier this year, I introduced the Buy American \nImprovement Act, which would strengthen the existing act by tightening \nits waiver provisions.\n  Unfortunately, it's virtually impossible to get hard numbers on the \nFederal Government's purchases of foreign- and domestic-made goods. \nUnder current law, only the Department of Defense is required to report \nannually to Congress regarding its use of waivers of the Buy American \nAct and its corresponding purchases of foreign-made goods. As for other \nagencies, there is no real disclosure or accountability in the waiver \nprocess.\n  I think that Congress and the public should know how taxpayer dollars \nare being spent, and that's what my amendment would do. The amendment \nis very simple and, I hope, noncontroversial. It would just require all \nFederal agencies to prepare an annual report that details their \npurchases of foreign-made goods. That's it. It would not make any \nchanges in the Buy American Act; that law and its waiver provisions \nwould remain the same. All that would change is that we would all know \nwhether the Buy American Act is working.\n  My amendment would require that the annual report to be submitted by \nagency heads include the following information: the dollar value of any \narticles, materials, or supplies purchased that were manufactured \noutside of the United States; an itemized list of all applicable \nwaivers granted with respect to such articles, materials, or supplies \nunder the Buy American Act; and a summary of the total procurement \nfunds spent by the Federal agency on goods manufactured in the United \nStates versus on goods manufactured outside of the United States. The \namendment also requires that the heads of all Federal agencies make \nthese annual reports publicly available on the Internet.\n  Some may argue that this is a burdensome requirement. The truth is \nthat it is similar to the reporting requirement that the Defense \nDepartment complies with every year. If the Pentagon, with its many \nprocurement contracts, can report to Congress annually on its purchases \nof goods, so too can all other Federal agencies.\n  I am pleased that this amendment is supported by an array of business \nand labor groups including the AFL-CIO, Save American Manufacturing, \nthe U.S. Business and Industry Council, and the International \nBrotherhood of Boilermakers.\n  Madam President, 2.5 million American manufacturing jobs have been \nlost since January 2001. The current unemployment rate is 6.1 percent. \nThe stagnant economy and continued loss of high-paying manufacturing \njobs underscore the need for the Federal Government to support American \nworkers and businesses by buying American-made goods. This amendment is \na modest step toward that goal.\n  I understand that the managers will oppose this and all amendments \nthat are deemed to be non-relevant to the bill. I respect their \nprerogative to do so. I would have preferred to offer this important \namendment to another bill. But opportunities to offer amendments have \nbeen few and far between this year, and it is the right of all Senators \nto offer amendments. I hope that my colleagues will not oppose this \namendment simply because they do not feel it belongs on this particular \nbill. The question is not whether this amendment belongs on the bill; \nthe question is whether it is good law. I think it is and I hope others \nwill agree.\n  The American people deserve to know how their tax dollars are being \nspent, and to what extent these dollars are being used to support \nforeign jobs. I urge my colleagues to support American companies and \nAmerican workers by supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, as we approach the end of actually a \nrather short, abbreviated debate on this legislation, I want to say a \nfew words encouraging my colleagues to join the Presiding Officer, \nmyself, and our respective Republican and Democratic floor managers in \nsupporting this measure.\n  Let me begin by saying to Chairman Shelby and our ranking Democrat, \nSenator Sarbanes, that I think it is rather remarkable that we have \ncome through the deliberations of the past year. We had extensive, \nbalanced hearings on this legislation that gave people from all sides \nof the issue the chance to comment on what they would like to see us do \nwith respect to reauthorization of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n  This is the way the process is supposed to work. We have a deadline, \nand that deadline is to act by December 31. Our chairman and ranking \nDemocrat have orchestrated a series of hearings, as I said earlier, \nwhich allowed financial institutions to come in, allowed consumer \ngroups to come in, and other folks--rank-and-file citizens--to share \nwith all of us on the Banking Committee how they think we ought to \nproceed.\n  We did not have one hearing; we have had a whole series of hearings. \nI think what emerged from those hearings is a consensus that we aspire \nto have, but all too rarely see. I am proud to be part of this process, \nand I suspect the Presiding Officer feels the same way.\n  Our national credit granting standards that are created under the \nFair Credit Reporting Act allow all Americans quick and easy access to \ncredit, whether it is to purchase a home, to purchase a car, or any \nnumber of other consumer goods. There is compelling evidence that \nfailure to reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Fair Credit \nReporting Act would have significant economic consequences, and not \nvery positive ones.\n  I am pleased to say that the legislation before us today extends \nthese uniform standards. It makes them permanent. We avoid any adverse \nimpact on our national credit granting system, and we avoid any \nnegative impact on our national economy.\n  The legislation before us also makes a number of improvements to \ncurrent law. I think this is an important point. It is one made by \nothers, but I want to make it again. Earlier this year, the Federal \nTrade Commission released a survey indicating that millions of \nconsumers have been victimized by the crime of identity theft. My own \nfamily understands how disruptive and devastating this crime can be, as \none of our relatives in your State, Madam President, was victimized \nover a period of several years by identity theft. It\n\n[[Page S13888]]\n\nwas an awful experience for her and not a pleasant one for her family.\n  The bill before us responds to this increasing trend by requiring the \ncreation of a system of fraud alerts. This system of fraud alerts \nallows the victims of identity theft and also allows active duty \nmilitary personnel to flag their credit reports for potential fraud. \nFor example, if a consumer believes they have been the victim of \nidentity theft, then that consumer can make one call and have a fraud \nalert put on his or her credit report. The alert will notify users of \nthat report that this consumer could be the victim of a fraud. This \nalert, in turn, requires the users of this report to take extra steps \nbefore establishing new credit or establishing a credit limit.\n  In the year after the fraud alert is placed in the file, a consumer \nwill be able to receive not one, but two free credit reports to make \nsure the information in their credit report is correct. In addition, \nconsumers will have the ability to block information on their credit \nreport that is the result of identity theft.\n  Importantly, the bill increases the maximum penalty for those who \ncommit the crime of identity theft.\n  This legislation also gives consumers more control over the \ninformation that is contained in their credit reports. First of all, \nconsumers will have easy access to a free credit report on an annual \nbasis. This is a significant right that will allow consumers to review \nthe information contained in their credit report and to make \ncorrections to it.\n\n  To ensure consumers are aware of these rights, the Federal Trade \nCommission must actively publicize how consumers may obtain a free \ncredit report and how to dispute information contained in that report.\n  I oftentimes use the analogy of if a tree falls in a forest, there is \nnobody there to hear it. My colleagues have probably heard that; \nprobably used it a time or two. In this case, if a consumer has the \nability to obtain a free copy of their credit report annually, but they \ndon't know they have that right, is there a benefit that inures from \nthis legislation?\n  In the legislation, we put the onus on others and the Federal Trade \nCommission to publicize how consumers can obtain a free credit report.\n  In addition, the bill gives consumers important protection for their \nmedical information. One of our colleagues on the floor today was \nasking if they deal with a particular financial institution, a company \nthat has access to some of the medical data, can they then share \nmedical data with other affiliates of that company?\n  The answer is no; that is protected and prevented by this \nlegislation. This bill prohibits the use of medical information in the \ncredit granting process. In addition, as I just said, the legislation \ncreates a system for consumer reporting agencies to code medical \ninformation so that someone looking at a credit report cannot discover \na consumer's medical history.\n  Finally, the bill before us establishes the Financial Literacy and \nEducation Commission. I believe this is an essential part of the \nlegislation--it may not have gotten a lot of credit, but it is an \nimportant part of this bill--because a lot of consumers in this country \nhave no knowledge or at least limited knowledge of how our credit \nsystem works. This new commission will be charged with reviewing \nfinancial literacy efforts throughout the Government to eliminate \nduplicative efforts. Importantly, the Commission will also coordinate \nthe promotion of Federal financial literacy efforts, including outreach \namong State, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, as well as \nprivate enterprises.\n  This legislation creates many new tools for consumers. I have \nmentioned some of them. But if consumers lack basic financial literacy, \nthey may not be able to use these tools with the kind of effectiveness \nthat is intended.\n  Again, let me go back to where I started. We have seen this year a \nnumber of occasions when legislation has come to the floor without \ngoing through committee. We have seen legislation come to the floor for \nour consideration, sometimes rather complex legislation, and it has not \nhad the benefit of the hearings it should have. The system has worked \nin this case: excellent hearings, the ability for us as Democrats and \nRepublicans to work together to receive a whole lot of input from a \nbroad cross-section of people and interest groups in this country, the \nability to bring a bill out of committee on a unanimous voice vote. \nThis is legislation that I think is going to be disposed of today.\n  I am proud to at least have been a small part of that process and \npleased to lend my support. I urge my colleagues to do the same for \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is my opportunity to say a word or \ntwo about the National Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement \nAct.\n  We always hear about how divided the Senate is and how divided we are \npolitically, that there is so much partisanship. My experience \nindicates that when there is something that really is extremely \nimportant that needs to get done, we do it.\n  As I look back, there was the terrorism insurance, which was \ndifficult to do, but in a bipartisan method we stepped forward and did \nthat. We had significant problems after 9/11 with the airline industry. \nIt was difficult to do, but we stepped forward with legislation that in \nfact allowed the airline industry as we know it in America to continue.\n  Fair credit reporting is an important issue, and the two sides have \njoined together. I think one reason we were able to do this was the \nexperience and the abilities of the two managers of this bill. The \nSenator from Maryland has heard me brag about him on many occasions. He \nis a person of great intellect, a Rhodes scholar, someone who is very \nquiet. But whenever Senator Sarbanes speaks, everyone should listen \nbecause he does not speak impulsively. He is aware of every word he \nsays. His being the ranking member on this Banking Committee every day \ngives me comfort because it is an area of the law that I do not fully \nunderstand.\n  I have never been on the committees of jurisdiction that deal with \nthese most important issues. This committee has wide-ranging \njurisdiction. It deals with certainly much more than banking--housing, \nmass transit.\n  I also say, as I said this morning earlier about my friend from \nAlabama, the distinguished chairman of the committee, he is a fine \nlegislator. We on this side of the aisle always look forward to the \nsenior Senator from Alabama being part of legislation. Everyone in the \nSenate is a person of their word. I do not know anyone in the Senate, \nof the 99 other Senators, whose word we cannot trust.\n  The Senator from Alabama certainly is a man of his word, but the \nreason I have such great admiration for him is that he is willing to \nlisten. He is willing to listen to someone who disagrees with him.\n  That this legislation arrived at the point it has, is the result of \ntwo fine legislators working through the committee system and reporting \na bill to the Senate. This bill is proof that with enough hard work and \ncommitment, we can move substantive, quality legislation through the \nSenate. Again, I applaud and commend the two managers of this \nlegislation.\n  I have personally spent some time on this legislation, working with \nMembers trying to work out an arrangement to allow us to have the bill \non the floor today. We have been able to do that. We have worked to \nlimit the number of amendments. The majority leader originally said he \nwould not accept the agreement that we had. There were more amendments, \nso we went back and worked and whittled down the amendments. As a \nresult of that, we were able to bring this to the floor.\n  I am very happy to see us moving this bill forward. It is very close \nto passage. It is an excellent example of what we can accomplish when \nMembers make a dedicated effort to pursue a reasonable compromise. This \nlegislation is not what Senator Sarbanes wants, it is not what Senator \nShelby wants; it is what the committee wanted. They had to work with \ntheir Members. It is a compromise. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise. That is not a bad word. That is the only way we can get \nlegislation passed--consensus building--and they have done that.\n  This legislation will help safeguard the security of consumers' \ncredit data\n\n[[Page S13889]]\n\nat the same time it guarantees those consumers rapid, widely available, \nand inexpensive credit.\n  It is a win for the people all over Nevada. It's a win for a family \nin Elko who receives a better mortgage rate because a mortgage bank can \nbe confident about the information in the parents' credit history. The \nfamily pays a lower rate for their mortgage and, as a consequence, will \npay thousands less over the lifetime of the loan, and that money can be \nredirected toward childcare, college, a family vacation.\n  It is a win for the used car dealer in Reno, or anyplace else in \nNevada, who receives more complete and reliable information about \nprospective buyers. He can review an applicant's credit history and \nfeel greater confidence about the degree of risk he is assuming when he \nextends credit to his customers.\n\n  It is a win for the public who will receive better protection than \never before against identity theft.\n  The United States has the lowest cost, most effective consumer credit \nmarket in the entire world, due in part to the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct. This bill will preserve and extend the best elements of this law \nand add important new provisions and make it even better.\n  In closing, I am glad to see that our hard work negotiating this \nlegislation has paid off with a solid bill, and I look forward to \nseeing consumers and business reaping the benefit of this legislation \nfor years to come.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Senator from Nevada has again heaped praise on our \nchairman and our ranking Democrat, as others of us have done, and that \nis important. I failed to mention this in my remarks and I want to \natone for that omission now, that we are blessed with wonderful staff, \nas we all know, on both the Republican and the Democratic sides, and on \nthe subcommittee and the full committee. I want to take a moment to \nalso express my thanks to them and say to my own counsel, Margaret \nSimmons, who has done great work on this bill, a special thank you. \nNone of us do this stuff by ourselves, as we all know. In this case, we \nhave been greatly assisted by their efforts.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2066 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, with regard to the second amendment I \noffered concerning the reporting for the Buy America Act, at this time \nI will withdraw the amendment, with my appreciation to the chairman for \nhis interest in the matter, and I defer to his comments.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator will yield, I believe that is a good \namendment. I think it ought to be in other legislation. I am going to \nwork with Senator Feingold. We all want to promote jobs in America. We \nbelieve the American worker can produce anything as well as, if not \nbetter than, any worker in the world. If we promote Buy America, I \nthink we are saying something to our workers and our industry and our \neconomy down the road, notwithstanding what others will argue.\n  So I commend the Senator from Wisconsin for bringing this up tonight. \nWe are going to continue to work on this and try to put it in the \nproper legislation, where it is going to go somewhere.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis important statement to finally make some progress in strengthening \nthe Buy America Act. I look forward to working with him on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My understanding is the Senator intends to table my \nother amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is pending.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2067\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Nelson of Florida, I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] for Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 2067.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure proper disposal of consumer information and records \n                     derived from consumer reports)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 216.

I learned last year, before comprehensive privacy \nregulations took effect, that some companies do not have protocols in \nplace outlining the proper way to dispose of private consumer \ninformation when it is no longer needed. Last year, thousands of files \ncontaining sensitive customer records were discarded in a dumpster. If \nthe wrong person came across these files, he or she would have had \neverything necessary to commit numerous crimes, including identity \ntheft.\n  Since this incident, the company has acted to correct its privacy \npolicies and the Federal Trade Commission issued its safeguards rule. \nThe rule applies to credit reporting agencies and financial \ninstitutions that maintain consumer records and also contains guidance \nfor businesses, which includes the storage and proper disposal of \nrecords.\n  Although check-cashing businesses, ATM operators, real estate \nappraisers, and even couriers are covered by the safeguards rule, \nrental property companies that assess the creditworthiness of tenants \nand businesses that maintain consumer accounts, such as cell phone \ncompanies and utilities, are not covered by the rule.\n  Improper disposal of a credit report could compromise driver's \nlicense information, Social Security numbers, employment history and \neven bank account numbers. My amendment will close the loophole and \nfurther protect credit information by requiring the Federal Trade \nCommission to issue regulations regarding the proper disposal of \nconsumer credit information.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes and I have reviewed the \namendment. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I support this amendment. Senator Nelson \nof Florida has focused on an important issue involving the disposal of \nconsumer financial records. We commend the amendment to our colleagues.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S13890]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 2067) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1904\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk the last few \ndays and different offers by the majority to go to conference on the \nHealthy Forests initiative and a number of other pieces of legislation. \nFor the majority to say that going to conference is the only way to \nlegislate between the two Houses is really, for lack of a better \ndescription, a bogus argument. Almost every day both Houses pass \nlegislation for which a conference is not appointed. As I mentioned \nearlier today, just last night the Senate passed H.R. 3365, the Fallen \nPatriots Tax Relief Act. We amended it and sent it back to the House \nwithout asking for conference.\n  On other measures, we have done the same thing--H.R. 1584, H.R. 1298, \nH.R. 733, H.R. 13, H.R. 4146, and H.R. 659 just to name a few.\n  If there is any concern about holding up legislation, we believe the \nshoe fits the majority. The Healthy Forests initiative is something \nthat needs to be done. We cannot understand on this side why the \nleadership has refused to send the bill to the House; that is, H.R. \n1904, the Healthy Forests initiative, which passed here overwhelmingly \njust a few days ago. The House may not want to go to conference. They \nmay like our legislation or they may want to amend it and send it back. \nBut at least we ought to give the House this opportunity rather than \nholding the bill hostage. That is what is happening now. By refusing to \nsend it to the House, the majority is holding the bill hostage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the enrolling clerk be directed to \nimmediately send H.R. 1904, which is the Healthy Forests initiative, as \namended by the Senate, to the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the regular order at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the motion to table \namendment No. 2065.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I believe the Senator from Wisconsin has an amendment \npending.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama moves to \ntable, first of all, I know we are getting close to the end of \ndeliberations on this bill. I think that it merits broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I appreciate very much the efforts that have been made by the \nchairman and ranking member. Both Senators have worked very closely \ntogether to get it to this point. Obviously, there are outstanding \nissues that still have to be resolved. We have a couple of amendments.\n  I wanted to take a moment--I didn't realize we were this close to \nhaving the vote on the amendment itself--to draw a distinction in this \nlegislation.\n  Obviously, because of the extraordinary effort that has been made on \nboth sides to work together and the assurances I have been given by the \nchairman that it is not his intention to conduct a conference that \nwould not involve the ranking member and members of the minority with \nregard to this bill and issues to be resolved in conference, I will \nrecommend to our caucus that we move forward with a conference on this \nbill. I wish I could say that with regard to other legislation, but we \nhave not been given the same assurances. We are not at that point yet. \nBut in this case, we certainly intend to work with our colleagues and \nwith the chairman in particular. I applaud him for his efforts and \nthank him for the kind of working relationship that our two colleagues \nhave. It is a tribute to both of them. I acknowledge that prior to the \ntime we take our vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Democratic \nleader.\n  First of all, we have gotten to where we are tonight on the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act coming out of the Banking Committee by working \ntogether in a bipartisan way. Senator Sarbanes and the Democrats on the \ncommittee have been involved in the formulation of this legislation as \nso many members of the Banking Committee have. That is why we are here \ntoday. That is why we believe we have put together a far-reaching, very \ncomplex piece of legislation. We are going to continue--assuming this \nbill passes and goes into conference--to work together because that is \nthe only way we are going to pass this legislation. This legislation, \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, would expire at the end of this year. We \nknow we are working on a deadline. We are working on a good piece of \nlegislation. We want to continue that.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply want to observe that we had a \nfair and open working relationship in the committee in bringing the \nlegislation forward. All Members participated from both sides. I would \nexpect that same relationship to then continue in the conference \ncommittee. We have been dealt fairly by the chairman. I presume we will \ncontinue to be dealt fairly by the chairman. I just wanted to add that \nperception to this relationship.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with that explanation of our \ncircumstances involving this bill, as I say, we will not object to \ngoing to conference. I wish our colleagues well as we finish our work \non this legislation before the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, if it is proper at this time, I move to \ntable the Feingold amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2065. The yeas and nays have already been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), \nthe Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell), and the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Thomas) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator form \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote.\n  The result was announced--yeas 61, nays 32, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 435 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n\n[[Page S13891]]\n\n\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Bunning\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     McConnell\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Thomas\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nthank some of the staff who did outstanding work on the Banking \nCommittee--Kathy Casey, chief of staff of the Banking Committee; Doug \nNappi, our general counsel; Mark Oesterle, one of our counsel.\n  I also thank some of the Democratic staff who worked with us on this: \nSteve Harris, who is Democratic chief of staff; Marty Gruenberg; Lynsey \nGraham Rea, and Dean Shahinian. They have all worked together in a \nbipartisan fashion. I believe that is why this legislation was brought \nout of the committee unanimously and we will be able to pass it, \nbecause we had a lot of input from Members and committee staff on both \nsides of the aisle. It makes a difference.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I echo the chairman in expressing my \ndeep appreciation to the staff people he enumerated: Kathy Casey, Doug \nNappi, and Mark Oesterle on the Republican side, and Steve Harris, \nLynsey Graham, Dean Shahinian, and Marty Gruenberg on the Democratic \nside.\n  We are fortunate in the Banking Committee that we have a very \ncommitted, able, dedicated staff on both sides of the aisle. \nFurthermore, they have been able to work with one another in a very \nproductive and cooperative fashion. The chairman and I are keenly aware \nof the fact of how much we rely upon them, and we want them to know how \nmuch we appreciate their terrific effort, which was reflected in this \nlegislation and in many other matters with which the committee deals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur on passage of the bill on Wednesday--tomorrow--with no \nintervening action or debate, at a time determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Democratic leader. Further, I ask \nunanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with a ratio \nof 4 to 3. I also ask unanimous consent that S. 1753 then be returned \nto the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the distinguished occupant of the chair \nand I are new Members of the Senate. There are a great many privileges \nto being here, and one is the congeniality to new Members of the \nSenate. One is the seriousness of the issues with which we deal these \ndays. One is the great traditions in the Senate. But there is a very \nspecial privilege of being here, and being here tonight, which I \nrealize, and that is this: Every single one of us as Americans someday, \nsometime, while sitting at home or on our job, may suddenly realize \nsomething about our Government that really stirs us up and we wish we \ncould say something and do something that somebody would hear. We are \nangry about it, we are upset about it, we want to say something about \nit. I have a privilege as a Member of the Senate of being able to do \njust that tonight.\n  Nothing used to make me more upset as the Governor of Tennessee for \nthe 8 years I was Governor than when Members of this distinguished body \nand the other distinguished body--Members of Congress--would get \ntogether and come up with some great idea and pass a law and tell us to \ndo it, and then send us the bill requiring us to pay for it, even \nthough they were printing money up here and we were balancing budgets \nat home.\n  The distinguished occupant of the Chair was mayor of a great city for \n8 years, I believe, the same amount of time as I was Governor. I know \nhe must have felt the same way.\n  It might have been the case in terms of storm water runoff. Somebody \nin Washington, like the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, in \nthat case may have said sometimes when it really rains hard, the water \ngets mixed up with the sewage and it runs into the river, so we need to \nfix that situation.\n  Great idea, but who is going to pay the bill? I tell you who pays the \nbill. In Minneapolis, you have to raise the property tax, or in \nNashville, you have to raise the sales tax. Or in Maryville, TN, you \nhave to fire some teachers so you have enough money to do the storm \nwater runoff.\n  I remember back in the mid-1970s, about the time I was getting into \npolitics, the Members of Congress decided we needed to help children \nwith disabilities. We are all for that. That is a wonderful idea. But \nat the time, the Federal Government was paying, as it is today, about 7 \npercent of all the costs of elementary and secondary education in \nAmerica. Most of that is paid for by Minnesota and Tennessee taxpayers \nthrough income taxes, and sales taxes, and property taxes that are \nraised at home.\n  The Congress said, ``Help the children with disabilities,'' but they \ndidn't pay the bill. So what happens. I meet with the Shelby County \nSchool Board in Memphis. What do they say to me? We have this huge, \nterrific cost and these orders from Washington and regulations about \nwhat to do, and then we have to take money we raise, that we would \notherwise be spending for other purposes, and deal with the good idea \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  I have heard many Members of this body talk a little bit about No \nChild\n\n[[Page S13892]]\n\nLeft Behind and the new provisions in that bill, wondering whether \nthose are unfunded Federal mandates, a Washington word that if you boil \nit down to plain English means: We will do it up here in Washington; we \nwill claim credit for it, but you pay the bill.\n  On Thursday, thanks to the generosity of the majority leader in a \nvery busy week, the Senate has agreed to consider whether we will \nimpose yet one more unfunded Federal mandate on State and local \ngovernments, and I refer specifically to the proposal to extend the ban \non State and local authority to tax access to the Internet.\n  In advance of that vote, which will occur in the next few days, I \nwant to discuss three basic considerations with my colleagues.\n  No. 1, some of my colleagues have seemed surprised when I suggested \nthe proposed ban on State and local Internet taxation is an unfunded \nFederal mandate. Let me say exactly in these remarks why the proposed \nban on State and local ability to tax Internet access is an unfunded \nmandate plainly in violation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995 which was passed by this body with 91 votes, and 63 Senators who \nvoted to ban unfunded Federal mandates in 1995 are still Members of \nthis body. In 1994, over 300 Republican candidates stood on the steps \nof the U.S. Capitol and said in the Contract With America: We will stop \npassing unfunded Federal mandates, and if we break this contract, throw \nus out. That is why, when this legislation is offered later this week, \nI plan to offer a point of order against its consideration because the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 says that it is out of order for \nthis Senate to pass an unfunded Federal mandate. The first thing I want \nto describe why this proposed ban on Internet taxation is an unfunded \nFederal mandate.\n  No. 2, I want to discuss a strange case of amnesia that seems to have \nenveloped this distinguished body, a strange disease that has caused \nmany Members to forget, as I mentioned a few moments ago, that in 1995, \nat the beginning of the 104th Congress, the new Senate majority leader, \nBob Dole, went down to Williamsburg, VA, and promised Republican \nGovernors that ``The first bill in the Senate, S. 1, is going to be \nunfunded mandates.''\n\n  This is especially surprising because Senator Dole was good to his \nword and, in fact, the second plank of the Contract With America that \nwas enacted in this Congress was the ban on unfunded mandates. It was \nat the heart of the Contract With America. It was at the heart of the \nRepublican revolution in 1994.\n  At that time, I was campaigning across this country in 1994. Nothing \nI found made local officials and citizens madder than Washington \npoliticians who pass unfunded mandates, claiming credit without facing \nthe costs, whether it was the legislation I described involving \nchildren with disabilities, storm water runoff, or highly qualified \nteachers. As a result, 91 Senators voted for the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995, and 63 of those Senators are still here today.\n  No. 3, I would like to discuss an amendment I will be proposing. I am \nfiling tonight an amendment I call the Unfunded Federal Mandate \nReimbursement Act. If a majority of the Senate should decide that \nbanning State and local taxation of the Internet is important enough to \ncreate an unfunded Federal mandate--that is, claim the credit up here, \nbut make it be done down there--then my amendment would provide a way \nfor Congress to pay the bill for that by authorizing our Department of \nthe Treasury to reimburse Tennessee and Minneapolis and other State and \nlocal governments each year for the cost of this new mandate.\n  Let me say briefly what we are talking about and what we are not \ntalking about. We are not talking about the issue of whether to \nauthorize States to require out-of-State companies, such as L. L. Bean, \nthat sell by catalog or Internet, to collect the same Tennessee sales \ntax that Friedman's Army Surplus Store would collect when it sells me a \nred-and-black plaid shirt. That is an entirely different piece of \nlegislation. The Senator from Wyoming and others have sponsored that \nlegislation. The Senator from North Dakota is a part of that. We are \nnot talking about making it easier to collect sales tax from Internet \nand catalog companies.\n  What we are talking about is whether Tennessee and other States can \ncollect a sales tax from an Internet service provider when it connects \nmy computer to the Internet, just as it collects sales tax from the \ntelephone company when it connects my telephone or from the cable TV \ncompany when it connects my TV. Tennessee has been collecting this tax \nsince 1996. Nine other States and the District of Columbia also collect \na tax on Internet access.\n  The Knoxville News Sentinel had an excellent article on Sunday \nputting this into perspective. I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Knoxville, News Sentinel]\n\n                        Internet's Taxing Issue\n\n\n    State, service providers wage fight over sales tax on Web access\n\n                           (By Larisa Brass)\n\n       Pull out your monthly Internet bill and take a look at the \n     bottom line.\n       See a sales tax charge? Maybe, maybe not.\n       Nearly a decade after the Internet's debut, the argument \n     still rages in Tennessee over whether online connections \n     should be taxed like your telephone bill or your cable \n     service.\n       The State says wording of its tax code implicitly includes \n     Internet access as a telecommunications service subject to \n     sales tax. A number of Internet service providers disagree, \n     however, saying that Internet access amounts to an \n     information, not communications, service and is not subject \n     to tax.\n       The argument has landed the Department of Revenue and six \n     Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, in court.\n       Five cases--two involving AOL and three against CompuServe, \n     Earthlink and AT now in litigation in Davidson County \n     Chancery Court. One case involving Prodigy is awaiting review \n     by the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n       A number of disputes between the Department of Revenue and \n     other service providers have not yet reached the courts, \n     although the department won't say how many or which companies \n     are involved.\n       Tennessee officials say they should be getting $18 million \n     in revenue on Internet access sales taxes each year. In \n     reality, the State's Department of Revenue reports \n     collections of half that amount.\n       For a State in dire financial straits, that isn't pocket \n     change. Add it up over the past seven years--the State began \n     pursuing collections in 1996--and you get about $60 million.\n       That's enough to fund the Department of Revenue for a year \n     or pay 1,600 teachers' salaries. In the next five years, the \n     state estimates it could lose $109 million in uncollected \n     revenues.\n       On one side, the Department of Revenue argues that Internet \n     access should be charged as a telecommunications service \n     because it falls under the state's definition of \n     ``telecommunications.''\n       That definition is: ``communications by electric or \n     electronic transmission of impulses, including transmission \n     by or through any media, such as wires, cables, microwaves, \n     radio waves, light waves or any combination of those or \n     similar media.''\n       But Internet services providers argue that the term \n     ``telecommunications'' doesn't apply to them at all.\n       When the State began to actively collect sales tax on \n     Internet access ``the department simply didn't understand how \n     ISPs work and that ISPs have never been considered telephone \n     companies,'' said Henry Walker, a Nashville lawyer whose firm \n     represents AOL and Planet Connect, a Kingsport-based Internet \n     service whose dispute with the Department of Revenue has not \n     yet reached the courts.\n       ``(ISPs) don't sell telecommunications services,'' Walker \n     said. ``They sell access to the Internet, and that's \n     different.''\n       Internet providers simply sell access to information, he \n     explained, not a communications service. He compared it to \n     dialing a 1-900 number, saying that users already pay tax on \n     the phone service and aren't charged separately for using \n     that service to access information at the other end.\n\n\n                             STATE VS. ISP\n\n       In the Prodigy case, the trial court and ultimately the \n     Tennessee Court of Appeals agreed.\n       The court found that the intent of state lawmakers, when \n     drafting the telecommunications tax code and the definition \n     of telecommunications used by the Federal Communications \n     Commission, supported Prodigy's claim that it should not have \n     to collect sales tax on its service.\n       In addition, the court said that because telecommunications \n     was not the ``true aim'' of Prodigy's service and because \n     customers must supply their own, taxed telephone service to \n     connect to Prodigy's servers, that the Internet connection \n     should not be taxed as a telecommunications service.\n       Last month, the Department of Revenue appealed the ruling \n     to the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n       ``We think the court was wrong,'' said Loren Chumley, \n     commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue.\n\n[[Page S13893]]\n\n       In a brief filed by the Tennessee attorney general on Oct. \n     9, the state argues Prodigy's services do ``fall squarely \n     within the definition'' of telecommunications, according to \n     Tennessee law, by providing access to ``the Internet, chat \n     rooms, e-mail and information services.''\n       The state argued that Internet service should be taxed even \n     though it was not explicitly included in the law.\n       ``With all due respect to the Court of Appeals, the plain \n     language of this statute should not be read narrowly to \n     include only those technologies that existed when the statute \n     was enacted,'' the filing stated, ``but should be read to \n     incorporate new technologies, including Internet access and \n     e-mail services such as those provided by Prodigy.\n       ``. . . Only by giving statutes their full effect can the \n     law keep up with technological advances.''\n       In addition, the state argued that the Court of Appeals \n     should not rely on the FCC's definition of telecommunications \n     and that to do so is to contradict another state appeals \n     court decision holding ``that federal regulatory statutes \n     should not affect the interpretation of state taxation \n     statutes.''\n       The Department of Revenue is awaiting the state Supreme \n     Court's decision on whether it will take the case.\n       Walker admits the issue isn't black and white. He agrees \n     that many people use the Internet for communication, such as \n     placing online orders or using Internet chat rooms or instant \n     messaging.\n       And, he said, there may be a place for taxing some types of \n     Internet communications, such as voice over Internet \n     protocol, which allows a customer to set up home phone \n     service via the Internet.\n       But ``at this point in time, the FCC has said, `No, that's \n     not telecommunications, that's information services,' '' \n     Walker said. ``I thought (state officials) were on shaky \n     ground from the get-go, and I think the court shut the door \n     pretty hard.''\n\n\n                          TO TAX OR NOT TO TAX\n\n       In any case, the days of taxing Internet access appear to \n     be numbered.\n       Tennessee is one of 10 states that, along with the District \n     of Columbia, now collect sales tax on Internet access \n     charges. They can do so because they were grandfathered into \n     a law passed by Congress in 1998 known as the Internet Tax \n     Moratorium.\n       The legislation forbade the collection of state Internet \n     access taxes unless a state was collecting the taxes before \n     the federal moratorium was passed.\n       Two bills now in Congress would end the state's ability to \n     collect those taxes. One bill now stalled in the Senate would \n     allow states to phase out the taxes within three years. The \n     House version, already passed, would end the tax immediately.\n       Right now, states like Tennessee are more worried about \n     provisions of the bill they say would end taxes on a broad \n     array of telecommunications services and cost Tennessee $360 \n     million in annual sales tax collections.\n       But Chumley said Tennessee stands to lose out, at least in \n     the short-run, if the tax is abolished. The state is moving \n     toward a streamlined sales tax system that would allow it to \n     collect more taxes on the sale of goods via Internet \n     companies, many of which are not now collecting state sales \n     tax on purchases.\n       Chumley said that increased collections on Internet retail \n     sales, however, won't immediately make up for projected \n     losses due to repeal of the Internet access tax.\n       ``I am concerned we could count on some revenue loss \n     immediately,'' she said\n       If the tax is repealed, that won't affect state cases over \n     tax collection of the past, Chumley said.\n       ``It's not retroactive,'' she said. ``Again, we're left \n     back in our case with, well, what is the court going to \n     do?'' can do so because they were grandfathered into a law \n     passed by Congress in 1998 known as the Internet Tax \n     Moratorium.\n       The legislation forbade the collection of state Internet \n     access taxes unless a state was collecting the taxes before \n     the federal moratorium was passed.\n       Two bills now in Congress would end the state's ability to \n     collect those taxes. One bill now stalled in the Senate would \n     allow states to phase out the taxes within three years. The \n     House version, already passed, would end the tax immediately.\n       Right now, states like Tennessee are more worried about \n     provisions of the bill they say would end taxes on a broad \n     array of telecommunications services and cost Tennessee $360 \n     million in annual sales tax collections.\n       But Chumley said Tennessee stands to lose out, at least in \n     the short-run, if the tax is abolished. The state is moving \n     toward a streamlined sales tax system that would allow it to \n     collect more taxes on the sale of goods via Internet \n     companies, many of which are not now collecting state sales \n     tax on purchases.\n       Chumley said that increased collections on Internet retail \n     sales, however, won't immediately make up for projected \n     losses due to repeal of the Internet access tax.\n       ``I am concerned we could count on some revenue loss \n     immediately,'' she said.\n       If the tax is repealed, that won't affect state cases over \n     tax collection of the past, Chumley said.\n       ``It's not retroactive,'' she said, ``Again, we're left \n     back in our case with, well, what is the court going to do?''\n\n\n                           Tax not so taxing\n\n       Not all ISP's agree they shouldn't have to collect sales \n     tax on the services they sell.\n       Ed Bryson, owner of Knoxville ISP Esper Systems, said he's \n     been collecting sales tax since he started his business about \n     eight years ago.\n       ``I would actually support (Internet service) being \n     taxed,'' he said. ``This state needs revenue. Do we pay sales \n     tax on telephone bills? Do we pay sales tax on cable? \n     (Internet access is) a commodity service.''\n       Bryson said it's not that he's such a big fan of taxes. He \n     estimates that collecting and remitting the sales tax on his \n     services cost about $500 per month. He says the company \n     collects about $100,000 in sales taxes per year.\n       And Bryson figures he's lost a few customers to larger \n     providers that don't charge sales tax.\n       But, he said, he doesn't believe that the Internet needs to \n     be tax free for the country to go online.\n       ``Do you really think the Internet needs any fertilizer \n     right now? Do you really think that Tennessee needs to not \n     tax the Internet to make jobs?'' he said.\n       ``I don't like taxes anymore than anybody else,'' Bryson \n     added. ``My philosophy is, just tell me what the rules are \n     and I'll work within them. More than anything I'd like to see \n     this (be) fair across the board.''\n\n\n                              internet tax\n\n       Internet access sales tax: local and state sales tax \n     charged on Internet service. The State considers Internet \n     access a telecommunications service under Tennessee tax law.\n       Tax implemented: 1966\n       Tax rate: 7 percent state; 2.5 percent local.\n       Revenues collected per year: $9 million\n       Estimated revenues uncollected per year: $9 million\n       Estimated total revenue loss: $63 million\n       Tennessee court cases involving Internet service sales tax \n     collection: 6\n       Companies involved: AOL (two cases), AT, CompuServe, \n     EarthLink and Prodigy.\n       Other States that tax Internet access: Connecticut, Iowa, \n     New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, \n     Texas, Wisconsin as well as the District of Columbia\n\n\n                               the basics\n\n       With multiple tax codes, legislation and initiatives, thing \n     can get a bit confusing when it comes to sales tax and the \n     Internet.\n       1. Sales tax on Internet access. This is a state sales tax \n     levied on the monthly subscription fees paid by customers to \n     an Internet service provider.\n       Some providers don't charge the tax to Tennessee customers, \n     saying the state legally can't require collection.\n       The issue has pitted five Internet service providers \n     against the Tennessee Department of Revenue in court. This \n     tax does not apply to the sale of goods over the Internet. \n     (See item No. 3 below.)\n       2. Internet Tax Moratorium. This law was passed by Congress \n     in 1998 and prohibited states from charging sales tax on \n     Internet access.\n       Tennessee, which already was collecting tax on Internet \n     service, was one of 10 states, along with the District of \n     Columbia, allowed to continue collecting the tax.\n       The moratorium expired Saturday, and the House and Senate \n     are hashing out a new Internet sales tax law. Both versions, \n     so far, would end the collection of Internet access sales tax \n     for the 10 grandfathered states, although the House's bill \n     would postpone its expiration for another three years. The \n     Senate bill has been stalled by Tennessee Sen. Lamar \n     Alexander because of controversial provisions that states say \n     would hinder collection of sales tax on a broad array of \n     telecommunications services.\n       3. Tax on sales via Internet. This is sales tax charged on \n     items bought over the Internet.\n       This issue has been in the news recently because Congress \n     is contemplating a bill, separate from the tax moratorium, \n     that would mandate collection of state and local sales tax on \n     goods sold via the Internet to customers in States that \n     comply with the Streamlined Tax Initiative.\n       This currently voluntary initiative includes a simplified \n     tax structure that allows companies to more easily collect \n     state and local sales tax on goods sold online. Tennessee has \n     passed legislation changing its tax code to comply with the \n     streamlined tax guidelines.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me go to my first point, why this proposed legislation is an \nunfunded mandate.\n  The proposed legislation is an unfunded mandate because it would make \nit illegal for these States to continue to collect State and local \nInternet access taxes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nthese losses would amount to $80 billion to $120 billion a year.\n  That is not all. The language of the legislation enacted by the House \nof Representatives, and every version of that language we have seen \nthus far in this Chamber, broadens the ban on taxation on Internet \naccess and increases the size of the Federal unfunded mandates, \nextending to some degree to other telecommunications services, which is \nwhy I suppose we have begun to see the halls filled with lobbyists from \nthe telecommunications industry as they anticipate the possibility that\n\n[[Page S13894]]\n\nthis Congress might be exempting them from some or maybe all of the \ntaxes that State and local governments put on telecommunications.\n  Now, there are many estimates about how much this would cost State \nand local governments. I have a study prepared in November of 2001 by \nErnst & Young for the telecommunications State and local tax coalition. \nThis study by Ernst & Young says that telecommunications providers and \nconsumers of telecommunications services paid a total of $18.1 billion \nin State and local taxes in 1999.\n  I am not suggesting this ban on Internet taxation would eliminate all \nof the $18 billion of State and local taxation on telecommunications, \nbut virtually everyone agrees that it would eliminate some. Every time \nwe, in our wisdom, tell a State or a city that it cannot use this tax, \nall we are doing is increasing the chance that Minneapolis or Tennessee \nwill increase some other tax, or fire some teachers or lay off some \nemployees or close some parks. We have to balance budgets where we come \nfrom. If we knock out a substantial part of the ability to State and \nlocal governments to tax the Internet and some part of the \ntelecommunications industry, we are only increasing the possibility in \nTennessee of raising the property tax, of raising the sales tax, of \nraising the tax on medicine, of raising the tax on food or, in our \nState, making it more likely that we will have sooner or later an \nincome tax. That is just one estimate.\n  Another estimate by the Multistate Tax Commission reported on \nSeptember 24, 2003: The Internet tax moratorium passed by the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives on September 17 would end up reducing State \nand local revenue collections by at least $4 billion, and as much as \n$8.75 billion by 2006, rather than the $500 million estimated cost \nunder the legislation's narrow original focus.\n  The sponsors of the Internet tax ban in the Senate, Senators Allen, \nWyden and others, have been working with State and local officials and \nwith other Senators to try to reduce the amount of loss to State and \nlocal governments. The House bill, which is also before the Senate, \nwould cost Philadelphia, Nashville, Minneapolis, and our States up to \n$4 billion according to this study. So which taxes are they going to \nraise to replace it? Which teachers are they going to fire, from which \nschool? Which park are they going to close? We are substituting our \njudgment for theirs.\n  There are other more specific estimates. We have been hearing from \nStates. The Governor of Tennessee called me. He is a Democrat. I am a \nRepublican. That does not matter so much because I respect the office. \nI had lunch with another former Governor of Tennessee, one of my \npredecessors. He is a Democrat as well. He agrees with us, too.\n  The Tennessee Department of Revenues says the managers' amendment \nwill cost us $358 million a year. That is what the improved version of \nthe House bill will cost one State, according to our State revenue \ndepartment.\n  Then other States have been writing me, and writing their Senators. \nThey say the Allen-Wyden amendment will cost Kentucky $40 million to \n$50 million, maybe $200 million. The new Governor of Kentucky is being \nelected, I guess as we speak. He will have a surprise on his hands \nperhaps when he finds out that he has some taxes to raise or some \nservices to cut because we, in our wisdom, wanted to dictate that. \nIowa, $45 million to $50 million; Maine, $35 million; New Jersey, $600 \nmillion; Ohio, $55.7 million; South Dakota, $34 billion; Tennessee, \n$358 million, as I said; Washington State, $33 million.\n\n  These are what the State governments are telling us the new and \nimproved Senate version of the Internet tax ban would cost State and \nlocal governments. Those are some of the estimates we have heard about.\n  Now, to my second point, why is this so important? Why should we just \nnot let it go on through?\n  Well, maybe one of the advantages of having been around a little \nwhile is I have seen and heard some things that I remember, such as \n1994, I remember the Contract with America. I see my distinguished \ncolleague from Pennsylvania. He remembers the Contract with America. He \nwas a candidate, I believe, in that same year.\n  While I do not believe he was there, surely we all remember the 300 \nRepublicans who stood on the steps of the Capitol. This was in \nSeptember of 1994. This was just before something that was to happen \nthat had not happened in half a century. It was a resurgence in the \ncountry that elected a Republican Congress.\n  What fueled all of that? What fueled that, according to the Heritage \nFoundation, in a candidate's briefing book that they did in 1996, \nlooking back at 1994, chapter 14: With frustrated Americans focusing \ntheir anger increasingly on Washington and gridlock, many political \ncandidates in 1994 successfully ran against Washington, appealing to \nvoters to throw the bums out, replace them with individuals more honest \nand devoted to the public welfare.\n  Then they began to list the items of the Contract with America, one \nof which was to stop unfunded mandates.\n  I can remember that in 1994, the Republican Governors assembled in \nWilliamsburg. They typically do this after an election every 2 years. \nThere were 30 of them there. Governor Allen, now Senator, was the host, \nand Bob Dole, the new majority leader, came down. This is what he \npromised the Republican Governors, that S. 1, the first bill of the \nSenate, was going to be unfunded mandates. That was what Senator Dole \npromised the Republican Governors.\n  At about the same time, the Heritage Foundation was making a list of \nthe unfunded mandates in this country that had given rise to all of \nthis anger and frustration among the American people. I will not read \nthem all but it reports, for example, that the National Conference on \nState Legislatures had identified 192 unfunded mandates on the States, \nincluding Medicaid, regulations governing the use of underground \nstorage tanks, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource \nConservation Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, only to name a few. Those are all wonderful acts, but \nwhat was happening was they were claiming credit up here and those of \nus who were down there were having to pay some of the bill. The U.S. \nConference on Mayors and Price Waterhouse estimated that the 1994 to \n1998 cost of these mandates, excluding Medicaid, on 314 cities was $54 \nbillion, or 11.7 percent of all local taxes. The EPA estimates that \nenvironmental mandates cost State and local governments $30 billion to \n$40 billion annually. State and local governments spend $137 billion to \nensure safe drinking water.\n  These are good laws. I would like to have voted for them. I wish I \nhad proposed many of them.\n  But the reason we had to come in here this year and pass legislation \nsending $20 billion back to the States and to local governments was not \njust because of the recession. It was because, consistently over the \nlast 20 years, we have undercut the ability of State and local \nofficials to make decisions for themselves about what services to \nprovide and how to pay the bills.\n  One of my most vivid memories is of the distinguished former majority \nleader of the Senate, Bob Dole, who was elected in 1995 with that new \nCongress. He had a little copy of the United States Constitution, and \nhe pulled it out when he met with the Governors in 1994 in \nWilliamsburg, when they made the ``Williamsburg Resolve'' to stop these \nunfunded mandates. Senator Dole said he wanted to read to them the \ntenth amendment of the United States Constitution:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it by State, are reserved to \n     the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Senator Dole went across this country during 1995, reading this \namendment to Republican audiences and to audiences in general. I know \nbecause I was there at many of the same meetings; and I know because I \nwas there, that this is the heart and the soul of the Contract With \nAmerica and the Republican revolution in 1994.\n  I am surprised that this case of amnesia has come over so many of my \ncolleagues and that we have forgotten about the importance of this. \nThis is a body that is very respectful of one another. It would not be \nappropriate, I do not think, for me to mention a Senator's name. I \nsuppose I could do it\n\n[[Page S13895]]\n\nwithin the rules of the Senate and then mention what he said about \nunfunded mandates in 1995 and apply it to the vote that we will be \ntaking later this week. But let me read to you just a handful of \nexamples of the kind of things that Members of this body said on this \nfloor in 1995 when the Senate, by 91 to 9, passed the unfunded mandates \nbill. One Senator said:\n\n       In my own State, I repeat to the Senate, local officials, \n     whether it be the Secretary of the State or Labor \n     implementing motor vehicle registrations, or the mayor of the \n     little town where I come from, attempted to meet the needs of \n     the small city. I have heard their appeals and they clearly \n     are tired of the Federal Government telling them precisely \n     how to do things by regulation when they could do it just as \n     well in different ways at less cost to their people.\n\n  A Democrat from the South:\n\n       I believe there is a tendency, particularly during a time \n     of constrained Federal resources, to look to the imposition \n     of obligations on State and local government as a means of \n     accomplishing national objectives which we at the national \n     Government are either unwilling or unable to pay for.\n\n  Another southern Senator, this one a Republican:\n\n       We worry about how we attract good people into office. It \n     is things like unfunded mandates that drives them out.\n\n  Another Senator from the West:\n\n       I served in the legislature and a good deal of our budget \n     was committed before we ever arrived by Federal unfunded \n     mandates.\n\n  This goes on and on.\n  The one other matter that I would like to specifically mention before \nI conclude is I want to remind, if I may, my colleagues of why this is \nan unfunded mandate. Several have come up to me and said: This doesn't \nsound like an unfunded mandate to me. I thought an unfunded mandate was \nonly when you pass a law to do a program, like help children with \ndisabilities, and then only pay half the bill, which is what we do.\n  That is one kind of unfunded mandate. But another kind of unfunded \nmandate that is specifically defined by the Budget Act that was amended \nin 1995 by this Congress is a direct cost that\n\n       . . . would be required to be spent or prohibited from \n     raising in revenues, in order to comply with the Federal \n     intergovernmental mandate.\n\n  In other words, the term ``unfunded mandates'' just requires the \nrequirements that we impose when we don't pay the bill. Whether we are \nrequiring a new program or whether we are telling the State it cannot \ndo this tax or that tax, it is a requirement we are imposing without \npaying the bill. In other words, we are claiming credit and asking \nothers to pay the cost.\n  The Uniform Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 created a very \nspecific procedure for this. This isn't guesswork. It said that when \nthere appears to be an unfunded mandate, that here is how we enforce \nthat. First, the Senate committee of relevant jurisdiction--in this \ncase it would be the Commerce Committee--under section 423 of the \nBudget Act, submits a request for an assessment, identification, and \ndescription of any unfunded Federal mandate.\n  That was done. The Commerce Committee asked the Congressional Budget \nOffice: Is this ban on Internet access taxation an unfunded Federal \nmandate?\n  And the Congressional Budget Office said: Yes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a report by the Congressional Research \nService be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        (CRS Report for Congress--Received Through the CRS Web)\n\n                Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Summarized\n\n   (By Keith Bea and Richard S. Beth, Specialist, American National \n                    Government, Government Division)\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       This summary of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of \n     1995 will assist Members of Congress and staff seeking \n     succinct information on the statute. The term ``unfunded \n     mandates'' generally refers to requirements that a unit of \n     government imposes without providing funds to pay for costs \n     of compliance. UMRA establishes mechanisms to limit federal \n     imposition of unfunded mandates on other levels of government \n     (intergovernmental mandates) and on the private sector. The \n     act establishes points of order against proposed legislation \n     containing an unfunded intergovernmental mandates, requires \n     executive agencies to seek comment on regulations that would \n     constitute a mandate, and establishes a means for judicial \n     enforcement. This report will be updated during the 106th \n     Congress if the act is amended.\n\n\n                            Overview of UMRA\n\n       History of the Act. Enactment of the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) culminated years of effort by \n     nonfederal government officials and their advocates to \n     control, if not eliminate, the federal imposition of unfunded \n     mandates. Supporters contend that the statute is needed to \n     forestall federal legislation and regulations that impose \n     questionable or unnecessary burdens and have resulted in high \n     costs and inefficiencies. Opponents argue that mandates may \n     be necessary to achieve results in areas in which voluntary \n     action may be insufficient or state actions have not achieved \n     intended goals.\n       Since the mid-1980s, Congress debated legislation to slow \n     or prohibit the enactment of unfunded federal manages. The \n     inclusion of the issue in the Contract with America, the \n     blueprint of legislation action developed by the House \n     Republican leadership when it gained the majority practically \n     guaranteed that action would be taken. UMRA was signed into \n     law early in the 104th Congress, on March 22, 1995.\n       Coverage of the Act. Under UMRA, Federal mandates include \n     provisions of law or regulation that impose enforceable \n     duties, including taxes. They also include provisions that \n     reduce or eliminate Federal financial assistance available \n     for carrying out an existing duty. UMRA distinguishes between \n     ``intergovernmental mandates,'' imposed on state, local, or \n     tribal governments, and ``private sector mandates.'' \n     Intergovernmental mandates include legislation or regulations \n     that would: (1) reduce certain Federal services to State, \n     local, and tribal governments (such as border control or \n     reimbursement for services to illegal aliens); and (2) \n     tighten conditions of assistance or reduce federal funding \n     for existing intergovernmental assistance programs with \n     entitlement authority of $550 million or more. Exclusions and \n     exemptions outside the reach of the statute are discussed \n     later in this report.\n       Under UMRA, an intergovernmental mandate is considered \n     unfunded unless the legislation authorizing the mandate meets \n     its costs by either (1) providing new budget authority \n     (direct spending authority or entitlement authority) or (2) \n     authorizing appropriations. If appropriations are authorized, \n     the mandate is considered unfunded unless the legislation \n     ensures that in any fiscal year: (1) the actual costs of the \n     mandate will not exceed the appropriations actually provided; \n     (2) the terms of the mandate will be revised so that it can \n     be carried out with the funds appropriated; (3) the mandate \n     will be abolished; or (4) Congress will enact new legislation \n     to continue the mandate as an unfunded mandate.\n       Contents of the Act. The act consists of five prefatory \n     sections and four titles. The prefatory sections address \n     matters such as the purpose, short title, and exclusions from \n     coverage of the act. Title I amends the Congressional Budget \n     and Impoundment Control Act, as amended, to permit Congress \n     to (1) identify legislation proposing mandates, and (2) \n     decline to consider legislation proposing unfunded \n     intergovernmental mandates. Title I also sets forth \n     thresholds for action, authorizations, and definitions. Title \n     II requires that Federal agencies assess the financial impact \n     of proposed rules on nonfederal entities, determine whether \n     federal resources exist to pay those costs, solicit and \n     consider input from affected entities, and generally select \n     the least costly or burdensome regulatory option.Title III \n     called for a review of Federal mandates to be completed \n     within 18 months of enactment. This statutory requirement was \n     not completed. UMRA assigned the study to the Advisory \n     Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), which no \n     longer exists. The ACIR completed a preliminary report in \n     January, 1996, but the final report was not released. Title \n     IV authorizes judicial review of federal agency compliance \n     with Title II provisions.The remainder of this report \n     summarizes the requirements set forth in Titles I, II, and IV \n     of the act.\n\n\n                Review of Proposed Legislation (Title I)\n\n        Referred to as ``Legislative Accountability and Reform,'' \n     Title I establishes requirements for committees and the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to study and report on the \n     magnitude and impact of mandates in proposed legislation. \n     Title I also creates point-of-order procedures through which \n     these requirements can be enforced and the consideration of \n     measures containing unfunded intergovernmental mandates can \n     be blocked.\n       Information Requirements. Under UMRA, congressional \n     committees have the initial responsibility to identify \n     Federal mandates in measures under consideration. Committees \n     may have CBO study whether proposed legislation could have a \n     significant budgetary impact on nonfederal governments, or a \n     financial or employment impact on the private sector. Also, \n     committee chairs and ranking minority members may have CBO \n     study any legislation containing a Federal mandate.\n        When an authorizing committee orders reported a public \n     bill or joint resolution containing a Federal mandate, it \n     must provide the measure to CBO. CBO must report an estimate \n     of mandate costs to the committee. The office must prepare \n     full quantitative estimates if costs are estimated to exceed \n     $50\n\n[[Page S13896]]\n\n     million (for intergovernmental mandates) or $100 million (for \n     private sector mandates), adjusted for inflation, in any of \n     the first five fiscal years the legislation would be in \n     effect. Below these thresholds, CBO must prepare brief \n     statements of cost estimates. For each reported measure with \n     costs over the thresholds, CBO is to submit to the committee \n     an estimate of:\n        The direct costs of Federal mandates contained in it, or \n     in any necessary implementing regulations; and\n        The amount of new or existing Federal funding the \n     legislation authorizes to pay these costs.\n        If reported legislation authorizes appropriations to meet \n     the estimated costs of an intergovernmental mandate, the CBO \n     report must include a statement on the new budget authority \n     needed, for up to 10 year, to meet these costs. For a measure \n     that reauthorizes or amends an existing statute, the direct \n     costs of any mandate it contains are to be measured by the \n     projected increase over those costs required by existing law. \n     The calculation of increased costs must include any projected \n     decrease in existing Federal aid that provides assistance \n     to nonfederal entities.\n       The committee is to include the CBO estimate in its report \n     or publish it in the Congressional Record. The committee's \n     report on the measure must also:\n       Identify the direct costs to the entities that must carry \n     out the mandate;\n       Assess likely costs and benefits;\n       Describe how the mandate affects the ``competitive \n     balance'' between the public and private sectors; and\n       State the extent to which the legislation would preempt \n     state, local, or tribal law, and explain the effect of any \n     preemption.\n       These requirements apply to all proposed mandates, both \n     intergovernmental and private sector. For intergovernmental \n     mandates alone, the committee is to describe in its report \n     the extent to which the legislation authorizes federal \n     funding for the direct costs, and details on whether and how \n     funding is to be provided.\n       Points of Order for Initial Consideration. UMRA establishes \n     that when any measure is taken up for consideration in either \n     house, a point of order may be raised that the measure \n     contains unfunded intergovernmental mandates exceeding the \n     $50 million threshold. This point of order applies to the \n     measure as reported, including, for example, a committee \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute. For any measure \n     reported from committee, a point of order against \n     consideration may also be raised for either intergovernmental \n     or private sector mandates, if the committee has not \n     published a CBO estimate, or if CBO reported that no \n     reasonable estimate was feasible.\n       In the Senate, if either point of order is sustained, the \n     measure may not be considered. Otherwise, in ruling on the \n     point of order, the chair is to consult with the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs on whether the measure contains \n     intergovernmental mandates. Also, the unfunded costs of the \n     mandate are to be determined based on estimates by the \n     Committee on the Budget (which may draw for this purpose on \n     the CBO estimate).\n       In the House, the chair does not rule on these points of \n     order. Instead, under UMRA, the House votes on whether to \n     consider the measure despite the point of order. To prevent \n     dilatory use of the point of order, the chair need not put \n     the question of consideration to a vote unless the point of \n     order identifies specific language containing the unfunded \n     mandate. Also, if several points of order could be raised \n     against the same measure, House practices under UMRA afford \n     means for all to be consolidated in a single vote. If the \n     Committee on Rules proposes a special rule for considering \n     the measure that waives the point of order, UMRA subjects the \n     special rule itself to a point of order, which is disposed of \n     by the same mechanism.\n       These procedures are intended to insure that the House, \n     like the Senate, will always have an opportunity to \n     determine, by vote, whether to consider a measure that may \n     contain an unfunded mandate. Also, if the House votes to \n     consider a measure in spite of the point of order, UMRA \n     protects the ability of Members to offer amendments in the \n     Committee of the Whole to strike out unfunded \n     intergovernmental mandates, unless the special rule \n     specifically prohibits such amendments.\n       Additional Enforcement Mechanisms. A point of order under \n     the UMRA mechanism may be raised not only against initial \n     consideration of a bill or resolution, but also against \n     consideration of an amendment, conference report, or motion \n     (e.g., a motion to recommit with instructions or a motion to \n     concur in an amendment of the other house with an amendment) \n     that would cause the unfunded costs of intergovernmental \n     mandates in a measure to exceed the specified threshold. UMRA \n     does not require amendments or motions to be accompanied by \n     CBO mandate cost estimates, but a Senator may request CBO to \n     estimate the costs of mandates in an amendment he or she \n     prepares. If an amended bill or resolution or a conference \n     report contains a new mandate or other new increases in \n     mandate costs, the conferees are to request a supplemental \n     estimate, which CBO is to attempt to provide. UMRA requires \n     no publication of these supplemental estimates.\n       The UMRA points of order are not applicable against \n     consideration of appropriations bills. However, if an \n     appropriation bill contains legislative provisions that would \n     create unfunded intergovernmental mandates in excess of the \n     threshold, the UMRA point of order may be raised against the \n     provisions themselves. In the Senate, if this point of order \n     is sustained, the provisions are stricken from the bill.\n       Exclusions and Exemptions. Legislation pertinent to the \n     following subject matters remains exempt from the UMRA point-\n     of-order procedures: individual constitutional rights, \n     discrimination prohibitions, auditing compliance, \n     emergency assistance requested by nonfederal government \n     officials, national security or treaty obligations, \n     emergencies as designated by the President and the \n     Congress, and Social Security. The provisions of Title I \n     pertinent to Federal agencies (for example, the \n     requirement that agencies determine whether sufficient \n     appropriations exist to provide for proposed costs) do not \n     apply to federal regulatory agencies. Also, provisions \n     establishing conditions of Federal assistance or duties \n     stemming from participation in voluntary Federal programs \n     are not mandates.\n\n\n            assessment of mandates in regulations (title ii)\n\n       Title II requires that Federal agencies prepare written \n     statements that identify costs and benefits of a Federal \n     mandate to be imposed through the rulemaking process. The \n     requirement applies to regulatory actions determined to \n     result in costs of $100 million or more in any one year. The \n     written assessments to be prepared by Federal agencies must \n     identify the law authorizing the rule, anticipated costs and \n     benefits, the share of costs to be borne by the Federal \n     Government, and the disproportionate costs on individual \n     regions or components of the private sector. Assessments must \n     also include estimates of the effect on the national economy, \n     descriptions of consultations with nonfederal government \n     officials, and a summary of the evaluation of comments and \n     concerns obtained throughout the promulgation process. \n     Impacts of ``any regulatory requirements'' on small \n     governments must be identified; notice must be given to those \n     governments; and technical assistance must be provided. Also, \n     UMRA requires that Federal agencies consider ``a reasonable \n     number'' of policy options and select the most cost-effective \n     or least burdensome alternative.\n\n\n                       judicial review (title iv)\n\n       The requirements in Title II pertaining to the preparation \n     of a mandate assessment statement and notification of impact \n     on small governments remain subject to judicial review. A \n     Federal court may compel a Federal agency to comply with \n     these requirements, but such a court order cannot be used to \n     stay or invalidate the rule.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Then there are some other steps that have to be taken. \nNot only is it defined as an unfunded intergovernmental mandate, there \nhas to be a certain threshold of spending, $50 million adjusted by \ninflation, which today would be $64 million.\n  So the Congressional Budget Office has given its opinion on that, and \nthey have said yes; it is an unfunded Federal mandate. So what the \nlegislation provides, and what I plan to do when this comes up on \nThursday, is as the law says. That it is not in order for this body to \npass an unfunded Federal intergovernmental mandate, and that a point of \norder may be raised against its consideration. I plan to raise such a \npoint of order.\n  The point of order may be waived by this body by 51 votes, which I \nhope it does not do because this body told the world in 1995 that it \nwas through with this business of unfunded mandates. But we will see. \nWe will see.\n  I will agree that it sounds good to say we are not going to tax \nInternet access. I will agree that there may be a Federal interest in \nnot taxing Internet access. I agreed when the issue first came up in \nthe 1990s that while the Internet was still an infant, maybe for the \nfirst 3 years a moratorium would be in order.\n  But if we think it is so important, then we should pay the bill. We \nshould pay the bill. We should not fall into this bad habit that \nexisted before the Republican revolution of 1994 of assuming that just \nbecause we were elected to come to Washington, suddenly we are all wise \nand that the Governors and mayors and legislators are not quite as wise \nand that we, therefore, ought to tell them what to do and that we ought \nto restrict their ability to do it or not do it based upon what their \ntax base is. Let them do their job and we can do ours.\n  I want to end where I began. It is a privilege to be in this body. \nOne of the greatest privileges is to stand up here and say, on the \nfloor of the Senate, something I used to think about as Governor time \nafter time: Why are those Senators and those Congressmen assuming I \ncan't do my job here? Why are they passing rules and then telling me to \npay the bill, especially when they are printing money and we are \nbalancing budgets?\n  I think we should draw the line. If we really believe that a ban on \nInternet access in a segment of the telecommunications interest is so \noverwhelmingly in the Federal interest, then let's pass an unfunded \nFederal\n\n[[Page S13897]]\n\nmandate reimbursement bill and send a check to the States, to \nMinneapolis, Nashville, Tennessee, every year, for whatever the cost of \nthat is.\n  I remind my colleagues, and I intend to do so as long as I am here, \nthat they were right in 1994 about the Contract With America. They were \nright when they stood on the steps of the Capitol and promised: No more \nunfunded mandates. If we break our contract, throw us out. And they \nwere right when they passed by 91 to 9 in 1995 the ban against unfunded \nFederal mandates.\n  I hope the 64 of my colleagues who are still here remember that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, to comment on the legislation the \nSenator from Tennessee was discussing, I have some concerns about the \nInternet and taxation of the Internet. I listened with great interest \nto the arguments the Senator from Tennessee has made. I think they are \nvery good arguments.\n  I have another argument that causes pause for me and that is that, \nwhile, yes, everybody is talking about all the commerce that occurs on \nthe Internet, there is a lot more depravity that occurs on the Internet \nthan commerce.\n  The top Web sites visited on the Internet are Web sites having to do \nwith pornography. As the father of six young kids, I have to tell you \nthat continuing in the sense of subsidies by not allowing taxation \nconcerns me. It seems to me these Internet IFCs and others who are so \nconcerned in coming up here saying don't tax us and don't hold back the \npotential of the Internet seem to be a heck of a lot less concerned \nabout the impact of culture debasement that is going on as a result of \nthe exposure of pornography and violence and what I would consider \nantisocial activities that occur with frequency and that are even more \nharmfully imposed on young kids in popup ads, through e-mail and spam \nand through other vehicles that these lecherous members of the \ninternational community--it is not just in this country--use to try to \nsell their wares on the Internet.\n  I am speaking not as a Senator but as a father who is very disturbed \nabout people coming here and crying, Don't tax us, at the same time \nthey are doing very little to stop what I think is one of the scourges \nthat attacks the decency of our society.\n  As someone who has been a supporter of the moratorium, as someone who \nhas never seen a tax cut I didn't like and never saw a tax I did like, \nI don't like what I see going on on the Internet. This whole comment \nabout it is commerce, if you look at where the commerce is, it is not \nthe kind of commerce I think we want to be supporting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13897-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13897-S13898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will not take any more time than \nnecessary because I know the Senator from Nevada, who has spent \ncountless hours here on the floor, would like to leave, like so many \nothers here, but I raise again the issue of H.R. 7.\n  H.R. 7 is the charitable giving act, the CARE Act, that passed both \nthe House and the Senate. I want to state again for the Record this is \na bipartisan bill. This is a bill that was worked out in the Senate by \nSenator Lieberman and myself. I worked with Senators Durbin and Reed of \nRhode Island and others when they brought up concerns about this bill. \nWe wanted to have a balanced bill, a bipartisan bill, one that could \npass here with the kind of support for a bill which encourages \ncharitable giving and individual development accounts for low-income \nindividuals and social services block grants to help those \norganizations that meet the needs of people who are hurting in our \ncommunities. It should pass on a bipartisan basis. We were able to work \nthat out. I even worked out something I wasn't sure I could work out, \nwhich is a commitment to try to work with the House to make sure they \ndidn't include language which Senator Reed of Rhode Island requested \nand Senator Durbin requested; that it not include language having to do \nwith faith-based organizations and expanding charitable choice.\n  Charitable choice is a provision in the law that was passed here \nthree times and signed by the President three times to allow faith-\nbased organizations to participate in social service funding programs \nthe Federal Government implements. I said I would do my best to make \nsure that it was not in the House bill, and lo and behold, I was \nsuccessful and it is not in the House bill. It is not a conferenceable \nissue. The biggest concern by about government and faith being mixed \ntogether is not in this bill. It is not a conferenceable item. There is \nno poison pill that can come back in this bill because it is not a \nconferenceable item. I kept the commitment on a bipartisan basis to \nkeep this bill clean.\n\n  There are controversies between the House and Senate bills. The \nSenate bill is paid for. We have offsets in the bill. The House bill is \nnot paid for. The social services block grant, which is a very \nimportant component of this mix, is in the Senate bill and is not in \nthe House bill. There are a variety of different tax provisions that \nare treated differently in the House and Senate.\n  This isn't going to necessarily be an easy conference. There will \nhave to be a lot of give and take, as in most conferences, when we are \ndealing with taxes and spending.\n  I think it is important that we sit down with the House and have a \nconference. I will tell you that I fully anticipate needing and wanting \nsupport from my colleagues here in the Senate on both sides of the \naisle to get this bill done. We are going to need that kind of leverage \nto go to the House and be able to work out this compromise. I will need \ntheir support because I want to pass this bill. It is a bill that is on \nthe President's agenda. This is one of the bills he really wants to \naccomplish.\n  I fully anticipate that if this bill comes back in the form that is \nnot acceptable to the minority, there is probably very little chance \nthey are going to give us the votes to be able to pass it.\n  To be crass about it, we have to work together. But to be honest \nabout it, I want to work together. I think I have shown throughout the \nentire legislative history of this act that I have done so, and I have \ndone so honestly and straightforwardly. We have produced a bill that \nhas gotten overwhelming support. Actually a higher percentage of \nDemocrats voted for this bill than Republicans.\n  I am concerned. I understand the minority has said and the Senator \nfrom Nevada has said with frequency they are not being treated fairly \nin conference. I understand that, and I don't necessarily want to get \ninto that issue. They may have points, and they can take them up with \nthe committee chairman and with the leader. I am talking about this \nbill. This is the first bill on which this charge has been leveled. We \nare not going to conference on this bill because of those reasons. I \nthink it is not the best bill to pass. There may be other bills that \nhave not been worked on on a bipartisan basis. But the prospect of \nhaving a bipartisan compromise is less likely than with this bill. This \nis a bill that helps poor kids. This is a bill that is going to provide \nsocial services funding to make sure people do not go homeless or \nhungry. This is a bill that we need to finish before the holiday \nseason.\n  It makes no sense for us to use this vehicle as sort of the line in \nthe sand that the minority is going to draw to say we are not happy \nwith the way we are being treated. Fine. You are not happy with the way \nyou are being treated, I understand that. But you certainly haven't \nbeen treated poorly on this bill. On this bill, you have been treated, \nI hope, as good as on any bill that has been passed through this \nChamber. I anticipate that continuing. I anticipate--in fact, solicit \nand expect--full participation from Senator Baucus, with whom I have \ntalked on this issue, and Senator Grassley, with whom I have talked. \nSenator Grassley came to the floor yesterday and said he anticipates, \nas he does with most if not all of the conferences he has been involved \nwith, working on a bipartisan basis as is the custom in the Finance \nCommittee.\n\n  I say in conclusion, before I enter into the unanimous consent \nrequest, to please look at what this bill has the potential of doing--2 \nbillion pounds of food and more will be donated as a result of this \nbill passing over the next few years, 2 billion pounds of food that \nwill be donated so people in America who are hungry and people who will \nbe homeless will no longer be hungry and homeless; people who want \nquality education will have a better opportunity\n\n[[Page S13898]]\n\nto get that education; people who want to save and invest and start a \nsmall business or to go to school or to buy a home will have the \nopportunity to do that which they don't have today.\n  That is what this is all about. This should not be about \ndisappointment over past practices. I hope we can focus on the goodness \nof this legislation and not take something that is accepted by both \nsides as a desirable and good thing for those who need help in America \nand use that as the point of departure of a new idea that says we are \nnot going to go to conference because we have not been treated fairly.\n  I just hope in searching yourselves on the minority side that you \nwill grab another piece of legislation and use that as the starting \npoint. I don't think this legislation deserves it. I don't think the \npeople who will benefit from it deserve it. I hope after further \nconsideration we can have a reasonable conference and get this \naccomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13898-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13898-S13899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 7\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 7, the charitable giving \nbill. I further ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken; the Snowe amendment and the Grassley-Baucus \namendment at the desk be agreed to en bloc; that the substitute \namendment, which is the text of S. 476, the Senate-passed version of \nthe charitable giving bill, as amended by the Snowe-Grassley-Baucus \namendments, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read the third \ntime and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nfurther, that the Senate insist upon its amendments and request a \nconference with the House; and, lastly, that the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees with the ratio of 3 to 2 and any statements relating \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I object. To say going to a conference is the only way to \nlegislate between the House and the Senate is not a valid argument. I \npersonally favor this legislation. I voted for it and I think it is \nsomething that is needed. As everyone knows, I am not a cheerleader for \nthe budget but I think this legislation is important for our country. I \ncommend the President for moving forward on it.\n  As I indicated, saying that a conference is the only way to legislate \nbetween the House and the Senate is not a valid argument. Almost every \nday, both Houses pass legislation for which a conference is not \nappointed.\n  Last night, the Senate passed the Fallen Patriots Tax Relief Act. We \namended this piece of legislation, then sent it back to the House \nwithout asking for a conference.\n  We have done this lots of times. Here are bills that are now public \nlaws. These pieces of legislation are now public laws. That is how they \nbecame public laws. We bundled them up, sent them to the House. On some \nof the occasions they accepted them, other times they sent them back \nwith an amendment with which we dealt. H.R. 1584, H.R. 1298, H.R. 733, \nH.R. 13, H.R. 3146, H.R. 659 are extremely important pieces of \nlegislation that we thought at the time were important. They are now \nlaw.\n  It is my understanding that the Senate, because of the majority, is \nnot willing to deal with the CARE Act, as has been so forcibly \nannounced here today by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I suggest and, in the form of a unanimous consent, request that we \ntreat this legislation as we treat lots of legislation: Send it to the \nHouse; they might accept it. If they do not, they can send it back with \nan amendment or amendments on it. They may like our bill. They may want \nto amend our bill. They may want to send it back. At least we should \ngive the House this opportunity rather than holding the bill hostage.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 7, which is at the desk; that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken; the Snowe amendment and the Grassley-\nBaucus amendment be agreed to en bloc; that the substitute amendment, \nwhich is the text of S. 476, as passed by the Senate and amended by the \nSnowe and Grassley-Baucus amendments, be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard of the request of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Nevada has suggested we \nsimply amend the bill we passed earlier this year and send it back to \nthe House.\n  I respectfully suggest to the Senator from Nevada, through the \nPresiding Officer, we did that once. We passed this bill once and sent \nit to the House, and the House struck that bill and sent their version \nback. I don't think we gain anything by then taking the very bill they \nrejected and sending it back to them and expecting them to pass it. \nThat is what I would call ping-pong. That is back and forth with nobody \ngetting anywhere. That is why there are things such as conferences, \nwhere we actually sit down and try to work out differences.\n  I am not familiar with the list of bills the Senator from Nevada laid \nout when he said we have been able to accomplish passing of legislation \nwithout having a conference. And that is true. We are going to do one, \nhopefully, tomorrow, the Syria Accountability Act. But the changes \nbetween what the House wanted and what the Senate wanted were very \nminor changes, a couple of finding changes and basically a change in \nthe waiver status. We talked to the House and they were willing to \naccept it because they were minor changes. That is an important piece \nof legislation. I would consider that a major piece of legislation, but \nit is not a particularly complex piece of legislation as we are dealing \nwith--with a lot of the moving parts--as we have in the charitable \ngiving act, the CARE Act. This is a rather complex piece of \nlegislation, complex tax law.\n  There is a whole issue of $10 billion that is not paid for in one \nbill, in the House bill, and it is paid for here. How are we going to \ntell what, if anything, will be paid for and how much; what vehicles, \nwhat measures, we will use to offset this? This is a very complicated \nissue that has not just one--as the Syria Accountability bill--issue. \nThere are many issues. There is the food donation provision. There are \nprovisions on IRA rollovers. There are provisions on people who do not \nfile long forms, people who do not itemize being able to deduct \ncharitable giving. That is just three of probably a dozen issues we are \ngoing to have to deal with on this bill.\n  To suggest we can do so by ping-ponging the bill back and forth and \ntrying to find some equilibrium--I suggest the people who have been in \nthis Chamber for a lot longer than I have would recognize that a bill \nof this complexity does not get handled that way.\n  I hope we will recognize we have an obligation to try to finish this \nlegislation. I hope we can do so in a way that will do well by the \nSenate. We have my commitment, the commitment of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, to be inclusive, not just because that is the way we have \ndone it but that is the way we need to do it in order to be successful \nand get a compromise that will pass both the House and the Senate.\n  I respectfully have to object to the unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from Nevada and hope we can continue to think of this and work \non it and get to a successful conclusion.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as my friend has said, we do not want to \nprolong this, but I make another suggestion that may work. That would \nbe that the two amendments, the Snowe amendment which deals with the \nchild tax credit and the other amendment that deals with tax extenders, \nreally have nothing to do with charitable choice. I suggest those be \ntaken from the bill and the pure bill that passed the Senate be sent to \nthe House forthwith. That may make it easier for the House to deal \nwith--I would hope so--and the other issues which I know are very \nimportant, we could deal with at a later time.\n  That is just a suggestion. I am not asking unanimous consent; I am \njust saying to my friend who has devoted so much of his time to this \nbill, which I know he believes in very sincerely, that might be a \nsuggestion that is taken up with the majority leader and\n\n[[Page S13899]]\n\nothers who have some persuasive powers in their ability to move this \nmatter.\n  For clarification with respect to my colloguy with the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, we are ready to send to the House all three \ncomponents of the Senate amendment to H.R. 7, the version of S. 476, as \npassed the Senate, the Snowe-Lincoln child tax credit piece, and the \nGrassley-Baucus tax extenders piece. We are supportive of all these \nitems. In order to help the Senator from Pennsylvania, we are ready to \nsend all of them over separately, and of course, we are ready to go \nforward sending them over bundled just without the necessity of a \nconference.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate the suggestion of the Senator from Nevada.\n  I suggest in response to that, again, this bill is the bill that has \nalready passed the Senate. We already sent it over to the House. The \nHouse has already looked at the Senate bill and said: We have a better \nway. We do not want to have offsets to this bill; we do not want to \nhave social service block grant funds; we do not want to have as \ngenerous a food donation provision. We want to have some other \nprovisions that you do not have in this legislation. They sent it back.\n  Now when you have such differing viewpoints on how to solve this \nproblem, the tradition in this body, and out of necessity, is to \nconvene a conference and get that done. Sending different versions back \nand forth does not make progress and, with all due respect, I do not \nbelieve will solve the problem.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13899-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of Pfc. Anthony \nD'Agostino, of Waterbury, CT, who was killed in Iraq this past Sunday. \nHe was just 4 days short of his 21st birthday.\n  Private D'Agostino was part of the U.S. Army's 16th Signal Brigade, \nbased in Fort Hood, TX. He was one of 15 soldiers killed when a missile \nstruck a Chinook helicopter that was carrying American troops to \nBaghdad International Airport for a trip home to spend 2 weeks with \nfamily and friends. I join all of America in mourning each and every \none of these brave soldiers, and in praying for the recovery of the 20 \nsoldiers who were injured in the attack.\n  It's a sad fact of war that as the death toll mounts, the daily \ncasualty reports can become almost routine. But each time I read the \nstory of a Connecticut soldier who has perished overseas and this is \nthe sixth such story in this war I'm reminded of how many lives are \ntouched by every single man or woman who makes the ultimate sacrifice \nso that all of us can live in peace, freedom, and security.\n  Anthony was a true Connecticut son, spending virtually his entire \nlife in our State. He grew up in Middlebury, attending Middlebury \nElementary School and Memorial Middle School, and in 2001, he graduated \nfrom the W.F. Kaynor Regional Vocational-Technical High School, \nspecializing in electricity. After graduating, he lived in Waterbury \nuntil he enlisted in the Army 2 years ago.\n  Men and women across America who make the decision to join our Armed \nForces do so for a variety of reasons. For Anthony D'Agostino, it was a \ndecision that was forged in the fire of the attacks of September 11, \n2001. Like so many Americans, in the aftermath of those terrible \nattacks, Anthony decided that he wanted to contribute something to his \ncountry. Tragically, he and his family would ultimately make the most \npainful contribution of all.\n  Joining the Army was a homecoming of sorts for Anthony. He was born \nin Georgia while his father Steven was stationed at Fort Benning. And \nwhen it was time for Anthony to enter basic training 19 years later, he \nreturned to the same base where his father once served.\n  Those who knew Anthony say he had a tremendous work ethic, whether \nthat meant giving his all on high school sports teams, or mowing his \ngrandparents' lawn with a stand-up mower. Even while he was in Iraq, he \nasked his family to send over Spanish books so he could use what little \nspare time he had to better himself. He had dreams of returning home \nand attending the U.S. Military Academy in West Point.\n  Anthony D'Agostino knew he was facing serious danger when he left for \nIraq 8 months ago. But it was a danger he was prepared and proud to \naccept as a soldier in the United States Army.\n  Anthony had a sense of responsibility, dedication, and commitment \nwell beyond his years. And Connecticut will never forget him.\n  My heart goes out to Anthony's father Steven, his mother Deb, his \nstepfather Paul, and to his entire family.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to pay \ntribute to a truly remarkable individual whom I have had the privilege \nto know and work with, U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Patrick Sargent. Pat \nSargent worked in my office for a year as a Congressional Fellow in \n2001. He is a helicopter pilot and is currently the commander of the \n421st Medical Battalion stationed in Germany. Lt. Colonel Sargent \nserved in Operation Iraqi Freedom and is scheduled to return for a \nsecond deployment shortly.\n  This past August, Pat received the General Benjamin O. Davis Jr. \nAward by the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., an organization dedicated to \npreserving the amazing legacy of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen. This \naward is conferred annually to ``a field grade officer who has \nexhibited outstanding performance in both professional and community \nservice.'' It is the highest award given by this organization, and this \nyear was the first time this honor has gone to an Army aviator.\n  Who were the Tuskegee Airmen? They were a group of American heroes \nwho every American should know about. In recent years we have seen a \nsurge in interest in World War II and the experiences of American \nservicemen who served in the worst conflict humanity has ever seen. \nMovies such as ``Saving Private Ryan'' have done much to illustrate the \nsacrifices of our World War II veterans, and we have begun construction \nof a World War II Memorial on the Mall here in Washington. All of these \nveterans sacrificed for the allied cause against totalitarianism.\n  But the Tuskegee Airmen faced an additional struggle on top of the \nwar against the Axis Powers. They fought prejudice here at home, and \nthey succeeded on both fronts. During World War II, the U.S. military \nbegan an experiment to determine whether African Americans were capable \nof successfully piloting combat aircraft. This ``experiment'' \neventually evolved into the 332nd Fighter Group, consisting of four \nsquadrons of fighter aircraft piloted entirely by African Americans. \nUnder the command of then-Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, the 332nd flew 200 \nmissions escorting U.S. bombers over Europe. It was the only U.S. \nfighter group of the war that never lost a bomber under its protection.\n  Pat Sargent is a modern-day descendent of those brave men. As I \nnoted, he commands the 421st Medical Battalion. With 45 Black Hawk \nhelicopters, 40 ground ambulances, 118 wheeled vehicles, and 591 \npersonnel, it is the U.S. Army's largest medical evacuation battalion. \nServing in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Pat became the first African \nAmerican to command a medical evacuation battalion in combat in our \nNation's history. The motto of the 421st is ``Anyone, Anywhere, \nAnytime.'' It is only three words in length, but it is telling \nnonetheless. The battalion's men and women are deployed to sites across \nthe globe, including the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Africa. They \nperform medical evacuations not only for American soldiers but for \nallied troops, wounded enemy soldiers that have been taken prisoner, \nand injured civilians. In Iraq, helicopters\n\n[[Page S13900]]\n\nfrom the 421st on MedEvac missions are routinely fired upon. Think \nabout that. The crews of these helicopters, these amazing men and \nwomen, are being shot at as they strive to bring life-saving medical \ncare to Iraqis and Americans alike. Anyone, anywhere, anytime.\n\n  Colonel Donald Gagliano, commander of the 30th Medical Brigade of \nwhich the 421st Battalion is a part, commented on Pat's recent award: \n``This exemplary senior Army aviator is the quintessence of excellence. \nHe is the epitome of the Tuskegee Airman, and his character, demeanor \nand professionalism are reflective and very similar to that of Gen. \nBenjamin O. Davis Jr.''\n  I cannot adequately pay tribute to Pat without also discussing his \nwife Sherry. She is also a Lt. Colonel in the Army and is currently \nstationed in Iraq as part of the 1st Armored Division. She and Pat met \nearly in their careers, while they were both in training to become \nofficers. Together they have a lovely daughter Samantha. Sherry has \nbeen in Iraq since the spring and is not scheduled to leave until \nspring, 2004.\n  As Pat and Sherry have found themselves both deployed overseas, they \nhave had to make arrangements for someone to look after Samantha. \nFortunately, Sherry's parents have been able to relocate to Germany \nindefinitely to help care for Samantha.\n  The Sargent family illustrates the fact that when our Nation calls \nupon our military to deploy, be it for peacekeeping, for combat, or for \nanother type of operation, the sacrifices are borne by more than just \nthose individuals who wear a military uniform.\n  September 11, 2001, was, of course, a tragic day for all Americans. \nSome of us were touched more directly than others. As I stated, Pat \nSargent spent 2001 as a Congressional Fellow in my Washington, DC \noffice. During that time, his wife was working at the Pentagon. On that \nterrible morning of September 11, Sherry Sargent learned that two \naircraft had struck the World Trade Center. She walked down the hall to \nan office with a TV in order to learn what was going on. At 9:40 AM, \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the portion of the Pentagon \nwhere Sherry Sargent's office was located. She lost many friends and \ncoworkers that day. Had she been in her office she would almost \ncertainly have been among those who were killed or injured. As soon as \nhe learned of the attack on the Pentagon, Pat rushed to the scene to \nlocate Sherry. He caught the last shuttle bus from Capitol Hill to the \nPentagon before the area was sealed off. After a long search on the \ncrowded Pentagon grounds, Pat was able to find Sherry and learn that \nshe had, fortunately, survived the attack.\n  In an e-mail to my office a few months ago, Pat noted that ``High-\ntech weapons played a part in the success of this war; but, it was won \nwith human capital--America's sons and daughters.'' He expressed his \nthanks for all that Congress has done to support our men and women in \nuniform.\n  Well, Pat, I want to thank you--and all of our dedicated service men \nand women--for your sacrifices, your commitment, and your bravery. And \nI congratulate you for your receipt of the General Benjamin O. Davis \nAward, an honor you richly deserve.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to honor a Virginia \nsoldier, Captain John Robert Teal, who was tragically killed in action \nin Iraq on Thursday, October 23, 2003. I want to express gratitude, on \nbehalf of the Senate, for his service to our Nation. The American \npeople, I am certain, join me in expressing their prayers and \ncompassion to his family.\n  Captain John Robert Teal followed his father Joseph, a retired \nfirefighter, into public service. He understood the importance of his \npresent assignment and despite the personal risk, wanted to serve the \nUnited States and the people of Iraq during this critical time.\n  A medical officer attached to the Army's 4th Infantry Division, he \nwas a dedicated and compassionate young man who, according to news \nreports, spent his final days helping sick children.\n  Captain Teal leaves behind his father Joseph; his mother Emmie; and \nhis sister Elizabeth Kormanyos.\n  His parents, Joseph and Emmie, with whom I have had the pleasure to \nspeak, albeit under tragic circumstances, are brave souls who have \nsacrificed so much for this Nation. We owe them and the other families \nwho have lost their loved ones a debt of gratitude.\n  John was a 1990 graduate of Benedictine High School. Upon graduating \nfrom Benedictine, he attended the Virginia Military Institute from \nwhich he graduated in 1994 and received a commission in the United \nStates Army.\n  He was an exceptional young man with a bright future in front of him. \nHe was known as a wonderful person and according to friends, the kind \nof individual that no one could say anything bad about. The \nCommonwealth of Virginia and the entire Nation shall mourn his loss.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Daniel Bader, a fellow Nebraskan and staff sergeant in the United \nStates Army. Staff Sergeant Bader was killed on November 2 near \nFallujah, Iraq when the Chinook helicopter he was aboard was shot down. \nStaff Sergeant Bader was one of 16 soldiers killed and 20 wounded en \nroute to the United States for 2 weeks of leave. He was 28 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Bader served in the 3rd Armored Cavalry, Tiger \nSquadron, based on Fort Carson, CO. He was deployed to Iraq on April 4, \n2003.\n  A York, NE native, Staff Sergeant Bader was a dedicated soldier who \nwas committed to his family and country. He joined the military shortly \nafter graduating from high school and ``absolutely loved'' his career \nin the Army, said his wife Tiffany. In addition to his wife, Staff \nSergeant Bader leaves behind a 14-month-old daughter, Taryn Makenzie. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them both at this difficult time.\n   Staff Sergeant Bader and thousands of brave American service men and \nwomen confront danger every day in Iraq--their tremendous risks and \nsacrifices must never be taken for granted. For his service, bravery, \nand sacrifice, I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in \nhonoring Staff Sergeant Daniel Bader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13900-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MOVING TO SUSPEND PARAGRAPH 4 OF RULE XVI\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Mr. Robert Maricle, a bisexual man from Salinas, CA, disappeared from \nhis community on December 14, 2002. Almost 4 months later, his body was \ndiscovered in a shallow grave. Mr. Maricle was reported missing after \ngoing out for drinks with three strangers. Police allege that those \nthree strangers are responsible for Mr. Maricle's death, and committed \nthe crime in part because of his sexual orientation.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13900-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13900-S13901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

This report meets the requirements for Senate scorekeeping \nof Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent Resolution on the \nBudget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2004 \nbudget through October 31, 2003. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2004 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95, as adjusted.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $14.6 billion in budget authority and by $14 billion in \noutlays in 2004. Current level for revenues is $108 million above the \nbudget resolution in 2004.\n  Since my last report, dated October 14, 2003, the Congress has \ncleared and the President has signed the following acts that changed \nbudget authority, outlays, or revenues for 2004: An act making further \ncontinuing appropriations for fiscal year 2004 (H.J.

Mr. President, available for brief debate and confirmation \nvotes by the United States Senate are several of the President's \njudicial nominees. Roger W. Titus of Maryland was unanimously reported \nby the Judiciary Committee to the Senate more than a month ago. This \nnomination was greeted with universal acclaim. He is an outstanding \nMaryland lawyer and leader of the bar, an active litigator in Maryland \nfor over 37 years, a partner at the Venable law firm, a former \nPresident of the Maryland Bar Association. He has also served as an \nAdjunct Professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. Mr. Titus \nearned a unanimous ``Well-Qualified'' rating from the ABA, and an AV \nrating from Martindale-Hubbell.\n  In 2001, Mr. Titus was honored with The Baltimore Daily Record's \nfirst Leadership in the Law Award, which recognizes members of the \nlegal community for their devotion to the betterment of the profession \nand their communities. In 1999, Mr. Titus received the Century of \nService Award from the Montgomery County Bar Association for his \noutstanding contributions to the legal profession and community during \nthe twentieth century.\n  According to an article in The Baltimore Sun, Mr. Titus was \napparently in the running to be nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In light of his stellar \nqualifications, deep roots in his legal community and ability to garner \nthe bipartisan support of his elected officials he would have been a \nconsensus choice for this important appellate seat. This White House \nwas not interested in appointing a consensus nominee to the Fourth \nCircuit. It wanted to pick a fight. So it did. It nominated someone \nfrom Virginia to the Maryland vacancy on the Fourth Circuit and \nprecipitated a controversy. There are reportedly 30,000 practicing \nattorneys in the State of Maryland. Instead of nominating a well \nqualified Marylander like Mr. Titus to Judge Murnahan's vacant seat on \nthe Fourth Circuit, the President selected a controversial nominee with \nvery little litigation experience from another jurisdiction. That \nnominee, Claude Allen, received a partial ``not qualified'' rating by \nthe American Bar Association and his selection has engendered \nsignificant opposition from concerned citizens groups and \nunderstandably from the Maryland Senators.\n  It is regrettable that this President has again chosen the course of \nconfrontation and conflict for his appellate court nominations. Mr. \nTitus, with his many years of litigation experience and his well-\ndeserved reputation as a leader among lawyers in Maryland is the type \nof person who should have been chosen for Judge Murnahan's vacant seat \non the Fourth Circuit. His nomination stands in sharp contrast to the \ninexperienced and divisive candidates chosen by the White House for too \nmany appellate judgeships in what appear to be an effort to pack the \ncourt with ideological nominees and tilt these courts.\n  There is no doubt that Mr. Titus is a Republican, yet he has the \nsupport of both of his home-state Senators, both Democrats, and has \nearned the unanimous support of the Members of the Judiciary Committee. \nI would have supported his nomination to the Fourth Circuit vacancy. I \ncontinue to support his nomination to the District Court. The month-\nlong delay the Republican leadership has already caused in his \nconsideration for the District Court position reminds me of their delay \nin scheduling a vote on the Fifth Circuit nomination of Judge Edward \nPrado earlier this year. Then they did not want to allow Democratic \nSenators to vote for a conservative Hispanic nominee when they were \ntrying desperately to mischaracterize Senate Democrats as anti-\nHispanic. Now it seems we are making too much progress on too many \njudicial nominees to suit their partisan interests in mischaracterizing \nSenate Democrats as blockading Bush nominee's to the courts.\n  The truth is that in less than three years' time, President George W. \nBush exceeded the number of judicial nominees confirmed for President \nReagan in all four years of his first term in office. Senate Democrats \nhave cooperated so that this President already surpassed the record of \nthe President Republicans acknowledge to be the ``all time champ'' at \nappointing Federal judges. Since July, 2001, despite the fact that the \nSenate majority has shifted twice, a total of 167 judicial nominations \nhave already been confirmed, including 29 circuit court appointments. \nOne hundred judges were confirmed in the 17 months of the Democratic \nSenate majority and the Senate has proceeded to confirm another 67 \njudges during the comparative time of the Republican majority for a \ntotal of 167 judges.\n  One would think that the White House and the Republicans in the \nSenate would be heralding this landmark. One would think they would be \ncongratulating themselves for putting more lifetime appointed judges on \nthe federal bench than President Reagan did in his entire first term \nand doing it in three-quarters the time. One would think that they \nwould be building upon that success by scheduling prompt votes on \nnoncontroversial nominees like Roger Titus. But Republicans have a \ndifferent partisan message and this truth is not consistent with their \nefforts to mislead the American people into thinking that Democrats \nhave obstructed judicial nominations. That is why the President chose \nto criticize the Senate from the Rose Garden again last week and in \ncampaign appearances around the country last weekend and earlier this \nweek rather than work with us and recognize what we can accomplish \ntogether.\n  Not only has this President been accorded more Senate confirmations \nthan President Reagan achieved during his entire first term, but he has \nalso achieved more confirmations this year than in any of the six years \nthat Republicans controlled the Senate when President Clinton was in \noffice. Not once was President Clinton allowed 67 confirmations in a \nyear when Republicans controlled the pace of confirmations. Despite the \nhigh numbers of vacancies and availability of highly qualified \nnominees, Republicans never cooperated with President Clinton to the \nextent Senate Democrats have. President Bush has appointed \nmore lifetime circuit and district court judges in 10 months this year \nthan President Clinton was allowed in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or \n2000.\n\n  Last year alone, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 72 of President Bush's judicial nominees and was savagely \nattacked nonetheless. With a little cooperation from Senate Republicans \nwe might match that record before adjournment this year, as well.\n  In fact, President Bush has now already appointed more judges in his \nthird year in office than in the third year of the last five \npresidential terms, including the most recent term when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and President Clinton was leading the country to \nhistoric economic achievements. That year, in 1999, Republicans allowed \nonly 34 judicial nominees of President Clinton's to be confirmed all \nyear, including only 7 circuit court nominees. Those are close to the \naverage totals for the six years 1995-2000 when a Republican Senate \nmajority was determining how quickly to consider the judicial nominees \nof a Democratic President. By contrast, the Senate this year has \nalready confirmed 67 judicial nominees, including 12 circuit court \nnominees, almost double the totals for 1999.\n  We have worked hard and bent over backwards cooperating with a very \nuncooperative White House and Senate Republican majority. In spite of \ntheir false charges and partisanship, Senate Democrats have continued \nworking to make progress in filling judicial vacancies. According to \nthe website of the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee we \nhave reduced the number of judicial vacancies below 40. Had the Senate \nDemocratic majority not acted last year to authorize between 15 and 20 \nadditional judgeships, the vacancies total might well be in the low \n20's. After inheriting 110 vacancies when the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reorganized under Democratic control in 2001, I helped move \nthrough and confirm 100 of the President's judicial nominees in just 17 \nmonths. Through hard work we have proceeded to reduce vacancies to the \nlowest number in 13 years and arguably the lowest level since President \nReagan. There are more Federal judges on the bench today than at any \ntime in American history. These facts stand in stark contrast to the \nfalse partisan rhetoric that\n\n[[Page S13903]]\n\ndemonize the Senate for having blocked all of this President's judicial \nnominations. The reality is that the Senate is proceeding at a record \npace and achieving record numbers.\n  Also on the Senate calendar awaiting action is the nomination of Gary \nSharpe of New York. That nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee two weeks ago. He remains on the Senate Executive \nCalendar because the Senate Republican leadership has no interest in \nscheduling this noncontroversial judicial nominee for a vote.\n  Also on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting scheduling of debate \nand a final vote are the nominations of Judge Dora Irizarry of New York \nand J. Leon Holmes of Arkansas. Mr. Holmes nomination has been awaiting \ndebate since May, more than six months. Let us be clear. There is no \nDemocratic hold preventing debate and votes on either of these \nnominees. They merit debate. There was debate in the Judiciary \nCommittee. There should be debate on the Senate floor. And then the \nSenate will vote.\n  Indeed, following the debate on Judge Irizarry more than half of the \nRepublican Members indicated that they opposed the President's \nnomination. I respect and understand their concern. I have had similar \nconcerns about a number of this President's nominees. More than two \ndozen have received ratings or partial ratings of ``not qualified'' by \nthe ABA. Some, like Timothy Hardiman of Pennsylvania and Dora Irizarry \nof New York, do not have the support of their local bar association \neither.\n  Unlike the way Republicans treated the nomination of Justice Ronnie \nWhite of Missouri when he was ambushed on the Senate floor and defeated \nin a party line vote. I do not expect that to happen with Judge \nIrizarry. Those with concerns have been forthright in coming forward. I \ndo not expect Democratic Senators to do what Republicans did in 1999 to \nRonnie White when they switch their votes and voted lockstep in a \npartisan effort to defeat his nomination on the floor.\n  With these four nominees for additional lifetime appointments to the \nfederal bench, the Senate has the chance to reach a total of more than \n170 judicial confirmations for the President in less than three years. \nMaybe that is why the Republican leadership has chosen not to go \nforward. Could it be that they do not want the American people to know \nthat we have cooperating in filing 170 judicial vacancies in less than \nthree years? That would not be consistent with the talking points the \nAdministration is peddling to friendly media outlets all over town and \naround the country.\n  Over the last several days more than 200 people have been killed or \nwounded in Baghdad. The number of unemployed Americans has been at or \nnear levels not seen in years, poverty is on the rise in our country, \nand the current Administration seems intent on saddling our children \nand grandchildren with trillions in deficits and debt. For the first \ntime in a dozen years, charitable giving in this country is down.\n  While negative indicators are spiking, the Republican leadership of \nthe Congress would rather demonize Democrats, engage in name calling \nand charge obstruction where the facts are historic levels of \ncooperation. The Senate wheel-spinning exercises involving the most \ncontroversial judicial nominees and the Republican leadership's \ninsistence on unsuccessful cloture votes are unhelpful to the Senate or \nthe courts. Despite the heated rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, \nwe have made progress on judicial vacancies when and where the \nAdministration has been willing to work with the Senate.\n  Only a handful of the President's most extreme and controversial \nnominations have been denied consent by the Senate. Up to today only \nfour have failed. That record is in stark contrast to the more than 60 \njudicial nominees from President Clinton who were blocked by a \nRepublican-led Senate. One-hundred sixty-seven to four, but as I have \nsaid, that total could be 170 to four if the Republican leadership \nwould work with us and schedule voted and debate on the four nominees I \nhave identified.\n  But despite this record of progress, made possible only through good \nfaith effort by Democrats on behalf of a Republican President's \nnominees, and in the wake of the years of unfairness shown the nominees \nof a Democratic President, the Republican leadership has decided to use \npartisan plays out of its playbook as this year winds down.\n  Instead of putting partisanship aside and bridging our differences \nfor the sake of accomplishing what we can for the American people, we \nare asked to participate in a transparently political exercise \ninitiated by a President. With respect to his extreme judicial \nnominations, President George W. Bush is the most divisive President in \nmodern times. Through his extreme judicial nominations, he is dividing \nthe American people and he is dividing the Senate. Far from a uniter, \non judicial nominations he has chosen to be a divider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13903-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN RECOGNITION OF TWO U.S. ARMY CIVILIANS RECEIVING AWARDS FOR \n                  OUTSTANDING SERVICE ON CAPITOL HILL\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to bring my colleagues' \nattention to two civil servants whose exemplary work in the U.S. Senate \nArmy Congressional Liaison office has been formally recognized by the \nU.S. Army at a recent awards ceremony. For many years, my constituents \nhave benefitted from their outstanding, timely, and compassionate \nservice. It is my honor to also recognize their service, and to bring \nto your attention the nature of the awards given to Ms. Margaret Tyler \nand Mrs. Trulesta Pauling.\n  Ms. Tyler and Mrs. Pauling, both assigned to the Office of the Chief, \nLegislative Liaison, Headquarters, Department of the Army, were \nrecognized in a ceremony held on October 23, 2003.\n  Ms. Tyler and Mrs. Pauling, Congressional Liaison Representatives for \nthe\n  U.S. Army's Senate Liaison Division on Capitol Hill, were each \nawarded the Army Staff Identification Badge and the Commander's Award \nfor Civilian Service for exceptionally meritorious achievement. Both \nwomen were recognized for their work in support of Operations Enduring \nFreedom and Iraqi Freedom.\n  According to the award citations, Ms. Tyler and Mrs. Pauling managed \ntheir increased caseload with calm, grace, professionalism, and \nefficiency. Their commitment to excellence and devotion to duty has had \na significant and\n  long-lasting, positive impact on soldiers and their families.\n  The Commander's Award for Civilian Service is the fourth highest \nDepartment of the Army award for civilians. All Army civilian employees \nare eligible for consideration to receive this award for service, \nachievement and heroism. It is equivalent to the Army Commendation \nMedal awarded to soldiers.\n  The Army Staff Identification Badge was first proposed by General \nDouglas MacArthur while he was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, on \nDecember 28, 1931. The award of the lapel button for civilian personnel \nin the grade of GS-11 and higher was authorized in 1982 and is a symbol \nof exemplary service.\n  Once again, I extend my sincere congratulations to these two \noutstanding civil servants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13903-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF JOSEPH TIMOTHY KELLIHER\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord a speech by University of Chicago Law Professor Geoffrey Stone \non ``Civil Liberties in Wartime,'' delivered at the annual luncheon of \nthe Chicago Council of Lawyers on July 23. Professor Stone thoughtfully \nreviews America's history of restricting civil liberties during times \nof war and our subsequent regret for those decisions. His speech \ninvites reflection by the Members of this Senate as we debate important \nissues of national security and civil rights, and counsels us to \n``value not only [our] own liberties but the liberties of others . . . \nand to have the wisdom to know excess when it exists and the courage to \npreserve liberty when it is imperiled.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Civil Liberties in Wartime\n\n                         (By Geoffrey R. Stone)\n\n       We live in perilous times. This is true along several \n     dimensions, but I focus this afternoon on only one of them: \n     Civil Liberties in Wartime. Or, more precisely, how are we, \n     as a nation, responding to the threat of terrorism?\n       Since September 11th, our government, in our name, has \n     secretly arrested and detained more than a thousand non-\n     citizens; it has deported hundreds of non-citizens in secret \n     proceedings; it has eviscerated long-standing Justice \n     Department restrictions on FBI surveillance of political and \n     religious activities; it has vastly expanded the power of \n     federal officials to invade the privacy of our libraries and \n     our e-mails; it has incarcerated an American citizen, \n     arrested on American soil, for almost a year--incommunicado, \n     with no access to a lawyer, and with no effective judicial \n     review; it has sharply restricted the protections of the \n     Freedom of Information Act; it has proposed a TIPS program to \n     encourage American citizens to spy on one another; it has \n     laid the groundwork for a Department of Defense Total \n     Information Awareness program to enable the government to \n     engage in massive and unprecedented data collection on \n     American citizens; it has detained a thousand prisoners of \n     war in Guantanamo Bay in cynical disregard of the laws of \n     war; and it has established military tribunals without due \n     process protections. We live in perilous times.\n       Of course, we have lived in perilous times before. What I \n     want to discuss this afternoon is how we have responded to \n     such peril in the past, what we can learn from those \n     experiences, and what our responsibilities are as lawyers.\n       I have a simple thesis: In time of war, we respond too \n     harshly in our restriction of civil liberties, and then, \n     later, regret our behavior. To test this thesis, I will \n     review, very briefly, our experiences in 1798, the Civil War, \n     World War I, World War II, the Cold War and the Viet Nam War. \n     I will then offer some observations.\n       To begin, at the beginning. In 1798, the United States \n     found itself embroiled in a European war that then raged \n     between France and England. A bitter political and \n     philosophical debate divided the Federalists, who favored the \n     English, and the Republicans, who favored the French. The \n     Federalists were then in power, and the administration of \n     President John Adams initiated thus a dramatic series of \n     defense measures that brought the United States into a state \n     of undeclared war with France.\n       The Republicans fiercely opposed these measures, leading \n     the Federalists to accuse them of disloyalty. President \n     Adams, for example, declared that the Republicans ``would \n     sink the glory of our country and prostrate her liberties at \n     the feet of France.'' Against this backdrop, the Federalists \n     enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. The Alien Act \n     empowered the President to deport any non-citizen he judged \n     to be dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States. \n     The Act accorded the non-citizen no right to a hearing, no \n     right to present evidence and no right to judicial review.\n       The Sedition Act prohibited criticism of the government, \n     the Congress or the President, with the intent to bring them \n     into contempt or disrepute. The Act was vigorously enforced, \n     but only against supporters of the Republican Party. \n     Prosecutions were brought against every Republican newspaper \n     and against the most vocal critics of the Adams \n     administration.\n       The Sedition Act expired on the last day of Adams's term of \n     office. The new President, Thomas Jefferson, promptly \n     pardoned all those who had been convicted under the Act, and \n     forty years later Congress repaid all the fines. The Sedition \n     Act was a critical factor in the demise of the Federalist \n     Party, and the Supreme Court has never missed an opportunity \n     in the years since to remind us that the Sedition Act of 1798 \n     has been judged unconstitutional in the ``court of history.''\n       During the Civil War, the nation faced its most serious \n     challenge. There were sharply divided loyalties, fluid \n     military and political boundaries, easy opportunities for \n     espionage and sabotage, and more than 600,000 combat \n     fatalities. In such circumstances, and in the face of \n     widespread and often bitter opposition to the war, the draft \n     and the Emancipation Proclamation, President Lincoln had to \n     balance the conflicting interests of military necessity and \n     individual liberty.\n       During the course of the Civil War, Lincoln suspended the \n     writ of habeas corpus on eight separate occasions. The most \n     extreme of these suspensions, which applied throughout the \n     entire nation, declared that ``all persons . . . guilty of \n     any disloyal practice . . . shall be subject to court \n     martial.'' Under this authority, military officers arrested \n     and imprisoned 38,000 civilians, with no judicial proceedings \n     and no judicial review.\n       In 1866, a year after the war ended, the Supreme Court \n     ruled in Ex parte Milligan that Lincoln had exceeded his \n     constitutional authority, holding that the President could \n     not constitutionally suspend the writ of habeas corpus, even \n     in time of war, if the ordinary civil courts were open and \n     functioning.\n       The story of civil liberties during World War I is, in many \n     ways, even more disturbing. When the United States entered \n     the war in April 1917, there was strong opposition to both \n     the war and the draft. Many citizens vehemently argued that \n     our goal was not to ``make the world safe for democracy,'' \n     but to protect the investments of the wealthy, and that this \n     cause was not worth the life of one American soldier, let \n     alone ten or hundreds of thousands.\n       President Wilson had little patience for such dissent. He \n     warned that disloyalty ``must be crushed out'' of existence \n     and that disloyalty ``was . . . not a subject on which there \n     was room for . . . debate.'' Disloyal individuals, he \n     explained, ``had sacrificed their right to civil \n     liberties.''\n       Shortly after the United States entered the war, Congress \n     enacted the Espionage Act of 1917. Although the Act was not \n     directed at dissent generally, aggressive federal prosecutors \n     and compliant Federal judges soon transformed it into a \n     blanket prohibition of seditious utterance. The \n     administration's intent in this regard was made evident in \n     November 1917 when Attorney General Charles Gregory, \n     referring to war dissenters, declared: ``May God have mercy \n     on them, for they need expect none from an outraged people \n     and an avenging government.''\n       In fact, the government worked hard to create an ``outraged \n     people.'' Because there had been no direct attack on the \n     United States, and no direct threat to our national security, \n     the Wilson administration had to generate a sense of urgency \n     and anger in order to exhort Americans to enlist, to \n     contribute money and to make the many sacrifices that war \n     demands. To this end, Wilson established the Committee for \n     Public Information, which produced a flood of inflammatory \n     and often misleading pamphlets, news releases, speeches, \n     editorials and motion pictures, all designed to instill a \n     hatred of all things German and of all persons whose \n     ``loyalty'' might be open to doubt.\n       During World War I, the government prosecuted more than \n     2,000 dissenters for opposing the war or the draft, and in an \n     atmosphere of fear, hysteria and clamor, most judges were \n     quick to mete out severe punishment--often 10 to 20 years in \n     prison--to those deemed disloyal. The result was the \n     suppression all genuine debate about the merits, the morality \n     and the progress of the war.\n       But even this was not enough. A year later, Congress \n     enacted the Sedition Act of 1918, which expressly prohibited \n     any disloyal, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form \n     of government, the Constitution, the flag, the uniform, or \n     the military forces of the United States. Even the Armistice \n     didn't bring this era to a close, for the Russian Revolution \n     triggered a period of intense public paranoia in the United \n     States, known to us today as the ``Red Scare'' of 1919-1920. \n     Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer unleashed a horde of \n     undercover agents to infiltrate so-called radical \n     organizations, and in a period of only two months the \n     government arrested more than 5,000 American citizens and \n     summarily deported more than a thousand aliens on \n     ``suspicion'' of radicalism.\n       The story of the Supreme Court in this era is too familiar, \n     and too painful, to bear repeating in detail. In a series of \n     decisions in 1919 and 1920--most notably Schenck, Debs, and \n     Abrams--the Court consistently upheld the convictions of \n     individuals who had agitated against the war and the draft--\n     individuals as obscure as Mollie Steimer, a twenty-year-old \n     Russian-Jewish emigre who had thrown anti-war leaftlets in \n     Yiddish from a rooftop on the lower East Side of New York, \n     and as prominent as Eugene Debs, who had received almost a \n     million votes in 1912 as the Socialist Party candidate for \n     President.\n       As Harry Kalven has observed, these decisions left no doubt \n     of the Court's position: ``While the nation is at war, \n     serious, abrasive criticism . . . is beyond constitutional \n     protection.'' These decisions, he added, ``are dismal \n     evidence of the degree to which the mood of society can \n     penetrate judicial chambers.'' The Court's performance was \n     ``simply wretched.''\n       In December 1920, after all the dust had settled, Congress \n     quietly repealed the Sedition Act of 1918. Between 1919 and \n     1923, the government released from prison every individual \n     who had been convicted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts. \n     A decade later, President Roosevelt granted amnesty to all of \n     these individuals, restoring their full political and civil \n     rights. Over the next half-century, the Supreme Court \n     overruled every one of its World War I decisions, holding in \n     effect that every one of the individuals who\n\n[[Page S13905]]\n\n     had been imprisoned or deported in this era for his or her \n     dissent had been punished for speech that should have been \n     protected by the First Amendment.\n       On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Two \n     months later, on February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt \n     signed Executive Order 9066, which authorized the Army to \n     ``designate military areas'' from which ``any persons may be \n     excluded.'' Although the words ``Japanese'' or ``Japanese \n     American'' never appeared in the Order, it was understood to \n     apply only to persons of Japanese ancestry.\n       Over the next eight months, 120,000 individuals of Japanese \n     descent were forced to leave their homes in California, \n     Washington, Oregon and Arizona. Two-thirds of these \n     individuals were American citizens, representing almost 90% \n     of all Japanese-Americans. No charges were brought against \n     these individuals; there were no hearings; they did not know \n     where they were going, how long they would be detained, what \n     conditions they would face, or what fate would await them. \n     Many families lost everything.\n       On the orders of military police, these individuals were \n     transported to one of ten internment camps, which were \n     located in isolated areas in wind-swept deserts or vast swamp \n     lands. Men, women and children were placed in overcrowded \n     rooms with no furniture other than cots. They found \n     themselves surrounded by barbed wire and military police, and \n     there they remained for three years.\n       In Korematsu v. United States, decided in 1944, the Supreme \n     Court, in a six-to- three decision, upheld the President's \n     action. The Court offered the following explanation:\n       We are not unmindful of the hardships imposed upon a large \n     group of American citizens. But hardships are part of war, \n     and war is an aggregation of hardships. Korematsu was not \n     excluded from the West Coast because of hostility to his \n     race, but because the military authorities decided that the \n     urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of \n     Japanese ancestry be segregated from the area. We cannot--by \n     availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight--say \n     that these actions were unjustified.\n       In 1980, a congressional commission declared that the \n     Japanese internment had been based, not on considerations of \n     military necessity, but on crass racial prejudice and \n     political expediency. Eight years later, President Reagan \n     signed the Civil Liberties Restoration Act of 1988, which \n     offered an official Presidential apology and reparations to \n     each of the Japanese-American internees who had suffered \n     discrimination, loss of liberty, loss of property and \n     personal humiliation because of the actions of the United \n     States government.\n       As World War II drew to a close, the nation moved almost \n     seamlessly into the Cold War. As the glow of our wartime \n     alliance with the Soviet Union evaporated, President Truman \n     came under increasing attack from a coalition of Southern \n     Democrats and anti-New Deal Republicans who sought to exploit \n     fears of Communist aggression. As House Republican leader Joe \n     Martin declared on the eve of the 1946 election, ``the people \n     will choose tomorrow `between communism and the preservation \n     of our American life.' '' The next day, the Democrats lost 56 \n     seats in the House.\n       Thereafter, the issue of loyalty became a shuttlecock of \n     party politics. By 1948, President Truman was boasting on the \n     stump that he had imposed on the federal civil service the \n     most extreme loyalty program in the entire ``Free World,'' \n     and he had. But there were limits to Truman's anti-communism. \n     In 1950, he vetoed the McCarren Act, which required the \n     registration of all Communists. Truman explained that the Act \n     was the product of ``public hysteria'' and would lead to \n     ``witch hunts.'' Congress passed the Act over Truman's veto.\n       In 1954, Congress enacted the Communist Control Act, which \n     stripped the Communist Party of ``all rights, privileges, and \n     immunities.'' Only one Senator, Estes Kefauver, dared to vote \n     against it. Irving Howe lamented ``this Congressional \n     stampede to . . . trample . . . liberty in the name of \n     destroying its enemy.''\n       Hysteria over the Red Menace swept the nation and produced \n     a wide-range of federal, state and local restrictions on free \n     expression and free association, including extensive loyalty \n     programs for government employees; emergency detention plans \n     for alleged ``subversives''; abusive legislative \n     investigations designed to punish by exposure; public and \n     private blacklists of those alleged ``pinkos'' who had been \n     ``exposed''; and criminal prosecution of the leaders and \n     members of the Communist Party of the United States.\n       The Supreme Court's response was mixed. The key decision, \n     however, was Dennis v. United States, which involved the \n     direct prosecution under the Smith Act of the leaders of the \n     American Communist Party. In a six-to-two decision, the Court \n     held in 1951 that the defendants could constitutionally be \n     punished for their speech under the clear and present danger \n     test even though the Court readily conceded that the danger \n     was neither clear nor present. It was a memorable stroke of \n     judicial legerdemain.\n       Over the next several years, the Court upheld far-reaching \n     legislative investigations of ``subversive'' organizations \n     and individuals and the exclusion of members of the Communist \n     Party from the bar, the ballot and public employment. In so \n     doing, the Court clearly put its stamp of approval on an \n     array of actions we look back on today as models of \n     McCarthyism.\n       In the Vietnam War, as in the Civil War and World War I, \n     there was substantial opposition both to the war and the \n     draft. Lest we forget the stresses of those years, let me \n     quote briefly from Theodore White's eyewitness account of the \n     1968 Democratic Convention:\n       The demonstrators chant ``Peace Now'' as they approach the \n     Chicago police picket-lines. Then, like a fist, comes a \n     hurtling column of police. It is a scene from the Russian \n     revolution. Gas grenades explode. Demonstrators kneel and \n     begin singing America the Beautiful. Clubs come down. ``The \n     Whole World is Watching.''\n       Over the next several years, the nation entered a period of \n     intense and often violent struggle. After President Nixon \n     announced the American ``incursion'' into Cambodia, student \n     strikes closed a hundred campuses. Governor Ronald Reagan, \n     asked about campus militants, replied: ``If it takes a \n     bloodbath, let's get it over with.'' On May 4, National \n     Guardsmen at Kent State University responded to taunts and \n     rocks by firing their M-1 rifles into a crowd of students, \n     killing four and wounding nine others. Protests and strikes \n     exploded at more than twelve hundred of the nation's colleges \n     and universities. Thirty ROTC buildings were burned or bombed \n     in the first week of May. The National Guard was mobilized in \n     sixteen states. As Henry Kissinger put it later, ``The very \n     fabric of government was falling apart.''\n       Despite all this, there was no systematic effort during the \n     Vietnam War to prosecute individuals for their opposition to \n     the war. As Todd Gitlin has rightly observed, in comparison \n     to World War I, ``the repression of the late sixties and \n     early seventies was mild.'' There are many reasons for this, \n     including, of course, the rather compelling fact that most of \n     the dissenters in this era were the sons and daughters of the \n     middle class, and thus could not so easily be targeted as the \n     ``other.'' But the courts, and especially the Supreme Court, \n     played a key role in this period. In 1969, the Court, in \n     Brandenburg, overruled Dennis and held that even advocacy of \n     unlawful conduct cannot be punished unless it is likely to \n     incite ``imminent lawless action.'' The Court had come a long \n     way in the fifty years since World War I.\n       But the Court did not rest there. In other decisions it \n     held that the Georgia House of Representatives could not deny \n     Julian Bond his seat because of his express opposition to the \n     draft; that a public university could not deny recognition to \n     the SDS because it advocated a philosophy of violence; that \n     the government could not conduct national security wiretaps \n     without prior judicial approval; and, of course, that the \n     government could not constitutionally enjoin the publication \n     of the Pentagon Papers, even though the Defense Department \n     claimed that publication would endanger national security.\n       This is not to say that the government did not find other \n     ways to impede dissent. The most significant of these was the \n     FBI's extensive effort to ``expose, disrupt and otherwise \n     neutralize'' allegedly ``subversive'' organizations, ranging \n     from civil rights groups to the various factions of the anti-\n     war movement. In this COINTELPRO operation, the FBI compiled \n     political dossiers on more than half-a-million Americans.\n       When these activities came to light they were sharply \n     condemned by congressional committees, and Attorney General \n     Edward Levi declared such practices incompatible with our \n     national values. In 1976, he instituted a series of \n     guidelines designed to restrict the political surveillance \n     activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       What can we learn from this history? I would like to offer \n     at least a dozen observations. But time limits me to only \n     six.\n       First, we have a long and unfortunate history of \n     overreacting to the perceived dangers of wartime. Time after \n     time, we have allowed our fears to get the better of us.\n       Second, it is often argued that given the sacrifices we ask \n     citizens (especially soldiers) to make in time of war, it is \n     small price to ask others to surrender some of their \n     peacetime freedoms to help the war effort. As the Supreme \n     Court argued in Korematsu, ``hardships are part of war, and \n     war is an aggregation of hardships.''\n       This is a seductive, but dangerous argument. To fight a war \n     successfully, it is necessary for soldiers to risk their \n     lives. But it is not necessarily ``necessary'' for others to \n     surrender their freedoms. That necessity must be convincingly \n     demonstrated, not merely presumed. And this is especially \n     true when, as is usually the case, the individuals whose \n     rights are sacrificed are not those who make the laws, but \n     minorities, dissidents and non-citizens. In those \n     circumstances, ``we'' are making a decision to sacrifice \n     ``their'' rights--not a very prudent way to balance the \n     competing interests.\n       Third, the Supreme Court matters. It's often said that \n     presidents do what they please in wartime. Attorney General \n     Biddle once observed that ``the Constitution has not greatly \n     bothered any wartime President,'' and Chief Justice Rehnquist \n     recently argued that ``there is no reason to think that \n     future wartime presidents will act differently from Lincoln, \n     Wilson, or Roosevelt.''\n       In fact, however, the record is more complex than this \n     suggests. Although presidents may think of themselves as \n     bound more by political than by constitutional constraints in \n     time of war, the two are linked. Lincoln did not propose a \n     Sedition Act, Wilson rejected calls to suspend the writ of \n     habeas\n\n[[Page S13906]]\n\n     corpus and Bush has not advocated loyalty oaths. The fact is \n     that even during wartime, presidents have not attempted to \n     restrict civil liberties in the face of settled Supreme Court \n     precedent. Although presidents often will push the envelope \n     where the law is unclear, they do not defy established \n     constitutional doctrine.\n       Fourth, it is often said that the Supreme Court will not \n     decide a case against the government on an issue of military \n     security during a period of national emergency. The decisions \n     most often cited in support of this proposition are, of \n     course, Korematsu and Dennis. In fact, however, there are \n     many counter-examples.\n       During World War II, the Court upheld the constitutional \n     rights of American fascists in a series of criminal \n     prosecutions and denaturalization proceedings, effectively \n     putting a halt to government efforts to punish such \n     individuals. During the Cold War, the Court rejected \n     President Truman's effort to seize the steel industry and \n     eventually helped put an end to the era of McCarthyism. And \n     during Vietnam, the Court repeatedly rejected national \n     security claims by the Executive. So, although it is true \n     that the Court tends to be wary not to ``hinder'' an ongoing \n     war unnecessarily, it is also true that the Court has a \n     significant record of fulfilling its constitutional \n     responsibility to protect individual liberties--even in time \n     of war.\n       Fifth, it is useful to note the circumstances that have \n     tended to produce these abuses. They invariably arise out of \n     the combination of a national perception of peril and a \n     concerted campaign by government to promote a sense of \n     national hysteria by exaggeration, manipulation and \n     distortion. The goal of the government in fostering such \n     public anxiety may be either to make it easier for it to gain \n     public acceptance of the measures it seeks to impose or to \n     gain partisan political advantage, or, of course, both. If \n     all that sounds familiar, it should.\n       Finally, I want to say a word about our responsibilities as \n     lawyers. In each of these episodes, lawyers played an \n     important role, both in imposing the restrictions on civil \n     liberties, and in opposing them. At the moment, I'm more \n     interested in the latter. Albert Gallatin offered brilliant \n     arguments in opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts. \n     Gilbert Roe defended the free speech rights of dissenters in \n     World War I. Professors Ernst Freund and Felix Frankfurter, \n     of the Chicago and Harvard law schools, played a critical \n     role in illuminating the civil rights violations of the Red \n     Scare and bringing that era to a close. Francis Biddle played \n     a courageous role within the Roosevelt administration during \n     World War II in opposing both the Japanese internment and the \n     prosecution of American fascists. Joseph Welsch, a Boston \n     lawyer, publicly humiliated Senator Joseph McCarthy hearings \n     with his blistering questions ``Have you no sense of decency, \n     sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?'' And a \n     group of lawyers here in Chicago from such organizations as \n     BPI, the ACLU, the Better Government Association and the \n     Alliance to End Repression helped put an end to end \n     COINTELPRO and to the City of Chicago's Red Squad during the \n     Vietnam War.\n       Now, to return to our own perilous time. The threat of \n     terrorism is real, and we expect our government to protect \n     us. But we have seen disturbing, and all-too-familiar, \n     patterns in our government's activities. To strike the right \n     balance in our time, we need judges who will stand fast \n     against the furies of the age; members of the academy who \n     will help us see ourselves clearly; an informed and tolerant \n     public who will value not only their own liberties, but the \n     liberties of others; and, perhaps most of all, lawyers with \n     the wisdom to know excess when it exists and the courage to \n     preserve liberty when it is imperiled.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13906-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CABOT TEACHES THE VALUE OF DAIRY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to commend one of Vermont's most successful farmer-owned \nenterprises, the world-renowned Cabot Creamery of Vermont. Since its \nfounding by 94 farmers in 1919, Cabot's farm families have preserved \nthe heritage and proud agrarian traditions of the State of Vermont and \nour great nation.\n  Cabot has an 80-year history of doing what they do best, making the \nworld's best cheddar cheeses. When Cabot Creamery earned the title of \n``Best Cheddar in the World'' and ``Best Flavored Cheddar'' at the 22nd \nBiennial World Championship Cheese Contest, they did it as a team, \nsteeped in family traditions and pride and with skill and expertise \nthat has been painstakingly built over the generations. That same \nteamwork goes into every aspect of their business.\n  In 1992 Cabot joined forces with another New England farmer-owned \ncooperative, Agri-Mark Inc, to open new markets for Vermont dairy \nfarmers. Today the cheese made by Cabot is from the milk of more than \n1,450 Agri-Mark dairy producers throughout Vermont, New England and New \nYork. The Cabot Creamery of Vermont combines the best aspects of both \ncooperative farming and value-added agricultural products to provide \nmuch-needed price premiums to Vermont dairy farmers.\n  The dairy farmers of Cabot Creamery also have a rich history in \nteaching their communities about the importance of dairy to the economy \nand to nutrition and health. Dairy products pack a powerful punch of \neight additional nutrients needed for stronger bones and healthier \nbodies. Throughout New England, Cabot runs the Ag in the Classroom \nprogram, an educational program for elementary students that teaches \nthem about agriculture. This program has been recognized by educators \nas a valuable resource that helps connect students to their \ncommunities, raises self-awareness and fosters creativity.\n  Cabot also has sponsored Calcium Crisis Challenge, a program for \n6th--8th-grade students that helps them learn about calcium and its \nimportance for stronger bones and healthy living. The program brings \nattention to the fact that more than 75 percent of Americans do not get \nenough calcium in their diets.\n  This week in Washington, D.C., the dairy farmers of Cabot Creamery \nwill host a reception to highlight the national 3-A-Day education \ncampaign. The 3-A-Day campaign is simple--three servings of milk, \ncheese or yogurt is a deliciously easy way to help build stronger bones \nand better bodies. Most Americans are eating only half the daily \nrecommended servings of dairy each day, resulting in loss of bone \ndensity and in related health problems. Eating 3-A-Day of dairy is an \neasy and wholesome way for families to help meet their calcium needs.\n  Along with Senator Jeffords and Congressman Sanders, I am pleased to \njoin Cabot's involvement with this important education campaign to \nhighlight the importance of dairy products to healthy diets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13906-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I am honored and humbled to serve \nas the Senate Co-chairman of the 2003 National Bible Week. During the \nweek of November 23 to 30, communities and churches across this Nation \nwill participate in this fine tradition by reading and reflecting on \nthe teachings of the Bible. I am very proud to be a part of this \ncelebration and I salute the National Bible Association for its \nsponsorship of this annual event.\n  The very first National Bible Week was organized in 1941, during \nWorld War II. Organizers created National Bible Week as a way to extend \ncomfort and hope to our Nation during a troubled time. Today, in 2003, \nwe are facing another troubled time when our country could use a dose \nof comfort and hope. The Holy Bible is our richest source of great \ninspiration, spiritual guidance and strength. That is why so many refer \nto it as their solid rock, their foundation.\n  During National Bible Week, I encourage everyone to read the Bible \nevery day and to pledge to continue to turn to this Good Book \nthroughout the year. Reflecting on Scripture, using the Bible's stories \nto teach our children right from wrong, and seeking to appreciate the \nliterature on which our great United States of America was established \nis always time well spent. I congratulate the National Bible \nAssociation for its dedication to the celebration of God's word, the \nHoly Bible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13906-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13906-S13907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:44 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land to Lander County, Nevada, and the Secretary of the \nInterior to convey certain land to Eureka County, Nevada, for continued \nuse as cemeteries; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce this bill, which will address important public land issues \nin central Nevada. As you might know, the Federal Government controls \nover 87 percent of the State of Nevada. Many of our colleagues from \nother States may not understand the challenge this presents for \ncommunities in Nevada. With such large tracts of land controlled by \nFederal agencies, it can be difficult to acquire land for vital efforts \nin both the public and private sectors.\n  This bill will convey two cemeteries in central Nevada from the \nFederal Government back to the local communities. Kingston is a small \ntown in southern Lander County, and Beowawe is a small community \nlocated in Eureka County. The original communities were home to \npioneers and immigrants who settled the isolated high desert valleys of \nthe central Great Basin. In the late 1800s, the pioneers established \nand managed the cemeteries to provide a final resting place for friends \nand family. Much of the original Kingston Cemetery is on land now \nmanaged by the U.S. Forest Service. The Maiden's Grave Cemetery in \nBeowawe is on land currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Under current law, these agencies must sell the cemeteries back to \nthe communities at fair market value. However, these historic \ncemeteries were established prior to the designation of the Federal \nagencies that now manage them. For over 2 years, Lander County has been \nrequired to lease much of the Kingston Cemetery from the Forest \nService. The Forest Service recently sold approximately 1 acre to the \nTown of Kingston, but this conveyance did not allow for the protection \nof uncharted graves, nor for the implementation of the community's \noriginal site plan.\n  It is wrong that Beowawe and Kingston should have to buy or lease \ncemeteries from Federal agencies that did not even exist at the time \nthat the cemeteries were established. Our bill simply provides for the \nconveyance of the Maiden's Grave Cemetery to Eureka County and the \nbalance of the original location of the Kingston Cemetery to Lander \nCounty, Nevada.\n  The conveyances provided by this bill will benefit our Federal land \nmanagers as well as our rural communities. The disposal of these small \nparcels of land for no consideration will benefit the United States \nbecause they represent isolated tracts that prove difficult to manage \nfor public use. I sincerely hope that my colleagues recognize the \nbenefit that the conveyances would provide to the local communities and \nsupport passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONVEYANCE TO LANDER COUNTY, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the \n     late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Kingston Cemetery'' in \n     Kingston, Nevada, predates incorporation of the land within \n     the jurisdiction of the Forest Service on which the cemetery \n     is situated;\n       (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through \n     local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the \n     permitting process of the Federal agency;\n       (3) in accordance with Public Law 85-569 (commonly known as \n     the ``Townsite Act'') (16 U.S.C. 478a), the Forest Service \n     has conveyed to the Town of Kingston 1.25 acres of the land \n     on which historic gravesites have been identified; and\n       (4) to ensure that all areas that may have unmarked \n     gravesites are included, and to ensure the availability of \n     adequate gravesite space in future years, an additional \n     parcel consisting of approximately 8.75 acres should be \n     conveyed to the county so as to include the total amount of \n     the acreage included in the original permit issued by the \n     Forest Service for the cemetery.\n       (b) Conveyance on Condition Subsequent.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights and the condition stated in subsection (e), \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the \n     Forest Service (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary''), not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, shall convey to Lander County, Nevada \n     (referred to in this section as the ``county''), for no \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in\n\n[[Page S13911]]\n\n     and to the parcel of land described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (b) is the parcel of National Forest System land \n     (including any improvements on the land) known as ``Kingston \n     Cemetery'', consisting of approximately 10 acres and more \n     particularly described as SW1/4SE1/4SE1/4 of section 36, T. \n     16N., R. 43E., Mount Diablo Meridian.\n       (d) Easement.--At the time of the conveyance under \n     subsection (b), subject to subsection (e)(2), the Secretary \n     shall grant the county an easement allowing access for \n     persons desiring to visit the cemetery and other cemetery \n     purposes over Forest Development Road #20307B, \n     notwithstanding any future closing of the road for other use.\n       (e) Condition on Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The county (including its successors) \n     shall continue the use of the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (b) as a cemetery.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary, after notice to the \n     county and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that \n     the county has used or permitted the use of the parcel for \n     any purpose other than the purpose specified in paragraph \n     (1), and the county fails to discontinue that use--\n       (A) title to the parcel shall revert to the Secretary, to \n     be administered by the Secretary; and\n       (B) the easement granted to the county under subsection (d) \n     shall be revoked.\n       (3) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the application of \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) if the Secretary \n     determines that a waiver would be in the best interests of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE TO EUREKA COUNTY, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the \n     late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Maiden's Grave \n     Cemetery'' in Beowawe, Nevada, predates incorporation of the \n     land within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management \n     on which the cemetery is situated; and\n       (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through \n     local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the \n     permitting process of the Federal agency.\n       (b) Conveyance on Condition Subsequent.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights and the condition stated in subsection (e), \n     the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of \n     the Bureau of Land Management (referred to in this section as \n     the ``Secretary''), not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, shall convey to Eureka County, Nevada \n     (referred to in this section as the ``county''), for no \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the parcel of land described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (c) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (b) is the parcel of public land (including any \n     improvements on the land) known as ``Maiden's Grave \n     Cemetery'', consisting of approximately 10 acres and more \n     particularly described as S1/2NE1/4SW1/4SW1/4, N1/2SE1/4SW1/\n     4SW1/4 of section 10, T.31N., R.49E., Mount Diablo Meridian.\n       (d) Easement.--At the time of the conveyance under \n     subsection (b), subject to subsection (e)(2), the Secretary \n     shall grant the county an easement allowing access for \n     persons desiring to visit the cemetery and other cemetery \n     purposes over an appropriate access route consistent with \n     current access.\n       (e) Condition on Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The county (including its successors) \n     shall continue the use of the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (b) as a cemetery.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary, after notice to the \n     county and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that \n     the county has used or permitted the use of the parcel for \n     any purpose other than the purpose specified in paragraph \n     (1), and the county fails to discontinue that use--\n       (A) title to the parcel shall revert to the Secretary, to \n     be administered by the Secretary; and\n       (B) the easement granted to the county under subsection (d) \n     shall be revoked.\n       (3) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the application of \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) if the Secretary \n     determines that a waiver would be in the best interests of \n     the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13911-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 258--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE ARREST \n          OF MIKHAIL B.

Khodorkovsky \n     and the freezing of shares of the oil conglomerate YUKOS have \n     raised questions about the possible selective application of \n     the law in the Russian Federation and may have compromised \n     investor confidence in business conditions there: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the \n     Russian Federation should ensure that Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky \n     is accorded the full measure of his rights under the Russian \n     Constitution to defend himself against any and all charges \n     that may be brought against him, in a fair and transparent \n     process, so that individual justice may be done, but also so \n     that the efforts the Russian Federation has been making to \n     reform its system of justice may be seen to be moving \n     forward; and\n       (2) such authorities of the Russian Federation should make \n     every effort to dispel growing international concerns that--\n       (A) the cases against Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and other \n     business leaders are politically motivated; and\n       (B) the potential remains for misuse of the justice system \n     in the Russian Federation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/04/senate-section/article/S13911-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13911-S13912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2053.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) high levels of tree mortality resulting from insect \n     infestation (including the interaction between insects and \n     diseases) may result in--\n       (A) increased fire risk;\n       (B) loss of old trees and old growth;\n       (C) loss of threatened and endangered species;\n       (D) loss of species diversity;\n       (E) degraded watershed conditions;\n       (F) increased potential for damage from other agents of \n     disturbance, including exotic, invasive species; and\n       (G) decreased timber values;\n       (2)(A) forest-damaging insects destroy hundreds of \n     thousands of acres of trees each year;\n       (B) in the West, more than 21,000,000 acres are at high \n     risk of forest-damaging insect infestation, and in the South, \n     more than 57,000,000 acres are at risk across all land \n     ownerships; and\n       (C) severe drought conditions in many areas of the South \n     and West will increase the risk of forest-damaging insect \n     infestations;\n       (3) the hemlock woolly adelgid is--\n       (A) destroying streamside forests throughout the mid-\n     Atlantic and Appalachian regions;\n       (B) threatening water quality and sensitive aquatic \n     species; and\n       (C) posing a potential threat to valuable commercial timber \n     land in northern New England;\n       (4)(A) the emerald ash borer is a nonnative, invasive pest \n     that has quickly become a major threat to hardwood forests \n     because an emerald ash borer infestation is almost always \n     fatal to affected trees; and\n       (B) the emerald ash borer pest threatens to destroy more \n     than 692,000,000 ash trees in forests in Michigan and Ohio \n     alone, and between 5 and 10 percent of urban street trees in \n     the Upper Midwest;\n       (5)(A) epidemic populations of Southern pine beetles are \n     ravaging forests in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, \n     Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, \n     Tennessee, and Virginia; and\n       (B) in 2001, Florida and Kentucky experienced 146 percent \n     and 111 percent increases, respectively, in Southern pine \n     beetle populations;\n       (6) those epidemic outbreaks of Southern pine beetles have \n     forced private landowners to harvest dead and dying trees, in \n     rural areas and increasingly urbanized settings;\n       (7) according to the Forest Service, recent outbreaks of \n     the red oak borer in Arkansas and Missouri have been \n     unprecedented, with more than 1,000,000 acres infested at \n     population levels never seen before;\n       (8) much of the damage from the red oak borer has taken \n     place in national forests, and the Federal response has been \n     inadequate to protect forest ecosystems and other ecological \n     and economic resources;\n       (9)(A) previous silvicultural assessments, while useful and \n     informative, have been limited in scale and scope of \n     application; and\n       (B) there have not been sufficient resources available to \n     adequately test a full array of individual and combined \n     applied silvicultural assessments;\n       (10) only through the full funding, development, and \n     assessment of potential applied silvicultural assessments \n     over specific time frames across an array of environmental \n     and climatic conditions can the most innovative and cost \n     effective management applications be determined that will \n     help reduce the susceptibility of forest ecosystems to attack \n     by forest pests;\n       (11)(A) often, there are significant interactions between \n     insects and diseases;\n       (B) many diseases (such as white pine blister rust, beech \n     bark disease, and many other diseases) can weaken trees and \n     forest stands and predispose trees and forest stands to \n     insect attack; and\n       (C) certain diseases are spread using insects as vectors \n     (including Dutch elm disease and pine pitch canker); and\n       (12) funding and implementation of an initiative to combat \n     forest pest infestations and associated diseases should not \n     come at the expense of supporting other programs and \n     initiatives of the Secretary.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to require the Secretary to develop an accelerated \n     basic and applied assessment program to combat infestations \n     by forest-damaging insects and associated diseases;\n       (2) to enlist the assistance of colleges and universities \n     (including forestry schools, land grant colleges and \n     universities, and 1890 Institutions), State agencies, and \n     private landowners to carry out the program; and\n       (3) to carry out applied silvicultural assessments.\n\n     SEC. 402.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Highlands Conservation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Highlands region is a physiographic province that \n     encompasses more than 2,000,000 acres extending from eastern \n     Pennsylvania through the States of New Jersey and New York to \n     northwestern Connecticut.\n       (2) The Highlands region is an environmentally unique area \n     that--\n       (A) provides clean drinking water to over 15,000,000 people \n     in metropolitan areas in the States of Connecticut, New \n     Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania;\n       (B) provides critical wildlife habitat, including habitat \n     for 247 threatened and endangered species;\n       (C) maintains an important historic connection to early \n     Native American culture, colonial settlement, the American \n     Revolution, and the Civil War;\n       (D) contains recreational resources for 14 million visitors \n     annually;\n       (E) provides other significant ecological, natural, \n     tourism, recreational, educational, and economic benefits; \n     and\n       (F) provides homeownership opportunities and access to \n     affordable housing that is safe, clean, and healthy;\n       (3) An estimated 1 in 12 citizens of the United States live \n     within a 2-hour drive of the Highlands region.\n       (4) More than 1,400,000 residents live in the Highlands \n     region.\n       (5) The Highlands region forms a greenbelt adjacent to the \n     Philadelphia-New York City-Hartford urban corridor that \n     offers the opportunity to preserve water, forest and \n     agricultural resources, wildlife habitat, recreational areas, \n     and historic sites, while encouraging sustainable economic \n     growth and development in a fiscally and environmentally \n     sound manner.\n       (6) Continued population growth and land use patterns in \n     the Highlands region--\n       (A) reduce the availability and quality of water;\n       (B) reduce air quality;\n       (C) fragment the forests;\n       (D) destroy critical migration corridors and forest \n     habitat; and\n       (E) result in the loss of recreational opportunities and \n     scenic, historic, and cultural resources;\n       (7) The water, forest, wildlife, recreational, \n     agricultural, and cultural resources of the Highlands region, \n     in combination with the proximity of the Highlands region to \n     the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, make the \n     Highlands region nationally significant.\n       (8) The national significance of the Highlands region has \n     been documented in--\n       (A) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study \n     conducted by the Forest Service in 1990;\n\n[[Page S13937]]\n\n       (B) the New York-New Jersey Highlands Regional Study: 2002 \n     Update conducted by the Forest Service;\n       (C) the bi-State Skylands Greenway Task Force Report;\n       (D) the New Jersey State Development and Redevelopment \n     Plan;\n       (E) the New York State Open Space Conservation Plan;\n       (F) the Connecticut Green Plan: Open Space Acquisition FY \n     2001-2006;\n       (G) the open space plans of the State of Pennsylvania; and\n       (H) other open space conservation plans for States in the \n     Highlands region;\n       (9) The Highlands region includes or is adjacent to \n     numerous parcels of land owned by the Federal Government or \n     federally designated areas that protect, conserve, or restore \n     resources of the Highlands region, including--\n       (A) the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (B) the Shawanagunk Grasslands Wildlife Refuge;\n       (C) the Morristown National Historical Park;\n       (D) the Delaware and Lehigh Canal Corridors;\n       (E) the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area;\n       (F) the Delaware River Basin;\n       (G) the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area;\n       (H) the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River;\n       (I) the Appalachian National Scenic Trail;\n       (J) the United States Military Academy at West Point, New \n     York;\n       (K) the Highlands National Millenium Trail;\n       (L) the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge;\n       (M) the proposed Crossroads of the Revolution National \n     Heritage Area;\n       (N) the proposed Musconetcong National Scenic and \n     Recreational River in New Jersey; and\n       (O) the Farmington River Wild and Scenic Area in \n     Connecticut;\n       (10) It is in the interest of the United States to protect, \n     conserve, and restore the resources of the Highlands region \n     for the residents of, and visitors to, the Highlands region.\n       (11) The States of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and \n     Pennsylvania, and units of local government in the Highlands \n     region have the primary responsibility for protecting, \n     conserving, preserving, restoring and promoting the resources \n     of the Highlands region.\n       (12) Because of the longstanding Federal practice of \n     assisting States in creating, protecting, conserving, and \n     restoring areas of significant natural and cultural \n     importance, and the national significance of the Highlands \n     region, the Federal Government should, in partnership with \n     the Highlands States and units of local government in the \n     Highlands region, protect, restore, and preserve the water, \n     forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational and cultural \n     resources of the Highlands region.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Collins, chair of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, entering into a colloquy on a matter \nthat concerns the Judiciary Committee. In particular, our colloquy \ninvolves the nomination of Michael Garcia to be Assistant Secretary of \nHomeland Security. Following our statements, I will seek an unanimous \nconsent agreement to refer Mr. Garcia's nomination to the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  All committees derive their ``respective jurisdictions'' from Senate \nRule XXV, among other sources. As such, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, in its responsibility for the ``organization and \nreorganization of the executive branch of the Government,'' played a \ncrucial role in establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. I \nwould like to compliment Senator Collins on her leadership and the \nsignificant improvements that have resulted in our Nation's security \nsince September 11.\n  Also, under Senate Rule XXV, the Committee on the Judiciary has \njurisdiction over ``immigration and naturalization.'' It is important \nfor the immigration and naturalization functions which have been \ntransferred from the Department of Justice and other law enforcement \nagencies to the Department of Homeland Security to remain under the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee.\n  With the formation of three new bureaus for immigration policy in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, countless situations--from day-to-day \nimmigration services and enforcement to long-term border security \nplanning--will arise in which legislation affecting these bureaus and \noversight of these bureaus is an essential role of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I appreciate my colleague taking the time to clarify the \nconfirmation process for Mr. Garcia and the commitment to Senate Rules \nXXI and XXVI, Section 8 as it affects the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the Senator's comments, and I look forward \nto working with him. I would also like to assure him that I do not \nbelieve the Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction affects in \nany way the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction over immigration and \nnaturalization matters, as set forth in Senate Rule XXV. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee was responsible for the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 which created the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The committee has conducted wide-ranging and vigorous \noversight of the Department and, this year alone, has reported out six \nbills that address homeland security concerns. In total, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has held over 30 hearings on homeland \nsecurity matters, thus reflecting the paramount role it plays with \nrespect to these matters.\n  The committee also has handled the nominations of almost all of the \nDepartment's nominees. On June 5 of this year, our committee held a \nhearing on Mr. Garcia's nomination. We reported his nomination to the \nfull Senate on June 17. We then agreed to a referral of Mr. Garcia's \nnomination to the Judiciary Committee. I understand that my colleague, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, now seeks a \nsecond referral of the nomination in order to complete its work \nthereon.
