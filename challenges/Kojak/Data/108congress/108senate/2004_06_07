Mr. President, this week we mourn the passing of Ronald \nWilson Reagan, the 40th President of the United States. My wife Karyn \nand I, and indeed the entire Senate family, extend our deepest \nsympathies to his beloved Nancy and the entire Reagan family. More than \n15 years have passed since Ronald Reagan gave his final cheerful salute \nas President of the United States. He left the Oval Office with the \nhighest approval rating since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  Ronald Reagan had restored our confidence and our optimism in what it \nmeant to be an American. The countless tributes and recollections of \nthe past few days have brought forth a flood of memories, not only of \nhis extraordinary leadership but of his truly exceptional character. We \nremember Ronald Reagan and love him as we did the day he left the \nhighest post in the land. We feel a strong personal and unbreakable \nconnection with our 40th President.\n  Some attribute Ronald Reagan's ability to connect with the American \npeople to his abilities as an actor. No politician was better or more \ncomfortable around the camera. When he looked into the lens, he was \nlooking directly into the eyes of the American people. His timing was \nflawless, and he had a soft touch that could disarm even his most \nstubborn political opponents.\n  After being wounded by an assassin's bullet as he lay on a hospital \ngurney drifting towards unconsciousness, Ronald Reagan quipped to his \nbeloved Nancy:\n\n       Honey, I forgot to duck.\n\n  So many stories like this remind us that Ronald Reagan was a man of \nremarkable courage, coupled with boundless good humor. There was more \nto him than what he said and how he said it, as there was more to \nAbraham Lincoln than his stirring speeches, and more to Franklin \nRoosevelt than his fireside chats. Ronald Reagan believed in what he \nsaid, and that conviction came through. He believed there is good and \nevil in the world and that America stands for the good. He believed we \nmust protect freedom wherever it may be threatened and plant its seeds \nwherever freedom may take root. He believed democracy to be not the \nprivilege of a fortunate few but the rightful and ordained destiny for \nall mankind.\n\n  At the 1992 Republican convention in Houston, TX, he expounded on \nthese beliefs, telling the American people:\n\n       Whether we come from poverty or wealth, whether we are \n     Afro-American or Irish-American, Christian or Jewish, from \n     big cities or small towns, we are all equal in the eyes of \n     God. But as Americans, that is not enough; we must be equal \n     in the eyes of each other.\n\n  There was one thing--second only to the Almighty--in which he had \nmore faith than all else, and that was the American people. We trusted \nRonald Reagan, we respected Ronald Reagan, we loved Ronald Reagan, \nbecause he trusted, respected, and loved each and every one of us.\n  This week we will bear witness to a rare and extraordinary tribute to \none of our greatest leaders. Half-masted flags will snap in the wind. \nCannons will pound the air with salutes. And a horse-drawn caisson will \nsolemnly pull the flag-draped casket of Ronald Wilson Reagan up to the \nHill of our Capital City.\n  Americans will line up by the thousands to pause at his side, bow \ntheir heads, and pay their final respects. Hundreds of leaders will \ngather at the National Cathedral to show their deep appreciation of a \ngrateful Nation and a grateful world, and on Friday, when President \nReagan is laid to rest, each of us will give a moment of our day to \nremember a man who gave us his very best.\n  All of this is right and fitting. This is how we honor the lives of \ngreat leaders whom we love. But our tribute to Ronald Reagan must be \nmore than a passing historical moment. Although we say goodbye to the \nman, we must never say goodbye to his values. Let this week reaffirm \nthe goodness of our Nation. Let it reaffirm our faith in freedom. Let \nit reaffirm democracy as the destiny of all mankind. And let our fond \nmemories, our deep affection and regard for Ronald Wilson Reagan \nreaffirm that we believe, above all, in ourselves as Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, this past weekend we lost one of Americans \ngreatest leaders, Ronald Reagan. I had the privilege of serving under \nPresident Reagan's strong, principled leadership for 7 years--2 years \nin his White House as assistant to the President, or public liaison, \nand almost 5 years as his Secretary of Transportation.\n  Greatness in a President is marked by the ability to chart and \nimplement a new course, a better course, and by his level of decency \nand integrity. Ronald Reagan knew why he wanted to be President. He \ncame to office with the clearest of vision, a passion for achieving his \ngoals and in conveying them with an eloquence almost unsurpassed.\n  Ronald Reagan made all of us, the American people, believe in \nourselves again. He literally changed the world. Despite conventional \nwisdom, he determined that communism had to be defeated, not tolerated. \nHe rejected the Iron Curtain, rejected the status quo, and his legacy \nto the world is freedom. His strength of character and bedrock belief \nin right and wrong ended the cold war, and his leadership unshackled \nthe yoke of tyranny for millions upon millions of people who had known \nonly oppression.\n  I will always remember his remarkable rapport with the American \npeople and what a true gentleman he was. During my time on his White \nHouse staff, I brought scores and scores of people, organizations, and \ngroups into the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, the Roosevelt Room, and \nhe treated every person with courtesy and respect. Occasionally, there \nwould be some who had a difference of view with him on some issue or \nanother, and they were going to give him a piece of their mind. Well, \nthey came into his presence and you could almost see that anger just \nfading away. He would express his views, he would address their \nconcerns, and then he might sit back and tell them a story or two--\nperhaps a humorous one--and maybe pass jellybeans around. They would be \nready to climb any hill for Ronald Reagan. When the President would \nexplain his position, obviously, he did it in a very eloquent manner.\n  What a remarkable person his wife Nancy is. What a tremendous \npartner. She was his best friend, his confidant, his trusted, beloved \nspouse. She deserves great credit for his accomplishments and hers.\n  When I left the Cabinet, a farewell function was planned, and we \ntalked about the fact that it would be nice to invite to that farewell \nparty people who would not otherwise be able to meet the President of \nthe United States. He readily agreed.\n  I can remember one young woman from Arkansas. She was a part of the \nMake a Wish group. She had a terminal illness and her great desire was \nto meet President Ronald Reagan. I can still see her there in the White \nHouse and the compassionate way in which he greeted her and talked with \nher.\n  There was a young man named Tommy, from my hometown of Salisbury, NC, \nwho was in a wheelchair; he had to wear a helmet most of the time \nbecause if he were to fall, it would be very severe. His mother and his \nuncle very tenderly brought him to Washington to carry out his wish to \nmeet the great Ronald Reagan, President of the United States. Once \nagain, to watch the President and his compassion as he talked with \nTommy is something I will remember forever.\n\n  One of the things that will really be an inspiration to me for the \nrest of my life is a conversation I had with the\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nPresident when the two of us were alone. We were waiting in the holding \nroom for him to give a speech. You don't often find yourself alone with \nthe President of the United States. On this particular day, we were \nwaiting for a speech and I said: Mr. President, I just cannot resist. I \nhave to ask you how in the world, when you have the weight of the world \non your shoulders, are you able to be so gracious, so thoughtful, and \nso kind? I never see you flustered or frustrated. How do you do it with \nsuch weight on your shoulders?\n  He kind of leaned back, and he loved to tell a story and to \nreminisce. He said: Well, Elizabeth, when I was Governor of California, \nit seemed like every day yet another disaster would be placed on my \ndesk, and I had the urge to hand it to someone behind me to help me. \nOne day I realized I was looking in the wrong direction; I looked up \ninstead of back. I am still looking up. I don't think I could go 1 more \nday in this office if I didn't know that I could ask God's help and it \nwould be given.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that President Reagan was welcomed into \nthe gates of Heaven with open arms and with the words: Well done, good \nand faithful servant. Well done, indeed.\n  God bless President Ronald Reagan and his family, and God bless this \ngreat land of the free, America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, a few years ago when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident of the United States, he attended one of the many press \ndinners which are held. I think it was the gridiron dinner. I think it \nis well known that maybe 90 percent of the press corps in Washington \nhad a different point of view on issues than President Reagan did, but \nthey liked him anyway, and they respected him and he had fun with them, \njust as they did with him.\n  I remember on that evening he strode into the gridiron dinner looking \nlike a million dollars, smiling big. The press rose, smiling back, \napplauding. He stood in front of them until it subsided, and then he \nsaid to his adversaries in the media: Thank you very much. I know how \nhard it is to clap with your fingers crossed. And they laughed, and \nthey had a wonderful time with President Reagan.\n  The first thing we think about, those of us who had any opportunity \nto get to know him--a great many of us--was that Ronald Reagan was a \nvery friendly man. He was a congenial person, an easy person to know, \nthe kind of person you want to spend a lot of time with, if you had the \nopportunity, and that what you saw in private was what everyone else \nsaw in public.\n  Howard Baker, the former majority leader of the Senate when Ronald \nReagan was President, got to know him especially well, and then in \n1987, President Reagan invited former Senator Baker to come to be his \nChief of Staff, which he was for nearly 2 years.\n  I remember Senator Baker telling me that, to his surprise, when his 9 \na.m. meetings came every morning with President Reagan, he discovered \nthat Mr. Reagan had a funny little story to tell to Senator Baker, his \nChief of Staff. What surprised Senator Baker even more was President \nReagan expected Senator Baker to have a funny little story to tell \nback. So for that whole 2 years, virtually every morning at 9 a.m. when \nthe President of the United States and the Chief of Staff of the White \nHouse met, they swapped funny little stories. It is very reassuring to \nme that two men who have maybe the two biggest jobs in the world were \ncomfortable enough with themselves, each other, and their \nresponsibilities to begin the day in that sort of easy way. That is the \npart of Ronald Reagan we think more about.\n  Another part of Ronald Reagan which I think is often overlooked is \nthat he was a man of big ideas. I would say intellectual, although I \nguess there is a little difference between being devoted to ideals and \nbeing intellectual but not much difference.\n  Unlike most people who are candidates for President of the United \nStates, Ronald Reagan wrote many of his own speeches. When he had a few \nminutes, he would sit in the back of a campaign airplane and make notes \non cards in the shorthand that he had. His former aide, Marty Anderson, \nhas written a book about that and told that, to a great extent, Ronald \nReagan's words were his own words, ideas he expressed or ideas he \ngathered himself and ideas he had thought through and wanted to \npromulgate.\n  Maybe that is partly why he seemed so comfortable with himself when \nhe finally entered public life. He came to it late in life. He was age \n55 when he became Governor of California, so by then he knew what he \nthought, and he had a sense of purpose, and he knew what he wanted to \ndo.\n  I got an idea of that kind of big thinking when I went to see \nPresident Reagan in my second year as Governor--third year, I guess it \nwas, his first year as President in 1981. I talked to him about a big \nswap which I thought would help our country.\n  I suggested: Mr. President, why doesn't the Federal Government take \nover all of Medicaid and let the State and local governments take over \nall responsibility for kindergarten through 12th grade? That would make \nit clear, I said, where the responsibility lies. You cannot fix schools \nfrom Washington, and it would make more efficient our health care \nsystem if we did things that way. He liked the idea. It fit his \nunconventional brand of thinking. He advocated it. It was a little too \nrevolutionary for most people in Washington in the early 1980s.\n\n  He had the same sort of unconventional attitude toward national \ndefense policy. Many people overlooked the fact that Ronald Reagan did \nnot just want us to have as many nuclear weapons as the Soviet empire \ndid, he wanted to get rid of nuclear weapons. He saw them as wrong, as \nbad, and he wanted a world without nuclear weapons. Instead of mutual \nassured destruction, which was the doctrine at the time, he built up \nour strength so we could begin to reduce nuclear weapons and then \nunilaterally begin to do it before the Soviets did, hoping they would \nthen follow. We can see the results.\n  At the time, some people said Ronald Reagan was naive to think we \ncould transfer power from Washington, from an arrogant empire, at home \nor naive to think we could face down an evil empire abroad, and \nespecially naive to think our policy should be based upon getting rid \nof nuclear weapons. It turned out Ronald Reagan saw further than most \nof those critics did.\n  Perhaps his most famous speech, not my favorite speech--my favorite \nspeech is the one we heard a lot about this weekend, 20 years ago at \nNormandy, which moved the whole world to tears and reminded Americans \nwhy we are Americans and what we fought for--but his most famous speech \nmay be the one in 1987 at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin where he said:\n\n       Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\n\n  Earlier this year, I visited Berlin with John Kornblum who at the \ntime was U.S. minister and deputy commandant in the American sector of \nWest Berlin where tanks challenged tanks and white crosses marked grave \nsites of those who were killed trying to escape over the wall from East \nBerlin. Mr. Kornblum talked about the development of that speech that \nRonald Reagan gave that day. Those words, or the thought, ``tear down \nthis wall,'' went into the speech at an early stage. Some fought to \nkeep it in. Many fought to take it out. Those who had thought Ronald \nReagan was wrong to say the Soviet Union was an evil empire were not \nanxious for him to say:\n\n       Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\n\n  Some suggested that President Reagan try his hand at German as \nPresident Kennedy had in a memorable speech at the Berlin Wall in the \nearly 1960s. Some suggested that the speech should not be made at the \nBrandenburg Gate. That was too provocative, Mr. Kornblum remembers. But \nthe speech was made at the Brandenburg Gate, and Mr. Reagan did keep \nhis words in that speech. He did make his point, and his point was \nclear:\n\n       Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\n\n  For those of us who had a chance to see the new countries of Eastern \nEurope and their enthusiasm for freedom\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nand for a free market system, we can see the legacy of Ronald Reagan \nand his unconventional thinking.\n  So I think it is important for us to remember that this genial \nPresident was a man of ideas, of all the Presidents I have worked with, \nas much a man of ideas as any one of those Presidents.\n  Ronald Reagan also taught us something about leadership. I recall in \n1980 when he and Mrs. Reagan visited the Tennessee Governor's mansion \nduring the Presidential campaign. I had not known him very well. He had \nserved as Governor. He was several years older. He was from the West. \nIt was really my first chance to meet him.\n  After 1 hour or an hour and a half of breakfast with him the next \nmorning, I remember going away thinking this man has a better concept \nof the Presidency than anyone I have ever been privileged to meet.\n  Ronald Reagan understood what George Reedy said in his book, ``The \nTwilight of the Presidency,'' is the definition of Presidential \nleadership: No. 1, see an urgent need; No. 2, develop a strategy to \nmeet the need; and, No. 3, persuade at least half the people that you \nare right.\n  Ronald Reagan was as good as anyone at persuading at least half the \npeople that he was right. He taught that and he also taught us the \nimportance of proceeding from principles.\n  Sometimes we are described in Washington these days as being too \nideological, too uncompromising, too partisan. President Reagan was a \nprincipled man. He operated from principles in all of his decisions, \ninsofar as I knew. He advocated his principles as far as he could take \nthem, but he recognized that the great decisions that we make here are \noften conflicts between principles on which all of us agree. It might \nbe equal opportunity versus the rule of law. And once we have argued \nour principle and the solution, and strategy has been taken as far as \nit could go, if we get, as he said 75, 80, or 85 percent of what we \nadvocated, well, then that is a pretty good job.\n  So he was very successful because he argued from principles. He \nargued strenuously. He was good at persuading at least half the people \nhe was right. Then he was willing to accept a conclusion because most \nof our politics is about the conflict of principles.\n  There is another lesson that he taught us, and that was to respect \nthe military. Now, that seems unnecessary to say in the year 2004 where \nwe have a volunteer military that is better than any military we have \never had in our history; when we have witnessed the thousands of acts \nof courage, charity, kindness, and ingenuity in Iraq and Afghanistan \nrecently; when the men and women of our National Guard and Reserves are \nalso being called up. We have a lot of respect for our military.\n  In 1980, we were showing a lot less respect for the men and women of \nour military. I remember riding with President Reagan in a car in \nKnoxville during the 1980 campaign. As we pulled out of the airport by \nthe National Guard unit, there were a number of the soldiers waving at \nhim, understanding and sensing that he respected them. He turned to me \nand said something like this: I wish we could think of some way to \nhonor these men and women more. He said: We used to do that in the \nmovies in the 1930s and 1940s. We would make movies honoring men and \nwomen in the military and that is how we showed our respect for them.\n  Well, he did find a way to honor them during his Presidency in the \n1980s, and by the time he left at the end of that decade there was no \nquestion but that the American people remembered to honor the men and \nwomen in the military.\n  There is one other aspect of President Reagan's leadership that I \nwould like to mention, which is probably the most important aspect of \nthe American character, and that is the belief that anything is \npossible. The idea that we uniquely believe in this country, and people \nall around the world think we are a little odd for believing it, is \nthat no matter where you come from, no matter what race you are, no \nmatter what color your skin, if you come here and work hard, anything \nis possible.\n\n  That is why we subscribe to ideals such as all men are created equal, \neven though we know achieving that goal will always be a work in \nprogress and we may never reach it. That is why we say we will pay any \nprice, bear any burden, as President Kennedy said, to defend peace, \neven though we know that is a work in progress and we may never reach \nit.\n  That is why we say more recently we want to leave no child behind \nwhen it comes to learning to read. We know that is a work in progress \nand we may not reach it, but that is our goal.\n  We Americans say that anything is possible, and nothing symbolizes \nthat more than the American Presidency. And no President has symbolized \nthat more in the last century than Ronald Reagan. He has reminded us of \nwhat it means to be an American. He lifted our spirits, he made us \nproud, he strengthened our character, and he taught us a great many \nlessons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6488-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6488-S6489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE 278TH ARMORED CAVALRY REGIMENT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I rise today to comment on some of those military men \nand women that President Reagan felt so strongly about. On Saturday, I \nwent to Knoxville, TN, for the casing of the colors of the 278th \nArmored Cavalry Regiment. Four thousand troops, the largest unit in the \nTennessee National Guard, are being sent to Mississippi for training, \nthen to California and then, just before Christmas, to Iraq. This was a \nlarge number of men and women from across Tennessee, mostly east \nTennessee. While their command headquarters are in Knoxville, their \nsquadron headquarters are in Athens, Cookeville, and Kingsport. The \nwhole community had organized a tremendous day of celebration and \nparade to honor these men and women.\n  Randy Tyree, the former mayor of Knoxville, was the master of \nceremonies. Joe Alexander was the parade chairman. The East Tennessee \nVeterans Memorial Association was the event sponsor. It was a bright, \nsunny day. It came during a week we had filled with honoring the men \nand women in our military. Earlier in the week was Memorial Day and \nbefore that the opening of the World War II memorial. The week ended \nwith the celebration of the 60th anniversary of D-day, honoring those \nmilitary heroes of the past.\n  But Saturday was not about the past. The men and women we honored in \nKnoxville, TN, on Saturday live among us. We know them. We see them in \nthose communities every day. They are members of the Knox County \nSheriff's Office. They include McMinn County school superintendent John \nFogerty. They are Casey Boring, Tony Loveday, Kevin Fuller, Roger \nLawson, and Randy Cruz all from Blount County, my home county's \nsheriff's office. They are our fathers, brothers, sons, sisters, and \ndaughters. They are not all 24 or 26 or 30 years old either. They are \nin their thirties and their forties. Some are in their fifties.\n  Jim Leinart is an Anderson County deputy who fought in Vietnam and is \na grandfather. He is a part of the 278th and is heading to Iraq, a \nmonth after he was supposed to have retired from the military. He is a \ntank mechanic, and he and nearly 4,000 other members of the 278th leave \nJune 14 for Mississippi for training.\n\n  This is what he had to say about it:\n\n       Right after I got that alert, I figured out I wasn't going \n     to be able to retire. I kind of dread it in a way and kind of \n     look forward to it in a way. It'll be different; an adventure \n     in another country.\n\n  The families there, and the men and women in the 278th, all knew the \ntruth. They are not going to Iraq and Afghanistan for support \nactivities. They will be the first National Guard unit from Tennessee \nin a long time to be on the front lines, to be combat troops. But there \nwas not a word of complaint that day, and the men looked forward to \nthat.\n  This unit has a fantastic history. The 278th traces its roots to the \nAmerican Revolution in what may have been the first early American war \nof preemption. A British colonel named Patrick Ferguson on the eastern \nside of the Great Smokey Mountains sent word across the mountains to \nTennessee that the mountaineers should lay down their arms or the \nBritish would come across the mountains and arrest them and hang their \nleaders.\n  This angered the mountaineers so they gathered, in October of 1789 \nnear Watauga, TN, near Sycamore Shoals. They marched across the \nmountains to\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nfind this general who sent this warning, killed him, won that battle, \ndestroyed the left wing of Cornwallis' army and, according to President \nTheodore Roosevelt, changed the course of the Revolutionary War. These \nmilitiamen were the early members of the 278th.\n  At the ceremony on Saturday, MAJ Charles R. Southerland, who is \nAdjutant of the 278th ACR, gave a beautiful speech, setting out the \nhistory of the 278th and its significance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of Major Southerland's \naddress, as well as a story from the Knoxville News Sentinel of \nSaturday, June 5, about Anderson County Deputy Jim Leinart to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAddress Given on 5 June 2004 by Major Charles R. Southerland, Adjutant \n           of the 278th ACR, for the Parade in Knoxville, TN\n\n       Today the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment writes another \n     page in our rich history of military service for Tennessee. \n     In 1780, Colonel John Sevier called for 100 good men and 200 \n     men answered the challenge. Tennessee has been known as the \n     Volunteer State ever since. The 278th ACR is the only \n     enhanced Armored Cavalry Regiment within the National Guard, \n     and one of only two Armored Cavalry Regiments in the United \n     States Army.\n       The history of the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment began \n     before the American Revolution when local militia units \n     formed throughout communities in East Tennessee. These units \n     were organized to protect the early settlers in Tennessee \n     from the Creek and Cherokee Indians who often raided \n     settlements in East Tennessee. Once these militia units were \n     formed, the Indian raids subsided and life on the Tennessee \n     frontier settled down.\n       During the American Revolution, these militia units joined \n     along the Nolichucky River in East Tennessee under the \n     command of Colonel John Sevier to form a mounted Militia \n     Company of east Tennesseans. They formed with other ``Over \n     the Mountain Men'' and defeated a superior British force \n     under the command of General Patrick Ferguson in the Battle \n     of Kings Mountain, North Carolina. The battle, fought on \n     October 7, 1789, destroyed the left wing of Cornwallis' army \n     and effectively ended the Loyalist in the Carolinas. The \n     victory halted the British advance into North Carolina, \n     forced Lord Cornwallis to retreat from Charlotte into South \n     Carolina, and gave General Nathaniel Greene the opportunity \n     to reorganize the American Army.\n       In 1796, Tennessee became the sixteenth state to join the \n     union. Colonel John Sevier became the State's first governor. \n     He organized the State's Militia into three brigades with the \n     Third Brigade of the Militia in East Tennessee.\n       During the War of 1812 with Great Britain, Militia units \n     from East Tennessee marched with General Andrew Jackson and \n     fought engagements at Pensacola, Florida and defeated a \n     superior English force on 8 January 1815 in New Orleans.\n       In 1846, a call went out for 2,800 Volunteers from the \n     State of Tennessee to take part in the War with Mexico, \n     38,000 Tennesseans answered the call, sealing the Tennessee \n     Militia the ever-lasting nickname of ``Volunteer.'' From that \n     heritage, the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment's motto ``I \n     Volunteer Sir'' was derived.\n       The Third Brigade of the Tennessee Militia was absorbed \n     into the National Guard of the United States on March 25, \n     1887 as the Third Tennessee Infantry Regiment with \n     Headquarters in Knoxville, TN.\n       On 29 April 1977, the 278th Infantry Brigade was \n     reorganized and re-designated the 278th Armored Calvary \n     Regiment. Colonel Russell A. Newman was appointed as the 1st \n     Colonel of the Regiment.\n       Today we will embark on yet another journey to answer our \n     nations call to protect the freedom and quality of life for \n     our families, communities and the citizens of our great \n     nation. The Casing of the Regimental Colors today symbolizes \n     the end of our current mission in the State of Tennessee. The \n     colors represent the soldiers, past and present, which \n     comprise the Regiment and are the physical symbols of its \n     spirit, tradition and lineage. The act of casing the colors \n     is symbolic of the Regiment's upcoming journey and expresses \n     our rich heritage and the heroism of our forefathers. The \n     Regimental Colors will be uncased again when the Regiment \n     arrives at our new location as we begin our next mission. \n     This tradition carries on our wiliness to preserve the rights \n     and privileges of our great nation and our resolve against \n     terrorism. Today is one step in our journey to a foreign land \n     with our Regimental Colors encased during this transition and \n     will be soon unfurled to fly freely in our new location with \n     the gesture of freedom and the future for that area. The \n     pride and love we have for our families and the state of \n     Tennessee will go with us as we take this journey and we will \n     return with a richer and more affluent value for these people \n     and places in our hearts. We look forward to the part of the \n     journey that will return us back here to Knoxville and the \n     uncasing of our Regimental Colors with the knowledge that we \n     made a difference.\n       The Regimental Command Sergeant Major, who is in charge of \n     the Colors, will case the Colors on command from the \n     Regiment's 8th Commander, Colonel Dennis J. Adams.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the News Sentinel, June 5, 2004]\n\n       Anderson Deputy's Plans for Retirement Put on Back Burner\n\n                            (By Bob Fowler)\n\n       Clinton.--An Anderson County deputy who fought in Vietnam \n     and is a grandfather is heading to Iraq--a month after he was \n     supposed to have retired from the military.\n       Shift Supervisor Jim Leinart is one of five Anderson County \n     Sheriff's Department officers--three of them in leadership \n     positions--who will begin an 18-month deployment June 14.\n       Their departures create a huge void in the already short-\n     staffed sheriff's department that will likely delay responses \n     to non-emergency calls, Chief Deputy Lewis Ridenour said.\n       ``Some calls may have to be prioritized,'' he said. ``It \n     may also take away from proactive law enforcement.''\n       As for Leinart's upcoming duty in Iraq, ``I'm sure that's \n     the last thing he was expecting, to be re-commissioned to a \n     war 30 years after serving his country in Vietnam,'' Ridenour \n     said.\n       Leinart is a 54-year-old resident of the tiny, remote \n     Briceville community, tucked into the mountains of Anderson \n     County near Lake City.\n       He has four children and eight grandchildren and is a \n     member of Troop B of the National Guard's 278th National \n     Armored Cavalry Regiment.\n       A tank mechanic, he and nearly 4,000 other members of the \n     278th will leave June 14 for Camp Shelby in Mississippi for \n     training. They'll be on the way to Iraq in the fall.\n       For Leinart, his upcoming tour of duty is tinged with \n     irony: He was supposed to have retired May 16 from the \n     National Guard.\n       But that retirement was put on hold in March when he was \n     placed on ``stop-loss,'' the military's term for stopping a \n     soldier from leaving the military during an operation.\n       ``Right after I got that alert, I figured out I wasn't \n     going to be able to retire,'' said Leinart, a burly man with \n     a quick wit, ready laugh and a neatly trimmed moustache \n     fading to gray.\n       ``I kind of dread it in a way and kind of look forward to \n     it in a way,'' Leinart said. ``It'll be different; an \n     adventure in another country.''\n       He said he and his wife, Joyce, a dispatcher with the \n     county's 911 emergency communications center, are preparing \n     for his departure.\n       ``I'm getting all the stuff done around the house that \n     needs to be done,'' he said.\n       His wife, their children and grandchildren ``are accepting \n     it, but they don't like it,'' Leinart said of his marching \n     orders.\n       Leinart joined the army when he was 17 and was shipped out \n     to Vietnam shortly after his 18th birthday. He said he was \n     stationed next to Saigon in 1967-68 and was involved in the \n     Tet Offensive, when the Vietcong staged simultaneous attacks \n     on major South Vietnam cities in January 1968.\n       It was a time, he said, ``when there was a lot of \n     confusion'' and when he was ``shot at a few times.''\n       After Vietnam, Leinart joined the Army Reserves in 1981 and \n     transferred to the National Guard's 278th in 1988.\n       Ridenour said Leinart has been a shift supervisor in the \n     sheriff's department for more than a year. ``It was apparent \n     he was someone we wanted in a leadership role,'' Ridenour \n     said. ``He's just the type of person who has that ability.''\n       Other shift supervisors who are headed to Iraq include Sgt. \n     Chucky Beach and Sgt. David Davis. Deputies, Steve Alcorn and \n     Daniel McFee are also on their way to Iraq.\n       Ridenour said even with the assignment changes made to fill \n     in while the five men are in Iraq, the sheriff's department \n     ``will still be short three people on a full-time basis.''\n       A school drug awareness program may be put on hold next \n     year so the officer assigned to that job can go on patrol, \n     Ridenour said.\n       Two drug enforcement officers have been placed on patrol, \n     and a training officer will become a road deputy three days a \n     week, he said.\n       ``It's going to be a very big problem for us, but these \n     guys are making a bigger sacrifice than we are,'' Ridenour \n     said of the five National Guardsmen.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The men and women of the 278th are going across the \nocean to fight for us so we can live safely at home. They are doing \nthat the same way militiamen in Tennessee did more than 200 years ago, \nmen who went across the mountains to fight for the settlers so they \ncould live safely in the pioneer villages. What I said to them on \nSaturday in Knoxville I would like to say to them and to their families \nagain today:\n  We are proud of you. We support you. We will pray for your safety, \nand we are grateful that you are going across the ocean to fight so we \ncan be safe at home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 542, S. 1887.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1887) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to \n     lift the patient limitation on prescribing drug addiction \n     treatments by medical practitioners in group practices and to \n     amend the Controlled Substances Act, and so forth, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1887) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF THE 30-PATIENT LIMIT FOR GROUP \n                   PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 303(g)(2)(B) of the Controlled Substance Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 823(g)(2)(B)) is amended by striking clause (iv).\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this legislation, S. 1887, ensures that all \nappropriately trained group practice physicians may prescribe and \ndispense certain recently approved drugs for the treatment of heroin \naddiction. It addresses the unintended effect of the Drug Abuse and \nTreatment Act of 2000, DATA, that hinders access to new treatments for \nthousands of individuals who seek such help.\n  When Congress passed DATA as Title XXXV of the Children's Health Act \nof 2000, Public Law 106-310, it allowed for the dispensing and \nprescribing of Schedule III drugs, like buprenorphine/naloxone, in an \noffice-based setting, for the treatment of heroin addiction. As a \nresult of DATA, access to drug addiction treatment is significantly \nexpanded; patients no longer are restricted to receiving treatment in a \nlarge clinic setting, but now may receive such care from specifically \ntrained physicians in an office-based setting.\n  DATA limits qualified individual physicians to treating no more than \n30 patients at a time. The interpretation of the law results in the \nsame 30-patient limit on physician groups. For example, the physician \nmembers of the Duke University Medical School faculty practice plan may \ntreat only 30 patients at one time, even though they may have ten \nindividual physicians trained and willing to treat patients and more \nthan 30 patients would benefit from newly available treatment. The \ndifficulties that have arisen, including the dashed hopes for treatment \nof many, due to the patient limitation on group practices, are detailed \nin a May 30 article in the Boston Globe, by Peter DeMarco. I would like \nto share a few excerpts from that article with my Colleagues, as \nfollows:\n\n       When buprenorphine became available as a treatment for \n     OxyContin and heroin addiction 18 months ago, many medical \n     professionals and addicts hailed it as a miracle drug, \n     bringing addicts back from the brink and helping them lead \n     normal lives when all else had failed. But for many addicts, \n     buprenorphine remains one of the hardest drugs to obtain. \n     Approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration in 2002, \n     buprenorphine is an opiate like heroin or the painkiller \n     OxyContin. Unlike those drugs or methadone, the prescribed \n     drug it's meant to replace, buprenorphine doesn't cloud the \n     minds of patients, allowing them to work or study as if \n     they're not on any drug at all. Nearly all who take \n     buprenorphine, meanwhile, say they lose all physical cravings \n     for street drugs.\n       But a combination of federal limits on the distribution of \n     buprenorphine, and reluctance on the part of some physicians \n     to offer it to patients has kept thousands of opiate addicts \n     from receiving the drug in Massachusetts and across the \n     country. At the heart of the issue is federal legislation \n     passed in 2000--two years before the drug was approved by the \n     FDA--that restricts individual clinical practices from \n     treating more than 30 patients with buprenorphine at a time.\n       While many substance-abuse experts say the 30-patient \n     figure is too low for some practices, their main quarrel with \n     the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 is its failure to \n     differentiate single-physician practices, hospitals, and \n     health care organizations. For example, all the doctors who \n     work for Tufts Health Plan can treat a combined 30 patients--\n     the same total as can be seen by a physician practicing \n     alone.\n       Boston health officials, along with their counterparts in \n     the State and Federal governments, say the Federal \n     legislation erred on the side of caution, and needs to be \n     changed to allow wider access to buprenorphine.\n       ``Boston Medical Center's main practice has 200 or more \n     general internal-medicine doctors, and within that practice, \n     we can only treat 30 people. It's the craziest loophole,'' \n     said Colleen Labelle, nurse-manager of the hospital's Office-\n     Based Opioid Treatment Program. ``We get 20 calls a day from \n     across the state. People are begging, desperate to get \n     treated, who we can't treat.''\n       The Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration has begun an internal process to increase the \n     30-patient cap. But because any proposed change would be \n     subject to the public-review process, approval could take as \n     long as two years, said Nick Reuter, a senior public health \n     analyst with the agency.\n\n  It clearly was not the intention of DATA that individuals seeking \ntreatment have less access to new medications simply because they \nreceive care from a physician practicing in a group, or from a group-\nbased or mixed-model health plan. Nevertheless, this is the is the \neffect and it is having a severe effect. The problem is addressed by \nremoving the 30-patient aggregate limit on medical groups. The patient \nlimitation would remain on individual treating physicians. This is \nachieved in the bill, S. 1887, which I introduced along with Senators \nHatch and Biden. It simply removes the statutory limit on the number of \npatients for whom doctors in medical groups may prescribe certain newly \navailable, FDA-approved medications to treat heroin addiction.\n  I would like to close with another excerpt from Mr. DeMarco's article \nregarding the positive impact buprenorphine treatment has had on an \nindividual who was fortunate enough to seek and help and not be turned \naway. It is as follows:\n\n       Timothy Tigges says his addiction began after he wrenched \n     his back and bummed a few Percocet pills, a prescription \n     analgesic, from a friend to dull the pain. Before he knew it, \n     he was hooked on opiates, alternating between OxyContin and \n     shooting up heroin as his life went to pieces.\n       In October, Tigges, a 27-year-old East Boston carpet \n     installer, began taking buprenorphine, placing an orange pill \n     the size of a dime under his tongue until it dissolves, four \n     times daily. He hasn't touched an illegal drug since the day \n     he started the program, has put on 80 pounds from lifting \n     weights at the gym, and has yet to miss a day of work.

Mr. President, as the whole world knows by now, America \nand the world lost a great man, Ronald Reagan, last Saturday. After \nbattling Alzheimer's disease for the last 10 years, he finally \nsuccumbed and left this life for the next.\n  This week, in this Senate, on television, in the newspapers, and all \naround the world we will hear people talking of their memories of this \ngreat man and what a difference he made in this country and to freedom-\nloving people all around the world. I offer a few of my own comments in \nthat regard out of respect for him and his family and the great example \nhe was for all who believe in freedom, hope, and opportunity.\n  Ronald Reagan, perhaps during his entire political career, was \nunderestimated. He was written off by some as an actor or by some as a \nnice man but maybe not particularly effective. Because he was a man of \ngood humor who loved a good joke, some thought he could not and should \nnot be taken seriously.\n  The fact is, Ronald Reagan demonstrated for everyone how a serious \nperson--that is, someone who believes deeply in their principles, \nindeed in the principles upon which this country was founded, and who \nis willing to put themselves out in the public domain and to argue and \nfight, sometimes to lose but sometimes to win, in advocacy of those \nprinciples--Ronald Reagan reminded us that a good man, indeed a kind \nhuman being, a gentle person, a loving husband and father, can also \nsurvive in this sometimes difficult, some might even say ugly, world of \nelectoral politics.\n  In many ways, his death gives another reason to remember that \npolitics today seems in many ways to become personal, so adversarial. \nIndeed, it need not be. There is no reason why individuals cannot \ndisagree about public policy and differing points of view. There is no \nreason they cannot do that without becoming personal and hurtful.\n  I believe it was Margaret Thatcher who once said that a person who \nreverts to name-calling simply has run out of anything else to say. \nIndeed, what we ought to be focused on is the policies we believe are \nin the best interests of the American people and avoid the sort of \npersonal acrimony and hurt which too often seems a characteristic of \nour modern politics.\n  Ronald Reagan taught us you can be a successful politician, you can \nrise to the greatest heights in our system--indeed, to be the leader of \nthe free world--and still keep your good humor, still treat every \nperson with dignity and respect, and still show the milk of human \nkindness to others.\n  The one thing that made Ronald Reagan such an attractive person in \npublic life was his basic principles. Indeed, there are some who \nunderestimated him his entire political career. What they failed to \nappreciate was the power of his convictions and the ideals for which he \nstood. One of those convictions was putting people first. Ronald Reagan \nsaid putting people first has always been America's secret weapon. It \nis the way we have kept the spirit of our revolution alive, a spirit \nthat drives us to dream and dare, and to take great risks for a greater \ngood.\n  I know Ronald Reagan has been touted as a great man. I believe he was \na great man. But he never considered himself to be a great man, merely \na man committed to great ideas.\n  He also was sometimes criticized for being too much of a dreamer, but \nhe made no apologies about that. He said:\n\n       There's no question I am an idealist, which is another way \n     of saying I am an American.\n\n  But when I think of the policies of the Reagan administration and the \nsuccesses of what some have called the ``Reagan Revolution,'' but which \nI think in many ways was not revolutionary as much as it was a \nrestoration of our basic principles upon which this country was \nfounded, I think of the fall of communism and the subsequent liberation \nof tens of millions of people who had known nothing other than \noppression and tyranny and dictatorship, and, also, the resurgence of \nthe American economy.\n  First, so far as his role in the fall of communism, although he was a \ngenial, friendly, humor-loving optimist, he was a hardnosed realist \nwhen it came to the terrible impact and consequences of communism on \npeople across this globe. Indeed, he knew it was important for us to \nmaintain a strong military and made no apologies when it came to the \nimportance of peace through strength, not going hat in hand to our \nallies or our enemies asking them to do us a favor but recognizing that \nAmerica has a unique role in the world as the one remaining superpower, \nafter the fall of the Soviet Union, and recognizing the failure of \ncommunism as an alternative to freedom and democracy.\n  But it was, in large part, his commitment to rebuilding our military \nand peace through strength and hardnosed negotiating across the \nconference table with various opponents of our country and leaders of \nother countries that caused freedom to reign for tens of millions of \npeople who had never known freedom due to the fall of communism.\n  The other thing he believed in was the freedom here at home. He \nbelieved that big government was the enemy of individual freedom, and \nthat if, in fact, we were going to be able to continue to enjoy the \nkind of prosperity and opportunity that has been synonymous with \nAmerica, we needed to get a handle on big government. Indeed, when \nRonald Reagan became President, it is hard to believe now, but the \nhighest marginal income tax rate was 70 percent. By the time he left \noffice, it was 28 percent. Today it stands at 35 percent.\n  But Ronald Reagan understood, as all Americans understand--all folks \noutside of Washington especially understand--that in order to grow the \neconomy you do not tax it more, you cut taxes, because only then can \nyou provide the incentive for the individual American worker to work \nhard, save their money, invest their money, perhaps in their small \nbusiness, and then create jobs and opportunity for others who may not \nhave those jobs or that opportunity. It was by growing the economy, by \nproviding that incentive for work and investment and savings and risk \ntaking that we have all been the beneficiaries of that new economic \nfreedom was brought in, in modern times, by Ronald Reagan's leadership.\n  Most of all, I think my memories of Ronald Reagan center around his \ncall for us to believe in ourselves once again, to believe in America \nagain, and believe in the ideals we all identify with this great \ncountry of ours. America is different from virtually every other \ncountry in the world in that it was founded on ideals, on an ideal of \nliberty and justice for all, something not shared by any other country \nin the world that was formed or based on history or collective \nexperience. But, of course, our country was formed on the basis of \nthese ideals, and Ronald Reagan believed in them fervently and, more \nimportantly, he fought for them, even against those who suggested that \nperhaps it was not possible for America to be great again.\n\n  There were those who suggested that somehow America's greatest days \nwere behind us. Ronald Reagan never believed that. He always believed \nAmerica's greatest days lay ahead of us. And indeed they do, even \ntoday.\n  He understood and preached, perhaps better than anyone, that big \ngovernment and high taxes are the enemy of individual freedom, that \nsmaller government and lower taxes would be an incentive to work and \nsavings.\n  I mentioned a moment ago his belief in the individual initiative of \nrisk takers, of entrepreneurs, of those who\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nwould take the risks, make the investment, and create jobs for the \nAmerican people. At one point he said:\n\n       Too often entrepreneurs are forgotten heroes. We rarely \n     hear about them. But look into the heart of America, and you \n     will see them. They are the owners of that store down the \n     street, the faithful who support our churches, schools, and \n     communities, the brave people everywhere who produce our \n     goods, feed a hungry world, and keep our homes and families \n     warm while they invest in the future to build a better \n     America.\n\n  Now, those who only saw the genial, friendly, humor-loving side of \nRonald Reagan did not know the entire man. As I mentioned, behind that \ngenial countenance was a man of strong principle and a man as tough as \nthey come. For example, when the air traffic controllers defied a back-\nto-work order, he fired them, emphasizing the fact that the greater \ngood is always paramount and more important than special interests.\n  Of course, he survived an assassin's bullets with great humor, \ntelling his wife, ``Honey, I forgot to duck,'' and expressing to his \nphysicians, the ones who saved his life in the emergency room: ``I hope \nyou're all Republicans.''\n  With every fearsome challenge he encountered in life, he met it with \ngood humor, humanity, kindness, and optimism in a way that inspired and \ncontinues to inspire the American people, which, to me, will be one of \nhis greatest legacies.\n  He also taught us that politics can be a noble calling. \nUnfortunately, today, it seems that is forgotten too often and people \nask: How in the world can you be involved in politics and be a good \nperson? How can you believe in doing the right thing and be involved in \npolitics since it is all about getting reelected and raising money and \na fight for power? But, indeed, Ronald Reagan exemplified the fact that \na good person, with strong convictions, committed to great ideals and \nthe principles upon which this country was founded, can be successful \nin life and in politics, which, indeed, he was as the leader of the \nfree world.\n  Mr. President, as the Nation grieves with his family, we also \ncelebrate the life of this great man, a quintessential American whose \nhopes and dreams knew no bounds.\n  Ronald Reagan loved America, and America loved him back.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I come to the floor today after receiving \nthe news over the weekend of the passing of President Reagan. I see \ntoday these young folks called pages who work for us on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. They will be here this week during a very historic \nperiod. Here are young people who never met President Reagan. They have \nnever seen him give a speech live, nor have had conversations with him, \nand never really will be able to hold the man in their hearts like some \nof us who were inspired to go into political life by his words and by \nthe example that he set for political life. It is too bad they didn't \nget to do that. But that is not their fault.\n  This week, we will be celebrating his life. He will come to this \ntown, and there will be a lot of recollections from those who knew him. \nI did not get to serve with him because he left the Presidency the same \nyear that I was elected to the Senate. I came here under the Presidency \nof President George Herbert Walker Bush.\n  One of the photographs of which I am most fond, of the President and \nme, one I shall cherish to the end of my life, was taken in 1982 when \nhe came to Billings, MT. We had a little bit to do with that meeting. I \nthink it was the first personal meeting I ever had with the President. \nYou could tell from the way he carried himself, the way he walked, the \nway he spoke, the way he treated people, the handshake, that he was not \nonly the Commander in Chief and President of the United States, but he \nwas also a man of the people. He had Midwestern roots--Illinois, the \ngreat prairies. He was successful in Hollywood. He was a successful \nbroadcaster. He was of an age, at the time he was called to political \nlife, that basically everyone said he was too old. Yet he went on to \nserve two terms.\n  You may not have agreed with everything he stood for, but you didn't \never have any problem figuring out where he stood. He never wavered. He \nwas the same the day he left office as the day he came into office. \nThat example probably put into public life a lot of us who never \nthought of it.\n  I can remember something that happened in 1988, when I ran. In this \npolitical life, they said you have to come back to Washington, DC, and \nyou have to have your picture taken with President Reagan. They gave me \nthe date to be here. I said: I am sorry, I can't be there that date.\n  They reminded me and said: This is the White House calling. This is \nthe date.\n  I said that I wasn't concerned about what color their house was, but \non that date I happened to have an auction. I am an auctioneer. I had \nto make a living first, in 1988.\n  So that conversation closed. Then all at once, the political director \ncalled up. I explained the same thing to him. I said: It is not that \nimportant, no big deal. I am busy, he is busy, we have a date, they \ndidn't jibe, so we will move on.\n  Well, as it turned out, even the President called. He said: I \nunderstand about auctions, once you have one advertised. You go ahead \nand have the auction.\n  That surprised me a lot. He was something. He was one of those who \nreally won the cold war without firing a shot. And the chemistry \nbetween him and Prime Minister Thatcher of England was one of an \nunbelievable partnership. They stood alone against the world on the \ndeployment of tactical nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the aggression \nof a country that he called evil. You see, he had come to the \nPresidency knowing that about communism. He knew it for what it was--\ndegrading, dehumanizing. There was no upward mobility, no chance of any \nindividual ever attaining any kind of freedom--either economically or \npolitically. There was no opportunity to take their own talents and go \ninto the field of their endeavor. He understood communism for what it \nwas and he said: This cancer has to go.\n  As a result, through his steadfast leadership--and I know there were \nlonely times with decisions that he made--he brought down the Berlin \nWall without a shot being fired.\n  We honor him. This should be a week of celebration of a life--a life \nin the history of this country that will live as long as the country \nlives, as long as free men want to breathe. His name will be \nremembered. He has made his mark.\n  At that first meeting in Billings, I was sitting on a horse, and we \nwere getting ready to take him into a building. There were two others \nwho were supposed to escort the stagecoach. I can remember him saying: \nYou know, the rowels on those spurs aren't very big. And I said: You \ndon't need a big rowel if you have a spirited horse. He said: I \nunderstand that.\n  We will celebrate this man's life this week. We named a post office \nin Billings, MT, 59105, after Ronald Reagan this year. I am proud of \nthat.\n  But what a gifted man he was, the way he could communicate, the way \nhe could touch people, the time he gave to this country for which we \nshould be very thankful. He wasn't a perfect man. I haven't seen one \nyet who didn't have a few bruises, scars, marks, bumps, warts, and \nsuch. But he was an American, and he was an American who took those \nprinciples to heart. He lived them every day he drew breath--while he \nwas in the White House and after he left the White House.\n  Mr. President, we welcome you back to Washington this week to \ncelebrate your life and your contribution to this great country. We \nsay, Thank you.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6493-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6493-S6494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their cooperation \nin regard to the work that the committee, Senator Levin and I, and all \nMembers of the committee have performed on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which is currently the pending business before the \nSenate.\n  I state to all Senators that the amendments are in now. We have quite \na few. In such time as staff will have this week, I and other Members \nof the committee will be working through these amendments. When the \nSenate resumes its business next week, my understanding is the \nleadership intends to bring up this bill and we will continue our work. \nWe are making progress.\n  At the same time, I commend the leadership of the Senate. It is most \nappropriate as a tribute to our late President and the deep respect so \nmany hold him in that this Senate will not be conducting its normal \nworkload this week.\n  Our committee had planned to have a very important hearing on \nThursday. We had confirmed witnesses and the hearing was set to have \nthe Deputy Secretary of State, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs before the committee. The principal agenda \nwe were going to address was the transition taking place in Iraq, the \ngovernment, our concerns regarding the hopeful U.N. Resolution, as well \nas documents being in place that will give a specific clarity to the \nquestion of the status of forces and how they will operate under the \nevolution of this new government. It is very important, not only for \nthe safety of each member of the Armed Forces of the United States but \nour coalition partners, as we continue to pursue the goal as laid down \nby our President and the Prime Minister of Great Britain and others in \nbringing about peace in Iraq and providing for a security situation \nsuch that they can enjoy the freedoms we in this country and other \ncountries enjoy.\n  I myself am anxious to receive the report of our majority leader and \nothers who were in Iraq meeting with officials. I will leave that for \nthe moment.\n  In conversations with the majority leader over the weekend, I was \nvery encouraged by the positive observations he provided.\n  We will not be able to move forward on this bill this week for very \nimportant reasons, nor will we have our hearing. I thought of having \nthe hearing the following week but, again, it is extremely difficult \nfor a committee to pursue a bill of this magnitude--and I think there \nare probably 200 amendments at the present time--and then have a \nhearing, which hearing would take 4 or 5 hours, in all probability. \nConsequently, I will not schedule a hearing that week, but I will be in \nconsultation with the Senate leadership and the members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Levin and all members of the \ncommittee, as to the course of action we will take to continue to \npursue the hearings we deem necessary to fulfill the basic parameters \nof the investigation regarding the prisoner situation that were laid \ndown in my opening statement on May 7 at which time the Secretary of \nDefense appeared before the committee.\n  There had been a lot of press speculation, comments, and inquiries to \nmy office about any changes. The answer, speaking for myself, is \nclearly no. It is my intention to try to achieve the necessary \noversight. We cannot predict every course of action of the committee \nbut basically the oversight we deem necessary on this important issue. \nAt the same time, we must recognize important work is being done by the \ncommittee in getting this bill through and adopted. It is important \nbecause the Appropriations Committee, I understand, is awaiting the \nbill and the House is anxious to get started with the conference. All \naspects are coming together.\n\n  So for the present time I am not able to give an exact prediction. We \nare looking at the possibility of the earliest possible hearing to \nreplace the one we are not going to have on Thursday. Thursday's \nhearing was going to be devoted to the transition of government and the \nsecurity of our forces and the framework within which our coalition \nwill operate in carrying out its mission. We nevertheless anticipated \nwe would get an update from the Departments of Defense and State with \nregard to the various inquiries and investigations now underway, all of \nwhich were instituted by the executive branch. As far as I am \nconcerned, the Department of Defense is pursuing those investigations \nin a very fair and objective and serious manner.\n  Speaking for myself, I think the Department of Defense has been \ntotally cooperative with me as chairman of the committee in bringing \ncertain documents and other matters to the attention of the committee. \nThere was a situation regarding General Taguba's report. I worked with \nthe Department. The Department, in a timely way, is bringing to the \nSenate for its examination such other records as we deem to have been \nwithin the framework of that report and bringing them to the Senate in \na timely fashion. They have been cooperative.\n  I thank all Senators. We will be resuming our series of hearings on \nnot only the prisoner situation but the transition in the government \nand other issues as quickly as we can following the completion of our \nbill in the Senate.\n  I also at this time draw the attention of all Senators to an \namendment which I put into the Record. The amendment is a very short \none. It states the title of this bill, subject to the adoption of this \namendment, will become the ``Ronald W. Reagan National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005.''\n\n  I have a number of cosponsors to this amendment at this time. I hope \ntomorrow other Senators might consider becoming cosponsors.\n  I was privileged to be in the Senate through his Presidency and, at \nvarious times, served as ranking member of the committee. His steadfast \ndetermination to strengthen America's defense is one of the hallmarks \nof his administrations. I was so privileged, as were other Members of \nthe body, to have worked with him on that buildup.\n  That buildup, in my judgment, clearly laid the foundation for the \neventual demise of the Soviet Union and the ability of diplomacy to \nwork more effectively because, undoubtedly, through his actions and his \nremarks, the world clearly knew this President was going to guide this \nNation to the position of such strength as necessary to back up \ndiplomacy. After all, I think as a doctrine well established, diplomacy \ncan only be as effective as a nation is capable of backing it up if it \nfails and have the determination to use such other assets as necessary \nto achieve its goals, in our case, in the area of the security and \nfreedom of our great Nation; namely, national defense.\n  Mr. President, with that, I think I will conclude my remarks, again \ndrawing the attention of Senators to this amendment that I was \nprivileged to submit together with Senator Frist, Senator Stevens, and, \nI must say, Senator Levin and Senator Inouye. So it is bipartisan in \nevery respect. And Senator Lieberman has joined us. So I hope other \nSenators might consider joining us as cosponsors during the course of \nbusiness tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain an amendment that I offered and was accepted by unanimous \nconsent on Friday, June 4, 2004. The amendment expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that the Department of Defense should set aside funds to \nassist those school districts with school-aged populations that are \nseverely affected by the Army's Residential Communities Initiative--\nRCI. In essence, it urges the Department to build and improve its \nhousing with an eye toward the needs of the surrounding civilian \ncommunity, to contribute to that community's public school system and \nto assist with those expansions and accommodations that are driven by \nan increased military presence.\n  In 1996, the Department began a project that will result in \napproximately 120,000 new housing units at 34 installations across the \nUnited States. The increase in family housing units will bring a \ncorresponding increase in school-age children to these bases. These \nchildren will be educated primarily at public schools. Indeed, of the \napproximately 750,000 current school-aged children of members of the \nactive duty Armed Forces in the United States, approximately 650,000 \nattend public schools.\n  President Truman created the Impact Aid Program in 1950 to reimburse\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\npublic school districts for the loss of traditional revenue sources \nresulting from a Federal presence or Federal activity. Since that time, \nnumerous school districts throughout the country have received direct \nassistance from the program. Impact Aid is unique among the Federal \neducation programs because it is one of the only programs in which \nfunds are sent directly to the school district with little or no \nintervening bureaucracy.\n  Although in recent years the program has not been fully funded, it \nstill provides critical support to school systems that contain Federal \nbases. School systems have three main sources of revenue for each \nstudent: State aid, local property taxes, and local taxes on \nbusinesses. Districts that contain Federal installations do not have \nthe benefit of collecting property taxes on the property upon which \nmilitary bases sit. Their schools educate children whose parents are \nstationed on base, but they do not receive the benefits of a tax base \nthat includes the property that these parents would occupy in normal \nschool districts. In other words, these districts have less money per \nchild with which to support their public schools.\n  The Impact Aid Program was created to alleviate some of the pressures \ncreated by a large military presence by providing funding for \nadditional students and programs to meet growth-related needs. But the \nDepartment's RCI program presents a unique situation for communities \nacross the country, including that of Anne Arundel County, which \ncontains Fort Meade. On the one hand RCI provides a commendable \nsolution. By rehabilitating dilapidated military housing, our service \nmen and women have safer, more comfortable places to live. We in \nMaryland are very proud of and grateful for our military presence and \nstrongly support the right of military families to have livable \ndwellings. But on the other hand our communities must have the \nDepartment participate as a full partner in those facilities its \npersonnel use.\n  It is only proper that the Department, as it improves its housing, \nconsider the impacts those improvements are likely to have on the \nsurrounding community, particularly the school system. My amendment \nasks the Department to do just that--to not only build and improve \nhousing, but to think of the community it is creating and to contribute \nto that community's needs as a partner. I believe this is the only \nresponsible way for the Department of Defense to proceed and I thank my \ncolleagues for supporting this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last Thursday, I submitted amendment No. \n3273 to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 \nrevising and extending the authority for the advisory panel to the \nAdministrator for Federal Procurement Policy on review of government \nprocurement laws and regulations\n  This amendment is intended to ensure that small business interests \nare represented both in the membership of the panel and in its \nactivities.\n  The advisory panel was created in Section 1423 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004, and was mandated to \nfocus on laws and regulations concerning the use of commercial \npractices, performance-based contracting, the performance of \nacquisition functions across agency lines of responsibility, and the \nuse of government-wide contracts. The panel was required to issue a \nreport a year after appointment, but, otherwise, the panel has no \nsubset date.\n  While the panel was to study contracting laws in different contexts, \nsmall business was not one of them. Further, Section 1423 provided that \nappointments were to be made in consultation with several government \nagencies and Congressional committees involved in procurement policy. \nAgain, neither the Small Business Administration nor the Congressional \nSmall Business Committees were mentioned. Finally, there as no mention \nof small business with regard to the panel's report.\n  As Chair of the Small Business Committee, I am profoundly troubled by \nthe omission of small business interests from the work of this panel. \nThe contracting practices to be studied by the panel have an enormous \nimpact on the ability of small business to participate in the Federal \nprocurement marketplace. The Senate must assure small businesses that \ntheir opinions about acquisition reforms will be heard.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It would require \nparticipation on the panel by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the \nSmall Business Administration or his designee. The Chief Counsel's \nOffice of Advocacy, created by Public Law 94-305, has a unique mandate \nto be an independent voice of small business before Congress and \nFederal agencies. Under Executive Order 13272 signed by President \nGeorge W. Bush, Federal agencies must consider the chief counsel's \ncomments on any proposed rules in order to ensure that our government's \npolicies will not cause harm to America's small business.\n  As we know, small businesses have been struggling to gain and retain \naccess to Federal contracts. Problems like contract bundling continue \nto persist, and many agencies still fail to meet their statutory small \nbusiness contracting goals. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy and his \ncapable staff have worked hard to tackle challenges faced by small \ncompanies in doing business with the Federal Government. Naming the \nchief counsel or his designee to this panel will enable the Office of \nAdvocacy to better carry out its statutory mandate, and it will \nfacilitate the implementation of President Bush's Executive order on \nconsideration of small business interests. The chief counsel, Mr. \nThomas M.

Mr. President, earlier today the Architect of the Capitol \nand I had the opportunity to participate in the ribbon cutting for a \nsmall, but important project on the Senate side of the Capitol.\n  At my request, the Architect and his staff built a demonstration rain \ngarden, also known as a low impact drainage project, last month just \noutside of parking lot 16 at the corner of First and D Streets, \nNortheast. A rain garden captures and filters runoff from parking lots \nto reduce stormwater flooding and keep pollutants from entering local \nstreams and rivers.\n  In the case of the Senate's rain garden, oil, gas, brake fluid, and \nother toxic substances from automobiles are filtered though a garden \nthat measures 18 ft x 65 ft x 5 ft just outside of the Lot 16 fence. \nThe garden, which is a very attractive addition to the landscaping here \non Capitol Hill, is not flat; it is built on an angle to pull runoff \ninto it. The water is filtered through rocks and a coarse mix of soil. \nThe soil is 50 percent sand, 30 percent topsoil, and 20 percent organic \nmaterials, such as composted leaf mulch. The annual and perennial \nplants in the rain garden were selected by the Landscape Architect due \nto their ability to withstand periods of heavy saturation, drought, and \nalso their ability to thrive in an environment that occasionally \nincludes a steady diet of pollutants.\n  Once the water is filtered, it is discharged into the existing \nstormwater\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nsewer system which, during periods of heavy rainfall can discharge \ndirectly into the Anacostia River and, eventually, the Chesapeake Bay. \nHowever, the rain garden filters out as much as 90 percent of the \npollutants that would otherwise go directly into the stormwater sewer. \nAs it turns out, a rain garden is a simple, inexpensive, yet attractive \nsolution to a very difficult problem in most urban areas.\n  While this rain garden will not solve all of the runoff problems on \nCapitol Hill, it will serve as a model that can be replicated \nthroughout the Capitol complex. As Members of the Senate we represent \nall 50 States, but we must never forget that we have a responsibility \nto be thoughtful and caring stewards of our Nation's Capital.\n  Now that the rain garden project is complete, I extend my thanks to \nDoug Siglin of the Anacostia River Initiative for bringing the concept \nto my attention last year, to the Architect of the Capitol, for moving \nthe project forward, and to Ecosite, the Maryland-based contractor, \nthat did the physical construction work on the project.\n  However, special thanks are reserved for the two people most \nresponsible for making this project a reality, Nancy Olkewicz, who \nworks for the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, and \nMatthew Evans, the Landscape Architect of the Capitol.\n  Matthew brought his great vision and gentle determination to bear on \nthis project and it shows in the way the rain garden blends seamlessly \ninto the overall Capitol Hill landscape plan. He has been pleasant and \nresponsive throughout this entire process and I appreciate his hard \nwork.\n  I asked Nancy to investigate whether a demonstration rain garden \ncould be built on Capitol Hill given all of the restrictions and rules \nthat govern everything that takes place within the Capitol complex. \nNancy took my request and ran with it. In large part, the rain garden \nis a product of her determination and doggedness in seeing it through \nto completion. I have great admiration for such perseverance and \nappreciate all that she does for me and the Senate, which she has made \nher professional home for 25 years.\n  The Senate rain garden was completed on time and under budget and \nwill undoubtedly contribute to a cleaner environment on Capitol Hill \nand throughout the region. I am pleased to have played a small role in \nits development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6495-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nanniversary of the Allied invasion of Western Europe.\n  Sixty years ago yesterday, Allied troops landed on the beaches and \nparachuted into the fields of Normandy in an effort that would lead to \nthe eventual destruction of the German Army and the liberation of the \nEuropean continent.\n  On the early morning of June 6, 1944, after years of logistical \ncoordination and deceptive intelligence operations, U.S. troops and \ntheir counterparts from Britain, France, Canada, and Poland brought to \nbear their enormous power and tremendous bravery on Hitler's military.\n  On that momentous day, over 150,000 Allied servicemen, including \n73,000 Americans, 5,000 ships, and more than 1,000 planes started to \nbeat back the German Army.\n  The attack began just after midnight when more than 13,000 \nparatroopers carrying between 70 and 90 pounds of equipment jumped down \ninto German-occupied territory. As these men fell through enemy fire to \nthe fields and farmland of Normandy, the largest armada ever assembled \nsteamed across the English Channel toward the French coast.\n  At 6:30 a.m., the first wave of troops arrived on the beaches, \nunloading tens of thousands of soldiers in the face of mortar, \nartillery, and machine gun fire from the cliffs above the Normandy \nbeaches.\n  A second wave of Allied Forces landed at 7 a.m., charging up hills \nand scaling cliffs through continued firepower. The fighting continued \nthroughout the day, and at day's end, the Allied casualties numbered \nnearly 10,000, of which 2,500 had died, including more than 1,400 \nAmericans.\n  But more than 100,000 Allied soldiers had made it ashore and secured \nFrench coastal towns. On D-Day Plus Five, June 11, over 325,000 Allied \ntroops, 54,000 vehicles, and 104,000 tons of supplies had arrived in \nNormandy.\n  The D-Day invasion was one of the most daring military operations in \nhistory and it succeeded because of the courage of Allied soldiers and \nthe careful planning of Allied military leaders. These brave troops and \ntheir leaders knew that this attack would determine the fate of Europe \nand much of the world for many years to come.\n  With success on the coast of Normandy, the Allies advanced across \nFrance, liberating village after village on the path to Berlin. The \nmassive landing and subsequent arrival of troops had allowed for a \nrelentless advance and cleared the way to a conclusion of the war.\n  The Americans who survived that day and that war are no longer young. \nIndeed, there are fewer D-Day veterans this year than last, and there \nwill be fewer still next year. Yet the men who fought on that day 60 \nyears ago, and the Americans who supported their efforts at home and \nabroad, have created a legacy of peace and prosperity that continues to \nreign across Europe today.\n  Europe is united, not by force of arms or tyranny, but by economic \nstrength and cooperation. Last month, 10 new countries joined the \nEuropean Union. Former battlefield adversaries now enjoy freedom of \nmovement, a single currency, and a secure future for themselves and \ntheir children.\n  The legacy of those D-Day veterans is also apparent in our Nation \ntoday. Just last week, thousands of veterans came to Washington, DC, to \ncelebrate the opening of the World War II Memorial. These veterans \nreminded us that the prosperity we have enjoyed for most of the past 60 \nyears came at a price--the 400,000 American lives that were lost during \nWorld War II.\n  The remarkable advancements in our Nation and the world during the \npast 60 years would not have been possible without the extraordinary \neffort undertaken by this generation of Americans and our allies who \nshared our commitment to freedom.\n  Today, courageous soldiers, sailors, marines, and pilots continue to \nserve and sacrifice for this country. As we remember the brave \nindividuals who served in Normandy and across the globe during World \nWar II, we must also honor the men and women of today's military who \nare in harm's way.\n  As of June 3, 126 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan and \nanother 818 have died in Iraq. Thousands more have been injured. These \nmen and women, along with their families, have made the ultimate \nsacrifice for our country. Today, I honor them and the approximately \n140,000 soldiers who continue to serve in the Middle East.\n  June 6, 1944, was a crucial day in the history of this Nation and the \nhistory of the world. Today we recognize the contribution of those who \nserved our Nation on that day and thank them for staring down tyranny \nand liberating Europe. They continue to serve our nation through the \nundiminished memory of a battle fought far from home for the good of \nall people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6495-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6495-S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MANIPULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKET\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the callous \nattitudes of Enron employees that were brought to light recently in \ntranscripts released by the Snohomish County Public Utility District in \nWashington and broadcast on CBS News.\n  These tapes provide concrete evidence of the manipulation and fraud \nthat was perpetrated by energy companies in the 2000-2001 energy crisis \nin California.\n  This manipulation resulted in the cost of energy in California \nincreasing from $7 billion in 1999 to $27 billion in 2000 and 2001, \nrespectively.\n  This type of price gouging and market manipulation can and will \nhappen again if the energy market is not restructured.\n  I urge the California State Legislature to take action on Speaker of \nthe Assembly Fabian Nunez's bill--AB 2006, the Reliable Electric \nService Act.\n  This bill would re-regulate the energy market and protect small \nconsumers served by utilities from this type of unethical behavior.\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\n  In more than a dozen taped conversations, the Enron power traders \nshow complete disdain for consumers throughout the West, and \nparticularly those in California.\n  While I cannot read the transcripts verbatim due to the coarse \nlanguage used by the traders, I would like to read to you some \nexcerpts: One trader sang: ``Burn, baby, burn. That's a beautiful \nthing.''\n  This was in reference to a wildfire that shut down a major \ntransmission line, decreasing power supplies and raising energy prices.\n  Another trader said: ``Just cut 'em off. They're so [expletive]. They \nshould just bring back . . . horses and carriages, . . . lamps, . . . \nkerosene lamps.'' (Expletives Deleted)\n  To have traders say these things shows a complete disregard for the \nhealth and safety of Californians. And this was not an isolated \ntrader--this was a mentality apparently endemic to Enron employees.\n  The only thing these traders cared about was how much money they \ncould bleed from the California marketplace.\n  Let me read you a second excerpt: One trader complained: ``They're \n[expletive] taking all the money back from you guys? All the money you \nguys stole from those poor grandmothers in California?''\n  A second responded: ``Yeah, grandma Millie, man.''\n  The first responded: ``Yeah, now she wants her [expletive] money back \nfor all the power you've charged right up, [expletive phrase], for \n[expletive] $250 a megawatt hour.''\n  To thumb your nose at a grandmother on a fixed income is completely \nreprehensible, but it was how these traders operated--with no \ncompassion for those suffering from their behavior--that galls me the \nmost.\n  When I heard these tapes, I knew that we could not expect any ethical \nconduct from traders in this energy market.\n  Let me read you another excerpt, this one illustrating the lengths \nthese traders would go to manipulate the market:\n\n       Tom: The headline before that is ``California Grid \n     Operators Call Stage 2 Power Emergency as Reserves Drop.''\n       Matt: Yeah. They're on the ropes today. I exported like a \n     [expletive] 400 megs.\n       Tom: Wow.\n       Matt: I bought it all. I'll see you guys--I'm takin' mine \n     to the desert.\n       Tom: [Expletive] 'em, right?\n       Matt: I think those gamblers in Las Vegas need the power \n     more than you.\n\n  Matt goes on to say that he and Enron were getting rich off of \nexporting power out of California when Californians needed it most.\n  The transcripts prove that Enron intentionally congested transmission \nlines and used its influence to delay wholesale price caps in order to \nmaximize its profits.\n  Other transcripts also prove that Enron traders made secret deals \nwith power producers, deliberately driving up prices by ordering power \nplants shut down.\n  But Enron did not act alone in manipulating the California energy \nmarket. In fact, this type of manipulation was pervasive among many \nenergy companies operating in California. Here are several more \nexamples.\n  Reliant, for instance, decided to game the market by deliberately \nholding back power generation for two days at its facility near Barstow \nin late June 2000. This is when the State needed power the most. Worse, \nthese decisions were made from the top. The vice-president of power \ntrading at Reliant directed traders to manipulate the market in this \nmanner.\n  At one point, Reliant charged the State of California $1,900 per \nmegawatt-hour for electricity, or approximately 6300 percent more than \nthe historic standard of $30 per megawatt-hour. Yet the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission only fined Reliant $13.8 million and the company \ndid not have to admit any guilt or wrongdoing.\n  Dynegy also demonstrated manipulative behavior such as load shifting, \nfalse reporting, and double selling. The company deliberately reported \nfalse gas market data to publications and created bogus trades to drive \nup the price of electricity.\n  Dynegy was only concerned with its bottom line in the first quarter \nof 2001, the company posted a recurring net income of $137.5 million, a \n73 percent increase in net income from the $79.4 million it reported in \n2000 and a 102 percent increase from the company's reported first \nquarter income in 1999.\n  For this manipulative behavior, FERC levied a fine of only $3 \nmillion, and, again, Dynegy did not have to admit any guilt.\n  In yet another instance, El Paso Merchant Energy and its affiliates \ninflated the price of natural gas by reducing deliveries to the State. \nIn fact, El Paso withheld capacity from at least 21 percent of its \npipelines that delivered natural gas to the California border. It is \nestimated that El Paso's price manipulation cost California's consumers \n$3.7 billion.\n  FERC settled with El Paso, letting them walk away, again, without \nadmitting any wrongdoing, for a $1.5 billion fine. That is only a \nfraction of the cost that California consumers were forced to bear due \nto El Paso's misdeeds.\n  These companies used many deliberate strategies to manipulate the \nmarket, which included: Death Star, Get Shorty, Fat Boy, Load Shift, \nBlack Widow, and Red Congo.\n  California is still suffering from this unethical conduct.\n  Californians are forced to pay higher prices for electricity because \nof long-term contracts that were signed when wholesale prices were \nartificially inflated by price manipulation.\n  And Californians still have not gotten the $9 billion in refunds they \ndeserve, which were overcharges as a result of Enron and other \ncompanies' manipulation of the energy markets.\n  These tapes provide concrete evidence that there was intentional \nmanipulation and fraud perpetrated by energy companies during the 2000-\n2001 energy crisis in California.\n  That is why I have joined my colleague, Senator Boxer, in calling \nupon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to immediately refund \nCalifornia the $9 billion that it is owed and to order a renegotiation \nof the long-term contracts that were made under manipulated prices.\n  These transcripts further prove that the rates Californians paid for \nelectricity were not ``just and reasonable.''\n  Consumers are not served well by a deregulated marketplace where \ntraders from companies including Enron, Dynegy, Reliant, Mirant, \nWilliams, AES, CMS, El Paso Merchant Energy, and Duke can manipulate \nthe market in the grossest way.\n  Absent strong action, I have no doubt that this unethical, immoral \nand illegal behavior will continue.\n  That is why I support re-regulating California's energy markets. \nSpeaker Nunez's bill would create a regulatory framework that will put \nCalifornia back in charge of its energy future.\n  The bill would attempt to ensure reliable electricity at stable and \naffordable rates for small customers; require California's utilities to \nmeet a renewable portfolio standard of 20 percent by 2010; and require \nutilities to have enough generation capacity to meet the demands of \ntheir consumers and have a significant reserve on hand in case of an \nemergency.\n  This bill will provide Californians the protection they need from \nexorbitant energy prices and energy traders with no ethical standards.\n  California was the first to experiment with de-regulation. Sadly, the \n1996 deregulation was a total failure for consumers in California.\n  We learned the hard way that energy is not a commodity like pork \nbellies or frozen orange juice, but is a public good.\n  California needs to put in place a new framework to take regulate the \nenergy market in order to ensure reliability and reasonable prices for \nconsumers.\n  In other words, consumers should be protected from price spikes, \nmarket manipulation, and blackouts.\n  In closing, I cannot express how disgusted I am by the newest Enron \ntranscripts.\n  I wish we could have prevented the manipulative behavior in the first \nplace.\n  Congress still has not acted to pass bills that would prevent this \nkind of unethical and immoral manipulative behavior in the energy \nmarkets, such as those that were offered by me, Senator Cantwell and \nothers.\n  As a result, I feel that California must act on its own to control \nits own energy supplies in order to prevent further manipulation of our \nmarkets and keep our lights on.\n  CBS News is to be commended for bringing these tapes to light.\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\n  It is imperative that we learn as much as we can about Enron's \nbehavior--so that we know its impact on the western energy markets and \nso that this type of fraud and manipulation can be prevented from ever \nhappening again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6497-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ROBERT CLIFFORD UERZ\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Robert \nClifford Uerz, an outstanding Vermonter and a national leader in the \nnot-for-profit sector. As he prepares to retire from his position as \npresident and CEO of the American Lung Association of Vermont, it is \nimportant to reflect on how much one person can accomplish in serving \nothers.\n  Robert ``Bob'' Uerz has had a distinguished career with the American \nLung Association. He has served the organization for a quarter of a \ncentury working in various chapters in the States of New York, \nConnecticut, and most recently serving in Vermont.\n  Bob has been on the forefront of the association's efforts in Vermont \nto carry forward its worthy goals of reducing the presence of lung \ndisease and improving lung health in our communities through preventive \nmeasures.\n  He was the primary force in establishing the American Lung \nAssociation's Asthma Clinical Research Center at the University of \nVermont, an institution that has served Vermonters and others by \nadvancing medical knowledge through research. I was indeed impressed \nwith the national implications of this study and responded by securing \n$500,000 in Federal funds to further our understanding of ways to \nprevent and treat asthma.\n  Bob has proven himself to be an effective educator and advocate in \nVermont by striving to protect and improve the quality of indoor and \noutdoor air and by expanding services to residents with lung disease or \nthose at risk of developing lung disease. His leadership was key to the \nestablishment of the Better Breathers Support Group Network in Vermont.\n  Bob has always brought a high level of integrity and dignity to every \ntask. It has become impossible to separate the identity and good name \nof the American Lung Association of Vermont from the name of Robert \nClifford Uerz.\n  Bob's unwavering commitment toward improving the quality of life of \nVermonters of all ages is a model for all who aspire to lead in the \nnot-for-profit sector. The people of our Green Mountain State are truly \nindebted to him. He has our best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6497-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One such crime occurred on November 18, 2001 in Huntington, WV. \nMichael Fife, 28, was beaten, robbed of $20 and left in an alley for \ndead while walking home from a gay nightclub. Mr. Fife suffered a \nfractured skull and internal bleeding. Due to a rash of hate crimes \nbiased against gays in the area, some believe that Mr. Fife may have \nbeen attacked because the alleged perpetrators thought he was gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to allow \nadditional\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\ntransit systems greater flexibility with certain mass transportation \nprojects; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill restore flexibility to small communities in the use of Federal \ntransit funding. As chairman of the Senate's Surface Transportation \nSubcommittee, I recognize the value of mass transit. Public transit is \nthe first choice of transportation for many Americans. Local options \nsuch as buses, light rail and subways are affordable, friendly to the \nenvironment, and reduce traffic congestion.\n  I know the limited availability of Federal funds for the Nation's \nextensive transportation needs requires creative solutions. For this \nreason, I have introduced this bill to correct an inequity in current \nlaw. The 1998 TEA-21 bill phased out operating assistance for mass \ntransit except in small communities, using a population of 200,000 as \nthe benchmark. Nationwide, more than 30 cities that are generally \nconsidered small transit communities because they operate fewer than \n100 buses at peak hours exceeded that threshold in the 2000 Census. In \nTexas, the city of Lubbock is caught in this discrepancy. The 2000 \nCensus also treated metropolitan areas composed of two or more adjacent \ncities as one statistical unit, and many of these units, such as Denton \nand Lewisville in Texas, subsequently ceased to qualify as small \ntransit communities without increasing the size of their transit \nsystems.\n  This bill would allow the Secretary of Transportation to make grants \nto a transit system for mass transportation operating costs in an \nurbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 if such transit \nsystem operates less than 100 buses. Smaller communities have always \nrelied on Federal operating assistance for public transportation. \nAlthough bus systems may generate profits, the revenues of such limited \nofferings are not enough to finance administrative and other overhead \ncosts not associated with capital purchases.\n  While Congress works to reauthorize highway and other surface \ntransportation programs for another 6 years, the need for this \ntechnical correction cannot be ignored. To ensure quality mass transit \nin States, small transit communities operating fewer than 100 buses \nshould be permitted to use Federal funding as needed for capital \ninvestments or operating expenses.\n  I am proud to offer this bill that provides an important correction \nfor small transit systems, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transit System Flexibility \n     Protection Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GENERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 5307(b)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end of the following:\n       ``The Secretary may make grants under this section to a \n     transit system to finance the operating cost of equipment and \n     facilities for use in mass transportation in an urbanized \n     area with a population of more than 200,000 if such transit \n     system operates less than 100 buses on fixed route service \n     during peak service hours.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2508. A bill to redesignate the Ridges Basin Reservoir, Colorado, \nas Lake Nighthorse; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great honor and \nprivilege to introduce a bill that would rename Ridges Basin Reservoir \nin Colorado as Lake Nighthorse after my dear friend and colleague, the \nSenior Senator from Colorado, Ben Nighthorse Campbell. It is fitting \nthat the Ridges Basin Reservoir, which was created pursuant to \nlegislation introduced and shepherded through congress by Senator \nCampbell, bear his name. I hope the United States Congress will give \nthis legislation its every consideration.\n  A veteran, Olympian, and public servant, Senator Campbell has \nselflessly devoted himself to serving his State and country for over \nhalf a century. During his seventeen years in the United State \nCongress, Senator Campbell has earned respect on both sides of the \naisle as a consummate statesman and staunch advocate for the State of \nColorado.\n  As you know, Senator Campbell recently announced that he will not \nseek a third term to the United States Senate. This is a great loss to \nthe Nation and to the great State of Colorado, but most of all, it is a \nsignificant loss to the Senate. His leadership and presence will be \ngreatly missed by all of us. I wish him the best of luck in all of his \nfuture endeavors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RENAMING OF RESERVOIR.\n\n       The reservoir known as the ``Ridges Basin Reservoir'' \n     located on the Animas River in Colorado, constructed under \n     section 6(a) of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights \n     Settlement Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 2975; 114 Stat. 2763A-260), \n     shall be known and designated as ``Lake Nighthorse''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 370\n\n       Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (also \n     known as AD/HD or ADD), is a chronic neurobiological \n     disorder, affecting both children and adults, that can \n     significantly interfere with an individual's ability to \n     regulate activity level, inhibit behavior, and attend to \n     tasks in developmentally appropriate ways;\n       Whereas AD/HD can cause devastating consequences, including \n     failure in school and the workplace, antisocial behavior, \n     encounters with the justice system, interpersonal \n     difficulties, and substance abuse;\n       Whereas AD/HD, the most extensively studied mental disorder \n     in children, affects an estimated 3 percent to 7 percent \n     (2,000,000) of young school-age children and an estimated 4 \n     percent (8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, and \n     socioeconomic lines;\n       Whereas scientific studies clearly indicate that AD/HD runs \n     in families and suggest that\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n     genetic inheritance is an important risk factor, with between \n     10 and 35 percent of children with AD/HD having a first-\n     degree relative with past or present AD/HD, and with \n     approximately 50 percent of parents who had AD/HD having a \n     child with the disorder;\n       Whereas despite the serious consequences that can manifest \n     in the family and life experiences of an individual with AD/\n     HD, studies indicate that less than 85 percent of adults with \n     the disorder are diagnosed and less than half of children and \n     adults with the disorder are receiving treatment;\n        Whereas poor and minority communities are particularly \n     underserved by AD/HD resources;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General, the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), the American Psychiatric Association, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), \n     the American Psychological Association, the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics (AAP), the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), and the National Institute of Mental \n     Health, among others, recognize the need for proper \n     diagnosis, education, and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas the lack of public knowledge and understanding of \n     the disorder play a significant role in the overwhelming \n     numbers of undiagnosed and untreated cases of AD/HD, and the \n     dissemination of inaccurate, misleading information \n     contributes to the obstacles preventing diagnosis and \n     treatment of the disorder;\n        Whereas lack of knowledge, combined with the issue of \n     stigma associated with AD/HD, has a particularly detrimental \n     effect on the diagnosis and treatment of AD/HD;\n       Whereas there is a need to educate health care \n     professionals, employers, and educators about the disorder \n     and a need for well-trained mental health professionals \n     capable of conducting proper diagnosis and treatment \n     activities; and\n       Whereas studies by the National Institute of Mental Health \n     and others consistently reveal that through proper and \n     comprehensive diagnosis and treatment, the symptoms of AD/HD \n     can be substantially decreased and quality of life for the \n     individual can be improved: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 7, 2004, as ``National Attention \n     Deficit Disorder Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n     (AD/HD) as a major public health concern;\n       (3) encourages all people of the United States to find out \n     more about AD/HD and its supporting mental health services, \n     and to seek the appropriate treatment and support, if \n     necessary;\n       (4) expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility to--\n       (A) endeavor to raise public awareness about AD/HD; and\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to, and the \n     quality of, mental health services dedicated to the purpose \n     of improving the quality of life for children and adults with \n     AD/HD; and\n       (5) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 371--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF RONALD WILSON REAGAN, \n                THE 40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 371\n\n       Resolved, That in recognition of the long and distinguished \n     service rendered to the Nation by the late Ronald Wilson \n     Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, when the \n     Senate recesses or adjourns on each of the days during the \n     period from June 7 through June 11, 2004, it do so as a \n     further mark of respect to the memory of Ronald Wilson \n     Reagan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 115--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF \n THE CAPITOL FOR THE LYING IN STATE OF THE REMAINS OF THE LATE RONALD \n           WILSON REAGAN, 40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Dodd) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                            S.

INCLUSION OF CERTAIN FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT \n                   UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS \n                   COMPENSATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon \n     Springs facility) were exposed to levels of radionuclides and \n     radioactive materials that were much greater than the current \n     maximum allowable Federal standards.\n       (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.\n       (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures.\n       (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage.\n       (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their \n     health endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials.\n       (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.\n       (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radionuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of May 13, \n     2004, the rule has yet to be finalized.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398);

INCLUSION OF CERTAIN FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT \n                   UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS \n                   COMPENSATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon \n     Springs facility) were exposed to levels of radionuclides and \n     radioactive materials that were much greater than the current \n     maximum allowable Federal standards.\n       (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.\n       (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures.\n       (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage.\n       (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their \n     health endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials.\n       (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.\n       (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radionuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of May 13, \n     2004, the rule has yet to be finalized.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398);

HUMANE TREATMENT OF DETAINEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) After World War II, the United States and its allies \n     created a new international legal order based on respect for \n     human rights. One of its fundamental tenets was a universal \n     prohibition on torture and ill treatment.\n       (2) On June 26, 2003, the International Day in Support of \n     Victims of Torture, President George W. Bush stated, ``The \n     United States is committed to the world-wide elimination of \n     torture and we are leading this fight by example. I call on \n     all governments to join with the United States and the \n     community of law-abiding nations in prohibiting, \n     investigating, and prosecuting all acts of torture and in \n     undertaking to prevent other cruel and unusual punishment.''.\n       (3) The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, \n     which prohibit torture, cruel treatment, or outrages upon \n     personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading \n     treatment, during armed conflict.\n       (4) The United States is a party to 2 treaties that \n     prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment, as follows:\n       (A) The International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, done at New York December 16, 1966.\n       (B) The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \n     or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York \n     December 10, 1984.\n       (5) The United States filed reservations to the treaties \n     described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) \n     stating that the United States considers itself bound to \n     prevent ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' to the extent that phrase means the cruel, \n     unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by \n     the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, or 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n       (6) Army Regulation 190-8 entitled ``Enemy Prisoners of \n     War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other \n     Detainees'' provides that ``Inhumane treatment is a serious \n     and punishable violation under international law and the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). . . . All prisoners \n     will receive humane treatment without regard to race, \n     nationality, religion, political opinion, sex, or other \n     criteria. The following acts are prohibited: murder, torture, \n     corporal punishment, mutilation, the taking of hostages, \n     sensory deprivation, collective punishments, execution \n     without trial by proper authority, and all cruel and \n     degrading treatment. . . . All persons will be respected as \n     human beings. They will be protected against all acts of \n     violence to include rape, forced prostitution, assault and \n     theft, insults, public curiosity, bodily injury, and \n     reprisals of any kind. . . . This list is not exclusive.''.\n       (7) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n     Department of the Army states that ``acts of violence or \n     intimidation, including physical or mental torture, threats, \n     insults, or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or \n     an aid to interrogation'' are ``illegal''. Such Manual \n     defines ``infliction of pain through . . . bondage (other \n     than legitimate use of restraints to prevent escape)'', \n     ``forcing an individual to stand, sit, or kneel in abnormal \n     positions for prolonged periods of time'', ``food \n     deprivation'', and ``any form of beating'' as ``physical \n     torture'', defines ``abnormal sleep deprivation'' as ``mental \n     torture'', and prohibits the use of such tactics under any \n     circumstances.\n       (8) The Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation of the \n     Department of the Army states that ``Use of torture and other \n     illegal methods is a poor technique that yields unreliable \n     results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can \n     induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator \n     wants to hear. Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel \n     will bring discredit upon the U.S. and its armed forces while \n     undermining domestic and international support for the war \n     effort. It may also place U.S. and allied personnel in enemy \n     hands at a greater risk of abuse by their captors.''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading \n     Treatment or Punishment.--(1) No person in the custody or \n     under the physical control of the United States shall be \n     subject to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws, \n     or treaties of the United States.\n       (2) Nothing in this section shall affect the status of any \n     person under the Geneva Conventions or whether any person is \n     entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n       (c) Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines.--(1) Not later than \n     180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall prescribe the rules, regulations, or \n     guidelines necessary to ensure compliance with the \n     prohibition in subsection (b)(1) by the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and by any person providing services to \n     the Department of Defense on a contract basis.\n       (2) The Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees the rules, regulations, or guidelines prescribed \n     under paragraph (1), and any modifications to such rules, \n     regulations, or guidelines--\n       (A) not later than 30 days after the effective date of such \n     rules, regulations, guidelines, or modifications; and\n       (B) in a manner and form that will protect the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--(1) The Secretary shall submit, on \n     a timely basis and not less than twice each year, a report to \n     Congress on the circumstances surrounding any investigation \n     of a possible violation of the prohibition in subsection \n     (b)(1) by a member of the Armed Forces or by a person \n     providing services to the Department of Defense on a contract \n     basis.\n       (2) A report required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in a manner and form that--\n       (A) will protect the national security interests of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) will not prejudice any prosecution of an individual \n     involved in, or responsible for, a violation of the \n     prohibition in subsection (b)(1).\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment'' means the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment \n     or punishment prohibited by the 5th amendment, 8th amendment, \n     or 14th amendment to the Constitution.\n       (2) The term ``Geneva Conventions'' means--\n       (A) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, done at \n     Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);\n       (B) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of \n     the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at \n     Sea, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);\n       (C) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners \n     of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and\n       (D) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian \n     Persons in Time of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST \n     3516).\n       (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Defense.\n       (4) The term ``torture'' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 2340 of title 18, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3387.

Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Bond) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 2400, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2005 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Services, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XXXI, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3146. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT \n                   UNDER THE ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS \n                   COMPENSATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Energy workers at the former Mallinkrodt facilities \n     (including the St. Louis downtown facility and the Weldon \n     Springs facility) were exposed to levels of radionuclides and \n     radioactive materials that were much greater than the current \n     maximum allowable Federal standards.\n       (2) The Mallinkrodt workers at the St. Louis site were \n     exposed to excessive levels of airborne uranium dust relative \n     to the standards in effect during the time, and many workers \n     were exposed to 200 times the preferred levels of exposure.\n       (3)(A) The chief safety officer for the Atomic Energy \n     Commission during the Mallinkrodt-St. Louis operations \n     described the facility as 1 of the 2 worst plants with \n     respect to worker exposures.\n       (B) Workers were excreting in excess of a milligram of \n     uranium per day causing kidney damage.\n       (C) A recent epidemiological study found excess levels of \n     nephritis and kidney cancer from inhalation of uranium dusts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has admitted that those \n     Mallinkrodt workers were subjected to risks and had their \n     health endangered as a result of working with these highly \n     radioactive materials.\n       (5) The Department of Energy reported that workers at the \n     Weldon Springs feed materials plant handled plutonium and \n     recycled uranium, which are highly radioactive.\n       (6) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health admits that--\n       (A) the operations at the St. Louis downtown site consisted \n     of intense periods of processing extremely high levels of \n     radionuclides; and\n       (B) the Institute has virtually no personal monitoring data \n     for Mallinkrodt workers prior to 1948.\n       (7) The National Institute of Occupational Safety and \n     Health has informed claimants and their survivors at those 3 \n     Mallinkrodt sites that if they are not interviewed as a part \n     of the dose reconstruction process, it--\n       (A) would hinder the ability of the Institute to conduct \n     dose reconstruction for the claimant; and\n       (B) may result in a dose reconstruction that incompletely \n     or inaccurately estimates the radiation dose to which the \n     energy employee named in the claim had been exposed.\n       (8) Energy workers at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (also \n     known as the Burlington Atomic Energy Commission Plant and \n     the Iowa Ordnance Plant) between 1947 and 1975 were exposed \n     to levels of radionuclides and radioactive material, \n     including enriched uranium, plutonium, tritium, and depleted \n     uranium, in addition to beryllium and photon radiation, that \n     are greater than the current maximum Federal standards for \n     exposure.\n       (9) According to the National Institute of Occupational \n     Safety and Health--\n       (A) between 1947 and 1975, no records, including bioassays \n     or air samples, have been located that indicate any \n     monitoring occurred of internal doses of radiation to which \n     workers described in paragraph (8) were exposed;\n       (B) between 1947 and 1955, no records, including dosimetry \n     badges, have been located to indicate that any monitoring \n     occurred of the external doses of radiation to which such \n     workers were exposed;\n       (C) between 1955 and 1962, records indicate that only 8 to \n     23 workers in a workforce of over 1,000 were monitored for \n     external radiation doses; and\n       (D) between 1970 and 1975, the high point of screening at \n     the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, only 25 percent of the \n     workforce was screened for exposure to external radiation.\n       (10) The Department of Health and Human Services published \n     the first notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the \n     Special Exposure Cohort on June 25, 2002, and as of May 13, \n     2004, the rule has yet to be finalized.\n       (11) Many of those former workers have died while waiting \n     for the proposed rule to be finalized, including some \n     claimants who were waiting for dose reconstruction to be \n     completed.\n       (12) Because of the aforementioned reasons, including the \n     serious lack of records and the death of many potential \n     claimants, it is not feasible to conduct valid dose \n     reconstructions for the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant facility \n     or the Mallinkrodt facilities.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Former Workers in Cohort.--Section \n     3621(14) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000 (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398);

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on \n     December 7, 1941, and Congress declared war on Japan the \n     following day;\n       (2) the military code developed by the United States for \n     transmitting messages had been deciphered by the Axis powers, \n     and United States military intelligence sought to develop a \n     new means to counter the enemy;\n       (3) the Federal Government called on the Comanche Nation to \n     support the military effort by recruiting and enlisting \n     Comanche men to serve in the United States Army to develop a \n     secret code based on the Comanche language;\n       (4) at the time, the Comanches were--\n       (A) considered to be second-class citizens; and\n       (B) discouraged from using their own language;\n       (5) the Comanches of the 4th Signal Division became known \n     as the `Comanche Code Talkers' and helped to develop a code \n     using their language to communicate military messages during \n     the D-Day invasion and in the European theater during World \n     War II;\n       (6) to the frustration of the enemy, the code developed by \n     those Native Americans--\n       (A) proved to be unbreakable; and\n       (B) was used extensively throughout the European war \n     theater;\n       (7) the Comanche language, discouraged in the past, was \n     instrumental in developing 1 of the most significant and \n     successful military codes of World War II;\n       (8) the efforts of the Comanche Code Talkers--\n       (A) contributed greatly to the Allied war effort in Europe;\n       (B) were instrumental in winning the war in Europe; and\n       (C) their efforts saved countless lives;\n       (9) only 1 of the Comanche Code Talkers of World War 11 \n     remains alive today; and\n       (10) the time has come for Congress to honor the Comanche \n     Code Talkers for their valor and service to the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 202.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on April 6, 1917, the United States, after \n     extraordinary provocations, declared war on Germany and \n     entered World War I, the War to End All Wars;\n       (2) at the time of that declaration of war, Indian people \n     in the United States, including members of the Choctaw \n     Nation, were not accorded the status of citizens of the \n     United States;\n       (3) without regard to this lack of citizenship, many \n     members of the Choctaw Nation joined many members of other \n     Indian tribes and nations in enlisting in the Armed Forces to \n     fight on behalf of the United States;\n       (4) members of the Choctaw Nation were--\n       (A) enlisted in the force known as the American \n     Expeditionary Force, which began hostile actions in France in \n     the fall of 1917; and\n       (B) incorporated in a company of Indian enlistees serving \n     in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th Division;\n       (5) a major impediment to Allied operations in general, and \n     operations of the United States in particular, was the fact \n     that the German forces had deciphered all codes used for \n     transmitting information between Allied commands, leading to \n     substantial loss of men and materiel during the first year in \n     which the military of the United States engaged in combat in \n     World War I;\n       (6) because of the proximity and static nature of the \n     battle lines, a method to communicate without the knowledge \n     of the enemy was needed;\n       (7) a commander of the United States realized the fact that \n     he had under his command a number of men who spoke a native \n     language;\n       (8) while the use of such native languages was discouraged \n     by the Federal Government, the commander sought out and \n     recruited 18 Choctaw Indians to assist in transmitting field \n     telephone communications during an upcoming campaign;\n       (9) because the language used by the Choctaw soldiers in \n     the transmission of information was not based on a European \n     language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were \n     unable to understand any of the transmissions;\n       (10) the Choctaw soldiers were placed in different command \n     positions to achieve the widest practicable area for \n     communications;\n       (11) the use of the Choctaw Code Talkers was particularly \n     important in--\n       (A) the movement of American soldiers in October of 1918 \n     (including securing forward and exposed positions);\n       (B) the protection of supplies during American action \n     (including protecting gun emplacements from enemy shelling); \n     and\n       (C) in the preparation for the assault on German positions \n     in the final stages of combat operations in the fall of 1918;\n       (12) in the opinion of the officers involved, the use of \n     Choctaw Indians to transmit information in their native \n     language saved men and munitions, and was highly successful;\n       (13) based on that successful experience, Choctaw Indians \n     were withdrawn from frontline units for training in \n     transmission of codes so as to be more widely used when the \n     war came to an end;\n       (14) the Germans never succeeded in breaking the Choctaw \n     code;\n       (15) that was the first time in modern warfare that the \n     transmission of messages in a Native American language was \n     used for the purpose of confusing the enemy;\n       (16) this action by members of the Choctaw Nation--\n       (A) is another example of the commitment of Native \n     Americans to the defense of the United States; and\n       (B) adds to the proud legacy of such service; and\n       (17) the Choctaw Nation has honored the actions of those 18 \n     Choctaw Code Talkers through a memorial bearing their names \n     located at the entrance of the tribal complex in Durant, \n     Oklahoma.\n\n     SEC. 302. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \n     President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate \n     arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, \n     of a gold medal of appropriate design honoring the Choctaw \n     Code Talkers.\n\n                   TITLE IV--SAC AND FOX CODE TALKERS\n\n     SEC. 401. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\n       (1) Sac and Fox Indians used their native language, \n     Meskwaki to transmit military code during World War II;\n       (2) those individuals, who manned radio communications \n     networks to advise of enemy actions, became known as the Sac \n     and Fox Code Talkers; and\n       (3) under heavy combat action, the Code Talkers worked \n     without sleep to provide information that saved the lives of \n     many Americans.\n\n     SEC. 402.\n\n       The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \n     President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate \n     arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, of \n     a gold medal of appropriate design to each of the following \n     Sac and Fox Code Talkers of World War II, in recognition of \n     contributions of those individuals to the United States:\n       (1) Frank Sanache.\n       (2) Willard Sanache.\n       (3) Dewey Youngbear.\n       (4) Edward Benson.\n       (5) Judie Wayne Wabaunasee.\n       (6) Mike Wayne Wabaunasee.\n       (7) Dewey Roberts.\n       (8) Melvin Twin.\n\n                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. DEFINITION OF INDIAN TRIBE.\n\n       In this title, the term `Indian tribe' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 4506).\n\n     SEC. 502.

DRUG ERADICATION EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States engaged in military action against \n     the Taliban-controlled Government of Afghanistan in 2001 in \n     direct response to the Taliban's support and aid to Al Qaeda.\n       (2) The military action against the Taliban in Afghanistan \n     was designed, in part, to disrupt the activities of, and \n     financial support for, terrorists.\n       (3) A greater percentage of the world's opium supply is now \n     produced in Afghanistan than before the Taliban banned the \n     cultivation or trade of opium.\n       (4) In 2004, more than two years after the Taliban was \n     forcefully removed from power, Afghanistan is supplying \n     approximately 75 percent of the world's heroin.\n       (5) The estimated value of the opium harvested in \n     Afghanistan in 2003 was $2,300,000,000.\n       (6) Some of the profits associated with opium harvested in \n     Afghanistan continue to fund terrorists and terrorist \n     organizations, including Al Qaeda, that seek to attack the \n     United States and United States interests.\n       (7) The global war on terror is and should remain our \n     Nation's highest national security priority.\n       (8) United States and Coalition counterdrug efforts in \n     Afghanistan have not yet produced significant results.\n       (9) There are indications of strong, direct connections \n     between terrorism and drug trafficking.\n       (10) The elimination of this funding source is critical to \n     making significant progress in the global war on terror.\n       (11) The President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has stated \n     that opium production poses a significant threat to the \n     future of Afghanistan, and has established a plan of action \n     to deal with this threat.\n       (12) The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has \n     reported that Afghanistan is at risk of again becoming a \n     failed state if strong actions are not taken against \n     narcotics.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the substantial reduction of \n     drug trafficking in Afghanistan a priority in the war on \n     terror;\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should, in coordination with \n     the Secretary of State, work to a greater extent in \n     cooperation with the Government of Afghanistan and \n     international anti-drug agencies to assist in the protection \n     of anti-drug personnel in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) because the trafficking of narcotics is known to \n     support terrorist activities and contributes to the \n     instability of the Government of Afghanistan, additional \n     efforts should be made by the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, in conjunction with and in support of coalition \n     forces, to significantly reduce narcotics trafficking in \n     Afghanistan and neighboring countries, with particular focus \n     on those trafficking organizations with the closest links to \n     known terrorist organizations.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report that describes--\n       (1) progress made towards substantially reducing the poppy \n     cultivation and heroin production capabilities in \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (2) the extent to which profits from illegal drug activity \n     in Afghanistan fund terrorist organizations and support \n     groups that seek\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\n     to undermine the Government of Afghanistan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3403.

Mr. KENNEDY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 2400, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2005 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nServices, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CLARIFICATION OF AVAILABILITY OF PRIVATE RIGHT OF \n                   ACTION FOR STATE VIOLATIONS OF UNIFORMED \n                   SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT \n                   OF 1994.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Government has an important interest in \n     attracting and training a military to provide for the \n     National defense. The Constitution grants Congress the power \n     to raise and support an army for purposes of the common \n     defense. The Nation's military readiness requires that all \n     members of the Armed Forces, including those employed in \n     State programs and activities, be able to serve without \n     jeopardizing their civilian employment opportunities.\n       (2) The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \n     Rights Act of 1994, commonly referred to as ``USERRA'' and \n     codified\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\n     as chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, is intended to \n     safeguard the reemployment rights of members of the uniformed \n     services (as that term is defined in section 4303(16) of \n     title 38, United States Code) and to prevent discrimination \n     against any person who is a member of, applies to be a member \n     of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an \n     obligation to perform service in a uniformed service. \n     Effective enforcement of the Act depends on the ability of \n     private individuals to enforce its provisions in court.\n       (3) In Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 \n     (1996), the Supreme Court held that congressional legislation \n     enacted pursuant to the commerce clause of Article I, section \n     8, of the Constitution cannot abrogate the immunity of States \n     under the 11th amendment to the Constitution. In addition, in \n     Alden v. Maine 527 U.S. 706, 712 (1999), the Supreme Court \n     held that this immunity also prohibits the Federal Government \n     from subjecting ``non-consenting states to private suits for \n     damages in state courts.'' Some courts have cited the \n     sovereign immunity prinicples of Alden and Seminole Tribe to \n     prohibit state employees from maintaining a private suit to \n     enforce their USERRA rights. As a result, although USERRA \n     specifically provides that a person may commence an action \n     for relief against a State for its violation of that Act, \n     persons harmed by State violations of that Act lack important \n     remedies to vindicate the rights and benefits that are \n     available to all other persons covered by that Act. Unless a \n     State chooses to waive sovereign immunity, or the Attorney \n     General brings an action on their behalf, persons affected by \n     State violations of USERRA may have no adequate Federal \n     remedy for such violations.\n       (4) A failure to provide a private right of action by \n     persons affected by State violations of USERRA would leave \n     vindication of their rights and benefits under that Act \n     solely to Federal agencies, which may fail to take necessary \n     and appropriate action because of administrative overburden \n     or other reasons. Action by Congress to specify such a \n     private right of action ensures that persons affected by \n     State violations of USERRA have a remedy if they are denied \n     their rights and benefits under that Act.\n       (b) Clarification of Right of Action Under USERRA.--Section \n     4323 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by striking paragraph (2) and \n     inserting the following new paragraph (2):\n       ``(2) In the case of an action against a State (as an \n     employer) by a person, the action may be brought in a \n     district court of the United States or State court of \n     competent jurisdiction.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (j) as subsection (k); and\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (i) the following new \n     subsection (j):\n       ``(j)(1)(A) A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     amendment to the Constitution or otherwise, to a suit brought \n     by an employee of that program or activity under this chapter \n     for the rights or benefits authorized the employee by this \n     chapter.\n       ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `program or activity' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 309 of the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6107).\n       ``(2) An official of a State may be sued in the official \n     capacity of the official by any person covered by paragraph \n     (1) who seeks injunctive relief against a State (as an \n     employer) under subsection (e). In such a suit the court may \n     award to the prevailing party those costs authorized by \n     section 722 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3413.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Authorization for \n     Multilateral Iraq Stabilization Force Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 1302.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES POLICIES TOWARD \n                   IRAQ.\n\n         It is the sense of Congress that--\n         (1) the end of the regime of Saddam Hussein presents an \n     opportunity for the Iraqi people to build a new government;\n         (2) the United States should reassess its laws and \n     policies that were intended to apply to the government of \n     Saddam Hussein, to determine whether those laws and policies \n     should still apply to a new government in Iraq;\n         (3) the crimes of Saddam Hussein's government should not \n     be forgotten, but that the new authorities in Iraq should be \n     afforded a fresh start to establish a government under \n     principles consistent with international standards of \n     behavior; and\n         (4) the President should work with the United Nations \n     Security Council to effect the sunset of prior Security \n     Council resolutions that placed punitive obligations upon the \n     government of Saddam Hussein, so as to insure that a new \n     Iraqi government is not unfairly burdened or prejudiced by \n     the actions of the prior regime.\n\n     SEC. 1306.

As I \nstated earlier today, we will delay action on the Defense bill until \nnext week. We do now have copies at the desk of all amendments that may \nbe offered to the Defense authorization bill. Although we will not be \ndebating those amendments on the floor this week, we now have an \nopportunity for the chairman and ranking member to review the language \nof the amendments.\n  Tomorrow we will also be considering any additional resolutions \nrelating to the passing of our former President and therefore rollcall \nvotes may occur. However, no rollcall votes will occur prior to the \nrecess for the party policy luncheons tomorrow.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that when the Senate completes its \nbusiness on Wednesday afternoon, we will adjourn until Monday, June 14 \nto accommodate the ceremony and services relating to the death of \nPresident Ronald Reagan. Having said that, I invite my colleagues to \ncome to the floor over the course of the next 2 days to express \nthemselves during this solemn time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are totally comfortable and think the \nleader has done the right thing regarding the schedule. It is totally \nappropriate and we will, of course, cooperate as much as we can to make \nsure we do our work on the Defense bill next week. It is important \nlegislation, and we need to complete that.\n  I direct a question, through the Chair, to the distinguished majority \nleader. There will be some votes, or at least one vote, tomorrow on \nsome resolutions, I would assume. Does the majority leader have any \nidea when?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we should continue our conversation. We \nwill be voting on several resolutions in all likelihood. Whether there \nwill be rollcall votes has not been determined. I expect that through \njoint discussions we will decide whether rollcall votes will be \nnecessary. We certainly will not be voting, as we talked earlier, \nbefore 2:15. It may be that we will have no rollcall votes tomorrow, \nbut that decision will be made with further discussion among the \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/07/senate-section/article/S6593-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come \nbefore the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nadjournment under the provisions of S. Res. 371, as a further mark of \nrespect to the memory of Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:03 p.m., adjourned until \nTuesday, June 8, 2004, at 9:45 a.m.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}]
