Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. Under the order, the Cantwell \nsecond-degree amendment to the electricity amendment will be debated \nfor 2\\1/2\\ hours. Following the disposition of that amendment, we will \nhave 60 minutes prior to the cloture vote on the Estrada nomination. \nThis will be the seventh cloture vote on his nomination.\n  Following the cloture vote, we will resume the electricity amendment \nand, hopefully, we will reach an agreement for the consideration of the \ntwo Bingaman second-degree amendments on electricity. The chairman has \nstated it is his desire for the Senate to work its will on those second \ndegrees and then vote on the underlying electricity amendment. We hope \nto reach an agreement to allow for that to occur at a reasonable time \nthis afternoon. In addition, there have been discussions about debating \nand voting in relation to several climate-related amendments during \ntoday's session. I certainly hope we can reach reasonable time limits \non the amendments as we go forward, so we can have a productive day on \nthe Energy bill. Senators should be prepared to work into the evening \nwith votes as we move through the remaining amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10171-7", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10171-S10172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the majority leader is on the floor, \nwe have had a number of conversations privately and publicly with the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico on this electricity title. As I \nindicated last night, we have Senators Feinstein, Feingold, Boxer, \nDayton, and Cantwell who have amendments to offer. All of them but \nSenator Cantwell have single amendments. Senator Cantwell may have two \nor three others. We will work with Senator Domenici to have time \nagreements on these. I\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\nam confident and hopeful that the Senators offering the amendments will \nagree to time agreements.\n  I also note--and I say this as respectfully as I can to the \ndistinguished majority leader, who I know has such a difficult job--the \nelectricity title is very complicated. I think we are approaching this \nin the right way, to move through it as quickly as possible. We are \ncooperating in that regard. It makes it really difficult, as somebody \ntrying to help move this along and help the two managers, to have these \nstops and starts. We just get going on something and then we have votes \non judges.\n  I want everybody to understand I know how important Senator Hatch and \nothers believe it is about these judges. For example, on Estrada, this \nwill be the seventh vote. The votes are not going to change. We will \ntake an hour of debate on that and get off the Energy bill, and then we \nwill go back on it. It makes it extremely difficult. Senator Domenici \ntold all his committee members during the committee markup that we know \nthe bill isn't perfect, but we will have an opportunity on the floor to \namend that. The leader has stuck by that. I think that is important.\n  Just as an effort to help, because you have to move this bill along, \nfor example, the two Bingaman amendments--Senator Dayton cannot offer \nhis amendments until those are disposed of. That is another procedural \nmatter we have to deal with here.\n  We recognize we have a lot of work to do. We squeezed in yesterday an \nhour on trade while everybody was at the White House. I know the leader \nwants these two bills done, and the White House talked about how \nimportant they are. I think it is good we have time down as low as we \ndo on a bill people feel so strongly about. From what I know, it should \npass fairly easily--both of those trade agreements.\n  In short, I want the Senator from Tennessee, who, I repeat, has a \ntremendously difficult job, to understand we are doing everything we \ncan to cooperate. I stated yesterday twice, and I will start the day \noff today saying, I don't know of a single Senate Democrat who doesn't \nwant an Energy bill. The time line you have given us makes it really \ntough. We will cooperate in any way we can to move the schedule along \ndespite the difficulties I see.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the assistance \nof the distinguished assistant leader on the other side of the aisle in \nmoving the Energy bill forward. We had the opportunity yesterday to \nhave a bipartisan meeting with the President of the United States, who \nonce again called for this body to address energy as expeditiously as \npossible, allowing appropriate time for debate and amendment.\n  The President set out his energy policy 2 years and 2 or 3 months ago \nand has called upon this body to work its will. The House has done that \nand passed a bill. We have not done that and the American people \ndeserve it. That is why we brought this bill to the floor on May 6. \nThat is why we have spent 17 days on the bill. That is why we are \nworking as hard as we can to complete this bill in the next 3 days. I \nthink we are working well together. It is a complex bill. We debated \ndays and days last year. It has been taken through committee this year \nand marked up and brought to the floor appropriately. We are making \nreal progress there.\n\n  The issue of judges, though, bothers me. It has been brought up every \ntime I say we have to keep moving forward and that we owe it to the \nAmerican people on this Energy bill, and then we have a few votes on \njudges. That is brought up as if that is slowing down progress on the \nEnergy bill. It disturbs me.\n  First of all, all we are saying is let's give Miguel Estrada an up-\nor-down vote. That is all we want. If you don't like him and you want \nto vote against him, do it. We think that when judicial nominees come \nfrom the White House to us under advice and consent, we deserve the \nopportunity to express that advice and consent, and the only way we can \ndo that is by voting. Each seat here has one vote. Let people express \ntheir will and, if the nominees are successful, fine. If not, we will \nmove on. That is what we are saying.\n  I also want to make it clear on what we are having to do this week. \nClotures filed on our side of the aisle don't require any debate. They \nrequire a vote and that is all we ask. Again, we want to keep things \nmoving. We have been willing, as I said time and time again, to stack \nthe votes among the other energy amendment votes. We don't require the \ndebate or time. It is the other side that is requiring the time.\n  Another issue we have not really talked about, at least on the floor, \nis these votes on district judges, which is essentially unprecedented, \nwhich is being required of us today, if we look to the past, if we \ncompare it to the past. The whole issue on both sides of the aisle is \nthat many, if not most, of these could be approved by unanimous \nconsent. Many, if not all, confirmations have to be by rollcall votes. \nBecause there is this call from the other side of the aisle for \nrollcall votes, which traditionally in this body have been handled, for \nthe most part, through voice votes, we are having to factor those \nrollcall votes, which take time, into the Senate schedule if we are \ngoing to demand justice around the country. If we do not get these \njudges confirmed, justice is, in effect, delayed. So they put a huge \ndemand on us--really me as majority leader--demanding what has not been \ndone in the past, rollcall votes, which take time and we have to factor \nthem into the schedule, which does delay our schedule unnecessarily, \nand it means later hours at night and starting 30 minutes earlier in \nthe day to accommodate the demands they are putting on us.\n\n  That, to me, is challenging. It is challenging that we work on this \nimportant Energy bill and, for the most part, these rollcall votes on \nthe district judges are challenging.\n  To make that point, if we go back to the 105th Congress, there were \n100 judges--20 circuit and 80 district judges. In that Congress, there \nwere 25 rollcall votes--7 circuit, 18 district. So on about 25 percent \nof the 100 judges, rollcall votes were required.\n  If we move to the 106th Congress, there were 72 judges confirmed, and \n18 of those were rollcall votes.\n  If we go to the 107th Congress, there were 100 confirmed and 59 \nrollcall votes.\n  And if we go to the 108th Congress, the present Congress, 37 judges \nhave been confirmed. We have had to have 28 rollcall votes.\n  What is interesting is that of those 28 rollcall votes, 23 were \nunanimous. So we had rollcall votes, and all 100 Senators, or everybody \npresent and voting, voted to confirm. Eighty-two percent of them were \nunanimous.\n  We can see this trend going back to the 104th Congress when there \nwere 73 judges confirmed, and there were zero rollcall votes. What has \nhappened in this Congress, because of the request from the other side \nof the aisle, is this demand that all of these judges, not just the \ncircuit judges, but the district judges, have rollcall votes. \nTherefore, it has made it very difficult.\n  When it is brought up that our voting on judicial nominees is slowing \nthe work of the Senate down, I ask the other side to at least consider \nwhat happened in the 103rd, 104th, and 105th Congresses in terms of the \nnumber of rollcall votes required.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10172-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10172-S10173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF THE MEDICARE ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am going to come back later today and \ncomment on the fact that today is the anniversary of Medicare. I know \nwe want to move on to the pending bill. It was a historic day in 1965. \nOn this day, President Johnson took the historic and bold action of \nsigning Medicare into law.\n  Since that time, Medicare has helped millions of seniors cover their \nhealth care needs, but Medicare, in 1965, was designed to treat \nepisodic illness and did not include the most powerful tool in medicine \ntoday--prescription drugs.\n  I mention this only because we have an opportunity before us, this \nbody already having spoken its will in passing a comprehensive Medicare \nreform bill that strengthens and improves Medicare and includes \nprescription drugs. The House has done likewise. We are currently in \nconference. By working in conference, we will greatly strengthen and \nimprove Medicare. Over the course of the day, I know there will be \nother statements, but there will also be a service and a statement \nabout Medicare at the White House later today.\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\n  We have a great opportunity before us. I wish to share with my \ncolleagues that the conference is going well and sometime after we come \nback from the recess, we will have a bill to bring back to this body.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say not only did President Johnson sign \nthat extraordinary bill--38 years ago?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, 1965; 38 years ago.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as he signed the bill, Congress went out of \nsession. That was a good example.\n  Mr. FRIST. Well said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10173-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1419.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. \n     Boxer, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 1419 \n     to amendment No. 1412:\n       Strike section 1172 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1172. MARKET MANIPULATION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Part II of the Federal Power Act (as \n     amended by section 1171) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 219. PROHIBITION ON MARKET MANIPULATION.\n\n       ``It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or \n     indirectly, to use or employ, in connection with the purchase \n     or sale of electric energy or the purchase or sale of \n     transmission services subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     Commission, any manipulative or deceptive device or \n     contrivance in contravention of such regulations as the \n     Commission may promulgate as appropriate in the public \n     interest or for the protection of electric ratepayers.''.\n       (b) Rates Resulting From Market Manipulation.--Section \n     205(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824d(a)) is \n     amended by inserting after ``not just and reasonable'' the \n     following: ``or that result from a manipulative or deceptive \n     device or contrivance in violation of a regulation \n     promulgated under section 219''.\n       (c) Additional Remedy for Market Manipulation.--Section 206 \n     of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824e) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Remedy for Market Manipulation.--If the Commission \n     finds that a public utility has knowingly employed any \n     manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in violation \n     of a regulation promulgated under section 219, the Commission \n     shall, in addition to any other remedy available under this \n     Act, revoke the authority of the public utility to charge \n     market-based rates.''.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the clerk for reading this \namendment, particularly at such an early hour of the morning. The \nreading of the amendment by the clerk shows exactly what we are up to \nthis morning; that this is a simple amendment and a simple action we \nare asking the Senate to take. We are simply saying market manipulation \nunder the Federal Power Act cannot be just and reasonable, and market \nmanipulation should be found, under the Federal Power Act, by the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, to be a wrongful act.\n  It did not take long to read that amendment but, as I said to this \nbody last night, the fact that such law is not currently on the books \nhas caused the ratepayers in my State great harm. It has caused \nratepayers in Snohomish County, where I happen to live, a 54-percent \nrate increase. It has caused ratepayers in King County a 61-percent \nrate increase. It has caused ratepayers in Vancouver, WA, and \nbusinesses in Vancouver, WA, that can easily move to other parts of the \ncountry, an 88-percent increase. In eastern Washington, the part of the \nState hardest hit economically, where jobs are few and farmers \nstruggle, it has caused ratepayers a 71-percent rate increase.\n  We are not talking about a rate increase that is just for 1 year. We \nare talking about long-term Enron contracts that were manipulated--\nknowingly manipulated--and my ratepayers are stuck paying those \ncontracts for the next 5, 6, and 7 years without relief.\n  We are here today to say one thing and be clear about it: This kind \nof manipulation that gouges ratepayers should be prohibited. This body \nshould be clear. We should be unequivocal. We should say, as other \nentities have said, that this kind of manipulation is wrong and needs \nto be corrected.\n  I have a lot to say on this amendment this morning, but I know I am \ngoing to be joined by many of my colleagues from the West who have had \ntheir economies wrecked by gouging and illegal practices. I want to \ngive them an opportunity to say something, too, because I think the \nface of the west coast economy and what it has meant for ratepayers \nneeds to be clear.\n\n  We are trying to say with the Cantwell-Bingaman amendment that we do \nnot want to see this kind of action happen on natural gas prices in \nother parts of the country. We do not want to see this take place 4 \nmonths from now, or 2 years from now.\n  Let's be really clear. These kinds of practices that were deployed by \nEnron, the various schemes of Fat Boy, Ricochet, Megawatt Laundering, \nand Load Shift are illegal.\n  I will yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Washington State, Mrs. \nMurray, who knows all too well that this crisis has caused real \nhardship in our State. She has been outspoken on this issue as well and \nsent many letters to various entities, including the Federal Regulatory \nEnergy Commission, talking about how we need to make changes.\n  I yield her 10 minutes this morning to talk about some of the impacts \nshe has seen firsthand.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \nthat has been offered by my colleague from Washington State, Ms. \nCantwell, that will help protect our consumers from this electricity \nmarket manipulation.\n  I begin by thanking Senator Cantwell for her tremendous work on the \nenergy commitment and her long-time work on trying to make sure \nconsumers in my home State of Washington finally receive the attention \nand the help they need from us at the Federal level because of the \ngouging that has gone on in this market manipulation. We have seen the \ndramatic impacts that she has so eloquently talked about.\n  I thank her for speaking out on behalf of our Pacific Northwest \nconsumers who are hurting. We have had the first, second, or the third \nhighest unemployment rate for almost 2\\1/2\\ years, much of that \nprecipitated by the fact of the energy spike costs that have hit the \nwest coast, causing many of our cold storage companies, the aluminum \nindustry, to shut down. They are laying people off. The effects of that \nreverberated throughout our economy, as other industries were hurt. \nEven our schools were hurt as they had to lay off teachers in order to \npay energy bills.\n  It has had a tremendous impact on our economy and continues to do so. \nBringing this amendment to the Senate floor today is absolutely \ncritical. If we are going to have an electricity title, and if we do \nnot deal with what happened in market manipulation, we are only going \nto see this continue.\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\n  We have a responsibility at the Federal level to protect our \nconsumers at home. In fact, that is the responsibility of the Federal \nRegulatory Energy Commission. This amendment is so critical to making \nsure that we can go home and tell our consumers we are doing the right \njob of protecting them and the market manipulations that have occurred \nin the past will not occur again. Without this amendment, we will not \nhave the ability to say that.\n\n  As Senator Cantwell stated, all of us on the west coast remember the \nenergy crisis of 2001. Our consumers and our businesses were hit with \nmassive increases in the cost of energy. In California, they saw \nshortages and brownouts that were incredible. In Washington State we \nhave felt the impact in every sector of our economy and in every home \nin our State. In fact, as I will talk about in a moment, we in \nWashington State are continuing to be penalized for the failures in the \nenergy market and failures by our Federal energy regulators.\n  There were certainly many causes for the energy crisis that hit us, \nbut the most disturbing is the fact that energy companies manipulated \nthe marketplace specifically to take advantage of the customers. As we \nsaw throughout that crisis, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission \ndid not take aggressive action to protect consumers from market \nmanipulation. The amendment that has been offered by my colleague, \nSenator Cantwell, will direct FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, to revoke those market-based rate authority companies that \nhave been found to knowingly engage in electricity market manipulation.\n  Our experience on the west coast shows why this amendment is so \nimportant and why FERC needs to be better policed in the energy market. \nFor more than 2 years, many of us in the northwest delegation have been \nurging FERC to better protect our consumers. In fact, way back in March \nand April of 2001 and again in May of 2002, I sent letters to FERC \ncalling for relief from this energy crisis. I asked for Federal price \ncaps to stabilize the market. I asked for Washington State utilities to \nreceive refunds, as California utilities received, and I urged FERC to \nreport criminal activity to the Department of Justice.\n  Finally, on March 26 of 2003, FERC found that market manipulation \noccurred during the 2001 west coast energy crisis. Unfortunately, FERC \nindicated it was highly unlikely that Washington State ratepayers would \nbe reimbursed for the harm that was caused by that market manipulation. \nThat is really unfair when we look at what happened throughout that \ncrisis.\n  At the height of the 2001 energy crisis, when Enron and others were \nmanipulating the system, FERC was urging companies to enter into long-\nterm contracts. Many of our utilities in the Pacific Northwest followed \ntheir request and entered into long-term contracts at highly inflated \nrates.\n  According to the Seattle Times, during the energy crisis the \nNorthwest wholesale market averaged $276 per megawatt hour. That is 16 \npercent higher than the average prices in northern California, and 28 \npercent higher than in southern California. So it was really disturbing \nto all of us to see FERC agree that there was manipulation but then \nleave Washington State ratepayers holding the bag with no relief for \nthe harm they experienced and continue to experience because of these \ncontracts.\n  Clearly, FERC needs to be more aggressive in protecting our \nconsumers. It needs to uncover and it needs to report market \nmanipulation much earlier. It needs to have the authority to take \naction against companies that defraud the public and defraud the people \nin our States by manipulating the electricity market. The amendment \nthat Senator Cantwell has offered will direct FERC to take aggressive \naction against predatory energy companies that manipulate the market, \nand I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n  This amendment will improve the underlying bill. It is extremely \nimportant. We need to have this kind of confidence if we want to see \nour ratepayers able to survive in the coming years.\n  I do have a lot of other concerns about the Energy bill and about an \neffort by Federal energy regulators. As my colleagues know, FERC is now \npushing what they call a standard market design which would set uniform \nnational standards for operating regional transmission grids, \ntransmission grids that allow energy to be passed back and forth \nbetween communities that are in each region and their wholesale energy \nmarkets. Unfortunately, what FERC does not understand, what the bill \ndoes not understand, is that a one-size-fits-all solution is not going \nto fit the unique needs of the Pacific Northwest.\n  In New England, if they want to increase or decrease energy \nproduction, they burn more gas or more coal. They can regulate that \nindustry. But in the Northwest, we cannot make it rain more or less \nbased on some kind of profit schedule. Standard market design does not \nwork in the Pacific Northwest. We cannot run our system that way \nbecause it is not designed to meet all of the needs we have. It means \nmore opportunities for market manipulation and price gouging by big \nout-of-State energy companies.\n  As we have already talked about, we know FERC has already failed to \nprotect Washington ratepayers from market manipulation. Given that, I \nthink it is particularly unwise to allow FERC to take authority away \nfrom our State regulators through this standard market design and other \nproposals that are floating around through Congress and in this bill.\n  I am also very concerned that the Energy bill repeals the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act of 1935 which restricts utility ownership.\n  Although Senator Domenici's substitute electricity amendment--which \nwe have just gotten, we are reviewing, and is now in this bill--does \ninclude some remedies to protect consumers, it does not go far enough. \nJust look at the devastating effects of the 2001 energy crisis to see \nwe have to do more to protect our consumers. It is our utmost \nresponsibility. I am concerned the electricity title in this bill fails \nto do that.\n  It is clear this Energy bill we are debating does not do enough to \nprotect consumers against market manipulation and could actually \nfacilitate more opportunities for manipulation. As currently written, \nit does not provide enough remedies to help our consumers who have been \nvictimized by market manipulation.\n  That is why I am in the Senate today to support my colleague from \nWashington State, Senator Cantwell, and the amendment she has offered. \nWe have the utmost responsibility to assure market manipulation is not \ngoing to continue again. We know the effects in the Pacific Northwest. \nSenator Cantwell has outlined the average rate increases that have hit \nour State because of market manipulation. Energy price increases affect \nevery sector of our economy. They affect every person in our State. \nThey affect everything from how we can operate our schools, how many \nteachers we can have versus how many energy bills our schools have to \npay, to whether potential new homeowners can afford a home. A 51 \npercent rate increase means we have more families in the State of \nWashington who cannot afford to buy new cars, new refrigerators. That \naffects our economy in the Pacific Northwest and has a rippling effect \nto our businesses, which have laid off thousands of employees because \nthey cannot afford to pay their increased electricity costs.\n  The market manipulation amendment of Senator Cantwell is an \nabsolutely critical amendment to assure we can protect our consumers in \nthe future. Failing to pass it is a failure of the responsibility we \nhave as Senators. I urge its passage.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding on this critical matter.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank Senator Murray for her articulate capsulization \nof what this Energy bill and the Domenici title means to the Northwest.\n  The Senator has hit it right on the head, in that market manipulation \nhas not been adequately dealt with in this legislation. Not only has \nthere been no strong stand against market manipulation, there are \nfurther attempts toward deregulation with standard market design and \nregional transmission organizations that we in the Northwest find \nludicrous.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Seattle Post\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\nIntelligence editorial from this morning's newspaper saying that the \ndubious Energy bill might be better shelved.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 30, 2003]\n\n                   Dubious Energy Bill Better Shelved\n\n       Republicans hope to drive the Senate toward a new energy \n     bill this week. We all know what happens when you drive too \n     fast; caution is lost in the rush to judgment.\n       For both the Northwest and the nation, the bill contains at \n     least a trio of contenders for worst idea of the year--more \n     deregulation of electricity, nuclear power subsidies and a \n     new look at offshore oil drilling.\n       The West Coast is still trying to recover from cost \n     increases created by deregulation schemes and market \n     manipulation. Loan guarantees for nuclear reactors and a \n     permanent cap on liability from accidents could increase \n     radioactive waste--as if Hanford didn't have enough now. And, \n     the idea of putting oil drilling platforms on more of the \n     nation's coast was rejected decades ago.\n       The plan would also tilt relicensing of hydroelectric dams \n     in favor of industry-designed environmental provisions. Don't \n     expect that to help salmon runs.\n       Senators have a host of ideas for improving the bill: \n     better vehicle mileage rules, new global warming standards \n     and more incentives for renewable energy sources. The White \n     House has intervened to try to move the bill forward, but \n     senators must recognize they are starting from a tough spot. \n     The existing bill is tainted because its roots are in closed-\n     door meetings between Vice President Dick Cheney and his \n     energy industry pals.\n       That kind of abuse during the Clinton administration killed \n     health care reform. If senators hope to rescue the energy \n     plan from its dubious origins, they had better plan on months \n     of work.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague for her diligence in expressing \nher opinion on this issue.\n  The RTO and standard market design issues she mentioned this morning \nshow how unsound this idea is, not only in not protecting us from \nmarket manipulation but saying in a conceptual scheme, let's have a \nnationwide regional energy grid and let the people who will pay the \nmost; that is, the power source that is willing to pay the most to get \non to the grid, let them decide how power will be distributed.\n  For people in the Northwest, if we had power produced at cost-based \nrates; that is, cost plus what it takes to deliver to consumers--but \nall of a sudden FERC is pushing a concept of standard market design and \nsaying, Enron or Reliance has more expensive power, we will shove it on \nto your grid and you pay that higher rate. As Senator Murray adequately \npointed out, this is not a plan we endorse.\n  Some of my colleagues from the South also have concerns. Not only \ndoes this bill not do enough in protecting manipulation, it creates the \npossibility for more loopholes, more havoc, more chaos. Frankly, this \nis exactly how California got in trouble. Regarding a lot of market-\nbased deregulation of the industry, everyone thought it would be \ncompetitive practices by which the cost of electricity would be driven \ndown. This is not like something one can afford to have the price go \nup.\n  One county, Snohomish County, had a 54 percent rate increase. We had \nprinted in the Record yesterday an article from the New York Times that \nSnohomish County has a 44 percent increase. Consumers got disconnected \nfrom their electricity because they could not afford to pay. This is \nnot one of these schemes when the ``free market'' does not drive down \nthe price of a utility and ratepayers have something to do. They cannot \ngo over to Nordstrom's and buy a cheap electricity contract and get \nelectricity. They cannot go over to Wal-Mart and buy affordable \nelectricity. They are stuck with these rates. They are stuck with the \n54 percent increase and they will be stuck for years ahead. We had a 44 \npercent disconnect rate in that county.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for her leadership on this amendment. \nI know there are several other amendments she will be offering.\n  The Senator has explained very clearly what has happened to real \npeople who are trying to pay their bills on something that is \nabsolutely necessary for life itself.\n  I ask my colleague a question on this point. In California, where we \nhad this all begin, there was some ill-advised legislation signed into \nlaw by then-Governor Pete Wilson which brought this deregulation to my \nState. Is my colleague aware that the rates started to double, triple, \nand more, in our State, that our State government under Governor Gray \nDavis said, the people cannot afford this. He went out and said that he \nwould, in fact, take care of this crisis.\n  As a result, our State is in deep debt. About a third of our debt can \nbe related directly to what the electricity companies did with their \nschemes that you are going to be explaining and I will be talking about \nlater.\n  Is my colleague aware that a third of the problem in California is \ndirectly related to the energy scam?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from California for asking that \nquestion and for being a cosponsor. The Senator understands all very \nwell how painful this has been to the California economy.\n  I was not aware that a third of the problem could be directly \nattributable to the crisis in California. I know businesses have closed \nin Washington State. I know people have moved to other regions and made \nother investments because the rate is high in our State. I know the \namount of money paid by higher utility costs for our west coast region \nis $6 billion. Ratepayers in the West paid a $6 billion increase in \ntheir electricity bills because of the market manipulation.\n  When I think about the little time we have, maybe 6 hours total to \ndebate this amendment, we gouged the ratepayers $1 billion and we are \ngoing to talk $1 billion an hour here. That is hardly the remedy for \nwhich I think people are looking. What they are looking for is some \nimmediate action, saying these kinds of activities will not take place \nagain, in the future.\n\n  So the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, is correct. The impact \nhas been devastating. It has been devastating to California's economy, \nand obviously we would like to see some relief. For the moment, what we \nare trying to say in the Cantwell-Bingaman-Feinstein-Boxer-Hollings-\nWyden amendment is that this kind of market manipulation ought to be \noutlawed specifically in the Power Act today so this does not happen \nagain.\n  As we are looking at natural gas price increases and people are \ngetting anxious, why would we have an electricity title that is unclear \nas to what the penalties are? Actually, under the Oxley legislation of \nSenator Sarbanes and Congressman Oxley, on the SEC side, on the \nauditor's side, it said: We are going to get tough. These are new \nrequirements. We are going to put this in the statute. Yet on the \nelectricity title, we are repealing PUHCA, as my colleague from \nWashington State said, the one consumer protection law that has been on \nthe books since 1935.\n  Why would you change a law that has been on the books since 1935 when \nyou just had the biggest pyramid scheme ever to defraud consumers, \nknowingly admitted by Enron, knowingly admitted by FERC, knowingly \nadmitted by the Department of Justice, knowingly printed by every \nnewspaper in the country that manipulation was going on? Why would you \nrepeal the consumer protection laws on the books? You would actually \ntry to enforce them.\n  That is what the Cantwell amendment does today, as the clerk read \nthis morning. It simply says the manipulation of those contracts cannot \nbe just and reasonable and put that in the Power Act, plain and simple. \nPlain and simple, not the 43 pages we have in the title addressing this \nissue, which I am sure tries to address the issue, but it falls far \nshort.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for just a moment on this point? I \nam going to go into a markup and then return.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My colleague points out that what she is attempting to do \nin this amendment, of which I am so proud to be a cosponsor, is to make \nsure what happened to Washington and Oregon and California is not going \nto happen to any other State, be it Kansas, be it Illinois, be it \nanywhere else.\n  For the life of me, I guess I need to say to my friend, does she \nunderstand why anyone in this Chamber, knowing what happened to our \nStates, knowing what happened to our businesses,\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\nknowing what happened to our consumers, knowing what happened, in the \ncase of California, to our State budget because our Governor protected \nthe consumers from these rates--can my friend understand why there \nwould be one vote against her amendment, given what we know happened to \nus?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. My colleague from California has asked a question that \nis very important. No, I cannot imagine why any of my colleagues would \nwant to vote against this amendment that prohibits market manipulation \nand puts that in the Power Act in a very simple way.\n  She mentioned something very interesting. A lot of people talk about \nthis as the California energy crisis--the California energy crisis. Her \neconomy has been devastated, but California actually had a retail cap, \nwhich meant even though those prices were being charged, and it left \nthe California economy in disarray and a bill at the State legislative \nlevel that is exorbitant, what happened in Washington State, because we \ndidn't have retail caps, is that the ratepayers actually saw the \nincrease in their day-to-day electricity bills. They saw it to the tune \nof 88 percent increases, 61 percent increases, 54 percent increases. \nThose disconnect notices are real. The companies that have left or are \nleaving the State are real. The long-term impacts on our economy are \nreal.\n\n  No, I cannot imagine, if this had happened to any of my other \ncolleagues from other States, that they would not be in the same \nposition I am in today, or Senator Murray, saying, at a minimum, outlaw \nthis market manipulation.\n  So I appreciate the question the Senator from California has asked. I \nappreciate her keen attention to this issue. I know she has spoken many \ntimes on the floor about what has happened to our colleagues from the \nWest and particularly how devastating it has been to her State. I \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from the State of Washington yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know she has limited time. I will be \nvery brief, but I did want to ask the question.\n  It seems to me this electricity title is critically important. I \nheard my colleague from California ask some questions. I chaired the \nhearings that dealt with the Enron abuses and other abuses in \nCalifornia and the west coast when I was chairing a subcommittee of the \nCommerce Committee. What happened there was egregious. It was wholesale \nstealing, and I use the word ``stealing'' in a very direct way. There \nare massive criminal investigations underway.\n  We have heard the terms Get Shorty, Fat Boy, Death Star--the schemes \nwe unearthed. The people, in memoranda inside the company, were saying: \nHere is the way we are going to cheat consumers. They created \ncongestion, and they then got paid for removing the congestion that \nthey created. They actually deliberately cheated consumers, not to the \ntune of a couple of loaves of bread but to the tune of billions and \nbillions of dollars.\n  It seems to me, as this energy title is written, there is not one \nperson in the Senate--not one--who would stand up and say: It is fine \nfor consumers to be confronted with that sort of manipulation and \ncheating or criminal behavior. Not one would say we support that kind \nof behavior.\n  If that is the case, if no one is going to support that, and they \nwould not, then should we not write an electricity title that \nrepresents the best ideas of both sides of the political aisle here; \nthat says we are going to stop criminal behavior; we are going to stop \nthe kind of activities that attempt to steal from consumers?\n\n  I ask the Senator from Washington, have you had an opportunity, or \nperhaps has the ranking member of the committee had an opportunity, to \nsit down with those who wrote the electricity title, which we received \nlast Friday, and talk to them about perhaps writing it together so we \nall accomplish that which we say we intend to accomplish--stopping this \nkind of manipulation and cheating? Because it did exist and it will \nagain if we do not plug the hole.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his question. \nI know he has been diligent, being at the committee hearings during the \ntime period in which the West tried to convince the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission--the policeman on the watch, if you will, when \nthis mugging of ratepayers was happening--we tried to convince the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission that prices were too high, that we \nwere getting gouged. The Senator was very articulate at that time and \nsubsequently, on the Commerce Committee, holding hearings, \ninvestigating the activities of Enron.\n  At that time, we were all speculating that manipulation happened. \nWhat has since come out is that the manipulation has been admitted to. \nIt has been admitted to in the memos by the company in those various \nschemes you have talked about, and we have charts showing the names, of \nDeath Star and Fat Boy and various other schemes. We have had the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission own up: Yes, this is market \nmanipulation.\n  I have a report here, that is almost too heavy to handle, that \nbasically documents all the manipulation that has happened. We have a \nDepartment of Justice investigating and saying yes, manipulation has \nhappened. Yet this electricity title is very scant on putting those \nthings in place.\n  The Senator is right. This new electricity title appeared last Friday \nnight. I don't know what time it was, but well beyond the time, I am \nsure, that I was home in Washington State. We started in on it on \nMonday. But the bottom line is this underlying Domenici title has some \nlanguage about: Let's make sure there is no false reporting.\n  That is in the current statute. It didn't save us. It didn't have \nanybody stop this or basically put everybody in jail.\n  Frankly, every time I get home, I hear from a constituent who is \npaying this high energy cost, paying this 61 percent or 88 percent rate \nincrease, saying: Why isn't Ken Lay in jail? Why is it I am paying this \nrate increase and I am going to be paying it for 5 or 6 years and Ken \nLay isn't in jail?\n  The transparency clause here is already on the books, making sure \npeople do not report false information to the organization known as the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. That is already on the books. The \nround trip trading, yes, is eliminated. But we have other schemes in \nthis bill that are not included in the electricity title and are not \noutlawed. I think it should be simple.\n  The Power Act was created to protect consumers. We decided in \ninterstate commerce; that is, the selling of power between States, that \nthe Federal Government should play a role in protecting consumers on \nwholesale power rates.\n  We gave to the States the ability through their utility commissions \nthe responsibility to protect consumers' electricity that is sold \nwithin each State. But we said as a Federal Government we want to make \nsure consumers have oversight of electricity. We said in the Federal \nPower Act we are going to make sure that rates are ``just and \nreasonable.'' That is our job--``just and reasonable.'' We set up a \ncommission to do it. Yet now we have seen that market abuse is \ncontinuing. And we have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nare proposing we repeal the only consumer protection law which has been \non the books since 1935--the Public Utility Holding Company Act--and in \nits place put some language that basically smacks the hand of Ken Lay \nbut doesn't have any teeth in it--teeth that will really bring to \njustice people who have manipulated this market.\n  We may have another day when we can discuss what kind of relief might \nbe given to California or Oregon or Washington. But this amendment \ntoday is geared toward protecting people from future abuse by simply \nsaying in the Power Act that manipulated schemes are not just and \nreasonable; that they ought to be banned in the Power Act. I don't know \nwhat is wrong with saying that. I would like to go over the specific \ndetails so my colleagues understand exactly what we are trying to say \nand why the current underlying title comes up short in the sense of not \ndoing enough to protect consumers.\n  As I said, first of all, the Power Act put in place a broad \nprohibition on the manipulation of electricity prices. We want to \ncontinue that. We want to make sure that in this language we say\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\nmanipulated electricity prices are wrong. In the Domenici substitute, \nwe are going to say that round-trip trading; that is, buying and \nselling of electricity at inflated rates and inflated volumes, is \nillegal. That is a good thing to do. But that is particularly focused \non the shareholder.\n  We are saying let us protect the shareholder to make sure these guys \nwho are in this manipulative practice of buying and selling on the same \nday and inflating the price and inflating the volume is wrong and \nillegal. That is good in protecting shareholders. But how are \nratepayers protected? I want to see protection for ratepayers.\n  In particular, my amendment would add a new paragraph to the act \nwhich is based on language the Federal energy commission has had in its \npower since 1934. This language would make it illegal for any company \nto use or apply any manipulative or deceptive device to circumvent the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission rules and regulations on market \nmanipulation.\n  It is simple. Let's just say it. What is wrong with saying what Enron \nhas admitted they have done? What is wrong with saying what the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has put in the report? What is wrong about \nsaying what DOJ has said about manipulation? Why not be really clear \nand specific? Any company that uses or applies any manipulative or \ndeceptive device to circumvent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nrules and regulations on market manipulation should be punished.\n  Second, we want to say specifically that electricity rates resulting \nfrom manipulative practices are not just and reasonable under the \nFederal Power Act.\n  As we talked about last night and as some of my colleagues have said, \nwe have the establishment of the Power Act and the protections of \n``just and reasonable,'' and it is our responsibility as a Federal \nGovernment to regulate wholesale energy prices between States. Why? \nBecause in the 1930s, guess what happened. A bunch of companies had too \nmuch power and jacked up the price on consumers. They held them \nhostage. Electricity is something no one should be held hostage for, \nand certainly no one should lose their home because of a manipulated \ncontract by a company that put a scheme in place.\n\n  We had a hearing before the Energy Committee in which I asked the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, ``Do you think if you \nfind market manipulation that it is ever going to be `just and \nreasonable,' or ever in the public interest?'' Chairman Wood told me, \n``I can't think of an instance when it would be.''\n  We have the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nsaying I can't think this would ever be in the public interest or ever \nbe just and reasonable. So why not put it in the Power Act? Guess what. \nChairman Wood doesn't write legislation. We write legislation. We are \nthe body that needs to take the responsibility. We are the body that \nneeds to say to the American people we got the message that market \nmanipulation has occurred.\n  My amendment would clear up any confusion and specifically declare in \nthe Power Act that market manipulation is unjust and unreasonable.\n  Lastly, this amendment would amend the section 206 of the Federal \nPower Act requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke \nthe company's authority to sell at market-based rates whenever the \ncommission finds it ``knowingly'' employs a strategy to manipulate the \nelectricity market. It says when the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission finds people have manipulated a market that they revoke \ntheir market-based rates. Market-based rates is when the company \ndecides what the rates are.\n  As I said, we in the Northwest have been traditionally comfortable \nwith cost-based pricing that the public Power Act provided. Why? \nBecause consumers get the power at the cost it takes to produce it. As \na former business executive, I am all for marketplace competition. But \nmarketplace competition has to have some regulation or some people \nbasically end up controlling the market and consumers get whacked \nwhatever they want. In this case, we know manipulation happened.\n  Why is this issue so important that we have to actually say to the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission make sure when these contracts \nhave been manipulated that you revoke the market-based rate authority? \nBelieve it or not, even though Enron, months and months ago, admitted \nin various memos that they manipulated the market, it wasn't until \nabout 2 weeks ago that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nactually revoked their market-based rate authority. Maybe it was 17 \ndays ago. Sometime in the last 2\\1/2\\ weeks, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission finally took the action they should have taken \nover a year and a half ago. We have a Federal agency that has been \nlaggard at addressing this issue.\n  While we will have other amendments to address the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission and address the fact they have not stepped up to \ntheir appropriate role in being the policeman on the books as this \nmugging of ratepayers happens, because clearly they haven't--it took \nus, the Members of the Senate and House of Representatives pounding on \nthem for months about the high cost of electricity in our region to \nfinally get a mitigation plan. Over a year later it finally took the \nhearings of Senator Dorgan and many others and an investigation that we \nfinally got the truth on the table that contracts were actually \nmanipulated. Now it is going to take the effort and focus of this body \nto say, Let's make it simple. Let us make it really clear: Manipulation \nof contracts is unjust and unreasonable. Any company that employs such \ntactics should not have free rein of the market by having market-based \nrates allowed under the Federal Power Act and the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. It is simple.\n\n  I want to point out to my colleagues the fact that there are other \nentities that are way ahead of the game; that is, they are way ahead of \nus. They are way ahead of this body in saying that Enron manipulated \ncontracts and something ought to be done about it. And that is \nbothersome. I think we are the protectors of the consumers in the \noversight of how well an agency is doing its job and to which we have \ndelegated the responsibility.\n  I am sure there are people in this body who probably never heard of \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission until this crisis happened. I \nam not sure the agency has had the bright light of day shined on it too \noften in its Congressional history.\n  In fact, the Government oversight committee, then chaired by Senator \nLieberman during this energy crisis, had some hearings on whether the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission was doing its job. I thought that \nwas very appropriate. It is very bothersome to me there are many \nnewspaper articles and accountants of Ken Lay actually lobbying members \nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on whether they should have \na cap or a plan in trying to control or mitigate prices in the western \nenergy market. He lobbied for Commissioners he thought would not put a \ncap in place. He lobbied for people he thought would continue the trend \ntoward deregulation of the market.\n  I do not know why we should listen to Ken Lay's energy plan and who \nhe thinks should be the nominees in these instances. We even have one \nnewspaper article that suggested he was for the renomination of the \ncurrent Chairman of the FERC but only if he would continue to have a \nfree market strategy and make sure these prices that basically had been \ncharged were kept in place. I think that is unconscionable. We need to \ndo something to make sure this agency has our trust in the Senate and \nthe trust of the American people. I think that is critically important.\n  Even though my colleagues have been hearing about this crisis for a \ncouple years and some may think it is over, it is not over for the \nratepayers of Washington State. It is not over for the California \neconomy. We are stuck with this bill. We are stuck with the impact of \nthese manipulated prices.\n  But I want to be clear, there are people who knew this was going on. \nAnd they have admitted it--Enron itself. Enron knew we were going to \nget access to this information eventually, so basically they produced \nthe smoking gun memos where the company said it engaged in practices to \nmanipulate the western power market. And they knew it was wrong.\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n  In fact, even when these memos were starting to be uncovered, people \nrealized these tactics had these exaggerated names that were not going \nto sound too positive, so they ended up saying: Well, let's change the \nnames. I am not sure if it was Fat Boy--oh, yes, Death Star. Death Star \nwas the name of a tactic used to manipulate the market, and they said: \nWell, if that comes out maybe that won't sound like such a good name. \nLet's change that to Cuddly Bear.\n  So somehow we were not going to find out there was market \nmanipulation in place because Death Star all of a sudden became Cuddly \nBear. It does not matter whether you change the code name, the impact \non my State is the same. It is wrong, and this body ought to outlaw it.\n  So when FERC finally began to investigate, they realized this \nproblem, as their report concludes, was significant and ``epidemic,'' \nand the epidemic market manipulation took place in the West. Their own \nreport says there is overwhelming evidence that suggests ``Enron and \nits affiliates intentionally engaged in a variety of market \nmanipulation schemes that had profound adverse impacts on the market \noutcomes.''\n  In fact, the report goes on to say:\n\n       Enron's corporate culture fostered a disregard for the \n     American energy customer. The success of the company's \n     trading strategies, while temporary, demonstrates the need \n     for explicit prohibition on harmful and fraudulent \n     market behavior and for aggressive market monitoring and \n     enforcement.\n\n  That is what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is saying has \ntranspired and what we need. It ``demonstrates the need for explicit \nprohibition on harmful and fraudulent market behavior and for \naggressive market monitoring and enforcement.''\n  It is not FERC's job to write the law. It is FERC's job to enforce it \nand interpret it. Our job is to act. They are telling us they need to \nhave this market behavior monitored and enforced, and that this problem \ndemonstrates the need for an explicit prohibition. Let's give them that \nexplicit prohibition. Let's put into the Federal Power Act that the \nmanipulation of prices cannot be just and reasonable and companies that \nparticipate in that practice do not deserve to have market-based rates.\n  As I mentioned, FERC just came to this conclusion recently, so it is \na little troubling that it took them so long, after so much damage has \nbeen done--$3-plus billion to the California economy, over $1 billion \nto the Washington economy, and billions more to Oregon and, I am sure, \nother parts of the West. So we don't want them to be confused or slow \nto pick up the regulatory framework and to use it as a hammer against \nthese kinds of manipulations. So let's make it really clear.\n  DOJ thinks this manipulation is wrong. The U.S. Department of Justice \nbelieves what Enron did was, as they said, wrong and fraudulent. The \nDepartment of Justice continues to conduct investigations into Enron's \nactivities. It has filed criminal charges levied against 16 different \nemployees, most recently resulting in one of those 16 arrested, a \ntrading desk manager. Already, two Enron traders have pleaded guilty on \ncharges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. And charges are pending \nagainst another.\n  So DOJ knows it is wrong. Yet in the electricity title we have not \nput in strict enough language to prevent it from happening again.\n  One of the most recent criminal complaints filed against an Enron \ntrader by the U.S. Attorney's Office says: Based on the facts, there is \nprobable cause to conclude that between approximately June 1999 and \nJanuary 2001 the Enron trader unlawfully conspired to commit and did \ncommit acts in violation of the Federal law. There is probable cause to \nconclude that the trader committed the offense of wire fraud in \nviolation to title 18, United States Code, and conspired to commit the \noffense of wire fraud in the northern districts of California and \nelsewhere.\n  The Department of Justice knows these acts are manipulative and \nillegal. The fact that they only have two people indicted so far--and \nwe still don't have justice as it relates to Ken Lay; and it was the \ndiligence of those on the west coast and Members here saying \nmanipulation went on--bothers me; it has taken so long. So I certainly \nwant to make sure there is no question that we think these activities \nare wrong and that something should be done about it. That is why we \nneed tough language.\n  Now, this body did its job as it relates to the auditing of \nregulators and reform after Enron. This CRS report for Congress--\nbasically that is part of the report about the Sarbanes-Oxley act--\ntalked about how we stepped up and did our job as it related to the \nauditing and accounting practices of these organizations.\n  Now, why was that important? It was important because not only did \nratepayers get gouged, but people counted on those companies and their \ntruthful reporting in their businesses. And the investors investing in \nthose businesses counted on that truthful reporting. We uncovered that \nthere was a lot of manipulation going on there as well. There was a lot \nof misinformation about what really was the cash and capital of these \ncompanies and whether the investments by investors really should have \nbeen made, given that the long-term outlook of the companies was not \nbased on real numbers but on these manipulated schemes.\n  So what did we do? We didn't repeal accounting laws that were on the \nbooks to protect consumers. We stepped up and said: Let's make this \nstronger. Let's get the Sarbanes-Oxley act in place. In fact, the act \ncreates a new oversight board for auditors. It prohibits auditing firms \nfrom providing certain consulting work for auditing clients so there is \nno conflict of interest in who they work for. It requires the rotation \nof all the partners. It imposes new regulations on corporate boards and \nexecutives. It increases government oversight and criminal penalties. \nWe took tough action as it related to the auditors. We protected the \nshareholders moving forward from having this kind of scheme from an \nauditing perspective happen again.\n  If we were so ready to jump on this issue as it related to the \nauditing practices and the accounting practices of these companies, and \nwe protected the shareholders and the individuals who may have had \npension plans or investments in these companies, why aren't we now \ngoing to protect the ratepayers who actually got gouged with the high \ncost of these contracts? Why aren't we going to say this is so \negregious that we should never allow it to happen again; that we, the \nCongress, believe that we are no apologists for Enron? We are not going \nto condone market manipulation. We are going to say, just as we did \nwith accounting rules and auditing rules, we are going to have in the \nPower Act the same message; that manipulating contracts is unjust and \nunreasonable and anybody who participates in market manipulation does \nnot get to have free market power under the Power Act. It is simple.\n  Let me talk about what is in here because I believe Chairman Domenici \nand his staff probably did try to say that some manipulations happen \nand we ought to do something about it. But I don't think we have \ncovered the full gamut of issues that need to be covered. The Domenici \namendment refers to round-trip trading. Round-trip trading is \nsimultaneously buying and selling electricity to stimulate both the \namount of electricity trading that was going on and to stimulate and \nincrease the price. So the Domenici amendment says round-trip trading \nis wrong. And that is good. It is good that we took one of these \nschemes and shot a hole into it and said this is wrong.\n  But there are many other schemes that are not covered under the \nDomenici title: Fat Boy, also known as Icing Load, to create real-time \npower markets. According to Enron's own memos dated December 6 and \nDecember 8, 2000, Fat Boy was ``one of the most fundamental strategies \nused by the traders.'' According to one, ``the oldest trick in the \nbook'' and ``is now being used by other market participants.''\n  What Fat Boy did, when you boil it down, is Enron submitted false \npower supply schedules to the California ISO--the California \norganization in which power was bought and sold--and other market \nparticipants for the purpose of receiving payments when it didn't \nactually need the extra generation. So in essence Enron received untold \nmillions of dollars for pretending to keep the lights on in the West \nwhen it really didn't need to. There is nothing in this current \nDomenici title that\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\nprohibits Fat Boy from happening. Yes, you say, you can't lie to FERC. \nThere is nothing in the act that says you can't lie to the California \nISO, which is exactly what Enron did under the Fat Boy scheme.\n  That was the whole point of California deregulation. That is what \npeople went to the legislature and sold them, just as they are trying \nto sell us. Hey, guess what, California. If you deregulate, market \ncompetition is going to drive down the price. And we will create this \nmechanism, the California ISO, which stands for the independent system \noperator. We are going to make this scheme where an independent system \noperator is going to get you cheap electricity. And all those people in \nthe marketplace who want to sell power and sell it at a cheap price, we \nare going to drive down the price.\n\n  That is not what happened. The price went up. It escalated. So they \ndefrauded the California ISO. There is nothing in this underlying bill \nthat protects the ratepayers from having Fat Boy happen again because \nit does nothing to prohibit lying under these kinds of schemes to the \nCalifornia ISO or any other organization like that.\n  Richochet was also known as Ping Pong. The sole purpose of this \nscheme was to evade California's attempts to put price controls in \nplace. Knowing that FERC wasn't really paying attention, they were \ngiven market-based rates. They said: Go out and see if you can drive \ndown the price of electricity. And under this scheme, basically to get \nout of the price controls that California was trying to put in place \nand control, the traders, instead of trading within the State of \nCalifornia, would ship their power outside of the State and then ship \nit back in. Yes, that is right, just like the ping pong ball, back and \nforth on a ping pong table, pushing power to one side and pushing it \nback--Ricochet.\n  If we push it out of California, then we are not subject to those \nState regulations, and guess what. When we ship the power back in, we \ncan ship it in at the price we want. That way we avoid the caps of the \nCalifornia ISO and the power exchange that is trying to enforce them.\n  So the prohibition on round-tripping in the Domenici bill does \nnothing to prohibit Ricochet or Ping Pong from happening again. This \nkind of practice of shipping out of State and shipping back in is not \nillegal under the Domenici title. But it will be under the Cantwell-\nBingaman amendment if this body will adopt it.\n  Let me talk about Death Star for a second. That is the one, yes, \nrenamed Cuddly Bear. I don't care what you call it, there is no way the \nAmerican public, the public in Washington State, doesn't know that this \nwasn't a cuddly bear. This was an unbelievable scheme that has ruined \nour economy. The essential strategy of Death Star was for Enron to earn \nmoney by lying about its transmission needs, scheduling transmission in \nthe opposite direction of the congestion. No energy, however, is \nactually put on the grid or taken off, according to the company's own \nmemos.\n  So wait a minute. We were saying to people this is what is going to \nbe on the grid, but then we don't really put it on the grid.\n  The U.S. Attorney's Office described in a June court paper that Enron \nsubmitted schedules to the ISO that pretended to move the electrons \nowned by Enron, but in reality it didn't. Because of this, it appeared \nto relieve congestion. So the ISO awarded Enron congestion relief \npayments. Basically by pretending it was putting power out there to \nrelieve congestion, which it really didn't, the ISO gave them relief \npayments. The ISO was deceived because part of the looping scheme was \noutside of California and, therefore, it couldn't be detected, thereby \ncosting more money.\n  According to the Department of Justice, senior Enron traders denied \nthey were doing this practice or violating any market rules. So \nbasically what we are saying is that there were people at Enron who \ntold other fine people who probably worked at Enron and who were trying \nto do their jobs, there is nothing wrong with this. This is totally OK \nto do.\n  One of the trading managers was smart enough and said: We are worried \nthat the details of the strategy would be leaked to the ISO and other \npower companies or the public. One of the consequences of his concern \nwas that he was instructed to refrain from calling this Death Star. \nThat is when they said: Gee, employees are getting nervous about this \nscheme; they don't think it is right. Let's change the name to Cuddly \nBear and maybe everybody will be OK with it. Well, we are not OK with \nit.\n  The underlying Domenici electricity title does not prohibit Death \nStar from happening again. Only the Cantwell-Bingaman amendment will do \nthat.\n  Load shifting was another ploy. To employ this tactic, Enron would \ndistort its transmission schedule to create the appearance of \ncongestion, or knowingly increase the congestion cost to all market \nparticipants. Again, more misinformation. The underlying Domenici title \nsays nothing of falsified information provided to the FERC. Well, FERC \nalready has language in there about reporting. It didn't get them to \nstop Enron from following these practices. It doesn't require or make \nillegal any of these practices of providing misinformation to the \nCalifornia ISO.\n  Remember, the California ISO was an organization that basically was \ncreated after deregulation. After deregulation, people went to the \nCalifornia Legislature and said: We will create a mechanism where the \nmarketplace buys and sells power at a cheap rate. We will let the \nmarket do it.\n  Under the California ISO, the independent system operators basically \nwere supposed to help control price. That is where the misinformation \nwas, where the lying and fabrication of information took place. This \nunderlying bill does nothing to protect or say that those kinds of \nactivities to the California ISO, an independent system operator, are \nillegal. It has no teeth as it relates to that. So nothing in this \nunderlying Domenici electricity title will protect us from load \nshifting. The Cantwell-Bingaman amendment will.\n  Get Shorty. Like many Americans, I thought this was a title of a \nmovie. I thought it was supposed to be a joke. But in my State it was \nnot a joke to the ratepayers who actually had a premium price increase. \nBasically, what they did was they gambled that it would be able to find \nservice at a cheaper price the next day. Enron's own memos admitted \nthat ``this was obviously a sensitive issue because of reliability \nconcerns.'' Indeed, the company stated that it would be ``difficult to \njustify our position if the lights go out because these services were \nnot available, and the reason was because we were selling them without \nactually having them in the first place.''\n  They basically were saying: We are going to have a scheme where we \nare going to say there is power available when there is not. And then \nwhen the lights went out, they knew they were going to have concerns. \nThey knew. How they could think the west coast economy would not be \nreached by this havoc being laid upon them. I cannot understand. I \ncannot understand the corporate greed that goes into this kind of \nthinking--that somehow this kind of marketing strategy would be good \nfor California, good for Washington, good for America, good for \ncorporate business, good for our confidence as a country--confidence \nthat we as a government are going to say this kind of manipulation is \nwrong. It has created a huge deal of unrest in the West. Nothing in the \nDomenici electricity title prevents Get Shorty from happening.\n\n  Wheel Out. I am not sure what marketer came up with this one. Enron \nwould submit schedules for a transmission on line they knew was out of \nservice. In doing so, the company would earn extra payments for their \ntrouble. It is not even available. It is sort of like a cab driver \nheading straight for a traffic jam in order to keep the meter running \non an unsuspecting tourist, basically saying: I am going to get you \ninto congestion and it is going to cost you a lot. The poor passenger \nin the car doesn't know there is a quicker route, a cheaper way, a more \nexpedient way to control the cost. But unlike a cab ride, the costs of \nthis are not in the tens of dollars but in the millions of dollars, and \nthe cost to our economy has been in the billions of dollars. There is \nnothing in the Domenici underlying amendment that would prohibit the \nWheel Out strategy from happening again.\n  The Cantwell-Bingaman amendment says that the Wheel Out strategy is\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\nmanipulation of the market--it is manipulation. Under the Federal Power \nAct, it cannot be just and reasonable that companies that deploy these \nkinds of practices should not have market-based rates.\n  I hope there are not any more schemes. I hope I don't have any more \ncharts because this is enough. This is enough of the tactics that were \ndeployed by a company that basically thought that making a few more \ndollars through manipulative practices was somehow OK to do.\n  I read some of those quotes from employees at Enron who said: I don't \nthink this is right; I think this is a concern. Yet they continued.\n  So the Cantwell-Bingaman amendment, which is supported by Senators \nHollings, Murray, Boxer, Feinstein, and others, simply says let's put \ninto the Power Act that manipulation is not just and reasonable.\n  We have had lots of support: The Northwest Public Power Association, \nNorthwest Energy Coalition, AARP, Consumers Union, International \nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers, Consumers for Fair Competition, \nNational Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, Union of \nConcerned Scientists, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and many \nother organizations, such as members of the AFL-CIO, and many people \nwho are concerned about the economic impact of manipulation happening \nprospectively on natural gas.\n  Why won't somebody just take this experiment that happened in \nCalifornia and the West and say, OK, we will--with the current Domenici \nlanguage, Congress barely smacks the hands of those Enron traders. Gee, \nonly one of them went to jail. I guess you have to be smart enough not \nto be the one who gets caught with a memo on an electronic file on your \ncomputer, and, guess what? You will get out of this. So let's take this \nsame kind of scheme and deploy it for natural gas.\n  That is what this amendment is about. This amendment is about saying \nthat natural gas in the future will have better protections of \nconsumers in mind regarding potential rate increases. So, if we have an \nincrease in natural gas prices, maybe because of shortage of supply, \nguess what, we will really know that it is about shortage of supply. We \nwill really know. We will be able to tell consumers in America that we \nreally know it was about not having enough supply; it was not because \nsome natural gas producer had tons of supply but manipulated the market \nthrough a variety of schemes and somehow gouged consumers, and that is \nwhy your rates are higher. Can we not give the American consumer that \nkind of confidence about our energy? I sure hope we can.\n\n  This issue has a real impact on people, and I know my colleagues are \nin the Chamber, and they want to speak, but I wish to share one letter \nfrom an 11-year-old girl whom I met almost a year and a half ago. I did \nnot know at the time she had sent this letter, but she lives in a \nregion of the State where they have had a 71 percent rate increase--a \nhuge increase.\n  This 11-year-old girl sent an emotional letter about how the crisis \nwas affecting her family, that her mom was living paycheck to paycheck. \nThat actually the job her mom had was dependent upon affordable \nelectricity. She wrote:\n\n       This is the first time I've lived in a house. This is the \n     most important thing in my life, that we get to live in a \n     house. Please listen to what might happen to hundreds of \n     kids, including myself, when my mom might lose her job and we \n     might have to move out of our house.\n\n  The impact is being felt by young children, not just by the parents \nwho might lose their job. Not just by the Snohomish County ratepayers \nwho had 44 percent disconnect notices, but by young children who are \nfearful that their families are not going to make it because these \nschemes caused these rate increases that we are stuck with for years \nand years.\n  There is somebody sitting in their office somewhere in America \nsaying: Gee, why don't you just sue those Enron people? Why don't you \njust sue them and tell them that under the Federal law, they cannot \nmanipulate these contracts? I think people in America would be \nsurprised to know that Enron is suing these utilities. Enron is turning \naround and suing these utilities and forcing them to pay these rate \nincreases. They are suing the Snohomish County public utility district, \nsaying: That contract--that has been manipulated--that you signed for 5 \nyears of power, even though it is manipulated and you are paying a 54-\npercent increase, we are not letting you out of that contract; we are \nsuing you.\n  This is the only body that can protect people in the future. It is \nonly the Senate and the Congress that can say: This manipulation is \nwrong. This manipulation, moving forward, is wrong. Then ratepayers in \nmy State in the future, if this happens, might have a chance.\n  We have had letters from senior citizens who are trying to live on a \nfixed income. This burden has made them make decisions about how they \nare going to live in the future. One woman from Okanogan County said: \nMy friends, myself, and my neighbors cannot afford the higher rates:\n\n       I am in a total panic because I am disabled and barely can \n     pay for heat now. With these rates going up as much, it will \n     make it a life-threatening situation. This will become a \n     public health disaster. To make matters worse, many \n     businesses are planning on shutting down here due to the \n     terrible economy and the power costs. This is putting the \n     last nail in our coffin in a dire economic situation in Omak, \n     WA.\n\n  That is what the ratepayers in my State think. Not just: Oh, please, \nSenator Cantwell, Senator Murray, please, Members of Congress, smack \nthe little hand of the Enron people and tell them that was a no-no. \nThey are saying these are dire circumstances, these are life-\nthreatening situations, these are public health risks. We ought to \nstand up today and say this kind of market manipulation is not just, it \nis not reasonable, it is not in the public interest, and these variety \nof schemes from Ricochet to Fat Boy to Death Star are not legal, they \nare examples of manipulation, and companies that practice such \nmanipulation should not be given market-based rates.\n\n  I could go on about this issue and talk about how our Northwest \neconomy has been impacted by the number of jobs lost. I know several of \nmy colleagues wish to speak on this issue, and I am going to give them \nthe opportunity because I know they have been engaged in such dialog \nand speaking out on this issue. I want to give them a chance to \ncontinue to express their opinion on this issue as well.\n  I do not know if the Senator from Iowa wants to have a few minutes \nnow, but I am happy to yield to him--for how much time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. For 10 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. For 10 minutes of the time I have remaining, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Washington for yielding to me. I \nwant to help her on this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor to the Cantwell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after listening to Senator Cantwell's \nexposition of the crimes, manipulations, and the fraud perpetrated on \nthe American people by the Enron Corporation, it is, again, amazing to \nthis Senator that we have not done something about this situation \nbefore now. I am amazed this is not taken care of in the underlying \nbill.\n  We know that what Enron did can happen again if we do not address it. \nIf we do not ban it, as Senator Cantwell does in her amendment, it will \nkeep happening over and over.\n  In the 1930s, at the height of the Great Depression, Congress \nrealized one of the most important factors was the collapse of the \nelectric utility industry. It turned out this basic industry had been \nbuilt on fraud after fraud, shell game upon shell game, and when \neconomic troubles hit, it collapsed like a house of cards.\n  Congress's attempt to prevent this from happening again was the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, otherwise referred to \naround here as PUHCA. That was our attempt in the 1930s to prevent what \nwas happening then from happening again, with all the frauds and the \ncollapse of the house of cards of the electric utility companies.\n  Then we go forward 60 years to about the midnineties, and we were \ntold that\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\nthe restructured electric utility industry would be built upon markets \nand trading, that the markets would ensure the soundness of the \nindustry, that the PUHCA now was just a hindrance to cheaper power, \nmore available power, for all of our consumers; that PUHCA was not only \nirrelevant but probably even a hindrance.\n\n  Enron was both the leading participant in and the leading advocate of \nthis new scheme of electricity markets. They were not the only one, but \nthey were the leading one. They were the ones that had the closest ties \nto people in Congress and to the Bush administration.\n  It turned out that Enron, like the electric companies of the 1910s \nand 1920s, was also built upon frauds, shell games, and out-and-out \ncriminal activity. When troubles hit, Enron, too, collapsed like a \nhouse of cards. Again, this is what we saw in the 1930s.\n  As Senator Cantwell has brought out, we had a whole new set of terms \nof art that entered our vocabulary: Fat Boy, Get Shorty, Death Star, \nand many more. Enron had legions of employees who were paid to dream up \nways to defraud the public and manipulate prices of electricity and \ntransmission capacity. They ranged from affiliate structures, creative \nloans, trading strategies.\n  We have heard about Wheel Out, about how they tried to sell \nelectricity through nonexistent lines. Again, Enron was not the only \none. FERC has found dozens of companies were involved in fraud, that \nmarket manipulation was epidemic.\n  The whole energy industry still has not recovered. In fact, the whole \neconomy is hurt by investors who have lost their trust in American \ncorporate management.\n  Now we see that PUHCA, the Public Utilities Holding Company Act, was, \nin fact, irrelevant to Enron schemes. Why? Because FERC had determined \nthat Enron was exempt from the law. Even that was not enough for \nEnron's chairman Ken Lay, who later threatened to remove the FERC \nchairman if he did not back his beloved markets and schemes more \nstrongly.\n  Where is Ken Lay today? Is he in prison? Is he behind bars? Well, of \ncourse not. I understand he had to sell a couple of his big houses, one \nin Colorado and one someplace else, but he is out free. He may be on \nthe French Riviera for all I know. I do not know where he is. He made a \nlot of money. He sacked it away and he is living a grand life.\n  Now I guess a couple of his underlings went to jail because they got \ncaught, but Ken Lay, the brains behind the whole scheme, the person who \nthreatened to remove the FERC chairman, is scot-free. So much for \njustice in this regard.\n  At this point I doubt this Justice Department is going to do anything \nto really go after Ken Lay because of his closeness to the Bush \nadministration. But Enron showed more clearly than any episode since \nthe Great Depression that strong Federal oversight is needed in the \nelectric industry; that fraud hurts consumers, investors, and our whole \neconomy.\n  The Domenici substitute bans one particular trading scheme, round-\ntrip trading, but it leaves all the other schemes with these names we \nhave heard of from Star Wars. It would still leave them there, and \nSenator Cantwell just laid all of those out for us. So it would leave \nall of those untouched.\n  Why just ban one and leave all the other ones there? Well, as one \nstep to restoring confidence in the energy industry and thus getting \nthe economy moving again, we need to ban all such market manipulation. \nThat is what the Cantwell amendment does and that is why I support it.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the State of Missouri, the home State \nof one of my political heroes, Harry Truman, a great Democrat. Harry \nTruman once said when he was campaigning in 1948 in the Midwest and \ntalking to a bunch of farmers who had lost a lot in the Depression and \nhe was telling them that his opponent, Mr. Dewey, was going to turn the \nclock back and they were going to get rid of all of the support they \nhad had for agriculture. Truman uttered one of his great lines. He \nsaid: How many times do you have to get hit on the head before you \nfigure out what is hitting you on the head?\n  Well, I would like to take Harry Truman's line and apply it to us and \nthe electricity industry. How many times do we have to get burned by \nfraudulent schemes in this industry before we figure out what we ought \nto do about it and ban all of these activities? How many times do we \nhave to get hit on the head before we figure out there are deep \nproblems in the electricity industry and they have to be solved? \nBecause if they do not, it is going to continue to hurt our economy.\n  Our economy right now is in terrible shape. I will divert just a \nlittle bit from this bill for a few minutes if the Senator does not \nmind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 32 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Five minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in March of 2001, President Bush visited \nWestern Michigan University to stump for his tax cuts. He said:\n\n     . . . we can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  Of course, today we know that what the President said that day was \nnot true, and I think it is time now that the White House comes clean \non this issue. We do not know whether the President was aware at the \ntime he made this statement that it probably was not true, but somebody \nshould have known.\n  Surely, someone in this administration knew that trillions of dollars \nof tax breaks, combined with a downturn in the economy, would lead to \nmassive budget deficits.\n  Following that speech, this administration gave trillions in tax \nbreaks to the wealthy, the economy softened, and we have gone straight \nfrom record projected surpluses to record projected deficits and debt. \nIn fact, just 2 years later, the United States now faces massive, \nprolonged, record-setting projected deficits--over $450 billion this \nyear, $475 billion next year, and trillions of dollars of deficits over \nthe coming years.\n  So, what the President said that day in 2001 was in fact woefully \nfalse.\n  Now, I know the other side is going to accuse me of making a mountain \nout of a molehill on this issue. They will say I am just taking 16 \nwords from one speech and blowing them out of proportion in order to \nchallenge the President's credibility. They will ask: How can 16 words \nin one speech be the test of a President's credibility?\n  Yes, I can hear the President's defenders already. They will say: \nThis speech was cleared by the Council of Economic Advisors. It is not \nthe President's fault. He relies on the technical advice of experts on \nthese matters.\n  Maybe that is the case. Maybe the President thought he was telling \nthe truth when he said we could reduce Government revenues by huge \namounts without causing deficits. But somebody should have known it was \nnot true.\n  If not one in this administration knew that passing enormous tax \nbreaks for the wealthy, combined with an economic downturn, might lead \nto exploding deficits, that does not exactly inspire a lot of \nconfidence, either.\n  The President's defenders on this issue may also say:\n\n       Well, actually, the statement is technically accurate, and \n     did not mislead anyone. After all, it says we can proceed \n     without fear of budget deficits. It does not say we will not \n     actually experience massive budget deficits. It just says we \n     do not need to fear them.\n\n  Unfortunately, that explanation will not work, either. As Alan \nGreenspan has reminded us repeatedly, large deficits do matter, and \nthey are something to be concerned about.\n  In truth, it is pretty obvious that the White House intended to \ncommunicate that the President's massive tax cuts would not create \ncorresponding massive deficits. It is now apparent that someone misled \nthe public in that speech by the President.\n  ``Well, but even if what the President said was not true,'' I can \nhear his defenders say, ``it does not matter. What matters is that we \ndid what we really\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nset out to do. We provided the most affluent Americans with large tax \nbreaks. We rewarded our largest campaign contributors with millions.''\n  Now, I hope that is not the real explanation. But that is what \nactually happened.\n  These days the administration does not want us to pay too close \nattention to what the President actually says. In fact, sometimes they \nwould rather we disregard it altogether, especially when it is only 16 \nwords. They say it does not really matter.\n  In this case, as in others, what the President of the United States \nsays does matter. The President needs to come clean about these \nremarks. He needs to admit his mistakes. Otherwise we are left with the \ndistinct impression the President, his advisers, or both, purposefully \nmisled the American people about the economy in order to get tax breaks \nfor the wealthy.\n  If they were a mistake, these 16 words, then the President ought to \nadmit it. The resulting policy is driving our economy into the ground. \nIf they would acknowledge the statement was wrong, hopefully we could \nall come together to remedy the President's economic malpractice and \nget the economy moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the ranking member, \nSenator Bingaman, who is a cosponsor of my amendment. He has worked \nhard in bringing attention to everyone about this issue of market \nmanipulation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for yielding \ntime on this amendment. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. I commend \nher for offering the amendment and focusing the attention of the Senate \non this important set of issues.\n  The electricity title is perhaps the most complex part of this entire \nEnergy bill. We recognize and understand there is a lot of complexity \nin writing a provision or a title that governs the regulation of \nelectricity.\n  However, the issue that the Cantwell amendment deals with is not \ncomplicated. It is extremely straightforward. Frankly, I am at a loss \nto understand why we cannot get agreement between Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate to go ahead and close this loophole which has \nbecome so clear to everyone in the country who has paid any attention \nto energy prices and energy markets in recent years.\n  Just a year ago, newspaper stories had almost daily headlines about \npower marketers manipulating the market in California and in the \nNorthwest States, Washington and Oregon, in particular. Unfortunately, \nit seems something has been forgotten since those stories were written \na year ago.\n  Senator Cantwell has outlined very dramatically and effectively the \nparade of these schemes devised to defraud utilities--and ultimately to \ndefraud consumers--that have resulted in consumers paying substantially \nmore every month when they pay their utility bills. They have very \nexotic names. But the truth is, her amendment is extremely \nstraightforward.\n\n  Let me read the operative part of this amendment and ask how this can \nbe objectionable to anyone.\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or \n     indirectly, to use or employ, in connection with the purchase \n     or sale of electric energy or the purchase or sale of \n     transmission services subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     Commission, manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance \n     in contravention of such rules and regulations as the \n     Commission may promulgate as appropriate in the public \n     interest for the protection of electric ratepayers.\n\n  What is wrong with saying it is illegal to engage in manipulative and \ndeceptive practices? I cannot understand why we are spending so much \ntime debating an issue that seems so straightforward to me.\n  The Domenici substitute does prohibit round-trip trades. And they \nshould be prohibited. Unfortunately, it does not go the next step and \ndo exactly what I just read, which the Cantwell amendment would do. We \nneed to add this provision. We need to be sure the tools are there in \nthe Federal Regulatory Commission to do this job in the future.\n  I sympathize with the statements the Senator from Washington has made \nabout the inaction of the Federal Regulatory Commission in the early \nmonths of the Bush administration. There was a period when prices were \ngoing through the ceiling, particularly on the west coast, and we were \nnot seeing action out of the Federal Regulatory Commission as we should \nhave. That was corrected, in my view at least. It was corrected after \nthe new chairman came in, Chairman Wood, and began to assert the \nauthority the Federal Regulatory Commission had and should have been \nasserting all along to go ahead and step in.\n  This is an additional tool. We should give FERC this tool and make it \nclear in the law that all of these deceptive and manipulative practices \nare illegal. Once we make that clear, we are in a position to hold the \nFederal Regulatory Commission accountable if, in fact, manipulative or \ndeceptive practices occur in the future.\n  This is not an academic inquiry. These practices resulted in \nincreased utility bills for many Americans. The Senator from Washington \nshould be commended for stepping in to ensure that does not recur in \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Mexico has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself 5 minutes of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I come to the floor this morning frustrated in part by \nsome of the debate that has occurred on the floor. The Senator from \nWashington and I agree the ratepayers of the Pacific Northwest have \nbeen injured by a dysfunctional California market that was badly \ndesigned and badly conceived from the beginning. In fact, it got so bad \nand it has been so dramatically treated in the wrong political way that \nwe have a gubernatorial recall going on in the State of California \nright now.\n  Finally, the ratepayers of California got it figured out. The \npolitics of California destroyed the market and the ratepayers of \nWashington, Oregon, and Idaho had to help pay for it.\n  To come to the floor this morning and say nothing is going on and \nnobody is being prosecuted is, in fact, wrong. It is not telling the \nwhole truth. The title we have in front of us, the electrical title, \nstill allows thorough and aggressive prosecution of those who violate \nthe law.\n  Where is the regulatory gap that is being talked about this morning \nthat the Senator from the State of Washington, by her amendment, might \nchange? Here are the agencies involved at this moment: The President's \nCorporate Fraud Task Force, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \nFederal Regulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United States Postal \nService, and numerous U.S. Attorney's Offices. Their cooperative \nenforcement activities have focused on investigations of possible \nround-trip trading, false reporting, fraud, manipulation of energy \ncompanies and their affiliates, employees, and their agents.\n  There is a list of some of the actions taken on various Federal \nagencies. Let me run through them:\n  Starting on July 16, 2003, the FERC administrative law judge \nrecommended Enron be required to refund $32.5 million for violating \nsection 205(c) of the Federal Power Act.\n  June 25, 2003, FERC revoked the market-based rate authority of the \nEnron power marketing entity.\n  June 3, 2003, John M. Forney, manager of the Enron real-time trading \ndesk during 1999 and 2000, was arrested and charged with wire fraud and \nconspiracy.\n  May 1, 2003, new criminal charges were filed against former Enron \nchief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, including charges of security \nfraud, insider trading, falsification of Enron accounting records, tax \nfraud, and self-dealing.\n  I could go on, and I have numerous lists. But that is Enron.\n  Let me go to Reliant Resources: May 12, 2003, Securities and Exchange \nCommission issued a cease and desist order against Reliant Resources \nand Reliant Energy arising from Reliant's admission in May of 2002 that \nit conducted round-trip trading for the purpose of artificially \nincreasing trading volume.\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\n  Dynegy, another energy company, June 12, 2003; the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the South District of Texas charged three former Dynegy \nemployees with conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud \nin connection with round-trip energy trades, and the Securities and \nExchange Commission also filed civil securities fraud charges against \nthe former employees.\n  How about El Paso Corporation? May 9, 2003--in May of 2003 FERC \ndeferred action in a pending proceeding stemming from allegations of \naffiliate abuse and anticompetitive impacts on the delivered price of \ngas and the wholesale electric market in California.\n  It goes on and on. I have four more pages of about seven items per \npage of actions that have already been taken against these companies.\n  The question is, Does the electrical title that we have before the \nSenate today create a regulatory gap? The answer is quite obviously no.\n  Does it change the problem in the State of Washington? Washington got \nstiffed by the old law and the old process. Idaho's ratepayers got \nstiffed by the old law and the old process. And the citizens of \nCalifornia have finally said: We have a Governor who will not do \nanything about it. He put us in a huge deficit problem, and we are \ngoing to throw him out of office. And that is what that recall is \nabout. It all stems from a phenomenally dysfunctional electric market \nthat the people of California created, and they created it by \nderegulating wholesale and regulating retail and in came the scammers \nand the scammers are now being prosecuted as they should be.\n  I do not believe the amendment is necessary. I believe the title in \nthis bill on electricity appropriately addresses this. There is \ntransparency. There is no regulatory gap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know my colleagues from the other side \nof the aisle want a chance to use up some of their time. I do not know \nwhether the chairman wanted to speak now. The Senator from Louisiana \nwas going to be yielded a few minutes, also. I do not know if the \nchairman wanted to use time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Cantwell have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 21 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from New Mexico has a half hour less than \nthe Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I inquire if the Senator from Louisiana desires to \nspeak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, Mr. President, I desire to speak both in support \nof the chairman----\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will yield and speak after Senator \nLandrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to ask, since it seems \nthere is enough time, if I could have 10 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent for that.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator is yielded 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Domenici \nsubstitute electricity amendment. There have been few other parts of \nthe Energy bill that have been more controversial or that have been the \nsubject of more debate than the electricity provisions. The Domenici \namendment is a well-crafted compromise that represents some of the best \nthinking on electricity deregulation. It is worthy of the support of \nall Senators because it addresses those issues that need to be \naddressed and does so in a fair and balanced way.\n  The Domenici amendment deserves the bipartisan support of the Senate \nbecause it provides Federal agencies such as the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with new \ntools to prevent and penalize anti-consumer and manipulative behavior, \nincluding false price reporting and simultaneous trading of the same \nvolumes of electricity between two entities, known as round-trip \ntrading. It encourages distributed and renewable generation through a \nnationwide net metering program; in other words, it allows entities \nthat use solar power or small gas generators to put excess electricity \nback into the grid.\n  It moves the FERC's refund authority back to the filing of a \ncomplaint. Currently there is a 60-day grace period before refunds can \nbe issued--the proposed language removes the 60 days. It expands FERC's \nmerger review authority by increasing the number of transactions that \nwill be subject to FERC review and approval; in addition to utilities \nFERC now will be able to review mergers of transmission assets. This \nprohibits so-called ``slamming'' and ``cramming.'' This concept comes \nfrom the telecom industry. Slamming is when retail customers have their \nservice switched unknowingly, for example, AT to Sprint. Cramming is \nwhen retail customers have items added on to their bills unknowingly, \nfor example, call waiting.\n  It requires the FTC to issue rules protecting the privacy of electric \nconsumers; and the customers information cannot be shared without their \nconsent. It requires FERC to issue a new policy establishing conditions \nunder which public utilities may charge market-based rates. This policy \nis to consider consumer protection, market power and other factors \ndeemed necessary by FERC to ensure that market based rates are just and \nreasonable. FERC cannot switch to market base rates if a monopoly exist \nor else will have to employ cost based rates.\n  Let me talk a few moments about the consumer protection provisions of \nthis amendment. This is an area where some of my colleagues say the \nDomenici amendment does not go far enough. I believe that the \nprovisions of the Domenici amendment are a significant first step in \nthe right direction. Let me tell you why. First, the Domenici amendment \nwould require FERC for the first time to issue rules to establish an \nelectronic information system to provide information about the price \nand availability of wholesale electric energy and transmission \ncapacity. Transparency is key to well functioning and fair electricity \nmarkets and this amendment will significantly improve transparency. The \namendment further seeks to ensure market transparency and integrity by \nprohibiting the filing of false information regarding the price of \nwholesale electricity and availability of transmission capacity.\n  Second, the amendment would prohibit specific manipulative conduct \nand practices, including simultaneous trading of the same volumes of \nelectricity between two entities--round-trip trading.\n  Third, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is given important \nnew authority that will improve market transparency and further \nstrengthen anti-manipulation powers. These new powers include a \nstrengthening of the CFTC's authority to investigate and punish fraud \nand manipulation in the reporting of electric and natural gas prices \nand an expansion of the CFTC's general anti-fraud authority to cover \ncertain on-line trading platforms, like those run by Enron.\n  Fourth, the amendment substantially increases criminal penalties for \nviolations of the Federal Power Act to $1,000,000 per violation and \ncivil penalties are substantially increased as well.\n  Finally, the refund effective date for violation of the ``just and \nreasonable'' pricing standard under the Federal Power Act is moved back \nto the date of the filing of a complaint, thus giving consumers a \ngreater likelihood of receiving refunds where prices are found not to \nbe ``just and reasonable.''\n  In short, this is a good consumer protection package and it is one \nthat is worthy of our support. The Domenici amendment also makes \ncertain long-overdue reforms to our Nation's outdated electricity laws. \nFor example, the amendment would carefully extend open access \nrequirements to transmission systems owned by all large transmission-\nowning utilities so that\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nlarger, more seamless regional wholesale electricity markets can be \ncreated. It would establish new transmission pricing policies to help \nensure that those benefitting most from new transmission investments \nare obligated to pay for them. It reforms PURPA while protecting \nexisting investments, contracts, and expectations. Lastly, it repeals \nPUHCA, while ensuring that State and Federal regulators have access to \nthe books, records and information needed to ensure informed regulatory \naction.\n  Mr. President, this is a good amendment. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  However, there are some improvements that should be incorporated. One \nsuch example would be Senator Cantwell's amendment that places a broad \nprohibition on all manipulative practices in electricity markets.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from Oregon would like a few minutes. I am \nhappy to yield to the Senator from Oregon 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, and I \nalso thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy.\n  I rise in strong support of the Cantwell amendment. What we have seen \nin the Pacific Northwest with respect to the manipulation of our energy \nmarkets is that the position of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission has simply been see no evil, hear no evil, and ignore evil.\n  The reason I have come to that conclusion is that when the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission Commissioners came to the Energy Committee \nin March to discuss with us the question of manipulation of the Pacific \nNorthwest market, I read excerpts point by point from the Reliant \nEnergy trading transcript to the Commissioners. I read to them pretty \nmuch like a bedtime story. Here is the portion of the transcript that I \nread to the Commissioners. It involves the Reliant manager.\n  He says:\n\n       How did it work today?\n       Reliant Trader: 129. We're talking about the power \n     exchange.\n       Reliant Manager: Yeah. I saw that.\n       Reliant Trader: Then we trade up to 1.31 for the third \n     quarter next year.\n       Reliant Manager: Sweet.\n       Reliant Trader. We even had a senior manager down here.\n\n  Listen, if you would, Mr. President, and colleagues to this.\n  The reliant trader said:\n\n       He just wanted us to know that everybody thought it was \n     really exciting that we're gonna play some market power.\n\n  After reading this transcript, I asked the Commissioners, How can you \nreach the conclusion after what I have read to you that overpriced \ncontracts based on manipulation toward market prices should not be \navoided or at least reformed? I pointed out it was clear just on the \nbasis of that short excerpt that the traders were manipulating long-\nterm prices when they were talking about the third quarter next year.\n  What is more, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staff's \ninvestigative report issued earlier this year found that there was a \nparticularly significant correlation between spot prices and shorter 1- \nto 2-year contracts. Despite being caught in the act with a smoking \ntranscript, despite having it read to them like a bedtime story, \ndespite the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's staff findings, the \nmajority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--specifically \nCommissioners Wood and Brownell--still cannot see the connection \nbetween these caught-in-the-act, smoking gun memos and transcripts and \nthe higher energy prices my constituents are now paying because of the \nmarket manipulation detailed in these transcripts.\n  I am pleased to be able to have just a couple of moments here. But it \nseems to me if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is unwilling or \nunable to police long-term energy markets in cases like this where \npeople in the Pacific Northwest are being ripped off in broad daylight, \nit is time for the Congress to step in. That is why the Cantwell \namendment is so important.\n  I urge my colleagues to back the Cantwell amendment and outlaw the \nkind of manipulation that I have read to the Senate today and that I \nread to the Energy Committee. Unfortunately, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission is unwilling or unable to address it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will soon have a unanimous consent \nrequest that will set up another amendment of the same class to follow \nthis afternoon immediately after the vote on the judge.\n  In the meantime, I have around 20 minutes to speak. I would like very \nmuch to be as short as I can. But first, let me say to fellow Senators \nthat I am very proud of the electricity amendment, with 13 bipartisan \ncosponsors, which is pending. Does anybody think we would have worked \non that for days on end and not have provisions in it that take care of \nthe problems that Senator Cantwell is talking about? Is it conceivable \nthat I would come to the Senate floor with what we perceive to be a \ngreat American reform of an electricity system from top to bottom and \nleave out protection for the kind of people she is speaking of? I will \nanswer my own question by saying that is impossible. It is impossible \nbecause we wouldn't let it happen. Second, it is impossible because it \ndidn't happen.\n  Having said that, I understand full well--and I have explained \nprivately to the very distinguished Senator, Ms. Cantwell. As I talked \nwith her, I could just see how her very being was upset with what has \nhappened to her constituents because of the pricing that went wild in \nthe State of California for which she got the aftermath in her State. \nBut it is not only her State and her constituents, it is a whole \nsection of the country which, in a sense, got it in the neck because of \nCalifornia.\n  While I am at it--I intended to do this later in my remarks, but let \nme do it right now--there was a lot of talk about what happened to \nbring those prices to that outrageously wild system that ended up \nfalling over on to her constituents. And the word ``manipulation'' was \nused and that even FERC said, in a report, manipulation caused it.\n  Let me suggest, the Senator from New Mexico has done everything he \ncould to try to find out what the real experts say caused it, and none \nof them say it was manipulation that was at the heart of the problem of \nprices going outlandishly high on the west coast. As a matter of fact, \nwhether you ask the Federal Reserve Board or whether you look at the \nFERC report, the root cause is found not to be--not to be--\nmanipulation. The meltdown was a significant supply shortage and \nfatally flawed design statutes.\n  Let me repeat, the general consensus of those who have looked at it \ncarefully say significant supply shortfall added to a fatally flawed \ndesign market and that blew up the California market and, thus, its \nsurrounding States.\n  On March 26, 2003, FERC issued its ``Final Report on Price \nManipulation in Western Markets.'' Senator Cantwell believes the report \nproves there was manipulation. However, not everyone shares that view.\n  As a matter of fact, the Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA, \nis considered one of the top, if not the top, energy market analysts in \nthe world. Daniel Yergin, the chairman of CERA, is the most respected \nexpert in energy policy and the author of the ``Prize,'' the Pulitzer \nAward-winning book on the global oil market.\n  CERA noted that FERC ignored the natural gas and electricity supply \nshortages and assumed scarcity was attributed to manipulation. It was \nscarcity first, and then it was flawed design statutes which permitted \nthe scarcity to go berserk.\n  Now, that is aside from the question.\n  Let's get back to the issue of the bill and whether we would bring \nbefore the body a bill that we would ask the entire Senate to support--\nthat I am very hopeful, by the time we are finished, will get in excess \nof 65, 70 votes--that does not protect the citizens from what happened \non the west coast.\n  Now, this amendment addresses the Federal Power Act and the Natural \nGas Act in the following ways:\n  No. 1, it establishes an electronic information system at FERC to \nenhance market transparency.\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\n  No. 2, it increases criminal and civil penalties under the Federal \nPower Act and the Natural Gas Act.\n  No. 3, it enhances FERC's refund authority.\n  No. 4, it requires FERC to issue regulations establishing conditions \nunder which utilities can charge market-based rates.\n  No. 5, it prohibits the filing of false information.\n  And, last, it prohibits round-trip trading.\n  Further, the so-called Domenici amendment--that is the master \namendment we are operating under that I have asked parenthetically of \nmyself: Would I bring it here without protecting for the future events \nthat are being alluded to by the distinguished Senator who is worried \nabout her State--that Domenici amendment enhances the role of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to provide oversight over \nelectricity and natural gas.\n  The Senate, in my humble opinion, should reject amendments--all of \nthem--to the electricity title of the bill that would affect FERC's and \nthe CFTC's flexibility to react and deal with bad actors and upset \nfurther the already beleaguered utility industry's ability to respond \nto a changing market.\n\n  Now, I do not want to take a lot of time because, frankly, I am not \nsure, when we go on forever, that anybody listens. But I want to tell \nyou that even without the so-called Domenici Modernization Act, the \nmarkets are being forced to respond, because FERC is taking action in \nthe form of initiatives to protect electricity consumers, increase \nmarket transparency, and strengthen the regulation of electricity \nmarkets at the wholesale level.\n  They have proposed to identify more clearly transactions and \npractices that would be prohibited under electricity sellers' market-\nbased rate tariffs and gas sellers' blanket certificate authority. \nThese new market behavior rules would prohibit market manipulation or \nattempts to manipulate the market through activities such as creating \nand relieving artificial congestion.\n  They have proposed to require electricity sellers to operate and \nschedule generating facilities in compliance with the rules and \nregulations of the relevant power market.\n  They have proposed to require sellers to provide complete, accurate, \nand factual information in all communications with FERC, RTOs, ISOs, \nmarket monitors, and other similar entities. They have proposed \nmeasures to assure the accuracy of electricity and natural gas price \nreporting.\n  They have established a new Office of Market Oversight and \nInvestigations as part of a stepped-up enforcement and audit program.\n  And I could go on.\n  Clearly, they are enforcing the law. They are taking out after those \nwho are causing this market to react other than in a normal market way. \nAnd we will add to that authority in the bill that is before us which \ndoes not have to be amended.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has aggressively prosecuted \nfraud and manipulation in energy markets. They have committed 25 \npercent of their enforcement staff to conduct investigations into \nmisconduct in energy markets.\n  CFTC's existing authority empowers it to prosecute fraud and \nmanipulation. Under the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, they have filed civil action against Enron and a former \nEnron vice president for manipulation of prices in natural gas markets. \nThey have filed civil action against Enron for operating an illegal \nfutures exchange. They have filed civil action against El Paso Merchant \nfor false reporting and have a $20 million settlement. And they have \nfiled civil action against Dynegy Marketing for false reporting and \nhave a $5 million settlement. They have filed civil action against \nEncana Trading for false reporting and Williams Trading for false \nreporting, both with a $20 million settlement.\n  Criminal actions have been filed, and I have a complete list of \nthose. Enron's former head of CA trading pled guilty to conspiracy.\n  We don't need further amendments beyond the Domenici amendment that \nis pending to be sure the constituents of the distinguished Senator \nfrom the State of Washington are protected. They are protected. All we \ndo by adding more is making the market more difficult. We would \naccomplish little but perhaps to say to ourselves we have done much.\n  The Natural Gas Supply Association, the Interstate Natural Gas \nAssociation, and the American Gas Association have all endorsed the \nmarket manipulation provisions in this amendment we call the Domenici \namendment. I believe it is right as it is. It need not be changed.\n  Mr. President, let me just generally talk about where we want to go. \nSoon we will have the unanimous consent request in writing.\n  I say to the Senator, maybe we can just recite it here since you and \nI know it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next amendment we will offer is an \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin dealing with the electricity \nsection. He has agreed his time on it will take approximately a half \nhour. Senator Feingold is usually quite concise. The problem is that if \nwe lock in this time agreement, people coming and wishing to speak on \nother subjects would not be able to do so. We have no reason to think \nanybody is going to or not going to. We don't want to have those time \nconstraints. We are going to offer the next amendment. It would be the \nFeingold amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. People might want to speak to which amendment? To the \namendment you were referring to?\n  Mr. REID. Well, to be very direct to the Senator from New Mexico, as \nI want to be, the majority leader has told us we are going to vote on \ncloture tomorrow on the attorney general of Alabama, Mr. Pryor. We have \nhad no opportunity to debate this. We will have a half hour tomorrow \nunder the rules. We are going to have members of the Judiciary \nCommittee come this afternoon and speak to the competency and the \nprofessionalism of the attorney general of Alabama to be a United \nStates Federal judge. People are going to take some time doing that. \nWhen they will come, I don't know. But we wouldn't want them to be \nprevented from doing that because we are in a time agreement on the \nFeingold amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we agree where we are going? There is an \namendment up shortly, is there not?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No unanimous consent has been \npropounded. The Senator from New Mexico controls the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have not propounded a unanimous \nconsent request. I just wanted to know how much time is left to Senator \nCantwell.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington \ncontrols 7 minutes and 20 seconds. The Senator from New Mexico controls \n9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from California is here. The Senator from \nWashington has 7 minutes left. She wants to close. We have no more time \nthan 7 minutes. The Senator from California wishes to speak on this \namendment. She can only do that if unanimous consent is given to allow \nher to speak for up to 15 minutes. Otherwise, she will not be able to \nspeak on the amendment. She wants to. Is that a fair description?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is a fair description. I have great respect for \nthe chairman of our committee. However, he did not correctly present \nthe California situation. I would like an opportunity to set the record \nstraight.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that on the Cantwell amendment, the \nSenator from California be allowed to speak for 15 additional minutes \nand that, of course, the majority, if in fact they want 15 minutes, \nwould have equal time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, there is objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't want to object to the Senator \nfrom California speaking. I just want to remind the Senator and the \nSenate, this amendment has been on the floor 3 hours--not 3 minutes, \nnot 30 minutes, 3 hours. We are supposed to vote, generally, when 3 \nhours is up. Three hours will be up in a few minutes. I would like to \nproceed and vote. I have a few minutes. I don't know that I need it. \nBut I really don't think I am being unfair in suggesting to the Senator \nthat perhaps, so we can vote on an amendment that has been pending for \n3 hours, if you could take half the time you requested so we can \nproceed to vote, I would have no objection.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may respond, this is an amendment on market \nmanipulation. You, Mr. Chairman, have just said there wasn't market \nmanipulation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have not.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to present evidence specifically. I have \n18 to 20 disks involving 3,000 pieces of paper which is evidence \npresented to FERC of market manipulation in the California market. This \nSenator has done a great service because those of us out west know what \nhappened. What happened is so egregious as to give the senior Senator \nfrom California an opportunity to support the amendment of her \ncolleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't think it is fair for the Senator--I am going to \ngive her time, but I don't think it is fair for her to give a speech \nthis way. She knows she is going to get time, and she can just be \npatient like every other Senator, if you don't mind.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have been patient.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you.\n  Might I say to the Senate, the Senator from New Mexico has responded \nto an amendment. Never once did I say there was no market manipulation. \nI don't intend that every time any of us gives a speech, that somebody \ncome to the floor when there are time agreements and decide they would \nlike to give a speech on something they heard.\n  I said there are studies that say market manipulation was not the \nprincipal reason for what happened. If the Senator would like to speak, \nI would ask her if she would speak for a little less time so we can \nproceed, since the time is up. I can object, and we will vote. And then \nyou can speak after the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So you can sustain the goodwill of the rest of the \ncolleagues because you are managing the bill, you should.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will suspend. The \nSenators are reminded to address one another in the third person or \nthrough the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I simply say to the Senator that to sustain the goodwill \nthat he needs to, he will work the bill, but when there are time \nagreements of 3 hours, this Senator will object to adding more time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to ask the Senator if he wanted to object at \nthis point. He is not going to object.\n  How much time did the Senator ask for?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I asked for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if you would take 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will do my level best.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right, 10 minutes, so long as we understand. I ask \nunanimous consent that she have 10 minutes, after which time we will \nfinish the time allowed and then we will vote on the pending amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from California is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  I wanted to say a few words in support of what Senator Cantwell is \ntrying to do. Perhaps those of us in the West are more disconnected \nfrom the Beltway than I ever believed, but let me give you a startling \nfact which will demonstrate market manipulation. The total cost of \nelectricity in California in 1999 was $7 billion. It increased 400 \npercent in one year to $27 billion the next year. There is no way \nsupply and demand can be responsible for a 400 percent increase.\n  What we now know is that power generators, traders, and marketers \nmanipulated the western energy markets, and the market abuse wasn't \nsimply limited to Enron. Look at these schemes. There are more than we \never knew: Ricochet, Death Star, Get Shorty, Fat Boy, Nonfirm Export, \nLoad Shift, Wheel Out, Black Widow, Red Congo, Cuddly Bear. This was \nnot limited to Enron. It was a widespread series of schemes perpetuated \nby many companies that supplied and traded in the West. I deeply \nbelieve this.\n  The State of California, the California Attorney General's office, \nand the State's largest utilities compiled the 3,000-page report \ndetailing the pervasiveness of fraud and manipulation in the western \nenergy market in 2000. Then they couldn't present it to FERC. They had \nto go to a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to get the ability to conduct \ndiscovery and evidentiary hearings to be able to bring the allegations \nof fraud and manipulation to FERC. So the whole Federal system is \nstacked against allowing a State to make a presentation of fraud and \nmanipulation.\n  This report concluded that energy companies intentionally withheld \npower from the western market, driving prices up and creating false \nshortages. For example, from August 30 to December 3, 2000, Dynegy shut \ndown one of its units for repairs, yet repairs had already been done \nprior to August 30.\n  The report's conclusion: The plant was shut down to intentionally \ndrive up prices.\n  Another example. Following an external tube leak, Merit held one of \nits plants offline for 2 extra days, from October 20 until October 22, \n2000, denying the western energy market much needed power and driving \nprices up. The report also submitted evidence that suppliers bid higher \nafter the California independent systems operator declared emergencies, \nknowing full well the State would need power and would be willing to \npay any price to get it.\n  Further, we learned that suppliers submitted false load schedules to \nincrease prices. One example of this bogus load is demonstrated in an \ninternal PowerX memo, which documents that PowerX entered into a \ncontract with the explicit purpose of overscheduling and \nunderscheduling and for congestion manipulation.\n  Other games were played in the western energy market, including \ncollusion among sellers, sharing of nonpublic generation outage \ninformation, and the manipulation of the nitrogen oxide emission \nmarket. Just look at one fact. One company, CMS Energy Corporation, has \nadmitted conducting wash energy trades that artificially inflated its \nrevenue by more than $4.4 billion. These round trips accounted for 80 \npercent of that company's trading that year, in 2001. So 80 percent of \nthe trading of a large company was bogus in that year. The market was \nrife with fraud and manipulation.\n  Senator Cantwell's amendment attempts to strengthen the Federal Power \nAct, so that the fraudulent and manipulative behavior we witnessed in \nthe western energy crisis does not go unpunished.\n  The problem is that FERC could not go back. FERC would not accept \nfindings from California to document the fraud and manipulation. \nCalifornia, to this day, has not received $1 of refund, despite \nsettlements. So that is what is really going on out there, and that is \na huge problem.\n  To have an Energy bill that doesn't adequately deal with fraud and \nmanipulation is something none of us should vote for. I will tell you \nwhy. Under the present regulations, it can and will happen again. These \ncompanies will try to do it if they possibly can. Consumers should be \nprotected from fraud and manipulation perpetrated by people who are \nonly motivated by profit, which we know dominated the trading scenario \nin the western energy market. I can tell you terrible things traders \nsaid about shutting off power for the purpose of inflating the bottom \nline of their company. That is wrong and it should be dealt with.\n  The fact is that FERC has not dealt with it up to this point. So I \nvery strongly support what Senator Cantwell is trying to do. I hope the \nSenate will accept it because I think the energy title is weak. I hope \nat a later time to add natural gas to some of the\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\nprovisions that this bill achieves in terms of increasing penalties in \nthe electricity market. Unfortunately, the bill does not harmonize \npenalties for the natural gas market, and there is ample evidence of \nfraud and manipulation as well in the national gas market, specifically \nwith El Paso Natural Gas, and I hope to indicate that in an amendment I \nwill do at a later time.\n  I have tried to truncate my remarks to cooperate with the chairman. I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for getting her \nremarks down to 10 minutes. How much time does Senator Cantwell have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. She has 7 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does she want to deliver her remarks?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 7 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Does the Senator from New Mexico wish to complete his \ncomments?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will wait for a while.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman of the \ncommittee giving time to the Senator from California so she could \nexplain and respond to her views on this issue. I appreciate my \ncolleagues from the West engaging in this debate. I appreciate the \nSenator from Idaho coming to the floor and reiterating to this body, \nyes, how ratepayers in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho got stiffed. That \nis the right word. We got stiffed. We got stiffed with paying a bill \nmore exorbitant than ratepayers should have to pay.\n  The debate that has ensued in the last few minutes is whether the \nDomenici underlying amendment has enough protections in it to protect \nconsumers or whether we need the Cantwell amendment. It is a clear and \nsimple and plain statement that market manipulation should be outlawed \nin the Federal Power Act as not being just and reasonable.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her comments. She supports the \nunderlying Domenici title, but she supports my amendment as well \nbecause she knows that kind of language can be helpful and can be \nspecific.\n  Let me be clear. If anybody thinks that the Enron manipulation didn't \nhave a profound and adverse impact on the marketplace and that this is \nall about poor management in California, I can assure you that is not \nthe case. This is about whether this body is going to adopt tough \nstandards against market manipulation so there is no question by the \npublic. So the public doesn't debate, if there was a shortage of supply \nor manipulation going on?\n  We know there was manipulation going on. We have proof of it. The \nFERC itself said:\n\n       Enron and its affiliates intentionally engaged in a variety \n     of market manipulation schemes that had profound, adverse \n     impact on market outcome.\n\n  There it is. The FERC said itself that market manipulation had \nprofound, adverse impact on the market. So we know for a fact that \nmarket manipulation had an impact in California, it had an impact in \nWashington, it had an impact in Oregon, and it had an impact in Idaho. \nThe question is whether this body is going to do enough to protect \nconsumers in the future.\n  So the chairman of the committee--I appreciate his earnest time on \nthe electricity title, and I appreciate the fact that he wants to have \nsome protection in this legislation. But these protections don't go far \nenough.\n  Let me explain why. There is transparency language in the underlying \nDomenici title. Some of those powers are already in place with FERC. \nThey are not doing us any good because reporting to FERC is one thing; \nreporting to the California ISO, the independent systems operator, who \nbasically was the cog by which all the manipulations took place, you \nare not under any kind of threat or penalty for reporting falsified \ninformation to them. That is where the manipulation took place, so the \nDomenici title does not cover that situation.\n\n  There is a lot of talk in the bill about the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, and there is a section in the bill that tries to \nbeef up that language. That is a noble attempt. I much prefer the \nFeinstein amendment which has very specific language about closing a \nloophole.\n  I have a letter from the National American Securities Administrators \nAssociation. They basically say the Domenici language is flawed. These \nare Federal regulators who are supposed to regulate this policy. They \nsay the Domenici language is flawed because it will prohibit any \nFederal or State agency from obtaining information directly from a \nboard of trade or exchange or market involving commodities, and that \nState and Federal agencies will be impeded from investigating \nviolations of these wide range of commodities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the National American \nSecurities Administrators Association, about how the Domenici language \nis trying to correct some of the problems is actually causing a new \nproblem and is not going to protect people, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administration Association, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2003.\n     Hon Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy & Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Energy & Natural \n         Resources, Washington, DC.\n     Re: S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n\n       Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman: The \n     North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) \n     is writing to express its concern over proposed language in \n     the Domenici substitute to Title XI, (the electricity title) \n     of S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n       Proposed Sections 1171 and 1173 would require that ``any \n     request by any Federal, State or foreign government, \n     department, agency or political subdivision'' to a ``board to \n     trade, exchange, or market'' involving transactions in \n     commodities ``within the exclusive jurisdiction'' of the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ``shall be \n     directed'' to the CFTC.\n       This prohibition on federal and state information gathering \n     directly from a board of trade, exchange or market would \n     place unnecessary burdens on state securities regulators when \n     they investigate violations of laws regulating foreign \n     exchange products, energy products and financial instruments. \n     Over the years, state securities regulators have handled many \n     of the foreign exchange cases under authority contained in \n     the Model Code and state securities laws.\n       This language would prohibit state securities regulators \n     from directly seeking information from a CFTC regulated \n     entity. State securities regulators do not have regulatory \n     jurisdiction over a CFTC regulated entity, but we must retain \n     our authority to subpoena documents from all relevant sources \n     as part of our enforcement cases. For example, a registered \n     representative of a securities firm could illegally take \n     investor funds and trade in commodities, and our members \n     might have to subpoena a futures exchange for trading records \n     or other information.\n       The CFTC and the states have a history of coordinating \n     efforts and working successfully toward our mutual goal of \n     protecting investors by recognizing potentially fraudulent \n     activity and bringing it to the attention of the public. \n     However, mandating that regulators go through the CFTC for \n     information could be burdensome, time-consuming and inhibit \n     our ability to investigate wrongdoing in a timely and \n     efficient manner. It may also place the CFTC in a difficult \n     position of deciding whether to send a state's subpoena to \n     one of the exchanges it regulates.\n       With the fallout from Enron and a variety of financial \n     scandals still in the news, now is the time to strengthen, \n     not weaken, our complementary system of state and federal \n     securities regulation. There seems to be no justification for \n     limiting the ability of state securities regulators to gather \n     information directly from a futures exchange.\n       We urge you to strike Sections 1171 and 1173 from the \n     Domenici substitute. Please do not hesitate to contact me if \n     I may be of further assistance to you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Christine A. Bruenn,\n\n                                                  NASAA President,\n                                   Maine Securities Administrator.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the bottom line is, in this amendment, \nwhile round-trip trading is covered and some, I am sure, well-\nintentioned language on reporting and falsifying information to FERC, \nit does not cover a myriad of other manipulative schemes\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\nthat have been deployed and used by Enron.\n  Fat Boy is not outlined under the Domenici language. Ricochet is not \noutlined under the Domenici language. Death Star is not outlined under \nthe Domenici language. Load Shift, Get Shorty, and Wheel Out are not \noutlined under the Domenici language.\n  I understand the chairman wants to see that the manipulation stops. \nIn this Senator's opinion, that manipulation will stop when this body \nstands up and says to the American people with simple language in the \nPower Act: Manipulated prices are not just, they are not reasonable, \nand anyone who deploys them are not doing so in the public interest, \nand we cannot give them market-based rates.\n  If this body will say this, then any future debate about natural gas \nprices will not be about whether some company manipulated them, it will \nbe about the real issues of the supply and demand.\n  Let's give the consumers confidence that market manipulation is \nprohibited in Federal law and that this body does not condone Enron's \nactivities but is going to be aggressive in outlawing them.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the bill before us does away with the \nEnron loophole, there is no question about it. If I came from \nCalifornia or Washington, I would come to the floor of the Senate and \noffer an amendment that was very precise and specific and talked about \nthe problems of the people of the west coast. That is what the Senator \nis doing. But merely talking about them does not mean that the bill \nbefore us does not protect her people. The truth is, it does.\n  The Domenici amendment protects consumers in the States of \nWashington, California, and others who were victimized by the Enron \nscandal, and many others, and market regulations in California that \nwere doomed from the outset to cause the failures that occurred. To \nregulate at one level and deregulate at the other level is clearly to \ninvite exactly what happened, and then the spillover falls onto the \nadjoining States, including that of the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington for her genuine and abiding \nconcern for her people. I commend the Senator from California for her \nstudious and lengthy involvement in attempting to ascertain and \narticulate the problems. But neither of those qualities require serious \namendment to this bill. They require just what is happening: that the \nSenators representing those problems speak to the issues. And speak \nthey have--3 hours and 15 or 20 or 30 minutes on this subject--and, I \nassume, before we are finished on collateral issues even more.\n  I could take out my preparatory books, where I spent hours talking to \neveryone of every ilk in every type of industrial input and involvement \nas we put this bill together, and read the language showing that what \nhappened before will not happen again.\n\n  I could tell my colleagues what has happened is being broken up by \nthose in the criminal justice structure of our Government, and those \ninvolved with the civil part are filing their lawsuits. Neither of the \nStates involved are having the same problem because there are \nprotections being carried out, and there will be more when this bill is \nadopted, without adding any more burdens, additions, or specificity to \nthe bill.\n  It is with great regret that I suggest we keep--since it was worked \nout so delicately with so many different units, institutions, and \ngroups--that we preserve the delicacy of this bill. The Senator who \nproposed this knows that the cooperatives that are very worried have \nspoken to the fact that they do not need any more protection. They have \ntold her that. They have told her office that. And there are more \nassociations beyond them that say their fears are alleviated by this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor, and we will proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHarkin and Senator Rockefeller be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tobacco \nMarket Adjustment Act of 2003. This is truly a key moment in the \nhistory of tobacco as each of the Senators from the leading tobacco-\nproducing States stands united in support of changing the Government's \ninvolvement with tobacco.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of farm bureaus from Kentucky, \nNorth Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, \nas well as the support of the Burley Co-op, Burley Stabilization, and \nthe Council for Burley Tobacco.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have letters indicating their support \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 16, 2003.\n       Tobacco State Senators: For many tobacco dependent states \n     in the Southeastern United States, tobacco buyout \n     legislation, possibly coupled with FDA regulation of tobacco \n     products, is the most important potential federal legislative \n     initiative for 2003. The undersigned Presidents of State Farm \n     Bureaus believe this is the year to accomplish a tobacco \n     buyout. For that reason, we urge you to endorse the \n     legislative language developed by many meetings of Senate \n     staff and eventually pledge your willingness to cosponsor the \n     legislation as it is introduced.\n       We continue to believe there are some details yet to be \n     ironed out in the legislation and we look forward to working \n     through those as we continue the process, but we believe that \n     to move forward, it is imperative that all tobacco state \n     Senators support one bill and we believe the legislative \n     language developed by the Senate staff gives all of us the \n     best shot at accomplishing a buyout this year.\n       We appreciate all the work you have done up to this point \n     in ensuring that tobacco farm families have a vibrant future, \n     and we look forward to continuing to work through this \n     process in the weeks ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sam Moore,\n       President, Kentucky Farm Bureau.\n     Flavius Barker,\n       President, Tennessee Farm Bureau.\n     Bruce Hiatt,\n       President, Virginia Farm Bureau.\n     Carl Loop,\n       President, Florida Farm Bureau.\n     Larry Wooten,\n       President, North Carolina Farm Bureau.\n     David Winkles,\n       President, South Carolina Farm Bureau.\n     Wayne Dollar,\n       President, Georgia Farm Bureau.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               The Council for Burley Tobacco,\n\n                                     Lexington, KY, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The Council for Burley Tobacco, \n     Inc. believes that during the 2003 Legislative Session is the \n     best and maybe the only time to pass a Tobacco Buyout Bill. \n     We are concerned about the lateness of the legislative \n     session.\n       We appreciate very much your leadership in developing a \n     consensus buyout bill with the Senate Tobacco Group and we \n     fully support your effort to introduce and move forward in \n     the Senate the consensus bill.\n       Please let us know how we can help you with this process \n     and again we thank you for your leadership and support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Johnny Bullock,\n       President.\n     Dean M. Wallace,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 29, 2003.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator McConnell: We are writing to thank you for \n     your ongoing effort to help tobacco farmers and our \n     communities and to offer our support to secure Senate passage \n     of your newly-drafted tobacco buyout legislation.\n       Our organizations and the farmers we represent firmly \n     believe that the Congress has a unique opportunity to \n     establish a new visionary tobacco policy in this country--one \n     that will allow tobacco-producing communities to adjust to \n     the realities of the permanently altered marketplace while \n     simultaneously protecting public health. We are united in our \n     view that the Senate consensus bill is a major step toward \n     achieving that objective.\n       While we look forward to continued discussion on a few key \n     provisions in the Senate bill, we intend to work vigorously \n     to secure Senate passage of this legislation.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership and commitment to \n     tobacco farm communities. We stand ready to work with you \n     side-by-side to pass historic tobacco legislation in 2003.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry S. West,\n       President, Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association.\n     George Marks,\n       President, Burley Stabilization Corporation.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tobacco was in the United States before \nEuropeans arrived here. It is depicted in various places here in the \nCapitol. George Washington and other Founders of our country grew \ntobacco. It has been an integral part of our history.\n  It is also no secret that the use of tobacco is dangerous to the \nhealth of Americans. Increasingly that view is held by a large number \nof Americans. The unfortunate side effect of that from an economic \npoint of view in a State such as mine, which still has 44,000 tobacco \ngrowers, is that their income continues to plummet.\n  Back in 1998, I first suggested a buyout might be an appropriate \ndirection in which to go. Ironically, at that time, that was roundly \ncriticized by all the farm organizations in my own State and across the \nburley belt and flue-curing areas, the argument being that it would \nlead to the end of tobacco production.\n  It is interesting, as I go across my State, that I am treated now as \na visionary because it is now virtually the unanimous view of our \ngrowers and certainly the unanimous view of our farm organizations that \na buyout is the only appropriate measure to take at this particular \njuncture in our history.\n  The reason for that is the quota established under the tobacco \nprogram back in the 1930s, which has been adjusted year to year all of \nthese years, has declined dramatically--up to 40 percent in the last 3 \nor 4 years alone. Our growers realize they are sitting on a declining \nasset that lowers the value of their property and their farm values and \nit is time to act and to move in a different direction.\n  Simply putting together a buyout proposal everyone could agree to--\nthat is the various farm organizations as well as Senators from tobacco \nStates--has not been easy. In fact, we have been working on this for 6 \nmonths to get to the point of actually introducing a bill, which as we \nall know around here is just the beginning. When you introduce a bill, \nit is not easy. It has not been easy to get to this point, which many \npeople would argue is just the start. We have, however, almost total \nconsensus. We have 100 percent consensus among tobacco State Senators \nand almost total consensus among those involved in the production of \ntobacco. We feel that is a significant accomplishment although it \ncertainly doesn't guarantee the result we all would like to see, which \nis a law.\n  We understand this issue is likely to go forward in the Senate in \nconjunction with an FDA tobacco regulation bill which is being worked \non in the Labor Committee under the leadership of Senators Gregg, \nDeWine, and Kennedy. It is our hope at some point after the recess to \nlink those two measures together with what we hope will be a formidable \ncoalition here in the Senate across an ideological divide to move us in \nthe direction of achieving both of these goals.\n  Frankly, accepting an FDA bill is a bitter pill for this Senator to \nswallow, and I think some other Senators from the burley belt and flue-\ncured tobacco areas. But that simply is the reality which we confront \ntoday. These measures are likely to move in transition.\n  I also want to commend my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, \nwho I know is here on the floor. He has been\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\nan integral part of the development of this bill, as well as our new \ncolleague from North Carolina, Senator Dole, who is also here, both of \nwhom will be speaking momentarily. They have been completely involved \nin the formulation of this product from the very beginning. As I said, \nit has not been easy to get to this point. We all understand it is \ngoing to be difficult to move the ball even further down the playing \nfield. But today we begin with unity. We begin with an aggressive \neffort to achieve this buyout for our farmers.\n  America's history is closely linked to tobacco. It provided the early \nsettlers with a key crop fro trade and barter, and it provided \ngentleman farmers throughout the colonies with livelihoods that sparked \nthe first inklings of the dream of an independent country. Throughout \nthis beautiful Capitol there are depictions of tobacco leaves \nsignifying this crop's importance to the founding of this country. \nGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison all raised \ntobacco. Almost no crop in the history of agriculture has provided so \nmany with a living off of so little land.\n  In agriculture, it is popular to speak about the importance of \nsupporting the small farmer. In reality, the number of small farms has \ndeclined as competitive forces have forced most farms to consolidate \nand diversify to compete. Many farmers now must work second jobs in \naddition to farming just to get by. However, over centuries, small \nfarmers with limited land have been able to carve out a living farming \ntobacco. The average acreage per tobacco farm is 6.7 acres--for my \nfriends from the South and the Great Plains, you know that these are \nsome small farms.\n  In my home of Kentucky, tobacco production is intimately connected to \nthe history and the culture of the State. In fact, the basis of \nagriculture in the State of Kentucky has been inextricably tied to this \ncrop. Home mortgages have been based on crops, loans for small \nbusinesses, and even children's educations have been funded through the \nperformance of an individual's tobacco crop. It has been said that ``A \ngood crop is a good Christmas.''\n  At harvest time, families gather: sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, \ncousins and children all set about the hard work of bring in a tobacco \ncrop. In the late fall, when the markets open for crop, entire \ncommunities hold celebrations and ceremonies. The marketing process \nalong with the auctions have a particular significance as the \nlivelihood of an entire family is dependent on a good crop.\n  Throughout Kentucky, tobacco has helped small communities construct \nschools and convention centers, it has supported local governments, and \nmost importantly, it has supported the small family farmer. In \nKentucky, tobacco is considered the 13 month crop, since there is \nvirtually no time during the year that difficult and labor intensive \nwork is not required. Despite the difficult labor required, it has \nprovided generation after generation with the opportunity to make a \nliving.\n  However, the very qualities that have allowed tobacco production to \ncontinue through the years have also led to the dependence of a \nculture, and a region, on this crop. There is no simple solution to the \nproblems facing tobacco farmers, but there are clear steps that we can \nand should take to help these individuals transition into a new era.\n  Most of the key tenets of the tobacco program were established by the \nAgriculture Adjustment Act of 1938. The program implemented a system of \nsupply restrictions and price guarantees aimed at stabilizing tobacco \nprices and income. Under this program, farmers agreed to restrict \nsupply via acreage/marketing allotments--or quotas--in exchange for \nminimum price guarantees. The levels of production were set each year \nto best ensure that the prices received for tobacco would meet or \nexceed the guaranteed price.\n\n  These marketing quotas were originally divided among active growers, \nbut this production right was then handed down to heirs or sold to \nothers as an asset. As a result, much of the quota is now controlled by \nnon-producers who rely on proceeds from renting or leasing this \nproduction right to growers. It is regarded as an inheritance and has \nbeen relied upon to support many seniors' retirements.\n  In 1982, the first major modifications to the tobacco program were \nmade, requiring the program to operate at no-net-cost to taxpayers. \nSince then, Federal funds have been prohibited from being used for \nexport promotion of American tobacco or research relating to tobacco \nproduction, marketing, or processing. As a result of many international \nand economic factors, the price supports have been reduced several \ntimes since the 1980's as well.\n  Under the current program, levels of production are cut in an effort \nto ensure a stable price. With lower consumption and increased foreign \ncompetition, the levels of quota have been cut significantly and \nfarmers are paying much higher quota rents to continue producing.\n  In 1998, I proposed a buyout of the tobacco program, but this measure \nfailed due to a lack of support from grower groups and a lack of \nconsensus among elected representatives from tobacco producing States. \nSince my effort in 1998, the programmatic decline of production has \nimposed severe economic hardships on tobacco producing communities. \nDuring a time when most agriculture production in this country has had \nto consolidate into larger operations to remain competitive due to \neconomies of scale and foreign competition, tobacco farmers, faced with \nthe same challenges, have actually been forced through this program to \nsimply cut production. While manufacturing needs have only declined \nslightly, production quotas have been reduced by more than 60 percent. \nSuch production cuts have forced domestic producers to vacate ever \nlarger amounts of market share to foreign producers. As a result, \ndomestic production levels have not been this low since 1908.\n  Despite financial help in the form of tobacco loss assistance \npayments, the crisis imposed by the program is plunging rural farm \nfamilies in Kentucky and throughout the tobacco belt into poverty, \nbankruptcy, or simply eliminating the ability of entire communities to \nremain engaged in agriculture.\n  In less than a decade the number of tobacco farms in the United \nStates has declined from 123,000 individual farms to right around \n90,000, with 44,000 of those in Kentucky. At the same time the annual \nvalue of domestic tobacco farm production has fallen from an average of \n$2.8 billion per year during the 1990's to $1.7 billion in 2002. In \nKentucky, tobacco represented 24 percent of total cash receipts for \nagriculture products during the 1990s. By 2001, cash receipts for \ntobacco dropped to 16 percent, and further quota cuts have continued to \nreduce the amount of tobacco that can be sold by producers.\n\n  Imports have also had a significant impact as the quality of foreign \nleaf has improved, domestic production has been restricted, and the \nprice of U.S. tobacco has been kept artificially high by quota rent \ncosts. These factors have led to dramatic increases in the amount of \nimported tobacco, with imports increasing by 25 percent between 2001 \nand 2002 alone.\n  Simple put, 165,000 of my constituents and 44,000 rural family farms \nin Kentucky are facing financial ruin due to the continuation of a \nprogram that we in the Congress have the power to change. In 1998, \ngrowers were divided on the issue and no consensus could be reached. \nToday, the introduction of this bill signifies the unified support of \ntobacco state Senators and growers to achieve the reforms.\n  The Tobacco Market Transition Act represents months of hard work and \nnegotiation. Such an undertakiing has required input, debate and \ncompromise over every element of the legislation ranging from the \nfunding mechanism to the health consequence of the changes that we are \nproposing. It provides tobacco growers with a fair level of support for \ntransition and tobacco quota owners with a fair level of compensation \nfor their asset. We also worked to ensure that these payments are fully \ndecoupled from current production, to avoid any possibility of trade \nimplications.\n  The changes we propose represent a radical shift in the way that \ntobacco production will occur in this country. The current tobacco \nprogram has outlived its usefulness, and now represents a hurdle and a \nthreat to the economic health of communities in tobacco producing \nstates. Therefore, it is important to end the quota system and do\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\naway with the strict production control price support system to usher \nin the necessary reforms.\n  This legislation will provide $8/lb on 2002 basic quota for quota \nowners and $4/lb on effective quota for 2002 for growers over 6 years. \nThe funds required will be obtained from manufacturers and importers of \nall tobacco products sold in the United States and shall total no \ngreater than $13 billion. Many quota owners and growers would like to \nbe compensated at higher levels, while many companies claim that the \nlevels are too high. This bill represents our extensive efforts to take \nboth the needs of the growers and the concerns of the companies into \nconsideration.\n  No longer will quota owners have control over the right to grow \ntobacco, a right that has been handed down from generation to \ngeneration regardless of their actual involvement with production. In \ndoing so, this bill eliminates the increasing expense of quota rent, \nwhich has artificially increased leaf prices without any benefit to \nactual growers or manufacturers. This requires that these assets, \nassets that were created and given value to through government \npolicies, be compensated. The impacts on the growers will be immediate \nand the reduced costs of tobacco produced in the U.S. will reduce leaf \nprices for manufacturers who utilize domestic tobacco.\n  However, in our consideration of the problems facing the farmers and \nthe manufacturers of tobacco products, it was essential to consider the \nadamant opposition of health groups to the unrestrained growth of \ntobacco throughout the United States. For years, tobacco production has \nbeen limited in both the area it could be grown and the amount that \ncould be produced. Our proposal addresses these concerns by limiting \ntobacco production to traditional tobacco producing regions and \nproviding a mechanism for producers to limit the amount of acreage \ngrown for each kind tobacco to historically established levels.\n  The key difference between the programs of yesteryear and the reforms \nwe are proposing today is the removal of the price guarantee for every \npound of tobacco grown. Under this new system, production will reflect \nthe market realities of the tobacco industry. This system provides key \nelements for tobacco dependent communities to transition out of tobacco \nproduction, while affording those who accept the risk, the opportunity \nto continue and compete in a shrinking and every more competitive \nmarket. Should these individuals choose to continue, we have created in \nthis bill the opportunity for growers to insure themselves--at no \nexpense to the U.S. taxpayer--against disastrous market conditions that \nmight emerge.\n  In addition to the buyout of quota, transition payments to growers, \nand the new regulations governing tobacco production, this bill \nprovides significant support to assist small tobacco dependent \ncommunities as they attempt to adjust to diminishing tobacco \nproduction.\n  This legislation will not solve all the problems that face small \ntobacco farms, but it does set in motion a system of reform and \ntransition that will allow these individuals and these communities a \nchance to continue or move into new industries. Such continuation or \ntransition will not be possible without this legislation. These \ncommunities are suffering due to problems with a government program \nthat we have the power to change. As elected representatives, we have a \nresponsibility to fix these problems, improve the lives of thousands of \nsmall farmers and greatly impact the future of an entire region.\n  I salute my colleagues from tobacco producing states for their hard \nwork and willingness to compromise to reach this consensus legislation. \nIt has been a long and difficult process, but this is only the first \nstep in addressing this issue. For this exercise to have any meaning \nwhatsoever, we need to enact this legislation and make these reforms as \nsoon as possible.\n  The worst thing that can happen is nothing. So, I ask my colleagues \nfrom all 50 States for their support of the Tobacco Market Transition \nAct of 2003.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1490, the \nTobacco Market Adjustment Act. Since Daniel Boone first came through \nthe Cumberland Gap in 1775, farming has provided the economic and \ncultural backbone of Kentucky.\n\n  The family farm is the foundation for who we are as a commonwealth. \nAnd for over a century, the family farm in Kentucky has centered around \none crop--tobacco.\n  Tobacco barns and small plots of tobacco dot the Kentucky landscape. \nWe are proud of our heritage and proud of the role that tobacco plays \nin our history. Recently, we have recognized that we cannot rely upon \ntobacco forever. We have seen the handwriting on the wall. In fact, in \n1998 the Senate had a long debate about the future of tobacco. Nothing \npassed then. But ever since we have known that sooner or later the \nsubject was going to return to the Senate floor.\n  Back in Kentucky, we have over the past few decades begun to \ndiversify and to prepare for the future.\n  We have tried to broaden our agricultural base. And we have had some \nsuccess with vegetables, beef cattle, raising catfish and expanding \ninto other areas like ethanol production.\n  But, at the end of the day, nothing brings as much of a return to the \nsmall farmer and tobacco quota holder in Kentucky as tobacco.\n  Whatever the opponents of tobacco say, there is no denying that the \nfuture for thousands of family farms and small communities across the \nsouth is tied directly to tobacco.\n  This is a complicated issue. Many tobacco quota holders are not even \nfull-time farmers and hold off-farm jobs.\n  And even full-time farmers usually do not raise only tobacco but grow \nit as only part of their total crop. But it is a crucial part, and for \nmany families it is absolutely irreplaceable, because the money they \nget from tobacco pays their mortgage, puts their kids through school or \nallows them to keep farming.\n  Outside of the western part of our State, Kentucky does not have tens \nof thousands of acres of flat land. We need a crop that grows on \nrolling hills, that thrives in our climate and can be profitably raised \non small plots that cannot accommodate other crops. Tobacco does that, \nand economically it is the only crop that can.\n  Farmers get a yield of over $4,000 per acre of tobacco. They get less \nthan $300 per acre for corn, soybeans and hay. That is how big the \ndifference is. This is what has made tobacco the economic linchpin for \nrural Kentucky. It is profitable and farmers rely on it. That might not \nbe popular today but it's an economic reality we have to face.\n  This Senate cannot--and if those of us from tobacco States have any \nsay about it, it will not--work on tobacco legislation without taking \ncare of tobacco farm families. Time have been getting tougher and \ntougher for small farms and rural communities in Kentucky. Plus, as I \nam sure most of my colleagues know, there is no tobacco subsidy.\n  We do have a price support system and production control program. But \neven the quotas have lost 60 percent of their value since 1998. No \nbusiness would be around if it lost 60 percent of its income in 5 \nyears, and we have lost a lot of growers.\n  Many farmers are barely holding on. They need help.\n  We believe that the time has come to assist them and to get the \nGovernment out of the tobacco business at the same time.\n  Our bill, which has the full support of the grower community, will \nbuy out the tobacco program. We will give our growers relief and end \nthe Federal price support program.\n  We will let many growers, whose average age is 62, retire with \ndignity.\n  Dr. Will Snell, the highly regarded agricultural economist at the \nUniversity of Kentucky, estimates 70 to 75 percent of tobacco growers \nwill get out of the business with a buyout.\n  In recent years tobacco has come under fire from all sides. And while \nthe antitobacco forces might not have intended it, their attacks are \nhurting tobacco farm families and rural America.\n  In Kentucky, we have counties that depend on tobacco for as much as \n85 percent of their revenue.\n  Without a tobacco base, land values will collapse and rural \ncommunities could fall into an economic death spiral.\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n  Falling land values mean lower property tax revenues and eventually \nsevere cuts in services such as police, fire, and emergency services, \nschools, sewers, and roads.\n  For decades farms and small communities have been built around the \ncultivation of a legal crop. To change that now without accounting for \nthe consequences would be devastating.\n  Our bill recognizes this reality and would offer some degree of \neconomic certainty for tobacco farm families that toil at the mercy of \nforces more powerful than themselves.\n  Mr. President, I am a realist. I know that passing any sort of \ntobacco legislation in Congress is a difficult, uphill fight. And I do \nnot know if we are going to be successful with this bill. But I do know \nthat if any tobacco legislation passes, it must include help for \ntobacco farm families. It is the least we can do for them.\n  I urge my colleagues in this Senate to understand this problem we are \nhaving in these six tobacco States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, tobacco farmers across the Southeast have \nbeen anxiously waiting for this day--the day when they can see hope for \nthe future. During the past 6 months, Senator McConnell, Senator \nBunning, and I have been working with all of the other Senators from \nmajor tobacco States to craft legislation that will enable tobacco-\ndependent communities to survive.\n  The Tobacco Market Transition Act, which we are introducing today, \nwill mark a major change from the current tobacco program, and it will \nbring a major sigh of relief to countless farm families across the \nSoutheast.\n  For years, the Federal tobacco program created economic opportunity \nfor farm families in North Carolina and other tobacco-producing States. \nIt allowed towns to prosper that would have been hard pressed to make \nit otherwise. It provided stability when other commodities suffered low \nprices. It was the standard bearer of all farm programs. Buyers of \ntobacco would come from all over the world to purchase America's leaf. \nAmerica's tobacco farmers held the world standard for quality, and they \nstill do today. But the environment in which they find themselves is \nmuch different. And it is not of their own making.\n  The current tobacco program was never designed to accommodate the \nsignificant changes that have engulfed this industry during the past \ndecade. Extensive litigation has forced the companies to cut costs and \nthereby purchase increasing amounts of cheap foreign tobacco. The \nincreasing cost of U.S. leaf as a result of the current tobacco program \nhas caused more and more foreign buyers to look elsewhere for their \nsupply. The numbers do not lie: The United States now accounts for only \n7 percent of all flue-cured tobacco production in the world.\n  We must not forget that behind every economic statistic is a human \nelement. The tobacco farmer bears the brunt of these changing forces \nwith nowhere to turn. Unlike the companies that can, and most often do, \npass their extra costs on to the consumer, the tobacco farmer must \nabsorb any extra cost and hope for better days ahead.\n  During the past 6 years, the amount of tobacco allowed to be grown--\nalso known as quota--has been cut more than 50 percent. In fact, not \nsince 1874 has so little been grown.\n  Let me explain what that really means. The tobacco farmer's paycheck \nhas been cut in half. They only get that if they can produce a good \ncrop. The weather, disease, and insect infestation make it all the more \nchallenging. Costs continue to rise. And making this even more \nunbearable is the increasing cost of leasing quota.\n  In North Carolina, more than 60 percent of quota is leased--a major \nfactor in the increasing cost of production. As quota has continued to \ndecline, farmers have sought to rent more quota in order to maintain \nthe economic viability of their operations. The quota owners, trying to \nmaintain their income stream with less, demand a higher price for the \nuse of their quota. It is simple supply and demand, with an aim at \nmeeting a bottom line. But you can only go on like this for so long--\nuntil you reach the breaking point.\n  This is where the growers are today. Many have hung on and have \ncontinued to produce in hopes that things will get better, knowing that \nif they got out they would have to sell their farm and liquidate other \nassets to settle up their debt. Even then, many would still be short.\n\n  Every week my office receives calls from farmers in desperation. They \nhave worked hard all their lives, sent their children to college, \ncontributed to their community, but now--now--all of that is passing \nbefore their eyes. There is a deep feeling of helplessness.\n  It is estimated that more than 60 percent of the tobacco farmers \ntoday will exit the business entirely if a tobacco buyout is achieved. \nMost are at retirement age, just hanging on a little while longer in \nthe hopes of being able to pay off their debt. Those who would like to \ncontinue to produce know their market is shrinking, not because of a \nlack of demand in the world for tobacco but because the price of U.S. \ntobacco is too high as a result of the current tobacco program. All \nthey can do is watch as Brazil and other countries take their market \nshare.\n  Many say: Well, why don't they just produce another crop? The truth \nis, they are. North Carolina ranks third in agricultural \ndiversification, behind only California and Florida. Our farmers are \nvery diversified but, as other Members from farm States will attest, \nprices have been at historical lows for every commodity over the past 5 \nto 6 years--further exacerbating the problem for tobacco farmers in the \nSoutheast.\n  Tobacco farmers are at a crossroads but, unlike most people who reach \na point of decision in their lives, these salt-of-the-Earth folks have \nno options because the current tobacco program does not accommodate the \nchanges needed for them to have an opportunity to survive in this new \nmarketplace. To them it is like standing on the tracks while watching a \ntrain speed closer and closer and yet they can't move. They strain and \ntry but they are shackled with nowhere to go.\n  This is why a tobacco buyout is so sorely needed. It will allow those \nwho want to retire the opportunity to do so with dignity, the \nopportunity to know that all they have worked for has not been in vain. \nIt will allow the widow whose sole source of retirement income is from \nquota rent and Social Security the opportunity to get a fair return in \nexchange for the taking of her quota. It will allow young farmers who \nwant to continue to produce the opportunity to compete in the world \nmarket--and compete very well because of their skills.\n  Let me bring a little more perspective to the buyout of quota. This \nprogram was created in the 1930s. Right or wrong, the Federal \nGovernment has allowed quota to be bought and sold. Rather than \ninvesting in stocks and mutual funds, as many Americans have, tobacco \nfarmers and their spouses have invested in quota over the years to \nprepare for their retirement. But they never predicted this massive \nchange in the environment for tobacco that has led to such a steep \nslash in quotas. And how could they? Unlike a stockholder whose shares \nlose value if the market tanks, the quota holder has lost not only the \nvalue from this steep decline in quotas but the quota itself--for good. \nUnlike the stock market where time is a prudent investor's best friend, \nthose who have invested in quota will never get that investment back.\n  In the legislation we are introducing today, the Federal tobacco \nprogram is eliminated. Quota owners are compensated for their \ninvestments--for the taking of their asset--just as the owners of the \npeanut quota were compensated with the peanut quota buyout in the 2002 \nfarm bill.\n  Traditional producers are provided direct payments over a 6-year \nperiod in order to allow them to better transition into this new \nmarketing environment--again, mirroring what Congress provided for all \nprogram crops under the 2002 farm bill.\n  There is no recreation of price supports or a new quota program. \nRather, this legislation keeps tobacco production in traditional areas \nand on a traditional level of acreage while allowing private industry \nto develop insurance products so farmers will be better able to manage \ntheir price risk in the free market.\n  Perhaps the most important point for my colleagues in the Senate: \nEvery penny that this buyout will require is\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\npaid for in full by all manufacturers and importers that sell tobacco \nproducts in this country.\n  Status quo is simply not an option. If nothing happens this year, \nmany of these farmers will be forced to give up all they have. After 6 \nyears of loaning on collateral, there is nothing left for the banks to \ndo except foreclose. There will be no holding out for just a little \nwhile longer. This may sound like rhetoric to some but it is the \nprecise truth for countless numbers of farm families. The lenders who \ncall my office confirm it. Status quo is simply not an option.\n  I thank Senator McConnell and his staff for working so diligently to \naddress this issue. It is vitally important that this legislation is \nachieved this year.\n  I am grateful, indeed, for Senator McConnell's commitment and Senator \nBunning's commitment to making this a reality. I look forward to my \ncontinued work with them and all the other tobacco State Senators on \nthis important legislation. It is either now or never. Many livelihoods \nhang in the balance, and with it the future of rural communities in \nNorth Carolina and other tobacco-producing States. These rural \ncitizens, the very ones who have helped make this country great, have \nbeen caught in a battle between corporate interests, some greedy trial \nlawyers, and those whose true desire is to ban tobacco from the face of \nthe Earth. Let us allow these farm families who have been trapped in \nthis battle to move on with their lives. They deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nand the Senator from Kentucky for their important contributions to the \ndevelopment of this legislation. I also want to make clear to our \ncolleagues this is a bipartisan bill. Senator Edwards of North \nCarolina, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, Senator Miller of \nGeorgia, and Senator Bayh of Indiana are also cosponsors. In fact, \nthere are 13 cosponsors of this important legislation. This is critical \nto our section of the country. We are going to work as intensely as we \ncan to achieve the result for which our farm families are hoping.\n  With that, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky has 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will reserve that time. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? Who yields to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield such time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania as he desires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10193-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10193-S10195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPEECH BY PETER R. ROSENBLATT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nKentucky.\n  I have sought recognition to comment about a very profound speech \nwhich was made by former Ambassador Peter R. Rosenblatt to the American \nJewish Committee in Detroit, a speech which has a unique historical \nperspective, makes an analysis of the new-fashioned war, the \nasymmetrical war of terror, comments about the trio of terrorists, \nthose who harbor terrorists, and the possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and has a perceptive analysis of the complex role of the \nUnited States on working through the complex relationships with so many \ncountries and the United Nations as we assert our role as the world's \nsole superpower.\n  This is a speech worth reading very broadly. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Then, Now and Tomorrow: America's Role in a Changing World\n\n       Throughout recorded history the relationship amongst states \n     has been determined primarily by the largest and most \n     powerful among them and by their efforts to protect their \n     interests within a stable state system. That may seem a \n     statement of the obvious but it has become an issue now, as \n     never before. In order to understand how, why and to what \n     extent such a basic condition of human history may now be in \n     question we must reach back to the political roots of the \n     modern world.\n       It all goes back almost two centuries ago to the Congress \n     of Vienna in the immediate aftermath of the French Revolution \n     and the Napoleonic Wars. The victors of those wars, Britain, \n     Prussia, Austria and Russia, joined with the restored \n     royalist regime of defeated France to establish a new \n     European order which, to all intents and purposes, meant a \n     new world order. It endured, with modifications, for nearly a \n     century.\n       Towards the middle of the century a number of major events \n     threatened to unravel the stable Great Power relationships \n     that had prevented major wars. The popular revolutions of \n     1848 undermined or overthrew traditional regimes, Italy was \n     reunified in 1856 and, most importantly, the reunification of \n     Germany was completed in 1871.\n       In 1862 King William I of Prussia had appointed Otto von \n     Bismarck as his Chancellor. In three brief military campaigns \n     in seven years against Denmark, Austria and France, \n     respectively, Bismarck expelled the three states with \n     opposing interests in Germany and in 1871 the new German \n     Empire was proclaimed by King William, now Emperor William I.\n       The German Empire emerged from this series of events as the \n     leading military power of Europe and Bismarck set to work to \n     secure the new state against the pressures that he knew would \n     inevitably build up against the leading power. Chief among \n     the sources of this pressure was defeated France, now in her \n     Second Republic and deeply embittered by her humiliation on \n     the battlefield and the loss of two border provinces. \n     Bismarck realized that French hostility to Germany had become \n     a fixture of European diplomacy and that France would ally \n     itself with any of the other three Great Powers which might, \n     at one time or another, wish to align itself Germany. \n     Bismarck saw Germany as what he called a ``satisfied'' power \n     which, after its unification, wanted nothing further from the \n     other powers and was therefore primarily interested in a \n     restoration of the stability that had prevailed since the \n     Congress of Vienna. Understanding that in a constellation of \n     five greats powers Germany must be, as he put it, on the side \n     of the three, he saw that it would be necessary for Germany \n     to ally itself with Austria-Hungary and Russia. Of the other \n     two Great Powers, France was in permanent opposition and \n     Britain, an active colonial rival of France, adhered to a \n     policy of ``magnificent isolation'' and therefore wished to \n     become no one's ally--and least of all France's.\n       When Bismarck's chancellorship ended in 1890, his brilliant \n     diplomacy had secured Germany as the linchpin of Europe, the \n     leading power in an alliance structure of three, on good \n     terms with England and absolutely unassailable militarily. He \n     had created a state system so stable that even the \n     unrelenting hostility of France threatened neither the \n     security of Germany nor the peace of Europe.\n       The old Emperor's grandson and successor, the arrogant and \n     foolish young William II, failed to understand Bismarck's \n     statecraft and in short order terminated the alliance with \n     Russia, throwing that country into the arms of France and \n     dividing the continent into two increasingly unstable \n     alliance blocs, which left Britain holding precarious \n     balance. William then alienated Britain by a vast naval \n     building program designed to match Britain's navy. Thus in a \n     few years time William II reversed Bismarck's diplomatic \n     accomplishments, ending a century-long period of stability \n     which had seemed to make a major war unthinkable. In its \n     place the statesmen of the time substituted uncertainty, \n     rivalry between two alliance blocs and fear, always the \n     enemies of peace. With the destruction of Bismarck's state \n     system the world lost a stability which we have not succeeded \n     in regaining in 113 years. The outcome was World War I, in \n     some ways the major tragedy of the 20th Century, which \n     destroyed the optimistic and predictable post-Napoleonic \n     world of our ancestors.\n       Out of that war there emerged an entirely new and different \n     state system of five powers, an exhausted and depleted \n     Britain and France, revolutionary Soviet Russia and the \n     newest entrants into the field, Japan and the United States. \n     After fifteen years of turmoil and economic depression the \n     five were joined by a resurgent Germany under Nazi rule. \n     Unlike the stable state system of the 19th Century the inter-\n     war state system was highly volatile and ultimately collapsed \n     due to the weakness and passivity of England and France, the \n     isolation of the United States and the aggressive \n     expansionism of the other three.\n       World War II produced an entirely new state system of two \n     great powers with a global reach engaged in a titanic \n     struggle for dominance and survival. The cold war was a zero \n     sum game in which the advantage of one became a loss to the \n     other. The defeat of the Soviet Union in this massive half \n     century long struggle produced a result unprecedented in \n     world history; a single global power militarily, politically \n     and economically vastly more powerful than all of its actual \n     or potential rivals.\n       It would be a mistake, however, to think that because this \n     is so there is no longer anything resembling a ``state \n     system'' in the world today. There are now five other powers \n     each one of which could, under appropriate circumstance, \n     present a challenge to the United States over time and with \n     which we\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\n     must learn to live on a basis of mutual accommodation. These \n     are Russia, Japan, China, India and Europe, when Europe \n     becomes significantly unified to act with one voice. Each of \n     these is currently unable to present a significant challenge \n     to the United States because of severe internal problems \n     which inhibit the full realization of its potential power.\n       Russia has not recovered from the wars, misrule, economic \n     mismanagement and intellectual distortions of the 20th \n     century.\n       Japan, having prospered under the U.S. defense umbrella \n     through the mobilization of its ancient social and cultural \n     system, now suffers the downside of the very same system.\n       China will eventually become a great military power through \n     the diversion of resources which are needed to bring its \n     entire population into the modern world and to overcome vast \n     internal demographic, social, economic and even hydrological \n     problems, any one of which would alone take a generation to \n     cope with.\n       Much the same could be said of India whose agenda, in \n     addition, is still dominated by the unresolved consequences \n     of the subcontinent's messy partition in 1947.\n       Western Europe, though prosperous, is disunited and \n     disarmed. It is as unprepared to assume the responsibilities \n     of a great global power as England and France were in 1939.\n       The wonderful professors who taught me my freshman European \n     history course at Yale were fond of saying that ``history \n     does not repeat itself, only historians do.'' But certainly \n     this maxim does not preclude even the devoted student of \n     Professors Foord and Mendenhall from attempting the \n     occasional historical analogy. We have arrived at this new \n     phase of history very much more powerful in relation to the \n     other major powers than was Germany after 1871. But like \n     Germany then we are a ``satisfied'' power which wants nothing \n     from any other. Our diplomatic task, like Bismarck's, is \n     therefore to crate and preserve global stability. But our \n     efforts to do so will have to be focused on new and different \n     issues in addition to those which preoccupied Bismarck; and \n     they are just as subject to mismanagement, the consequences \n     of which could be even more catastrophic.\n       Now, why do I recite all of this history for you if the \n     facts of today's world are so very different? Well, it is \n     because the power politics of the 19th and 20th Centuries \n     persist even as we cope with an entirely new class of threats \n     arising from a totally different source. It's a bit like the \n     science fiction movies in which a world preoccupied with its \n     normal conflicts and rivalries is suddenly confronted with a \n     unifying threat from outer space. But unlike the movies, \n     there is little present evidence of a global appreciation of \n     the magnitude of the threat.\n       The old world has not been abolished. International \n     relations are still largely determined by the most powerful \n     states--disproportionately our own. Just as in Bismarck's \n     day, armies, economic power and cultural influence still \n     determine the pecking order among states. Nor is there the \n     slightest reason to expect that the major states will cease \n     competing with each other.\n       But since September 11, 2001 Americans and a few others \n     have become conscious of a new and terribly destabilizing \n     overlay on the traditional state system which we are just in \n     the earliest stages of understanding. I refer not just to \n     terrorism, but more broadly to the ever increasing capacity \n     of small, poor, weak states, terrorist groups, criminal \n     organizations or even individuals to gain access to the most \n     terrible weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and to use them \n     against the most powerful states or to hold them to ransom by \n     threatening their use. The fact that increasingly powerful \n     weapons are becoming ever easier and cheaper to buy or \n     produce places them within the reach of the familiar rogue's \n     gallery of terrorist sponsoring or harboring states and to \n     irresponsible non-state actors. It is not terrorists or \n     terrorist harboring states or WMDs alone that are so terribly \n     menacing and destabilizing in today's world, but the \n     conjunction of all three.\n       The use of these terrible WMDs has been largely avoided up \n     until now through the doctrine of deterrence--the threat of \n     retribution as terrible or more so than the initial assault. \n     That doctrine has depended for its viability on an assumption \n     that the nation to be deterred is managed by at least \n     minimally responsible leaders with enough judgment not to \n     attack when the cost of so doing would be unacceptable. But \n     how does one deter a WMD assault by a fanatic or psychotic \n     adherent of some doctrine who has no regard for his own or \n     any one else's life? And how does one deter a group if one \n     cannot find it or if it is only one of many capable of \n     mounting a devastating attack without leaving a fingerprint? \n     And even if one were able to identify and find such a group, \n     and if one were willing and able to buy it off, how much \n     security would that bring and for how long?\n       This new global configuration has come to be known as \n     asymmetrical warfare, in which the weak attack the strong \n     without hope of victory in the conventional sense. The \n     attackers have only the power to destroy. When Prussia \n     defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 Germany \n     replaced France as Europe's strongest power. When the U.S. \n     won the cold war it became the sole superpower. If Al Qaeda \n     or some successor were, God forbid, to deliver a WMD to New \n     York, Washington or Chicago in a shipping container or \n     suitcase and detonate it, it could kill many Americans and do \n     grievous damage to the U.S. economy, but it could neither \n     conquer the U.S. nor replace it. The purpose of terrorist \n     organizations which pursue this form of warfare is, rather, \n     the survival of enough of them to attack again and again. \n     Chaos, not direct conquest, is the objective. The theory of \n     asymmetrical warfare conducted through terrorism is to \n     disrupt the stronger power's enconmy, social cohesion and \n     morale though massive human and material casualties so as to \n     ease the path for the terrorists' political or other \n     objectives.\n       The administration has reasonably concluded that a \n     successful defense against asymmetrical warfare requires us \n     to seize and hold the initiative. We simply cannot wait until \n     the fatal conjunction between terrorists and WMDs occurs, \n     most likely in the relative security of a terrorist-harboring \n     rogue state, and we are confronted either with a WMD attack \n     or with blackmail threats of such an attack.\n       We are therefore required to embark on a non-traditional \n     policy of searching out, seizing or neutralizing through \n     diplomatic, covert or, if necessary, military means any rogue \n     states, terrorists, fanatics, criminals and psychotics who we \n     believe are actively attempting to acquire and use, or \n     threaten to use WMDs, or to harbor, support, supply or \n     passively tolerate those who would do so. The \n     administration has called this a policy of pre-emption and \n     has explained that the threat is too urgent and the costs \n     of failure too grave to allow us to respond solely through \n     the usual diplomatic requests for investigative \n     assistance, extraditions and trials by jury. In other \n     words, we are engaged in war--a type of war for which \n     there is only one historical precedent--but a war \n     nonetheless, and not a criminal prosecution.\n       The precedent is, of course, Israel, which has been made a \n     testing ground for the strategy of asymmetrical warfare. All \n     the ingredients are there, even if they have not worked as \n     the attackers have planned. Terrorists are the delivery \n     vehicles. The West Bank and Gaza were designed to be the \n     harboring states after the Palestinian Authority was placed \n     in charge of the so-called Area A under Oslo and after \n     Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon. And WMDs? Well, \n     fortunately none have yet been used, but not for lack of \n     will. The Israeli authorities stopped an attempt to destroy \n     Tel-Aviv's largest office building, the Azrieli Tower, and a \n     fuel storage area north of Tel-Aviv. If either of these \n     efforts had succeeded the casualties might well have matched \n     those of 9/11.\n       The asymmetrical war of terror hasn't worked against \n     Israel. The impact has been opposite that which the attackers \n     expected. Israeli morale remains high, divisive internal \n     disputes have been largely laid aside, and Israel has struck \n     back with tremendous force and effect. Later, if not sooner, \n     the impact intended for Israel may, in fact, be visited upon \n     the attacker's own society.\n       Just as the war of terrorism being waged against Israel was \n     a harbinger of the war now being waged against us and the \n     rest of the civilized world, so Israel's reaction forecast \n     ours. Israel long since identified this assault as a war \n     rather than a criminal problem. Israel determined that it \n     could not afford to wait until terrorist attacks occurred to \n     take action against its sponsors. And it determined that \n     preemptive action, in order to be effective, required \n     military intervention in the harboring areas and elimination \n     of those who plan, lead and execute the assaults.\n       The administration has made quite clear, through its \n     actions more than its words, that it has gotten the message. \n     It now rarely criticizes Israel for pursuing policies locally \n     which it, itself, is pursuing globally.\n       Like Israel we are engaged in a twilight war in which we \n     can be certain of the full support of only a few nations. \n     Unlike Israel we do have some support from many others, but \n     only we, Britain, Australia, Poland and a few others are \n     willing to take the initiative in prosecuting the war with \n     full vigor, and only our government does so with substantial \n     popular support.\n       This circumstance requires that we maintain an \n     international diplomatic posture and military force directed \n     simultaneously at maintaining our political primacy and \n     military superiority vis-a-vis other major powers, while \n     waging active diplomatic and military warfare against \n     terrorists, those who harbor or tolerate them and the \n     proliferation of WMDs.\n       That is going to be expensive. We have seen that it took \n     most of our West European allies only a decade of inattention \n     and deeply slashed defense budgets to become nearly \n     irrelevant to the global strategic equation. Far from cutting \n     down on major weapons systems we are going to have to keep on \n     developing new generations of them while we reconfigure a \n     portion of our military to enable it to intervene anywhere in \n     the world on very short notice to carry on the new war and, \n     if necessary, to conduct what President Bush used to call \n     ``nation building.''\n       We will also have to figure out how we are going to pay for \n     all of this without killing the goose that has been laying \n     all those golden eggs--by saddling ourselves with \n     unacceptably high taxes or huge, escalating deficits.\n       It will also take active and imaginative diplomacy for us \n     to avoid the fate of William II by alienating the rest of the \n     world. We can afford to ignore or exclude a France which \n     seeks actively to undermine our national interests. But only \n     if we can ensure that it is\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\n     France and not we that becomes isolated in consequence. We \n     cannot win this war without the active support of most, at \n     least, of the world's major powers who see themselves to some \n     extent as our rivals. And we will require at least the \n     acquiescence of much of the rest of the world, including the \n     Islamic world, whose governments are the terrorists' primary \n     targets but many of whose ordinary people feel at least some \n     sympathy for the terrorists' proclaimed objectives.\n       Well, that brings us back to our starting point this \n     evening; our relationship with the world's other major \n     powers. Anti-proliferation efforts and the war against \n     terrorism cannot be conducted successfully by the U.S. alone. \n     Therefore, it is necessary for us simultaneously to conduct \n     our relationships and to contain our rivalries with these \n     powers--perhaps it would be more accurate to say their \n     rivalries with us--in the traditional manner on one level, \n     even as we seek to lead them in a priority joint campaign \n     against a global threat which some of them do not regard as \n     seriously as we, but which has or soon will target all of \n     them.\n       To some extent, this is happening even now. France, with \n     which we have serious and perhaps enduring differences of a \n     geopolitical nature, is cooperating with us in intelligence \n     sharing in relation to the war on terrorism. China, which \n     views us as a rival for influence in East Asia, is beginning \n     to cooperate with us in dealing with the nuclear threat posed \n     by its North Korean ally. And China and our old adversary, \n     Russia, identify their campaigns against separatism amongst \n     their Moslem minorities with our war on terrorism--a very \n     uncomfortable fit for us.\n       The United Nations Security Council, seen after 9/11 as the \n     logical instrument for organizing the world consensus against \n     terrorism, proved incapable in the face of discord over Iraq \n     among its permanent members. It was therefore bypassed, for \n     much the same reason that it was bypassed during most of the \n     cold war. Its structure no longer reflects the realities of \n     the current global state system--if it ever did--and it is \n     unlikely to realize its full potential until it, along \n     with the entire United Nations system, is restructured. \n     The UN today is a shambles, and not merely because Nauru \n     with 6,000 citizens has the same General Assembly vote as \n     China's 1.2 billion, nor because Libya is elected to chair \n     the UN Human Rights Commission, or Iraq the Disarmament \n     Commission or Syria becomes a non-permanent member of the \n     Security Council, or that the UN and its agencies spend \n     vast amounts of their time, effort and resources debating \n     and implementing annual resolutions directed exclusively \n     against Israel. No, the UN is a shambles because so much \n     of what it does is irrelevant to the world's major issues \n     that it lacks credibility even among those of its members \n     who are chiefly responsible for its distortions.\n       But before we dismiss the UN as entirely irrelevant let us \n     recall a few salient truths:\n       Metternich could conduct the Congress of Vienna, Bismarck \n     the Congress of Berlin and Wilson the Versailles peace \n     conference with four other principles and reshape the world. \n     We are relatively far more powerful than any of those \n     principals were, but we cannot be as effective as they were \n     then in our war against terrorism, even with the co-operation \n     of the 15 members of the Security Council.\n       The world has become so small and dangerous a place that we \n     cannot even consider trying to stabilize it without the \n     active participation of much of the rest of the world.\n       Therefore, if the UN did not already exist it would have to \n     be invented. Only we, with our enormous power and influence, \n     can make it work to focus the world's attention upon the \n     current version of the threat from outer space.\n       So here we are, the most powerful nation the world has ever \n     known; and what is our number one global problem? A \n     collection of small to medium third world countries none of \n     which has ever won a war against anyone, with economies a \n     tiny fraction of ours, most of whose people are still living \n     in the Middle Ages, and rag-tag gangs of fanatics and \n     criminals which, if they should ever acquire the world's most \n     powerful weapons, may be undeterrable and unappeasable and \n     may use these weapons rather than submit.\n       The real authority in our world may be distributed--albeit \n     unevenly--among six major powers. But neither we, as the \n     first among them, nor a majority of them as in Bismark's \n     alliance system nor all of them acting together, as in \n     Vienna, Berlin, Versailles or last year in Security Council \n     Resolution 1441, can absolutely ensure our safety. But we \n     have no alternative but to try to create sufficient harmony \n     among the world's principal powers to turn back the dark \n     forces that threaten civilization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10195-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY THOMAS P.

He has come to my office with \nextensive trial skills and has done extraordinary work on counseling in \nmy office, on post-9/11 legislation, on working on nominations, on \nlegislative packages involving the death penalty, and the war on \nterrorism.\n  He has worked hard on these issues--each time jumping in feet first, \nsoaking up knowledge, and moving legislation forward in this often \ncomplicated process. From his first assignment, he earned the respect \nof my staff, as well as mine.\n  Tom's primary duty consisted of working as my legal counsel for \nJudiciary matters where he handled a wide variety of issues. He also \nproved to be of invaluable assistance in crafting several pieces of \npost-September 11 legislation, all the while leading an investigation \non terrorism financing. His skills and judgment in this arena are \nexceptional. My staff and I were constantly impressed with the wealth \nof knowledge he demonstrated.\n  Tom also provided a tremendous service to the people of Pennsylvania \nin working on issues such as class action reform and the Patents Bill \nof Rights. He demonstrated a remarkable amount of enthusiasm and \ninitiative throughout his entire fellowship.\n  His dedication to each project was remarkable, and the assistance he \nprovided to my office will not be easily matched. However, for Tom this \nlevel of dedication is par for the course. Since his graduation from \nWest Point in 1983, he has consistently served our country. Prior to \nhis service with the U.S. Attorney's office, Tom served in the United \nStates Army and is currently a LTC in the Army Reserve.\n  Tom's personal record is equally distinguished. Those who know him \nwell consistently praise his qualities as a devoted husband and father \nof four beautiful children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today in commending Tom Swanton for \nhis service as a legal fellow and for his devotion and leadership to \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10195-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10195-S10196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TERRORIST PROSECUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this morning a group of Senators met with \nIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in a very informative session as \npart of Prime Minister Sharon's visit to the United States where \nyesterday he met with President Bush.\n  An item which has been worked on for many years has been the effort \nto try in the U.S. courts Palestinian terrorists who murder U.S. \ncitizens abroad. The Terrorist Prosecution Act, which I wrote back in \n1986, provides for exterritorial jurisdiction where U.S. courts have \njurisdiction to try a Palestinian terrorist who murders an American \ncitizen.\n  There are two prominent cases which could lend themselves to this \napproach. One case involves a Palestinian terrorist who is in the \nUnited States, where we have jurisdiction over him, where we need the \ncooperation of Israel in providing the witnesses. It was a matter which \nI discussed this morning with the Prime Minister, and we are working to \nsee if we can secure that kind of cooperation. It was pointed out that \nsort of cooperation has been present in the past, and we are seeking to \nbring that about here.\n  Another possible prosecution would involve a Palestinian terrorist \nwho confessed on television, so there is no issue about the \nvoluntariness of his confession. There is a potential problem in that \nIsrael opposes the death penalty and characteristically will extradite \nonly where there is assurance from the country receiving the individual \nthat the death penalty will not be sought. I believe there are \nexceptions under Israeli law where Israeli national security is \ninvolved. I believe the threat of the war on terrorism would qualify \nunder that section.\n  There is a second aspect, and that is the vindication of U.S. rights \nwhere American citizens are murdered by Palestinian terrorists in \nIsrael. I think there is a very real issue about vindicating U.S. \ninterests. We are going to continue to pursue that line.\n  One other observation in the brief amount of time remaining. The \nmeeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was a \nvery warm and a very good meeting. One of the items which I think bears \na little focus is the unusual rapport between these two men, where \nPresident Bush referred to Prime Minister Sharon by his\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\nfirst name ``Ariel,'' and Prime Minister Sharon reciprocated by \nreferring to President Bush as ``George.'' I think that signifies an \nunusually warm relationship.\n  It brings to mind comments by Prime Minister Begin who visited the \nUnited States back in June of 1982 and met with a group of Senators, \nand at that time made a comment that President Reagan had asked Prime \nMinister Begin to call President Reagan ``Ron.'' Prime Minister Begin \nsaid that he deferred, which led President Reagan to say to Prime \nMinister Begin: Well, Menachem, if you don't call me Ron, I won't call \nyou Menachem.\n  Prime Minister Begin went through that circle but refused to call the \nPresident by his first name, referring to the President as a Head of \nState.\n  I think it is a very encouraging sign when the President of the \nUnited States and the Prime Minister of Israel are on a first name \nbasis. That bodes very well for the relationship.\n  I note the time of 1 o'clock has arrived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time controlled by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor in any event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10196-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10196-S10203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXECUTIVE SESSION NOMINATION OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I believe the regular order is for the \nminority to be given a half hour on the proposal to proceed with the \nEstrada nomination; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New York has one-\nhalf hour under his control.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are back to voting on whether to \nproceed with the Estrada nomination. Before I get into the merits of \nMr. Estrada, I want the record to show that we have now confirmed 140 \nof the President's nominees. By the end of the week, it could be over \n150. By the end of the week, we may be blocking as many as 4. So right \nnow it is 140 to 4 and could be at the end of the week 150 to 4. That \nis a record that even Yankee fans would be jealous of.\n  We have this view of some, including the White House, that we are \nobstructionist because we have tried to block 4 out of 140 nominees. My \nguess is if James Madison or George Washington or Benjamin Franklin or \nany of the Founding Fathers were looking down on this Chamber, they \nwould say: Why are they blocking so few? We wanted the President and \nthe Senate to come together on judicial nominees.\n  It outlines in the Federalist Papers that the Founding Fathers didn't \nwant the President to have sole power to choose judges, nor did they \nwant the Senate to be a rubber stamp. In fact, one of the first \nnominees, John Rutledge from South Carolina, was rejected by the \nSenate, which contained a goodly number of the Founding Fathers \nthemselves because they were appointed to the Senate in those days \nright from the Constitutional Convention. Rutledge was rejected because \nof his views on the Jay Treaty.\n  So this idea that unless we find the candidate to have some kind of \ncriminal record or has done something unethical, we should not be \nexamining that record or speaking to that record makes a good deal of \nsense. President Bush is a classic case of what the Founding Fathers \nwere worried about in the way he has chosen his nominees because the \nFounding Fathers, I believe, wanted nominees to be from the American \nmainstream. They wanted them to interpret the law, not to make law.\n  There have been times when judges have leaned to the far left--the \n1960s and 1970s--and they now lean to the far right. The bench becomes \ninfused with ideologues and ideologies, and those judges want to make \nlaw, not interpret law--very much against what our Founding Fathers \nwanted. That has been the case of President Bush. I don't think it is \ndisputed that he has nominated judges through an ideological prism more \nthan any President in our history. You don't have a sprinkling of \nDemocrats or liberals or even moderates--you have a few moderates, but \nthe overwhelming majority of the President's judges have been hard \ncore, hard right. A few of them have been so far over that they don't \ndeserve nomination. They include Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen, and \nthey include, in my opinion, two nominees we may vote on later this \nweek: Carolyn Kuhl, and the attorney general of Alabama, Pryor.\n  If you look at the records of these judges and you put scales, left \nto right, 10 being the most liberal and 1 being the most conservative, \nthese judges are ones, to be charitable. When Bill Clinton nominated \njudges, he nominated mainly sixes and sevens, people who tended to be a \nlittle more liberal, but were moderate and mainstream--very few legal \naid lawyers or ACLU charter members, much more prosecutors and partners \nin law firms.\n\n  This President, for whatever reason, has chosen to nominate judges \nway over to the far right side.\n  I am proud of what we have done in this Chamber. I am proud that we \nare bringing some moderation to the bench. I am proud that we are \nfollowing the wishes of the Founding Fathers and not just being a \nrubber stamp. For those who try to beat us with a two-by-four, by \ncalling names, by saying we are anti-Black, anti-Hispanic, anti-\nCatholic, anti-women, when we oppose a judge who happens to be of that \ndescription, we are not going to win. We believe in what we are doing. \nWe believe it is mandated by the Constitution. We believe we are \nfollowing the will of the American people who don't want judges either \ntoo far left or too far right.\n  I assure you, Mr. President, and I assure President Bush, and I \nassure my colleagues in the Senate that we will continue to do this. \nYou can prolong this and put up all the visuals and nasty ads you want, \nlike the one just run by one of the President's associates in Maine, \naccusing those who will vote against Mr. Pryor of being anti-Catholic, \nincluding good Catholics in this Chamber. That is wrong. In fact, I \nthink it is reprehensible. But I tell the other side, not only will it \nnot work, if anything it strengthens our desire to do the right thing.\n  Let's talk about Miguel Estrada. This nominee was unusual in this \nsense: He had no real record because he had not been a judge \npreviously, nor written law articles. By many reports, his views were \nvery extreme. But when I approached the hearings for his nomination, \nand when many colleagues did, we were willing to see what he thought. \nThe bottom line is that he didn't tell us what he thought. The bottom \nline is that when he was asked very simple questions on issues that he \nhad an obligation to expound upon, such as: What is your view of the \nfirst amendment; how broad or narrow should it be; what is your view of \nthe commerce clause; what is your view of the relationship between the \nStates and the Federal Government; he kept hiding behind this idea that \ncanon 5 of lawyers ethics says you should not comment on a pending case \nif you are nominated to be a judge, so that he could not comment on \nanything. If Mr. Estrada were asked how should Enron be treated, he \nwould rightfully say: I cannot answer that because I might judge Enron \non the bench. But if he is asked what his views on corporate ethics \nare, of course, he has an obligation to answer that question. He did \nnot. And doing so was an affront, not to any one individual, but to our \nConstitution.\n  If Mr. Estrada were correct, then probably most of the judges we have \nnominated in the last two decades should be cited for violation of \ncanon 5. They all answered these questions. Judges nominated by \nPresident Bush before and after Estrada have answered these questions. \nSo why would Mr. Estrada not come clean and tell people what he \nthought? Why would he not do what every American has to do?\n  When every American applies for a job, the employer says: Please fill \nout this questionnaire. Can you imagine someone saying I refuse to fill \nout the questionnaire in getting the job? It would be rare to do that. \nThat is what he did. He is applying for a job--not just any job, but \none of the most important jobs this Government has--a Federal judge, \nwith awesome power. He kept refusing to fill in the job application \nform by answering the questions we had asked.\n\n  We then came to the question: How could we tell what his views were? \nWe\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\ndid not stop. We asked him, and we asked the Justice Department to give \nus some documents about issues on which he had worked when he was in \nthe Solicitor General's Office. There were some in that office who \nreported, again, that his views were way over, that they were extreme, \nand we were refused our request.\n  I will tell you this, Mr. President, and I will tell every Member of \nthis Chamber, as long as Mr. Estrada refuses to answer questions about \nissues over which he is going to have virtual life and death power in \nterms of governing the American people and we do not know how he feels, \nwe are going to continue to block him. We are proud of that fact.\n  At first when it started, most people said: Don't do it; politically \nthey will attack you--and this and that. I told my colleagues I thought \nwe ought to do it because it is the right action to take, regardless of \npolitics.\n  A funny thing has happened. Politics seems to be rolling in our \ndirection. People are beginning to understand that this President is \nnot nominating mainstream, moderate judges. People are beginning to \nunderstand that there is a desire to pack the courts and turn the clock \nback.\n  Congress will not turn the clock back. The President himself will not \nturn the clock back. We are elected. But if you put judges in, they can \nturn the clock back for a whole generation. There is a view out there \nthat this is happening.\n  What started out as something done out of a deep conviction remains a \ndeep conviction, and our view about the direction of this country, our \nview about the appropriate role of the Senate in the nomination process \nof judges is not ending up to be the political loser that some \nprognosticated.\n  We will continue to block this nomination. If nominees stubbornly and \narrogantly refuse to answer legitimate questions of members of the \ncommittee, we will not allow them to become judges. That is not our \ndoing in an ultimate sense; it is their own doing. If nominees are so \nfar out of the mainstream that it is quite clear they will make law, \nnot interpret the laws that others have made, we will oppose them as \nwell.\n  We will vote on the nomination of Mr. Estrada for the seventh time. I \nmake the point that my good friend from New Mexico was saying we have \nto move the Energy bill forward. Our majority leader is saying we have \nto move the Energy bill forward, but we are taking out time to vote on \nthis nomination again. The purpose I do not know, a purpose grander \nthan I can think of. But we are here and we are doing it.\n  No one has changed his or her minds. Mr. Estrada has not answered the \nquestions, and as long as he continues not to answer these important \nvital questions, he will not be approved.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some of the allocated time on \nthe nomination to make a comment. We have been debating the Energy bill \nfor the last couple of days and, of course, for good reason; the \ndistinguished majority leader has said he wants to move this \nlegislation forward and that we ought to do all we can to find a way to \nresolve the many issues that are still pending on energy prior to the \nend of the week.\n  I cannot think of a more counterproductive effort, a more \ncounterproductive device, than to bring back a nomination that has \nalready been before the Chamber six times. I certainly am not \nquestioning the majority's motives. I do not question their desire to \nfinish the Energy bill, but I do question the management of our time \nwhen I think with every bit of sincerity our Republican friends tell us \nthey want to finish this bill.\n  We are now in a quorum call in the middle of the day on a nomination \nthat has already been before the Senate six separate times this year. \nSix times we have debated whether Miguel Estrada ought to be required \nto do what every nominee is required to do, which is answer the \nquestions and fill out the job application. Six times, without \nequivocation, Senators said you do that and we will take another look \nat your nomination.\n  Here we are now for the seventh time, in the middle of an energy \ndebate that we are told by the majority must be done, debating once \nmore this very issue.\n  That is not all. Yesterday we debated Priscilla Owen, and I think \nthat was for the third time. Tomorrow we may debate another nominee, \nWilliam Pryor, for the first time. Who knows what could come on Friday.\n  The majority needs to show us they are truly intent on working with \nus through these many important issues before they can convince us that \nthey want to finish the job on energy.\n  It is 1:25 and for the life of me I cannot understand why we are in \nthe middle of a quorum call on a judicial nomination that has come \nbefore us on six other occasions. That is not good time management. It \nis not a good practice. It obviously has not generated much interest, \nand I think it is a huge waste of time.\n  I only come again to express my disappointment and my puzzlement, my \nlack of ability to answer the question why is this happening now, when \nwe have so much work to be done.\n  I will make another prediction. This vote will not change. If we do \nit 18 more times, it will not change. So we can continue to waste our \ntime or we can continue to find ways to work together to use our time a \nlot more effectively than we are using it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for his \ncomments on this Miguel Estrada nomination.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I can say we have been \nvery cooperative with the Bush administration. Of the 146 judges, if I \nam not mistaken--the minority leader can correct me but I think it is \nin the range of 140, and then there are five or six judges in another \nlifetime category that some add in, but whatever the number, 140, 146, \nit is significant--only two nominees to date have been held.\n  We have a responsibility under the Constitution, as Members of the \nSenate, to advise and consent to the President's nominees, and that \nmeans more than a rubberstamp. In the Miguel Estrada case, he is a \nperson with extraordinary academic credentials and an extraordinary \nlegal background who has refused to provide the Senate and members of \nthe Judiciary Committee important writings he generated which would \nreflect on his view of the law. He has said we cannot see them.\n  A few months ago, when we first considered this nomination, the \nRepublican Senator from Utah came to the floor--not Senator Hatch but \nhis colleague Senator Bennett--and suggested maybe the answer to this \nimpasse is for the White House to release these documents for us to \nreview, and once having reviewed them we can decide whether to move \nforward with this nomination.\n  I was here and I said I applaud that; I think that is a reasonable \nstandard of conduct. Within hours, the White House came out and said \npublicly, we will not release them. We do not believe we have to, and \nwe are not going to generate this kind of paperwork that may make \nEstrada's nomination more controversial. That was the end of the story. \nThat has been the end of his nomination. So it was a conscious decision \nby the White House not to release documents which may give us an \ninsight into Miguel Estrada and his lifetime appointment to one of the \nhighest Federal courts in the land.\n  In the Priscilla Owen situation, she is a classic judicial activist. \nWe have nominated and approved scores of conservative judges for the \nBush administration. She reached a new level, a level of judicial \nactivism which has put her in a special category with Miguel Estrada.\n  Now because of those two nominees being held up, we see practices in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that are unprecedented. Rule 4, which is \nthis obscure rule of the committee, was put in place by Senator Strom \nThurmond\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\nyears ago to protect the minority. It is now being ignored on a regular \nbasis, twice in the last few months by Senator Hatch. This rule \nbasically says if the majority wants to, they are going to move a \nnominee regardless of whether there is minority opposition. That was \nnever the practice of the committee. It is now. It is an effort by the \nBush administration and their supporters and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to basically ignore the precedent.\n  In the next couple of days, we are going to consider two other \nnominees, and they are fraught with controversy. William Pryor of \nAlabama has become a lightning rod on Capitol Hill. If one looks at his \nbackground, what he has done as attorney general in the State of \nAlabama, they can understand why. This is a man who goes far beyond \nconservatism. His positions on issues far and wide are so \ncontroversial. I said during the course of the committee, when one \nlooks at the controversial positions that have been taken by William \nPryor, the Attorney General of Alabama, it is like an all-you-can-eat \nbuffet. You do not want to fill up your plate early on with his \ncontroversial statements, discriminating against women, because you \nhave to save room for his controversial statements when it comes to the \nenvironment and to civil rights.\n\n  When it is all over, you are going to need more than one plate to get \nthrough the William Pryor all-you-can-eat buffet of controversial \npositions.\n  This man is headed for the floor. How did he get here? He got here by \ncircumventing an ethics investigation which was not completed. A \ndecision was made by the Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthat we do not need to finish that investigation; we are just going to \nsend him to the floor. Then they went through that shameful display on \nthe issue of his religion, which I hope never again is brought up in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee but was brought up for William Pryor. \nFinally, they jammed it through, strong-armed his nomination to the \nfloor, under rule 4.\n  So here we sit in the minority and what are we supposed to do? Are we \nsupposed to ignore these tactics, this departure from the precedent of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee? Are we supposed to ignore the fact that \nat least two, maybe four or five, of these nominees clearly would never \nhave passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee under any other \ncircumstances but for these tactics? I think if we did that, we would \nbe ignoring our constitutional responsibility.\n  Whether the nominee is William Pryor, Miguel Estrada, or Priscilla \nOwen, time and again we have to stand and accept our constitutional \nresponsibility to really stand in judgment as to whether these \nindividuals deserve a lifetime appointment to the Federal court. Miguel \nEstrada, until he is ready to come clean with his writings so we \nunderstand who he is and what he believes, I am afraid is going to face \nthe same fate over and over again.\n  The Republicans can call this to a vote as often as they want.\n  Our Senate Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, is right: The \nDemocrats will hold fast to the position. Until he is forthcoming and \nhonest and open as to who he is and what he believes, he does not \ndeserve this high appointment to a Federal circuit court. That spells \nout why we are here.\n  I also add, I listened for days last week and this week as the \nRepublicans complained we were not spending enough time on the Energy \nbill; we were finding all sorts of excuses not to get down to the work \nof the Energy bill. We are certainly not on the Energy bill right now. \nWe were not yesterday when we voted on Priscilla Owen, nor will we be \nlater in the week when other judicial nominations come to the Senate. \nAny excuse will do to get off that bill, it seems. I had hoped we would \nstay on it and do our work. I offered my amendment early. Others have \ndone the same. We will continue to make the symbolic votes.\n  If we are going to have true comity in this institution, if we are \ngoing to have a cooperative relationship, it will require us to deal \nwith this on a bipartisan basis. I urge my colleagues to continue to \noppose the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the assistant minority leader \nmade some cogent observations about how the Senate is being required to \nexpend hours on matters that are leading nowhere and take away from \ndebate on the Energy bill. If the Republicans were truly serious about \nfinishing the Energy bill this week, they would not be scheduling hours \nof debate on contentious judicial nominations. Nor for that matter \nwould they break for several hours yesterday to have a pep rally at the \nWhite House. From the Senate schedule, an objective observer would have \nto think it is more driven by partisanship and trying to score \npolitical points than a desire to make progress on the business of the \nSenate and on the issues that are the most important to the American \npeople.\n  This week we have not proceeded to the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, which contains a number of matters of overriding \nimportance to the country and the world, although Chairman McConnell \nand I have been ready to proceed. We have not proceeded to the energy \nand water appropriations bill or the other appropriations matters that \nneed to be concluded soon for the Government and Government programs to \ncontinue to operate in the fiscal year that will soon be upon us. \nUsually we devote July to appropriations matters but the Republican \nleadership has chosen to take this week off in that regard.\n  Today we must again return to the controversial nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The last \ncloture vote on this nomination was scheduled on May 8. The only thing \nthat has changed since that unsuccessful vote is that the \nadministration and some Republicans in the Senate have ratcheted up \ntheir unprecedented partisanship and the use of judicial nominees for \npartisan political purposes.\n  I spoke yesterday about the new low to which some Republican \npartisans have stooped in political ads and charges that should offend \nall Americans. I again challenged Republicans and the administration to \ndisavow those despicable efforts but, instead, they are choosing to \ncontinue to support the smear campaign of insult and division. \nYesterday I inserted into the Congressional Record some of the articles \nand editorials that comment upon this most troubling development.\n  Yesterday I also had the opportunity to meet with representatives of \nthe Interfaith Alliance. I thank them for condemning these unwarranted \nattacks and for standing up for the Constitution and the first \namendment rights of all Americans. Reverend Gaddy, Father Drinan, \nReverend Veazy, Right Reverend Dixon, and Rabbi Moline understand what \nis afoot and have spoken out in the best tradition of this country, and \nI thank each of them.\n  I do not expect the vote on this nomination to change today. Nothing \nhas been done to accommodate Senators' concerns. No arrangements have \nbeen made to provide access to the documents requested in connection \nwith this nomination that are available to the administration and that \nMr. Estrada said he had no objection be provided. Thus circumstances \nhave not changed since the first vote on this nomination or the most \nrecent vote back in May.\n  There continues to be, in the phrase favored by the White House, \n``revisionist history'' regarding the precedent of providing the Senate \nwith legal memos to the Solicitor General and by the Solicitor General \nand similar documents in connection with nominations for both lifetime \nand short-term posts. Senator Schumer, Senator Kennedy, and I have \ndetailed those earlier precedent in earlier debate. It has not been \nrefuted. It cannot be refuted. Facts are stubborn things. Nonetheless \nthe administration and Republicans continue to ignore the facts seeking \npolitical gain and have chosen to use Mr. Estrada as a pawn in their \nefforts. That is unfortunate and regrettable.\n  We have worked hard to try to balance the need for judges with the \nimperative that they be fair judges for all people, poor or rich, \nRepublican or Democrat, of any race or religion. This has been \nespecially difficult because a number of this President's judicial \nnominees have records that do not demonstrate that they will be fair \nand impartial. In response, the White House and its allies have \nbombarded the airwaves with all manner of misleading information to try \nto bully the\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nSenate into rolling over and rubber-stamping every one of its these \nnominees.\n  The claims that we are anti-Hispanic or anti-Catholic or anti-woman \nor anti-Christian are part of Republican politics of attack and \ndivision as taught by Presidential advisor Karl Rove and as implemented \nby the administration's allies in the Senate and C. Boyden Gray and his \nso-called Committee for Justice, who paid for the most recent volley of \nads. These dirty tricks are nothing new to this gang. Earlier this \nyear, Mr. Gray and his group ran ads insinuating that Democrats oppose \nthe nomination of Mr. Estrada because he is Hispanic, ads which were \nrefuted by the courage of many Latino leaders and Latino civil rights \ngroups which spoke out against confirming Mr. Estrada. Mr. Gray's group \nrecently ran print and radio ads calling Democratic Senators anti-\nCatholic because they oppose President George W. Bush's most \ncontroversial and divisive appellate nominee, Alabama Attorney General \nBill Pryor. These are despicable and false charges intended to distract \nthe public from the serious evidence that Mr. Pryor was chosen because \nhe would be an unfair, results-oriented judge. This type of \ndemagoguery, in its shameful effort to mislead and inflame, should be \ndisavowed.\n  The cynical political games are all the more disappointing from a \nPresident who campaigned claiming that he was going to be a uniter not \na divider and set a new tone in Washington. The reality is that on \nnominations this administration goes out of its way to choose divisive \nnominees. The tone set by the White House has been unilateral and been \nmarked by a refusal to consult with Senators in advance of nominations \nand to accommodate concerns raised.\n  Senate Democrats have more than demonstrated our good faith. We \ninherited 110 vacant seats in the Federal judiciary in July 2001, \nvacancies that were increased and perpetuated under Republican control \nof the Senate. In 17 months, Democrats worked hard to have the Senate \nconfirm 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  Second, as of July 28, 2003, the Senate has confirmed 140 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, including 27 circuit, or appellate, \nnominees. This is more circuit court judges confirmed at this point in \nhis Presidency than for his father, President Clinton, or President \nReagan at the same point in their Presidencies. It is more judges than \na Republican-controlled Senate allowed be confirmed in any 3-year \nperiod serving with President Clinton.\n  We are finally below the number of vacancies Republicans inherited in \n1995, and earlier this year we reached the lowest number of vacancies \nin the Federal courts in 13 years. This from the 110 vacancies that \nDemocrats inherited from Republican obstruction. Indeed, today there \nare more full-time Federal judges serving on the Federal courts than at \nany time in U.S. history.\n  These confrontations and problems with nominations are of the White \nHouse's own making. It is true that some of this President's judicial \nnominees with troubling records have not been confirmed. It is also \ntrue that Democrats have supported as many nominees as we could \nresponsibly. Democrats have not been spoiling for a fight.\n  We did not seek out the nomination of Judge Pickering or Judge Owen. \nBut we treated them fairly and much more fairly than Republicans had \ntreated President Clinton's nominees to the Fifth Circuit by according \nthem hearings, debate, and a committee vote. They were rejected. For \nthe first time in history a President nonetheless renominated those \nrejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee. That it was unprecedented \nis part of the difficulty with these controversial and divisive \nnominees. Justice Owen is someone whom Republican judges on the Texas \nSupreme Court criticized as a judicial activist.\n  We did not seek out the nomination of Miguel Estrada, but we accorded \nhim a hearing and sought to consider the nomination responsibly. We are \nbeing required to vote without all the information we need. The \ncommittee did vote, which was more than was accorded President \nClinton's nominees to the DC Circuit. The Senate is resisting a vote \nwithout knowing more about Mr. Estrada's work and judgment. Democrats \ndid proceed to vote on and confirm the nomination of another to the DC \nCircuit in spite of Republican obstruction of President Clinton's \nnominations to that important court.\n  We did not seek the controversial nominations of Jeffrey Sutton, \nTimothy Tymkovich, or Dennis Shedd, but we proceeded with them. They \neach received more negative votes than required to prevent cloture, but \nwe proceeded. We proceeded on Deborah Owen, Michael McConnell, and a \nnumber of strongly conservative and controversial nominees.\n  We have not chosen these fights this week. They have been staged by \nthe Republican leadership. We have fought them for the sake of the \nAmerican people, the independence of the Federal courts, and to \npreserve the Senate as a check on this expansive court packing by the \nExecutive.\n  Republican partisans have responded to the sincere concerns of \nnumerous Senators about the records of controversial nominees by \ndemanding that Senate rules be changed to force votes on the most \nextreme nominees. This effort is in the wake of repeated violations by \nRepublicans of longstanding committee rules and agreements to allow \nsufficient time to review the FBI investigations and legal careers of \nthe President's nominees for these powerful positions with lifetime \ntenure. With the Constitution's guarantee of lifetime jobs for judges, \nwe cannot correct mistakes made in a slipshod confirmation process.\n  In their quest to limit public scrutiny, Republicans have invented \ninterpretations of the Constitution without any basis in tradition or \nhistory. Although they now contend that the Constitution requires an \nup-or-down vote on every judicial nominee, the plain facts are that \nthey blocked up-or-down votes on more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees and more than 250 of his nominees to short-term \npositions in his administration.\n  Did they engage in wholesale constitutional violations during \nPresident Clinton's Presidency? I did think their one-person \nfilibusters by anonymous, secret holds were unfair, and that is why I \nmade blue slips public as chairman and have supported ending anonymous \nholds.\n  Our Democratic Senate leadership worked hard earlier this year to \ncorrect some of the problems that arose from some of the earlier \nhearings and actions of the Judiciary Committee in violation of rules \nthat have served the committee and the Senate well for a quarter of a \ncentury. However, once again just last week, the Republican members of \nthe Judiciary Committee decided to override the rights of the minority \nand violate longstanding committee precedent under rule IV in order to \nrush to judgment even more quickly for this President's most \ncontroversial nominees. That was another sad day in committee. And yet \nRepublicans persist in their obstinate and single-minded crusade to \npack the Federal bench with right-wing ideologues, regardless of what \nrules, longstanding practices, personal assurances, or relationships \nare broken or ruined in the process.\n  These rules and precedents are not just ``inside baseball.'' They are \nthe core of the rule of law in our system of government. If those \nelected will not follow rules to confirm judges or create statutes, \nthen we have little hope that the rule of law will prevail in our \ncourts and in our country. Republicans in the Senate seem intent on \nsacrificing the role of the Senate as a check on the Executive for the \nshort-term political gain of this White House.\n  The Framers expressly protected Members' freedom of debate in the \nConstitution. The Constitution also gives the Senate the power to \ndevise its procedural rules. There is no requirement in the \nConstitution that matters be decided by simple majorities or that all \nbills or nominations be brought to a vote.\n  As the Supreme Court has recognized that ``Certainly any departure \nfrom strict majority rule gives disproportionate power to the minority. \nBut there is nothing in the language of the Constitution, our history \nor our cases that requires a majority to always prevail on every \nissue.'' Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1 at 6, 197l, finding constitutional \nlocal voting rules requiring a majority of 60 percent to pass a \nmeasure. The notion that every nominee is\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\nentitled to a vote on the Senate floor is defied by decades of practice \nover the past two centuries.\n\n  Filibusters and other parliamentary tactics to delay matters were \nknown to the Framers. There was even a filibuster in the first Congress \nover locating the Capitol.\n  More importantly, the Framers created the Senate to be unique from \nthe House in the protections for the rights of each Senator and the \nstability and continuity in this body. Unlike the House, the Senate is \nnot reborn every 2 years but two-thirds of its Members remain through \nevery election. The Framers gave the Senate special powers, as a check \non the executive branch, to confirm nominees or to decline to do so, \naffirmatively or by inaction.\n  History shows that since the early 19th century, nominees for the \nhighest court and to the lowest short-term post have been defeated by \ndelay, while others were voted down. Not even President Washington's \nnominees were all confirmed. One of President Washington's short-term \nnominees, Mr. Benjamin Fishbourn's nomination to the port of Savannah, \nwas defeated on the floor of the Senate because of the opposition of \nboth Georgia Senators. Many Supreme Court nominations were defeated \nthrough inaction or delay, rather than by failed confirmation vote.\n  For 160 years, until 1949, there was no way, other than through \nunanimous consent, to bring a judicial or executive nomination to a \nvote. For the past 86 years, the Senate has required a vote of two-\nthirds to end debate on changing any rule of procedure, made explicit \nin 1959. For the past 54 years, the Senate has required more than a \nsimple majority, ranging from two-thirds to three-fifths, to bring a \njudicial nomination or legislation to a vote. For the past 25 years, \nthe Senate has required three-fifths of the Members sworn to vote to \nend debate on any matter, other than amending the rules, two-thirds.\n  The Senate and the Nation not only have survived all of these years \nwhile respecting freedom of debate but have thrived, strengthening our \ndemocracy by ensuring a forum that honors the passionate views and \ninterests of a minority of its members while checking the caprice of \ntemporary majorities, particularly regarding the lifetime appointments \nto our Federal courts.\n  As the late, eminent Professor Lindsay Rogers observed, ``the fact of \nthe matter is . . . that, as the much vaunted separation of powers now \nexists, unrestricted debate in the Senate is the only check upon \npresident and party autocracy.'' The American Senate 164, 1926. We \nwould all do well to remember that, as the scholar Charles Black \nobserved, ``If a President should desire, and if chance should give him \nthe opportunity, to change entirely the character of the Supreme Court, \nshaping it after his own political image, nothing would stand in his \nway except the United States Senate.''\n  If we give up the genius of the checks and balances of the \nConstitution as embodied in the role of the Senate exercising its \nindependent judgement to confirm or reject lifetime appointees, by vote \nor inaction, the American people will be the losers. Yet some \nRepublicans seem intent on inflicting more damage, to the process, to \nthe Senate, and to the independence of the Federal courts.\n  Republicans claim there has never been a filibuster of a circuit \ncourt judge. This is false. As recently as 2000, Senator Frist and his \nRepublican colleagues filibustered two of President Clinton's circuit \ncourt nominees. One of those nominees, Judge Richard Paez, a Mexican \nAmerican nominated to the Ninth Circuit was subject to filibuster \nprocedures and other blocking tactics that prevented him from being \nconfirmed for more than 1,500 days. That was a circuit court \nfilibuster, even though it was ultimately unsuccessful. At the same \ntime, Republicans were simultaneously filibustering the nomination of \nNinth Circuit nominee Marsha Berzon. This was in addition to nearly 2 \ndozen other circuit court nominees who were languishing or defeated in \ncommittee without a vote in committee or on the floor as well as dozens \nof other district court nominees.\n  Republicans who now claim that the Constitution requires a majority \nvote on every judicial nominee should explain how Republicans through \nsecret objections, blocked votes on more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees, including nearly 2 dozen circuit court nominees. For \nRepublicans to claim that the process is now broken because a few of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees are being debated in the light \nof day, rather than defeated in the dark of night, is breathtaking in \nits hypocrisy.\n  Republicans also blocked more than 250 of President Clinton's \nnominees to short-term positions in his administration. For example, \nthey successfully debated to death his nominations of an ambassador, \nSam Brown, and of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General, in addition \nto the other more than 300 judicial or executive branch nominees \nblocked in the dark of night by one of more Republicans. I mention this \nbecause I just cannot imagine how they can get away with these false \nclaims, which the most recent history of nominations clearly refutes. \nThis data is publicly available.\n  The Senate, unlike the House, has never had a rule allowing a simple \nmajority to force a vote on any matter. Only for the past 54 years have \nSenate rules allowed fewer than the agreement of all Senators to force \na vote on a nomination, reducing the number needed to end debate from \nunanimous agreement to the current number, 60 votes. These rules help \nensure that lifetime appointees have wide, rather than narrow, support \nbecause consensus nominees are more likely to be fair than extremely \ndivisive ones.\n  The nomination we vote on today, that of Mr. Estrada, is another \ndivisive nomination of this President. Despite the overtures that have \nbeen made to the White House to ask them to honor past precedent and \nprovide Mr. Estrada's memos to the Senate, the White House has refused \nto budge. Instead of honoring that precedent, the White has sought to \nbreak other precedents and understandings in the quest to win \nconfirmation at any cost.\n  Just last week, the White House signaled again its refusal to seek \ncompromise or accommodation for the sake of the fairness of the courts. \nThe President nominated two more controversial individuals to the DC \nCircuit. This is just one more sign in a long line that this White \nHouse is determined to continue to divide the American people with its \nnominations and to pack the courts in order to win judicial victories \nfor its ideological agenda and its allies at the expense of fairness \nfor all.\n  Since the administration has not provided the information requested \nmore than a year ago with respect to Mr. Estrada, nothing has been done \nto alleviate concerns about this nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada for the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit. It is truly a sad record that the Senate is now \nbeing obstructed by multiple filibusters on judicial nominees and that \nwe are required to conduct an unprecedented seventh cloture vote on \nthis particular extremely qualified nominee.\n  Let me state that a clear majority of this body supports this \nnomination, as has been demonstrated in the past six cloture votes. So \nit is regrettable that a minority number of Senators have followed \ntheir script of extraordinary obstructionism to prevent the Senate from \nconcluding the debate on this nomination and proceeding to a final \nvote.\n  It has now been 6 months since Mr. Estrada's nomination was reported \nby the Judiciary Committee and placed on the Senate Executive Calendar. \nIt has been nearly 8 months since he was renominated by President Bush. \nIt has been more than 10 months since his hearing before the committee, \nand I has been more than 2 years since he was first nominated by \nPresident Bush on May 9, 2001.\n  In all of that time my Democratic colleagues have had unlimited \nopportunities to make their case. Some of them oppose him; others \nsupport him. But one thing has remained clear through this debate: \nThere is no good reason to continue this route of obstruction by \ndenying Mr. Estrada an up-or-down vote.\n  We are at a troubling point in Senate history. Over the past few \nmonths I have spoken frequently on the calculated effort to stall \naction on President Bush's judicial nominees. There\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\nhave been efforts to bottle up nominees in committee, to inject \nideology into the confirmation process, to delay by demanding \nproduction of all unpublished opinions of nominees who are sitting \nFederal judges and making demands for answers to questions that are \nunanswerable. And, in the case of Mr. Estrada, opponents have demanded \nhe produce confidential internal memoranda that are not within his \ncontrol. When these tactics have failed, opponents have turned to their \nultimate weapon--the filibuster.\n  Filibusters of judicial nominees allow a vocal minority to prevent \nthe majority of Senators from voting on the confirmation of a Federal \njudge, a prospective member of our third, coequal branch of Government. \nIt is tyranny of the minority, and it is unfair to the nominee, to the \njudiciary, and to the majority of the Members of this body who stand \nprepared to fulfill their constitutional responsibility by voting on \nMr. Estrada's nomination.\n  I am not alone in my disdain for delaying or defeating judicial \nnominees through a cloture vote. I think that it is appropriate at this \npoint to note that many of my Democratic colleagues argued strenuously \non the floor of the Senate for an up-or-down vote for President \nClinton's judicial nominees.\n  The distinguished minority leader himself once said, ``As Chief \nJustice Rehnquist has recognized: `The Senate is surely under no \nobligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary \ntime for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.' An up-or-down \nvote, that is all we ask. . . .''\n  The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee echoed these sentiments \nwhen he said, ``. . . I, too, do not want to see the Senate go down a \npath where a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \nvotes of 41.''\n  Another one of my Democratic colleagues, Senator Kennedy, himself a \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had this to say: ``Nominees \ndeserve a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't like them, vote \nagainst them. But don't just sit on them--that's obstruction of \njustice.''\n  The distinguished Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, who \nalso serves on the Judiciary Committee, likewise said in 1999, ``A \nnominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them down.'' She \ncontinued, ``It is our job to confirm these judges. If we don't like \nthem, we can vote against them. That is the honest thing to do. If \nthere are things in their background, in their abilities that don't \npass muster, vote no.''\n  My other colleague from California, Senator Boxer, said in 1997, ``It \nis not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and prevent \nnumbers of highly qualified nominees from even being given the \nopportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.''\n  My colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, also said in 1997, ``I . . \n. respectfully suggest that everyone who is nominated is entitled to \nhave a shot, to have a hearing and to have a shot to be heard on the \nfloor and have a vote on the floor.''\n  The qualifications of Miguel Estrada are well known to the Senate. \nHowever I would like to briefly remind my colleagues of his outstanding \nrecord of accomplishment. Miguel Estrada represents an American success \nstory. Born in Honduras, he immigrated to the United States as a \nteenager to join his mother. Overcoming a language barrier and speech \nimpediment, he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1983 \nfrom Columbia College. At Harvard Law School he was an editor of the \nHarvard Law Review and graduated magna cum laude in 1986.\n  Mr. Estrada's professional career has been marked by one success \nafter another. After graduation he clerked for Second Circuit Judge \nAmalya Kearse--a Carter appointee--then Supreme Court Justice Anthony \nKennedy. He worked as an associate at the distinguished firm of \nWachtell Lipton in New York. He then worked as a Federal prosecutor in \nManhattan, rising to become deputy chief of the appellate division. In \nrecognition of his appellate skills, he was hired by the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office during the first Bush administration. He stayed with \nthe SG's Office for most of the Clinton administration. When he left \nthe SG's Office, he joined the D.C. office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, \nwhere he has continued to excel as a partner and has risen to the top \nof the ranks of oral advocates nationwide, having argued fifteen cases \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  The legal bar's wide regard for Mr. Estrada is reflected in his \nevaluation by the American Bar Association. The ABA evaluates judicial \nnominees based on their professional qualifications, their integrity, \ntheir professional competence, and their judicial temperament. Based on \nits assessment of these factors, the ABA has bestowed upon Mr. Estrada \nits highest rating of unanimously well qualified.\n  His supporters include a host of well-respected Clinton \nadministration lawyers, including Ron Klain, former Vice President \nGore's chief of staff; Robert Litt, head of the Criminal Division in \nthe Reno Justice Department; Randolph Moss, former Assistant Attorney \nGeneral; and Seth Waxman, former Solicitor General. I have, on previous \noccasions, placed letters of support in the record. I would refer my \ncolleagues to previous statements regarding Mr. Estrada's \nqualifications and endorsements.\n  Yet, despite the superb record, qualifications, temperament and \nexperience of Mr. Estrada, he continues to be blocked in his \nnomination. In support of their obstruction, our Democratic colleagues \nhave repeatedly raised red-herring issues with two demands that Mr. \nEstrada answer their questions, and that the administration release \nconfidential memoranda he authored at the Solicitor General's Office.\n  With regard to the first demand, the record is clear that Mr. Estrada \nspent hours during a day-long hearing answering my Democratic \ncolleagues' questions. He answered written questions submitted after \nthe hearing. He gave answers to questions that were substantially \nsimilar to answers given by Clinton nominees who were confirmed. Yet my \nDemocratic colleagues still complain that he has not answered their \nquestions. Really, their complaint is that, in answering their \nquestions, Mr. Estrada did not say anything that gives them a reason to \nvote against him. Simply put, they are not interested in his answers to \ntheir questions--they are interested in defeating his nomination.\n  This is why every effort to make Mr. Estrada available to answer \nadditional questions has gone virtually unacknowledged. He has been \nmade available to answer written questions and to meet with individual \nsenators. There has even been an offer to make Mr. Estrada available to \nanswer questions in a second hearing. But only one Democratic Senator \nhas met with Mr. Estrada since these offers were extended, and only one \nhas submitted written questions since the floor debate began, to which \nMr. Estrada has responded. We have met our Democratic colleagues more \nthan halfway on this, but they insist on continuing down this path of \nobstructionism.\n  Their second demand, for the Solicitor General memoranda, has been \nfully debated. The short response is that never before has a \nPresidential administration released confidential appeal, certiorari, \nand amicus recommendations on the scale that my Democratic colleagues \nseek for Mr. Estrada. This is a full-scale fishing expedition, pure and \nsimple, and the Justice Department is right to oppose it.\n  Despite these supposed reasons for denying an up-or-down vote on Mr. \nEstrada's nomination, I think there are other factors. Last fall a \nDemocratic staffer on the Judiciary Committee was quoted in The Nation \nmagazine as saying, ``Estrada is 40, and if he makes it to the circuit, \nthen he will be Bush's first Supreme Court nominee. He could be on the \nSupreme Court for 30 years and do a lot of damage. We have to stop him \nnow.''\n  So it appears that the real reason for this filibuster is the threat \nof a Justice Estrada on the Supreme Court. An editorial appearing in \nthe Atlanta Journal-Constitution said it best: ``The fear with Owen and \nEstrada is that one or both will be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court \nshould a vacancy occur. Senate Democrats are determined to keep off the \nCircuit Court bench any perceived conservative who has the credentials \nto serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.''\n  There is an additional factor that is not based on any substantive \nobjection to his nomination. I believe that some Senate Democrats do \nnot want the current President, a Republican President,\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\nto appoint the first Hispanic as United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  Let me read from an editorial published by the Dallas Morning News \naddressing this point. On February 17, 2003, the News wrote, \n``Democrats haven't liked Mr. Estrada from the beginning. Part of that \nis due to his ideology which is decidedly not Democratic. But part of \nit also has to do with the fellow who nominated him. Democrats don't \nrelish giving President Bush one more thing to brag about when he goes \ninto Hispanic neighborhoods during his reelection campaign next year. \nThey are even less interested in putting a conservative Republican in \nline to become the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme Court.''\n  Miguel Estrada will be an excellent Federal judge. Today, once again, \nwe have a choice either to continue to block another highly qualified \nnominee for partisan reasons or to allow each Senator to decide the \nmerits of the nomination for himself or herself. I choose to vote \nagainst obstructionist tactics and permit an up-or-down vote on the \nnominee. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 4, 2003]\n\n                 Democrats Use Wrong Route To Win South\n\n                            (By Jim Wooten)\n\n       U.S. Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) brought his presidential \n     aspirations to the South last week, promising in Alabama that \n     he will make the national party competitive here once again.\n       Make competitive, he neglected to mention, a party that has \n     positioned itself in opposition to the war in Iraq and \n     anything other than token tax cuts, and as Democrats reminded \n     the nation once again about the elevation of conservatives to \n     the federal bench. While the White House may appeal to some \n     as inside work with no heavy lifting, getting there through \n     the South toting this party's agenda will be a task requiring \n     Herculean labor.\n       Just this week, for example, Kerry's Democratic \n     colleeagues--Georgia's Zell Miller excepted--began to \n     filibuster the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     Priscilla Owen to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       Kerry and other Democrats are already filibustering the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the District of Columbia \n     Circuit Court of Appeals--the first time simultaneous \n     filibusters against judicial nominees have occurred in the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       Both Owen and Estrada are superbly qualified in every \n     respect. Yet on Owen, those who complain that a ``glass \n     ceiling'' exists for women of achievement are busily \n     constructing one to keep her in her place. And those who \n     complain that the federal bench lacks ``diversity'' find \n     Estrada to be too much diversity for their taste. He is \n     considered to be a conservative, and the interest groups that \n     drive the Democratic Party nationally fear Owen is, too, at \n     least on their abortion litmus test.\n       The fear with Owen and Estrada is that one or both will be \n     nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court should a vacancy occur. \n     Senate Democrats are determined to keep off the Circuit Court \n     bench any perceived conservative who has the credential to \n     serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Kerry, then, and the legions of presidential soundalikes \n     who campaign with him, have to come to a region where \n     conservatism is the mainstream to explain how reducing \n     federal taxes is bad and cheating exemplary women and \n     minorities of the fair hearing they have earned before the \n     U.S. Senate because they might be conservative is good.\n       ``I can help you wage a fight down here and rebuild this \n     party for the long,'' Kerry said in Birmingham. Republicans \n     have carried Alabama in all but three presidential elections \n     in the past 50 years. Jimmy Carter in 1976 was the last \n     Democrat to carry the state. George W. Bush carried every \n     Southern state in 2000, including Tennessee, his Democratic \n     opponent's home state. Al Gore Jr. thought so little of his \n     Southern prospects that he actively campaigned in just three \n     states--Tennessee, Florida and West Virginia.\n       Some Democrats, said Kerry, were ``surprised'' that he \n     visited Alabama.\n       No surprise that he visited. The real surprise is the party \n     baggage he hauled.\n       Opposition to tax cuts is comprehensible. Politicians \n     loathe interruption in the flow of spendable revenues. \n     Opposition to the war is, too. Too confrontational. Angers \n     adversaries. Provokes understandable aggression, for which we \n     bear unexpurgated sin.\n       While some positions are understandable, not so their \n     party-line opposition to Owen and Estrada. Owen, the new \n     filibusteree, drew the American Bar Association's highest \n     rating. She is a cum laude graduate of the Baylor University \n     Law School who scored the top grade in Texas on the bar exam. \n     She practiced 17 years before becoming a judge and has been \n     widely praised for her integrity and ability. Liberal groups \n     say, unconvincingly except when they are talking to each \n     other and Senate Democrats, that she is anti-abortion and \n     pro-business.\n       Being a neighborly people, Southerners of course welcome \n     Kerry to visit the region and to indulge himself in its \n     hospitality. But the senator should not indulge himself into \n     believing that a party that opposes tax cuts and filibusters \n     nominees such as Owen and Estrada has the slightest chance of \n     carrying this region.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Feb. 17, 2003]\n\n     Rush to Judgment: Estrada Nomination Has Been Blocked Too Long\n\n       There is a time for talking and a time for voting. The time \n     is past for the U.S. Senate to talk about Miguel Estrada's \n     nomination to the federal Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia circuit. It's time to vote.\n       Having emigrated from Honduras as a teenager unable to \n     speak much English, Mr. Estrada went on to graduate magna cum \n     laude from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, to \n     clerk for a Supreme Court justice, to serve two \n     administrations in the U.S. solicitor general's office, to \n     win more than a dozen cases in the Supreme Court. In short, \n     the 42-year-old lawyer is talented. Who knew that talent \n     would extend to tying the Senate in knots for days on end.\n       Democrats by now are in full filibuster. Senate \n     proceedings, as carried on C-Span, resemble the firm \n     Groundhog Day, where the main character has to relive the \n     same day over and over again. Every day, it's the same thing. \n     Democrats get up, march over to the podium, shuffle papers \n     and recite their main complaint with Mr. Estrada--that he's \n     conservative, unconventional and unapologetic. That when he \n     had the chance to hand them the rope with which to hang him \n     during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he \n     refused to hold up his end.\n       Democrats haven't liked Mr. Estrada from the beginning. \n     Part of that is due to his ideology--which is decidedly not \n     Democratic. But part of it also has to do with the fellow who \n     nominated him. Democrats don't relish giving President Bush \n     one more thing to brag about when he goes into Hispanic \n     neighborhoods during his re-election campaign next year. They \n     are even less interested in putting a conservative Republican \n     in line to become the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme \n     Court.\n       And so they have talked and talked, in hopes that \n     Republicans will back down. They won't. Nor should they.\n       Republicans certainly stalled their share of appointments \n     during the Clinton administration. But Democrats are being \n     shortsighted in seeking retaliation. It is precisely these \n     sorts of narrowly motivated temper tantrums--from both sides \n     of the political aisle--that turn off voters and make cynics \n     of the American people. When that happens, it doesn't matter \n     which nominees get confirmed or rejected. Everybody loses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. All time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will use a couple minutes prior to the vote in response \nto some of the comments that have been made, specifically in response \nto the Democratic leader's comments which I understand really are two.\n  Are we committed to addressing energy issues and completing this \nbill? We are. We will continue to work aggressively on this bill \nstarting earlier than we normally would and continuing later tonight. \nAgain, I ask for amendments to come forward. We are going to address \nthem one by one in a systematic way with adequate time for debate and \namendment.\n  Second, the question has been raised as to why we are considering \nthese votes today, such as cloture on Miguel Estrada. The answer is, \nthe American people deserve it. They understand we are not fulfilling \nour responsibility in this body without an up-or-down vote. That is our \njob. That is our responsibility. It is advice and consent of the \njudicial nominees sent by the President of the United States. That is \nbeing denied by the other side of the aisle. That is unacceptable to \nus. That is why that is being voted on today.\n  I made it very clear in my request both publicly and otherwise that \nwe would like to stack these votes as we are voting on other energy \namendments; it is not us who requested the time.\n  The complaint was made we were in a quorum call; why were we sitting \nin a quorum call in the middle of this bill? It should be made very \nclear that they requested that time and it was on their time that we \nwere in a quorum call. I, once again, make this plea for a vote like \ntoday. When the initial request was made, it was that we have\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\nthe vote and not spend a lot of time discussing the issue.\n  Second, let me reinforce a point I made this morning; that is, we are \nbeing required by the other side of the aisle to use a lot of our \nvaluable time, time that is increasingly valuable as we get closer and \ncloser to the recess, to rollcall votes on district judges. That has \nnot been done in the past. Once again, I ask and, in fact, plead with \nthe other side to change this request they have made that we spend so \nmuch time on rollcall votes which historically have been unnecessary.\n  On the issues of Chile and Singapore, I have made it very clear that \nwe will move those to a time after energy unless we are not dealing \nwith an issue on energy. I will talk to the other side of the aisle. If \nthere is debate on Chile and Singapore, we will probably do it after we \nhave the final energy votes this week. Then we will take up Chile and \nSingapore trade issues at that point.\n  The same issue will come up tomorrow because we will be voting on \nJudge Pryor. I am sure the same issues will come up about spending time \nand people will come to the floor and spend time.\n  I make it clear, our request last night was to set aside time, some \ntime in the future--not necessarily this week--to debate and discuss \nPryor and have an up-or-down vote on Pryor. That was refused. Again, it \nwould not have been this week--it could be sometime during September--\nbut there was an objection to that unanimous consent request. Thus, we \nwill proceed with a vote tomorrow.\n  Again, I make it clear my initial request is not to use a lot of time \nsimply to be able to go to Pryor but that we proceed aggressively on \nenergy. The American people deserve it. We will do it in an orderly way \nas we go forward today. I am confident we can complete this Energy bill \nif we stay focused, work together. The American people deserve it. I am \nconfident we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 21, the nomination of Miguel A.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nnomination of Miguel A.

Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback. I am \npleased that the Senator from Kansas is joining me in this effort, and \nhe has done so because I know he shares my view that the repeal of the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act in the underlying bill creates a \nserious regulatory void and market flaw that Congress should correct.\n  I am so pleased this is a bipartisan effort. I believe we have broad \nsupport in this body and beyond for these amendments.\n  These amendments would improve on the bill by making clear the \nactions that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--or FERC--must \ntake to ensure that deregulated holding companies do not outcompete our \nsmall businesses, damage their financial standing, and then pass the \ncosts of bad investments to consumers.\n  Our amendment is supported by a wide and impressive coalition of \nbusiness, labor, financial, and consumer groups which include: the \nIndependent Electrical Contractors, Air Conditioning Contractors of \nAmerica, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors, Associated Builders and \nContractors, National Electrical Contractors Association, Mechanical \nContractors, Sheet Metal Air Conditioning Contractors, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the National Alliance \nfor Fair Competition, the Small Business Legislative Council, Consumers \nfor Fair Competition, and the Association of Financial Guaranty \nInsurors.\n  The Senator from Kansas and I are concerned because electricity is \nnot like other commodities. Electricity is essential to public well-\nbeing. When this bill is enacted and the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct is repealed, a strong incentive will exist for large utilities with \nthe financial resources and the potential to exercise market power to \nget larger. Already, the electric utility industry is undergoing rapid \nconsolidation. In the past 3 years alone, there have been more than 30 \nmajor utility mergers and acquisitions, creating large multistate \nholding companies, including several in my own home State and with \nutilities in Minnesota that serve Wisconsin. Many companies have seen \ntheir stock plunge and credit ratings downgraded, and these companies \nare now prime buy-out targets.\n  I acknowledge that deregulation is not inherently bad and should not \nalways be prevented. It can produce efficiencies, economies of scale \nand cost savings for electrical consumers. However, it can also reduce \ncompetition, increase costs, and frustrate effective regulator \noversight. This amendment protects consumers from assuming the costs \nand risks of utility diversification into non-utility businesses, \nprevents utilities from subsidizing affiliate ventures and competing \nunfairly with independent businesses, and protects utility investors. \nIt does so by requiring FERC to issue regulations that require \naffiliate, associate, and subsidiary companies to be independent, \nseparate, and distinct entities from public utilities; maintain \nseparate books and records; structure their governance in a manner that \nwould prevent creditors from having recourse against the assets of \npublic utilities; and prohibit cross-subsidizing, or shifting costs \nfrom affiliate, associate, or subsidiary companies to the public \nutilities.\n  The Public Utility Holding Company Act was enacted in 1935 to rein in \nthe pervasive economic and political sway that holding companies held \nover the Nation's public utilities at that time. Studies conducted by \nthe Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. House of Representatives at \nthe time demonstrated that the holding companies, which controlled \napproximately 80 percent of the Nation's gas and electric utilities, \nwere exploiting both consumers and investors. At the time PUHCA was \npassed, 16 major holding companies and their utility subsidiaries \nproduced more than three-quarters of the electric energy in this \ncountry.\n  Individual States and localities enacted their own laws, but were \nunable to control these multi-State holding companies--many of which \nalso held investments in foreign countries--and their utility \nsubsidiaries. Holding companies created organizational structures that \nextended across State lines, specifically to place the holding \ncompanies beyond the regulatory reach of the individual State \ncommissions. In fact, registered holding companies were formed \nspecifically for the purpose of avoiding regulation. Holding companies \nleveraged their utility assets to gain financing for risky investment \nventures and engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\n  PUHCA requires that proposed investments benefit the utility system, \nand not harm ratepayers, shareholders or the public interest.\n\n  PUHCA requires that holding companies seeking to acquire utilities \nobtain preapproval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. In \naddition, a particular class of holding companies, known as \n``registered holding companies,'' those holding companies with utility \nsubsidiaries in more than one State, must obtain SEC approval also for \nacquisitions of nonutility businesses. The SEC has authority to oversee \nand provide advance approval for the complicated financial transactions \nof the registered holding companies,\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\nincluding intrasystem transactions and diversification into unregulated \nbusinesses.\n  PUHCA does these things, but the bill before us repeals PUHCA. As a \nresult, registered holding companies will be able to freely diversity \ninto unregulated businesses, and to engage in interaffiliate \ntransactions in which the holding company and nonutility businesses \ndrain financial resources and key assets from the utility businesses.\n  In California, for example, holding company maneuvers have left \nCalifornia utilities in a weakened financial condition. Billions of \ndollars have been moved out of their utility companies into the holding \ncompany and then into their unregulated affiliates which are protected \nby laws that now put this cash beyond the reach of even the holding \ncompany. As a result, the utilities have had too little cash to carry \nout their utility obligations.\n  In addition, even with PUHCA, we are already experiencing concerns \nabout utilities expanding into electricity-related services and \noutcompeting small businesses in my State. Small contractors can't \ncompete against big utilities in areas like energy efficiency upgrades \nto private homes, when big utilities can use existing assets like \npersonnel, equipment, and vehicles to perform those services. When \nPUCHA is repealed, utilities will be able to expand into other business \nareas, and we should make certain that we protect small businesses.\n  This amendment is good public policy, and it will strengthen the \nSenate's position in Conference with the House of Representatives. I \nurge my colleagues concerned about ensuring fairness in a deregulated \nsystem to support this amendment.\n  Let me say how delighted I am to be working with the Senator from \nKansas who I know has a deep and abiding commitment to small businesses \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin \nfor offering this amendment. I join him on it.\n  The amendment my colleague from Wisconsin has described first came to \nmy attention by a constituent and a friend of mine, D.L. Smith, Topeka, \nKS. D.L. is a great K-Stater, loves his country, has a medium size \ncontracting business. He employs between 57 and 100 Kansans. Founded in \n1972, the DL Smith companies provide commercial, institutional, and \nindustrial electrical services and, in recent years, even a little bit \nof telecommunications. They have been expanding slightly. D.L.'s \nservice trucks can be seen as far west as Salina and as far south as \nPittsburg, KS.\n  DL's is a successful medium size business by Kansas standards. It \nmight grow and could become more successful. But it might not be able \nto grow and could falter. The success or failure of this business will \nin great part be dependent upon the dispensation of this amendment.\n  This is what he brought to my attention. D.L. said: Look, what is \ntaking place is we are having to compete with these large utility \ncompanies that he asserts are using their regulated business to \nsubsidize the unregulated business and drive the small contractors out \nof business. That is my 15-minute speech, what he said and the examples \nhe gave.\n  What he does now is help in the contracting of electrical services \ninto homes. He is having to compete now with very large utility \ncompanies that are looking at other areas they can expand into to be \nable to do contracting work and, in the process, are driving these \nsmall to mid-size businesses out of business.\n  Such diversification on the part of the utility companies has been \nthe cause of significant and continuing harm to many small private \nsector firms. Utility-owned subsidies and affiliates now operate in \nalmost every imaginable type of business, from auto salvaging to resort \nmanagement to real estate brokerage to, more frequently, electric and \nmechanical contracting. Utilities now routinely sell appliances, \nprovide plumbing, heating and cooling, and service contracts, engage in \ninsulation work, sell and install storm windows and doors, provide \noutdoor lighting and interior lighting fixtures.\n  Normally as a free market Republican, I wouldn't have much problem \nwith that. This is a free country. People can compete the way they want \nto, the way they choose. The problem with this is, you have a regulated \nutility that has a clear income source that is dependent upon \nratepayers that is set by the Government, and they have a flow of \nresources that is established by the public sector. And it is a rate of \nreturn based upon cost plus.\n  The challenge--and what the D.L. Smiths of the world are feeling--is \nthe subsidization of that regulated business going into the unregulated \nfield and driving small to mid-size contractors out of business. Too \nmany companies are doing a very natural thing--trying to grow, get a \nlittle more business here and there for their shareholders to try to be \nable to hold down the cost of electrical rates to their customers. That \nis understandable. The problem is, you are using that regulated utility \nwhere they don't have competition coming in there to compete against an \nunregulated field and, in many cases, driving out small to mid-size \ncontractors like the D.L. Smiths of Topeka, KS, and others.\n  Private sector businesses both small and large welcome competition. \nUnfortunately, there have been numerous instances where utilities have \nengaged, in some cases, in unfair and abusive competitive behavior \nwhich undermines true competition in these impacted markets.\n  The primary obstacle to free, fair, and open competition in these \nmarkets is the ability of a utility to provide its affiliates and \nsubsidiaries with artificially lower costs of operation through cross-\nsubsidization and the failure to properly recover the true costs of \nequipment and services provided by the utility to such unregulated \noperations. These advantages arise neither from size, nor efficiency, \nbut rather from the corporate relationship such operations have with \nits related utility.\n  The utility companies are doing, by and large, a great job in serving \nthe public, providing utility rates at as low a cost as possible. That \nis a good thing. They work conscientiously to do that. We have a number \nof very good utility companies in the State of Kansas. When they use \nthe cross-subsidization, which is what we are trying to prevent in this \nbill, to run out small and midsize businesses, that is when we have a \nproblem, particularly when denying access to newly emerging markets, a \nkey to future expansion, job growth, and profitability for this \ncountry.\n  For those reasons, I support this amendment. I also recognize my \ncolleagues who wrote the bill, the Senators from New Mexico, \nparticularly Senator Domenici. They are trying to address this issue. \nWe put forward an amendment that we hope will strengthen the bill, help \nit out, one that doesn't negatively impact the electrical utility \nbusinesses, other than to say here is the area in which you can \noperate. Outside of that, this should be left to other businesses, \nparticularly small and midsize ones, to allow them to grow.\n  The amendment we put forward has broad support from the contracting \ncommunity, electrical contractors, plumbing, heating, and mechanical \ncontractors because they are feeling this onslaught. Most of my \ncolleagues, I guess, have been contacted by the contractors, most of \nwhich are small to midsize businesses operating in communities \nthroughout the country, that want this Feingold-Brownback amendment to \nbe added to the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n  I recognize the work that the chairman and ranking member have put on \nthis particular topic. We hope this amendment can be accepted because \nwe think it strengthens the bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nhis excellent work. It is an excellent example of why this is so \nimportant. I appreciate his support in working with me on it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, be \nadded as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am pleased that the ranking member \nof the committee, Senator Bingaman, is indicating positive remarks \nabout this amendment as well. I wonder if he may wish to make some \nremarks in support at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes. Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be added as a cosponsor, if I am not already one, on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from \nWisconsin and the Senator from Kansas for proposing this amendment. In \nmy view, it is offered in the same spirit in which the earlier \namendment I offered related to mergers was offered, and also the \namendment by Senator Cantwell related to market manipulation.\n  I think all three of those amendments have somewhat the same purpose, \nwhich is to strengthen this bill, to ensure there are necessary \nprotections for consumers, ratepayers, and for others who, in the case \nof the Senator from Kansas, pointed out there are many contractors in \nthe private sector who feel an amendment such as this is essential if \nthey are going to be able to compete and not face some type of unfair \ncompetition from companies that are part of holding companies that are \nowned by utilities or that also own utilities.\n  Let me back up here and talk a little about the Public Holding \nUtility Company Act, because that is the basic issue that causes this \namendment to come to the floor. As part of this bill, the proposal is \nthat we repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act. That was in the \nbill passed in the previous Congress--the repeal of that. I have \nsupported that but I have only supported it if it were clear that we \nwere replacing those authorities and those responsibilities for \nregulation and oversight at the Federal level with other effective \nauthorities for oversight and regulation.\n  My conclusion is that the Domenici substitute, as it now stands, does \nnot put in place effective regulatory tools to ensure that at the \nFederal level we can prevent the abuses that caused the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act to come into existence in the first place.\n  There is a very useful article that I commend to all of the Senate in \ntoday's business section of the Washington Post, written by Peter Behr. \nIt is called ``Energy Monoliths Could Return; Law Limiting Companies' \nReach Faces Repeal.''\n  Well, the law that limits a company's reach that this article is \ntalking about is the Public Utility Holding Company Act. As I say, \nthere is general agreement that the act has become an anachronism; it \nis way too complex; that we need to modernize the Federal regulatory \nscheme in regard to utilities. So the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct should be repealed but it needs to be replaced with something that \nalso constitutes effective regulation. Let me refer to the chart. I \ndon't know if anybody can see it.\n  This tries to rapidly describe what is involved with the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act, or PUHCA, jurisdiction. It basically says \nthat for a company which owns, as the chart shows, other affiliates--a \nutility generating and marketing affiliate--there are real restrictions \non what that holding company can do with regard to any other \nacquisitions of utilities. Essentially, you can acquire one more \nutility, or you can own one utility, and then if you own any more than \nthat, you come under a very strict set of requirements that are \npresently in the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Those requirements \nshould be repealed but we need something that is effective.\n  This amendment tries to do that and would do it in an effective way. \nIt accomplishes the same goal that I was trying to accomplish as part \nof--or one of the two goals I was trying to accomplish in the merger \namendment I offered earlier yesterday, by requiring FERC to establish \nreal firewalls around the utility affiliate of a holding company to \nprevent the assets of the utility from being used to prop up risky \ndiversification ventures. That is, you cannot use the assets of the \nutility to support a contracting company, as an example, which is the \nkind of thing that the Senator from Kansas was talking about having to \ncompete with.\n  I think the language of the amendment is extremely clear. It makes it \nvery clear that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall \npromulgate regulations, shall apply in the case of a transaction \nbetween a public utility and an affiliate or associate company of the \npublic utility--and that is what the chart shows--where you have a \nutility and another affiliate. It basically builds a firewall and gets \nat the issue I was talking about when I offered my amendment yesterday \nevening; that is, the public utility shall not cross-subsidize or shift \ncosts from the affiliate or associate company to the public utility. It \ncannot encumber the assets of the public utility in order to prop up \nsome other business. That is only fair as far as the ability of the \nother business to compete in the marketplace, but it is particularly \nimportant as security for the ratepayers of that public utility.\n\n  There are an enormous number of examples. I went through several of \nthem yesterday. Let me refresh people's memories. There are many \nexamples in the last year--in recent months, in fact--where utilities \nhave been getting into other activities and have encumbered the assets \nof the utility, and the ratepayers of the utility have been adversely \naffected.\n  One example I mentioned yesterday, and I will mention it again \nbecause it does relate to Kansas, is West Star. It is the largest \nutility in the State of Kansas. It is owned by a holding company. West \nStar came under scrutiny last year because of problems that it \nencountered with nonutility affiliates.\n  West Star had invested in a number of unregulated ventures, including \na home security company, and the home security company did not do well. \nSo the holding company, which owned both the utility and the security \ncompany, shifted $1.6 billion of debt from its unregulated companies to \nthe utility. It loaded these debts onto the utility, and then you have \nessentially the ratepayers of that utility left having to pay $100 \nmillion per year because of the activities of unregulated affiliates \nthat had nothing to do with the utility itself.\n  Some would say this is something the States should handle. The Kansas \nCorporation Commission began an investigation this last summer into \nthis situation. The Justice Department began an investigation. The \nFederal investigation resulted in the indictment of the CEO of the \ncompany for bank fraud, and the investigation of the Kansas Corporation \nCommission, which\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nis the State regulatory agency, resulted in a dramatic restructuring of \nthe company to separate the utility from the unregulated companies of \nthe holding company.\n  Some would say: They solved it at the State level. Why should we be \nhaving any authority at the Federal level? They solved it at the State \nlevel for the period going forward, but they did not solve it prior to \nthis arrangement being put in place and, accordingly, the ratepayers \nare paying $100 million a year to repay the debt that the utility has \nacquired because of this activity.\n  One other example I mentioned yesterday that I will mention again is \nPortland General Electric. Portland General Electric was in the \nunfortunate position of having been acquired by Enron, and the Oregon \nPublic Utility Commission required that a number of conditions be met \nbefore it approved that acquisition. That was helpful.\n  Frankly, they acted wisely in requiring those conditions. But even \nthat was not adequate to fully insulate that utility from the collapse \nof Enron and from the collapse of the other many businesses in which \nEnron was engaged. The fate of the parent company has had a very \nadverse effect on the ability of Portland General to gain access to \ncapital markets. As I say, that is just one of many other examples that \ncan be cited.\n  This amendment Senator Feingold and Senator Brownback are offering is \nextremely meritorious. It is an essential part of what we ought to be \ndoing if we are going to avoid getting back into a situation where \ncross-subsidy is permitted. We ought to have a bright line requirement \nthat the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ensure that cross-subsidy \nwill not occur in these acquisitions and mergers. We owe that to \nratepayers. We owe it to the public generally.\n  I hope very much we will adopt this amendment. I commend the authors \nof the amendment for their proposal today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, before I start, I ask the \ndistinguished sponsor of the amendment how much additional time does he \nthink he needs on his amendment. I am not pressing the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I do not expect a great deal of time \nat all. I would like the opportunity to respond to any comments the \nchairman of the committee might make.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Since it looks as if we will not be very long, does the \nSenator from New Mexico know if there is another amendment ready on his \nside since we are close to completing the debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me check with the Democratic floor \nleader. I will get an answer back on that question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Madam President, I say to the author of the legislation, I very much \nappreciate the fact that during these difficult times when we are \ntrying very hard to get so much done in a short period of time the \nSenator came to the floor, put an amendment down, and, in his typical \nmanner, got to the point, and in short order is going to let the Senate \nvote.\n  Frankly, what he is asking us to do is exactly the wrong thing for \nthe situation that exists today in the energy markets. There is an \narticle that was quoted from which is on all our desks:\n\n       Energy Monoliths Could Return.\n\n  It was quoted from, excepting on the second page there is an \nabsolutely succinct paragraph that this Senator believes is totally, \nunequivocally correct. I quote three-quarters of the way down the \nparagraph starting with the word ``repeal'':\n\n       Repeal could restore confidence in energy companies shunned \n     by shareholders after the Enron scandal and encourage badly \n     needed expansion of power transmission networks.\n       From the financial market standpoint, repeal--\n\n  And let me add ``of PUHCA,'' repeal of PUHCA--\n\n     would be the single most important part of the energy bill. \n     It certainly is what investors are looking for.\n\n  The problem with the amendment is that it probably will take the \nintent in that paragraph, the indication of what most probably will \nhappen when PUHCA is repealed, and it will probably destroy it, wilt \nit, make it very vulnerable, and we will not get the result. The result \nis the need for huge injections of capital into the energy companies \nbecause of what has happened to them in the past 18 months.\n  That is why it is good news that PUHCA is being repealed. That is why \nit is bad news when an amendment comes along and says: This is just a \nlittle 'ole amendment to make sure the electric companies keep their \nmoney where it ought to be, that they ought not invest it anyplace \nelse, and that their boards of directors be governed by this statute, \nthe kinds of issues that tie up the potential of a company that is \ninvolved in the utility business.\n  We have already given FERC in this carefully balanced bill the \nenforcement power to make sure that the companies are properly \ninvested, to make sure they are taking care of their business and of \nthe stockholders' money and of the electrical business.\n  We have actually said that is a power FERC has. This title already \nincludes enhanced books and records authority for both State and \nFederal regulators to ensure that ratemaking bodies have all the \ninformation necessary they need for retail ratemaking, to ensure there \nis no cross-subsidization or improper commingling of utility and \naffiliate assets. That is what the authors of the amendment are worried \nabout, that if PUHCA is not there--and remember, everybody has said so \nfar, including my friend Senator Bingaman, we ought to get rid of \nPUHCA. It is an unfair holding down of these companies by an old law. \nEveryone wants to get rid of it except these two Senators want to say \nnow if we do, let's go back and put some more handcuffs on these \ncompanies because we are scared, we are frightened, that they will do \nwrong.\n  We are saying, if that is done, the very pluses, the positives, that \ncome from the repeal are going to be negated because what is being done \nis not needed, and investment is going to be scared off.\n  The Domenici underlying bill says that when we get rid of PUHCA we \nbetter put in something, although this job is principally the job of \nStates. When Senator Bingaman read about the two cases, in both cases \nState commissions were involved in cleaning up the matter, but \nnonetheless, we have put in here the Federal Government, FERC, is given \nthis authority in this particular area, because of PUHCA going away, to \nmake sure there is no improper commingling of utility and affiliate \nassets.\n  There is more. In fact, the underlying amendment also says, with \nreference to merger, acquisitions and dispositions, leasing, or other \ntransactions:\n\n       Will not impair the ability of the Commission or the \n     ability of the State commission having jurisdiction . . . to \n     protect the interests of consumers or the public.\n\n  And:\n\n       Will not impair the financial integrity of any public \n     utility that is a party to the transaction or an associate \n     company of any party to the transaction.\n\n  So it even says when PUHCA is gone, we have all of these entities \nthat will be worried about mergers and the like, but we put new \nlanguage in that I just read, which says, nonetheless, if we are \ntalking about merger, acquisition, or disposition, there are these \nadditional powers.\n  Frankly, I understand that an amendment which is, in fact, a bill--\nthat is the Domenici amendment--it is that big. I understand Senators \nand their staff could read it and they could say, well, yes, we get rid \nof PUHCA, and then somebody back home might tell them if you are \ngetting rid of PUHCA you better be sure you do so and so, and this \namendment could be given birth.\n  If one looks at this carefully, they will find it did not come to the \nfloor without the staff which worked on it helping the Senator make \nsure we know, when we get rid of PUHCA, we have to do something to be \nsure we have taken care of some problem children that might arise along \nthe way.\n  I want to repeat, this is not a little proposition. If it was, I \nwould accept it because these are very good Senators. But I know if I \ntook it, I would be sending the wrong signal to all of those companies \nacross this land that have reviewed this bill very closely, some small, \nsome large, some of them municipal, some of them co-ops. They have \nlooked at it carefully and they know we are through with PUHCA. I do\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nnot want them to say, well, we got rid of one and they turn right \naround and make it difficult for us to do what we ought to do, what we \ncan do, what we should do, to make sure we got all the assets invested \nin our companies in these faltering days in terms of resources.\n  So I say to the two Senators, I wish that were not the case so I \ncould thank them and accept it, but I honestly do not believe those who \nanalyzed it did a careful job. No aspersions.\n  A better way might be that we looked at it carefully, we watched out, \nand we were certain we protected the public and the consumers, those \nwho will take electricity, and indeed the stockholders, so the kinds of \nthings they are worried about will not happen.\n  I do not know what it means, but the horror cases they are speaking \nof occurred while PUHCA existed. That is interesting, just as an \nobservation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. First, I thank the Senator for the kind remarks. I do \nnot believe we disagree with the goals with regard to the underlying \namendment. In fact, I regard this, and I think Senator Brownback \nregards this, as a friendly amendment; that is, an attempt to make sure \nthis dramatic change, the repeal of PUHCA, gets off the ground properly \nand does not, in effect, throw out the baby with the bathwater.\n  My amendment does not attempt to repeal the repeal. I think if one \nwas listening to the remarks of the Senator from New Mexico they might \nhave gotten the impression we were sort of pretending we were repealing \nPUHCA and then putting it back in effect. That is not in any way, \nshape, or form what we are trying to do.\n  We are trying to address a very specific problem the Senator from \nKansas laid out very well, the cross-subsidization problem, when a \nutility holding company owns other affiliated entities and the problems \nthat occur when those assets are moving back and forth in a way I and \nmany people think threatens ratepayers as well as investors.\n  Specifically, the Senator from New Mexico talks about the fact that \nthere are those who are poised and ready to invest in the utility \nindustry if changes are made, presumably such as the repeal of PUHCA. \nIt is my belief that is exactly what our amendment helps do. I think it \nhelps create a scenario that will make investors more positive rather \nthan less positive.\n  The Senator's argument about somehow our amendment will scare off \ninvestors is really a 5-year-old argument. PUHCA repeal, without the \nbottom-up regulation these ring-fencing provisions of this amendment \nprovide, will continue to keep capital away. We do not have some kind \nof insurance for investors in utilities that the resources of those \nutilities will not be spirited away to these affiliates. Then they will \nnot have the confidence in investing, and I want that investment to \nhappen.\n  Regulatory insulation, and that is what the Feingold-Brownback \namendment does, will help restore investor confidence. It will actually \nhelp achieve the chairman's goal. Our belief, and our hope, is our \namendment will help bring order to what is a beleaguered sector, not \nthat it will wreak havoc.\n  Utilities provide an essential public service. Our amendment \ninsulates these utilities wherever they are in a corporate family. So \nwhat we are doing is providing a clear distinction of what entities are \nregulated or not.\n  Now, if we are looking at investments, that is what we want to see. \nWe want to know exactly what we are getting into. We want to know what \nour dollars are going to be used for and it helps restore investor \nconfidence and consumer confidence, not the reverse.\n  This is a good amendment. It has strong bipartisan support. There \nhave not been a lot of Feingold-Brownback amendments over the years, \neven though I thoroughly enjoy working with the Senator. I think what \nit represents is a powerful commitment on the part of those of us who \nare working on this to protect small businesses in our State.\n  I will not read again the list of the contractors and small business \norganizations that support this effort, but it is the kind of \nmainstream people that made my State. It is the kind of mainstream \npeople that made the Chair's State. It is the kind of mainstream people \nthat made the Senator from Kansas's State. They do not want to be \ndriven out of business by utilities able to somehow move these assets \nback and forth through affiliates that are not properly regulated. That \nis a reasonable request.\n\n  Even more importantly and in response to the Senator from New Mexico, \nwe are trying to make sure investors feel comfortable so it will help \nthe utility industry. The worst thing we can do is raise the specter of \nanother Enron. The phrase ``cooking the books'' dominated our headlines \na year ago, and our amendment is about making sure there will not be \nany accusations or reality of cooking the books when it comes to a \nutility and its affiliates, that they will have two separate sets of \nbooks.\n  Yes, the Senator's underlying amendment is good. It allows FERC to \nlook at the books. If they look at the books and there are no standards \nor rules about keeping the entities separate, what is the good? There \nneed to be some teeth in it. That is what our amendment does.\n  I suggest this is a reasonable, fairly modest amendment that will \nmake the Domenici substitute even better. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I will speak briefly to the Feingold-\nBrownback amendment.\n  There is the illusion, or at least the concern, on the part of some \nof our colleagues that the title we have before the Senate in S. 14 \nsomehow creates a type of regulatory gap that I don't believe exists. \nThe chairman of the committee, in his thoughtful processes that brought \nus to this amendment and the time he has spent working on it with \nstaff, would agree it does not exist.\n  Certainly Senator Feingold and others have reason to be concerned, as \ndo I. My constituency, my ratepayers of Idaho, for a period of time \nspent a good deal more than they should have on their electrical costs \nbecause of the dysfunctional markets in the State of California. Those \ndysfunctional markets occurred with all of these laws in place that we \nare talking about now changing. What is most important to recognize is, \nthose who misused the market are now suffering. Those who misused the \nmarket are now being prosecuted. Those who misused the market to line \ntheir pockets, I trust, are having their pockets stripped of ill-gotten \ngold.\n  Why? Because our President has a Corporate Fraud Task Force, we have \na little organization called the FBI, we have the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and, yes, even the U.S. Postal \nService and the U.S. Attorney's Office that seek to look at and have \nfound what they allegedly suggest is postal fraud.\n  Whether it is Enron, whether it is Dynegy, whether it is Reliant or \nwhether it is El Paso Corporation, time and time again, and currently, \nmany of the major operatives within those organizational structures are \nbeing brought before the Federal justice system and will be or are \nbeing prosecuted because of what they are now alleged to have done or \nare accused of having done as it relates to wire fraud, conspiracy, \nmanipulation, round-trip trading, all of those things we suggest ought \nnot happen.\n\n  What we have done in this title appropriately protects the consumers \nof this country, but, as important, we protect the capital that comes \nto this market to be invested, to create the generational capabilities, \nthe transmission capabilities, the pipeline capabilities, all the \nthings we need to interlock an energy system in our country and to \ncontinue to make it as reliable as it has been in the past and as \nreliable and abundant as it should be, hopefully at the least cost to \nthe consumer.\n  Clearly, the consumer got gouged. My consumers got gouged. There was \nill-gotten gold. We darned well ought to strip it from the pockets of \nthose who were out to steal it from the consumer. Tragically enough, \nthat stealing was going on long before this\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\namendment, under the current laws that some argue we ought to keep in \nplace, 1930 laws that have rendered themselves relatively obsolete in a \nmodern-day energy system.\n  We are asking that we have the right enforcement in place. We have \ngiven FERC the authority it ought to have within the confines and the \nlimitations in which we believe it ought to operate. There is no \nregulatory gap. Any reason to add to what we have done simply \nfrustrates the multibillion-dollar market, the revenues that will come, \nthe investment that will be created, toward once again creating the \nfinest electrical and energy market in the history of the world. That \nis what we ought to have. That is what we need. Without that, our \ninvestors and our economies look elsewhere, beyond the bounds of our \ncountry where they can find stability of economy, stability of resource \nand, most importantly, an abundant supply of energy.\n  In the absence of energy, in the absence of an abundant, least cost \nsupply of energy, our economy is in trouble. If our economy is in \ntrouble, most assuredly our men and women who want to find work in that \neconomy are oftentimes without work. We believe this is a full \nemployment bill that will create literally hundreds of thousands of new \njobs because of the stability it will bring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I was informed a while ago by my good \nfriend, the whip, Senator Reid, that as soon as we finish this \namendment--and I think we are finished; I am not quite sure whether the \nproponents have finished--Senator Byrd wanted to speak. I ask Senator \nByrd, since he is here, if that is the case. And then I ask if I could \nspeak following Senator Byrd, if he has no objection. I ask that after \nthe distinguished Senator Byrd completes his remarks, the Senator from \nNew Mexico be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and I shall not object--the \nSenator has that right. We are in the process of winding down debate on \nthe Feingold amendment. After Senator Byrd and the Senator from New \nMexico, the manager of the bill, we would be ready to vote on not only \nthe Feingold amendment but the two amendments that have been offered by \nthe Democratic manager of this bill.\n  I suggest, because these were debated yesterday, we should have 10 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on each of the Bingaman \namendments. While Senator Byrd is speaking, maybe the staff could \nprepare a unanimous consent agreement to meet these steps that we need \nto take to complete votes on these three amendments. We would at that \ntime be ready to offer another amendment.\n  Also, if Senator Byrd speaks for half an hour or 45 minutes, then we \nwill have these votes occur at the same time as Mr. Rumsfeld is here. I \ndon't know if that is what people want. At least half of the Senate \nwill be going to the Rumsfeld meeting--maybe even more. It is up to the \nRepublican leader, of course, what he wants to do with the Secretary of \nDefense. But whatever the wish of the leader is, we will certainly go \nalong.\n  We are ready to vote on these three amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, if we could reduce the debate time \nbefore each amendment. We don't need 10 minutes; 5 minutes would do.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to do that, although I have conferred with \nSenator Bingaman. On one amendment he needs 5 minutes, and on the other \namendment he could use 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response, I don't believe I will use 5 minutes; I \nwill probably use closer to 3 minutes, but I would like to have the \nability to go on if I get warmed up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's prepare the unanimous consent request on all \nthree, with 5 minutes each, 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I want to bring this debate to a \nclose, but I want to quickly respond to a couple of comments from the \nSenators from New Mexico and Idaho.\n  When the Senator from New Mexico was making his comments he talked \nabout the fact the State commissions, public service commissions, and \nothers would be able to sort of take care of these kinds of problems \nthat would exist in a post-PUHCA repeal era. I don't think that is an \nadequate answer.\n  The fact is, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in many cases \nthese are interstate utility entities, and it is that very fact that \nhas made it so difficult, prior to PUHCA, for there to be any \nappropriate regulation at all. So we do need some kind of appropriate \nlaw that homes in on this problem of utility holding companies and \naffiliates and the cross-subsidization problem that exists. That is the \nfirst point I want to make, that the State level is simply not going to \ndo it.\n  The second point relates to the comments of the Senator from Idaho. \nThe premise of the remarks of the Senator is that somehow my amendment \nundoes the repeal of PUHCA. It does not do that. Our amendment is \nnecessary and helpful and good for investors and consumers and \nratepayers and small business, whether PUHCA is repealed or not. The \nargument is a red herring. The argument has no relationship to the \nissue of whether these provisions are needed.\n  Maybe we could put it this way: The Senator from Idaho believes that \na 1933 law known as PUHCA is no longer the right law for this time. We \nare proposing what we believe to be the appropriate, measured, consumer \nconfidence and investor confidence provision for 2003, not 1935. So we \nare accepting in the amendment the repeal of PUHCA, but we are adding \nthis provision that is necessary in 2003, not 1935.\n  The only other alternative, if we do not do at least our amendment, \nis we are going to be returning to the environment that we are just \ncoming out of, the environment that everyone admits was a disaster for \nconsumers and that it destroyed consumer confidence and investor \nconfidence because of the recklessness and the cooking of the books \nthat went on all over this country, particularly in the utility \nindustry.\n  We have to make sure what we do here does not undercut the confidence \nwe want to increase for consumers and for investors. That is the \npurpose of our amendment. We are not trying to undo the chairman's \nprimary purpose of his amendment.\n  I yield the floor. Assuming that is the end of the debate, I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico. I thank him for the knowledge he brings to the Senate on many \nmatters. For these several years I have worked with him on the \nAppropriations Committee, he has shown himself to be one of the most \nknowledgeable persons on that committee and, with respect to energy, he \nhas shown time and again that he is well equipped to enter into debate \nand to help to form good legislation, better legislation, or the best \nlegislation.\n  I have always found him to be one who is easy to work with. I enjoy \nworking with him and I compliment him for the time he has put in on \nthis matter that is before the Senate. He arrives at his conclusions \nafter due and deliberate examination, and he is a first-class \nlegislator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say thank you very much, Senator \nByrd. I greatly appreciate your remarks. It is always my pleasure to be \nserving with you.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. He has distinguished \nhimself in many fields.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, on pleasant summer days, such as these, I \ndoubt that the average person worries too much about the intricacies of \nenergy policy. However, energy is the life's blood of our economy. \nObviously, a comprehensive energy policy is a critical underpinning for \na viable, strong nation.\n  And, there are real and growing concerns about the Nation's energy \nsecurity--about our teetering economy and about our growing dependence \non foreign oil. Coupled with these is an increasing need to protect the \nenvironment and address global climate change. But instead of looking \nfor balanced and comprehensive solutions to our critical energy \nproblems, this administration drags its feet and deals with our energy \nchallenges by meeting\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nbehind closed doors with select corporate contributors.\n  As is often the case, this White House offers shortsighted, silver \nbullet solutions. But, in fact, there are just no silver bullet \nsolutions to a sound and comprehensive energy policy for the future. \nThere is no Lone Ranger approach to energy. There is no John Wayne \napproach to energy. We have to consider the worldwide energy supply and \ndemand. We must be ready to invest in a range of policies, \ntechnologies, resources, and institutional structures that can prepare \nus for the future.\n  During the 2000 election cycle, the Bush campaign claimed that the \ncreation of a national energy strategy was one of its most important \npriorities. But what they meant by that may not be what many people \nthought they meant. Even as candidate Bush traveled the Presidential \ncampaign trail, the issue of energy often shared the stage with George \nW. Bush and Dick Cheney, in part because both candidates were formerly \nbusiness executives with ties to the energy industry. My own home State \nof West Virginia, where energy issues are very important, played a \ncritical role in pushing the Bush-Cheney team over the top in the \nelectoral college and handing the current administration the White \nHouse.\n  But, after his election, the President seemed more interested in \nseeking the advice of his corporate friends than developing a balanced, \ncomprehensive, far-reaching energy policy. It may be illustrative here \nto review the background of some Bush administration officials. Vice \nPresident Cheney served as the CEO of Halliburton. Secretary Norton has \nlobbied for the oil, gas, and auto industries. The President's Chief of \nStaff has served as the president and CEO of the American Automobile \nManufacturers Association. The U.S. Trade Representative, Robert \nZoellick, has served on Enron's Advisory Council. Even National \nSecurity Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was honored by Chevron with a \nsupertanker named after her. With such close connections to big \ncorporate donors, one has to wonder about who really influences the \nenergy agenda of this administration.\n  Upon taking office, the Vice President led a task force that hammered \nout the new administration's energy strategy for the Nation. After \nmonths of work, the National Energy Policy Development Group issued its \nreport in May 2001. It was praised in some camps, criticized in others. \nThe criticism arose because executives from Enron and other big \ncorporate contributors played a major role in the recommendations of \nthat task force. To many, the task force recommendations for a national \nenergy policy appeared to be little more than an industry wish list.\n  When the General Accounting Office and outside groups requested basic \ninformation about the Vice President's task force, the White House \nclaimed executive privilege. Throughout the court battle which ensued, \nthe Bush Administration repeatedly claimed that the separation of \npowers and executive privilege prevented them from releasing pertinent \ndocuments. As a result, the credibility of the White House energy \nstrategy development is certainly strained, to say the least, \nespecially with regard to the oil industry.\n  I have been particularly concerned about our continued reliance on \nforeign oil and our lack of commitment to developing domestic fuel \ndiversity. Tackling that growing problem requires a serious and multi-\nfaceted commitment, involving cooperation and coordination among many \nplayers. But what the President seems to be proposing can be pretty \nmuch boiled down to drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, and exploiting the oil reserves under the hot sands near the \nTigris and Euphrates Rivers, in the Fertile Crescent--modern day Iraq.\n  U.S. domestic oil production peaked in the early 1970's, and, since \nthat time, our oil demands have far outstripped our supplies. But \ninstead of figuring out how to disentangle ourselves from foreign oil \ndependence, the Bush administration seems to be intent on sinking our \nenergy fortunes deeper and deeper into the hot sands of old \nMesopotania--the hot sands of the Middle East. What is this \nadministration's total energy agenda? Is oil the only card in the \nenergy deck which the administration will play?\n  It certainly appears so. And one has to wonder just how that card is \nbeing played. As the world witnessed in the war in Iraq, the \nadministration was much more interested in protecting, defending, and \ndeveloping Iraq's oil resources than it was in protecting Iraq's \ncultural or social resources. Early on in the war, coalition forces \nwere ordered to make it a priority to protect the oil fields. Upon \ntheir entry into Baghdad U.S. troops were ordered to surround and \nprotect Iraq's oil ministry. Despite clear warnings, coalition forces \nleft Iraq's priceless museums and other government institutions \ndefenseless. On top of that, U.S. forces failed to protect nuclear test \nfacilities. This is especially puzzling in light of the \nadministration's often stated concerns about dirty bombs and the \npilfering of nuclear material by terrorists. So where are our \npriorities? What is the United States really up to in Iraq?\n  If the United States were really intent on developing a smart, \ncommonsense oil policy, we would be taking additional measures to \nbetter balance our supplies from other nations; we would be carefully \nusing our strategic reserves to hedge against future foreign \nmanipulation; we would be promoting industrial energy efficiency, and \nwe would be nurturing all forms of alternative sources for our energy \nand transportation needs, including coal, renewable, and biomass-based \nsources.\n  I have proposed my own commonsense proposal to help mitigate the \ngrowing global dependence on oil supplies from volatile regions. The \nUnited States encourage the transfer of our own clean energy \ntechnologies to other nations, especially developing countries who will \nincreasingly be buying into the same finite oil markets that we are \npurchasing from. Such efforts are critical in order to satisfy our \nenergy security needs as well as to address related economic, job \ncreation, trade, and environmental objectives. The demand for oil from \nother countries will be increasingly fierce, and we have only a narrow \nwindow of opportunity ahead. Last year, the administration, at my \nurging, released a plan for just such an initiative intended to help \nopen international markets and export U.S. clean energy technologies. \nHowever, little, if anything, has been done to implement it. Where have \nwe seen this strategy before? The answer is, we have seen it virtually \neverywhere with this administration--from homeland security to No Child \nLeft Behind.\n\n  Furthermore, the administration's Fiscal Year 2004 budget confirms \nsome of my worst fears. When it comes to domestic issues, the plan of \nadministration officials these days is about outsourcing, downsizing, \nreorganizing, reducing, cutting, slashing, slicing, dicing, and carving \nup the Federal Government. It is a tailor-made infomercial for the \nbenefit of all-too-receptive corporate donors.\n  The administration's energy budget is a sham, and its energy program \nrequests are no different. The Department of Energy cut $20 million for \nthe Clean Coal Power Initiative. The Department of Energy's oil and gas \nresearch program was cut by more than 50 percent. In order to squeeze \nenough dollars out of the budget for the President's new hydrogen \ninitiative, other critical energy programs were severely cut. Yet the \nadministration's hydrogen program is years away and cannot serve as a \nsubstitute for conservation, energy diversification, or other key \nenergy programs. Moreover, a proliferation of ``new'' initiatives have \nbeen announced by this administration that are purported to solve our \nenergy needs, especially for fossil fuels. We have the hydrogen \ninitiative, a carbon sequester program, FutureGen, a national climate \nchange technology initiative, and more. My question is: Can anyone \nexplain how these ``new'' initiatives will work together? Where is the \nmoney to provide for all of this without compromising other important \nefforts? The fact remains that there is no major increase in real \nfunding or commitment for energy programs, just a proliferation of \nempty words from this administration. I do not believe we can treat our \nenergy illnesses with the administration's current budget prescription.\n  In the 107th Congress, both the House and Senate actually passed \ncomprehensive energy policy bills. After lengthy\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\ndebate in conference, important progress was made. A number of \ncompromises were struck, but in the end the conferees could not reach a \nfinal agreement. This should come as no surprise.\n  In fact, this administration made no real effort to help get a \ncomprehensive, national energy strategy passed. President Bush \nsuggested that energy was a cornerstone of his administration's agenda, \nbut what did he do during the energy conference in the 107th Congress? \nNothing. Oh, his rhetoric may have sounded good on the campaign trail. \nHe tried to talk a good game, but when it counted, the administration \ntook a decidedly hands off approach.\n  This new Senate Energy bill, S. 14, the House Energy bill, H.R. 6, \nand the White House's interest overall are intended to cater to the \nadministration's friends in industry. That is it. That is all. In its \npresent form, these energy bills are no victory for our country. They \nare a victory for special interests and a text-book example of our \ninability to set a long-term energy policy course. Now, we are on the \nbrink of another important opportunity squandered. While there are some \nsolid trees planted in the bill, this legislation will not produce the \ndiverse energy orchard we must have to meet our needs down the road. \nThe President and the Republican-controlled Congress are simply not \nprepared to make the tough choices that the Nation needs for a viable, \nlong-term energy policy. How long will we wait?\n  The President would love a one-day Rose Garden ceremony and a 2004 \ncampaign press release. But, given this administration's track record, \nan energy bill would simply be another empty soapbox for this President \nto stand on, as he has already demonstrated with the education soapbox, \nthe farm legislation soapbox, Afghanistan soapbox, and the Homeland \nSecurity soapbox, and other soapboxes. The Congress has passed bills \nand supported the administration's rhetoric, but then the necessary \nresources to carry them out never materialize. This is the same fate \nthat awaits an energy bill this session.\n  It takes leadership and it takes hard work to move forward in a \nresponsible, balanced, and intelligent way on energy policy. Yet this \nadministration makes do with a cheap knockoff. It looks like the real \nthing, but it is a fraud and a fake. It is much like cotton candy. At \nfirst glance, it may look good, but there is just no nutrition. In \nreality, it is just puffed air.\n  In the last 5 years, I have worked hard to help develop a balanced \nand bipartisan package of provisions to advance our national energy \npolicy goals--provisions that could go a long way toward addressing \nboth the near- and long-term energy needs of our Nation, while also \nproviding numerous benefits both at home and abroad. These provisions \ngarnered bipartisan support in the Senate Energy bill in the 107th \nCongress, including clean coal, climate change, international \ntechnology transfer, and other important provisions. Together, these \ninitiatives represent a bold new enterprise--stepping stones along a \n21st century energy pathway.\n  Yet the administration seems intent on just blocking many of these \nbipartisan ideas. For example, in a May 8, 2003, statement on the \nSenate Energy bill, the White House stated, in part:\n\n       The Administration is not convinced of the need for \n     additional legislation that would attempt to limit or direct \n     U.S. global climate change, and will oppose any climate \n     change amendments that are inconsistent with the President's \n     climate change strategy . . . we urge the Senate to allow . . \n     . the President's strategy to go forward unimpeded.\n\n  Well, I continue to ask, just what is the President's strategy--\ncotton candy?\n  Last session I introduced legislation with Senator Ted Stevens of \nAlaska that would allow the United States to deal more easily with the \ncomplex issues involved in climate change. The amendment to be offered \nby Senator Bingaman is based on last year's Senate-passed provisions. \nIt would create a comprehensive strategy based on credible science and \neconomics to guide American efforts to address climate change issues in \nour own backyard and around the world. This amendment also would \nestablish a major research effort to invent the advanced technologies \nthat we will need to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions that \ncontribute to global warming. We must develop a commonsense package of \ntechnology, science, policy and other market-based measures to address \nthis growing global problem. And it is growing. The question is what \nare we waiting for?\n  Specifically, the Bingaman amendment includes provisions that would \ncommit more than $4 billion during the next decade to vastly expand \nU.S. research into technology that could help to address the problem of \nglobal climate change. The amendment provides for the creation of a \nmore focused administrative structure within the Federal Government, \nincluding an office in the White House to coordinate and implement a \nnational climate change strategy. We cannot continue to just ignore \nthis problem.\n  This amendment does not mandate a reduction of emissions by American \ncompanies. Instead, this package places the Nation on a commonsense \nglidepath that is both achievable and sustainable. It provides the \nframework to address the long-term goal of stabilizing atmospheric \ngreenhouse gas concentrations by working with other nations, while \nleaving the actual technology and policy decisions to energy experts \nand the marketplace.\n  China, Brazil, and India, among other states, will soon surpass the \nindustrialized world in emissions of greenhouse gases. It is important \nthat we work in coordination with these nations to reduce their \nemissions at an early stage. American know-how, technology, and ideas \ncan help to lead to the implementation of a range of marketable clean \nenergy technologies, not just in the United States, but also around the \nworld.\n  It is time for real action. A cherry-picked energy plan based on \nsoliciting big industry campaign contributions is a bankrupt policy. It \ntakes this Nation nowhere, and it puts our future at risk.\n  We cannot continue energy programs and budgets if we ever hope to \nmeet our long-term needs. We cannot continue forestalling the \ndevelopment of a long-term energy strategy with a phantom plan. The \nNation is at a turning point. Our energy policy needs must stop being \ndominated by a crisis management policy. We must work to enact \nappropriate energy legislation so that we avoid the consequences of our \nlong failure to respond. We cannot wait for the next energy crisis or \nthe next spike in natural gas prices--or the next California \nelectricity debacle. We cannot just go out and seize another oil rich \ncountry in order to solve our energy problems. We must enact bipartisan \nenergy legislation that will deliver a thoughtful and reasoned energy \npackage.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I hope we are moving toward the \nopportunity to vote shortly. But, in the meantime, I cannot resist \nmaking a few comments.\n  I don't see it at all the way the Senator from West Virginia has \ndescribed it. Over the last couple of years, I have worked very hard to \nbring an Energy bill before the Senate. I believe we have an Energy \nbill before us that is very broad, that is very encompassing, and that \nis very balanced. That is what we have needed to do.\n  We have been working now for 2\\1/2\\ years, and we generally have not \nbeen able to get over the obstacles to be able to get it completed, and \nI think I understand why. But it is time for us to decide: How \nimportant is it for us to have an energy policy?\n  The first thing this administration came up with when it came into \noffice was an energy policy with a direction, and we have been fooling \naround with it ever since.\n  Last year, we couldn't even get it through the committee. We had to \ngo right to the floor. We went to the conference committee and worked \nvery hard. We did not succeed.\n  But this is a balanced approach. We are talking about an opportunity \nto have conservation, which is one of the things we need to do in \nenergy. We are talking about the opportunity to have alternative \nsources of energy, which we will come to over a period of time.\n  I remember very much a number of years ago somebody coming to Casper, \nWY, talking about energy, saying: We have never run out of energy \nbecause we have always found a new source.\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\nWell, we probably will, but we need to be doing that in research.\n  The bill involves research in a variety of different areas that \nrelate to energy. What else could you do besides research? There is a \nvery great emphasis on hydrogen in this administration and doing \nsomething that will move us to a different kind of energy opportunity. \nCoal might be the basis for that opportunity. It would be much more \neconomical to move.\n  Lots can happen in the future. What we are faced with doing in this \nbill relates to the fact that the energy industry has moved faster than \nwe have moved. This is not a matter entirely of setting a future; it is \na matter of catching up with what has already been done. And much of \nthat is evidenced in the electrical industry.\n  Years ago everything we did was designed to have an energy company \nand an electric company that had their own distribution. They did their \nown generating. It was all in one area. That is not the case anymore. \nThirty percent of electrical energy is generated by merchant \ngenerators. That energy has to be moved from the generator to the \nmarket. It is quite a different situation. It is already there, yet we \nseem to resist talking about it. We seem to resist accepting it. We \nseem to resist making that an advantage for us rather than a problem, \nand we have an opportunity to do that.\n\n  One of the other issues that is emphasized is domestic production, of \ncourse. It has already been pointed out that some 60 percent of oil \ncomes from overseas. We are talking about the possibility of shortages \nof natural gas. I can tell you something: We have a lot of natural gas \nright here in this country, much of it in the west where I am from. We \ncould be producing a great deal more if we had the policy to go ahead \nand do that, if we had the opportunity to have multiple use of lands to \nprotect the environment and produce at the same time, to be able to \nhave the transportation to move it to the market. These are the things \nthat are there and available. That is what this bill is about.\n  To suggest that this bill does not have any substance to it is simply \nnot right. It is a good excuse if you don't want to vote for it. But \nthe fact is, there is substance. The fact is, it does move us forward. \nThe fact is, we need to move it on.\n  We are talking now about an electric title, which I think is crucial. \nWe were just upstairs talking about what energy does for jobs. Remember \nthe economy started to turn down in the year 2000. We have been working \nat all kinds of things ever since. Here is one that has probably more \nof an immediate impact to jobs than anything else we could do, not only \nin production but, of course, it has an impact on all business \nactivities.\n  How important is electricity to us? Everything we do--travel, \ngasoline, natural gas, all these things. So I guess it is sort of \nfrustrating to hear there is no basis to this, that we don't need to \nhurry doing this. Yet the fact is, it is probably one of the most \nneeded things we have had for a number of years. And yet we continue to \nfind excuses for not going forward.\n  I hope we can move. We can complete this bill this week. We have \nalready discussed almost all these items for a long time. It is time to \nmove, and I hope we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I commend Senators Cantwell and Bingaman \nfor their amendments to the electricity title that will, in effect, ban \nall forms of market manipulation and add important merger provisions. I \nam terribly disappointed that the Cantwell amendment failed by a vote \nof 48 to 50. She did an extremely fine job of laying out this program. \nI am sorry it didn't pass. It should have. I think there will be some \nSenators who voted against her amendment who will regret having done \nso.\n  We know that the energy crisis in California in 2001 resulted from \nmarket manipulation and price fixing. People of the State of Nevada \nwere severely hurt by this manipulated electricity market, as were \nconsumers all over Western States.\n  The State of Nevada has just completed the most contentious \nlegislative session in the history of the State. The Governor of the \nState, after the regular session ended, had to continually call special \nsessions. I don't really know how many he called--two, three, four, \nfive--but they were there for a long time. Finally, because nothing \ncould be completed, the Governor filed a legal action with the Nevada \nSupreme Court. After the Supreme Court acted, action was taken. The \nprovision in question that went before the supreme court is whether the \nNevada Legislature had to pass tax increases by a two-thirds vote. The \nNevada Supreme Court said no and they said yes, but regardless of that, \nI spoke to the majority leader from Nevada, Bill Raggio, today. He said \nhe made the determination that it was going to pass by two-thirds, and \nboth the assembly and the house ultimately did that.\n  The reason I mention the difficulty they had is because of the \ntremendous burden the State of Nevada had in not having enough revenues \nto meet the projected deficit, $1 billion in the State of Nevada, much \nof which was caused by the problems that developed in California with \nmanipulating the energy prices there.\n  The State of Nevada had other problems: unfunded mandates that we \nhave passed on to them with homeland security and Leave No Child \nBehind, which has left a lot of kids behind. The fact is, the \nelectricity rates had a lot to do with that very difficult legislative \nsession. That session took a long, long time to complete. Since 1999, \nelectricity rates in the Las Vegas area have increased by more than 60 \npercent. Over the same period, natural gas prices across Nevada have \ndoubled. It is a sad state of affairs that some seniors, especially, \nand low-income families in Nevada are being forced to go without \nprescription drugs or cut back on food in order to pay their \nelectricity rates. That is a fact.\n  The bills that come from these increased electricity rates are a real \nburden, as the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, mentioned today. \nShe read specific letters from people in the State of Washington where \nthese prices were preventing them from getting proper medical care and \nhaving the ability to pay their rent. The same applies, of course, in \nNevada.\n  These wild price increases in electricity were painful to homeowners. \nThey also made it hard for businesses to expand or make long-term \nplans. Nevada consumers were being asked to pay for the same very \nexpensive long-term contracts negotiated by utilities in 2001 at the \ntime of the California energy crisis. It cost Nevada ratepayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n  Nevada Power, the power company that serves the Las Vegas area and \nsouthern Nevada, has flirted with bankruptcy. It is rated at junk bond \nstatus where in the past it was one of the strongest utilities in \nAmerica. What does this junk bond status mean? It means the cost of \nmoney for the utility to purchase power for Nevada is very high.\n  The weakened financial condition of our utility is a burden to our \nratepayers. I can remember during some of this time that I had to call \nthe Governor of California to see if there could be some arrangement \nmade so the power that the people of the State needed coming from \nCalifornia could be provided. I had to have a signoff from the Governor \nof California. This was difficult. They were in deep distress but their \ndistress was passed on to Nevada.\n  The weakened financial condition of our utility is a burden to our \nratepayers and the taxpayers of the State of Nevada. After Enron was \nexposed for its unfair and unethical practices, whether it was Fat Boy \nor Get Shorty, all these practices had an impact in Nevada. After these \nunfair practices were exposed, a subsidiary of Enron stopped delivering \nelectricity to Nevada Power because of its weakened financial \ncondition. Then adding insult to injury, this Enron subsidy sued Nevada \nPower for the losses it might incur if it couldn't sell the power at \nthe contract price.\n  In a recent ruling, FERC upheld the contract the utility signed at \nthese exorbitantly high prices. Again, our ratepayers were not \nprotected from abuses during the California energy crisis. It is not \nconsistent with rational thought that FERC could do this but they did \nit.\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\n  As the western energy crisis and Enron's collapse made clear, \nelectricity markets are ripe for manipulation unless clear safeguards \nare put in place and companies are held accountable. The electricity \ntitle should ban all forms of market manipulation and contain concrete \npenalties for those that break the rules. The electricity title should \nstrengthen FERC's authority to review public utility mergers for \nelectric and gas--there will be an amendment that will focus just on \ngas in this regard--holding company mergers and generation assets, and \nensure any consolidations are in the public interest.\n  I extend the appreciation of the entire Democratic caucus for the \nwork done by the manager on our side, Senator Bingaman. Senator \nBingaman is an intelligent Senator. He is experienced. He has done \neverything he can to help this bill be a bill that is a good bill which \nis indicated by the tremendous amendments he has filed that we will \nvote on in the next few hours.\n  Last year Democrats worked with Republicans to pass energy \nlegislation by a vote of 88 to 11. This vote was to strengthen our \nnational energy security, safeguard consumers and taxpayers, and \nprotect the environment. The heavy vote is an indication that we were \nable to accomplish that.\n  That vote came after 24 hours of debate over the course of 8 weeks, \nand only after the Senate dispensed with 144 amendments.\n  Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, the \nmajority leader, has said we have been on this for 16 days. He has to \nsay that with tongue in cheek. Many of those days have been Fridays and \nMondays, when everyone knows when you turn to a bill for a day or two \nand it is a Friday or Monday, that is like turning to nothing. It is \nfiller. Nothing happens. Most of those days the managers weren't even \nhere. They said we are going to energy on short notice. The 16 days the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee talked about really is more like 7 \nor 8 days.\n  As we know from past experience, the effort to craft comprehensive \nenergy policy involves working through a series of complex issues. We \nare currently working through one of the most complex issues right now, \nelectricity policy. These issues take time to debate, and we have a \nduty to the American consumer to ensure that we carefully consider what \nour energy policy will look like in the future. We have spent \nsignificantly less time debating the Energy bill this year. We have \nconsidered 42 amendments and held 15 rollcall votes. We have spent less \nthan 7 days on this bill, considered 102 less amendments, and conducted \n20 less rollcall votes than last year. There are a number of issues \noutstanding: Electricity; global warming; renewable portfolio standard; \nCAFE standards, on which we have debated two amendments but others need \nto be considered; hydroelectric dam relicensing; nuclear energy; \nnatural gas; energy efficiency incentives; wind energy; carbon \nsequestration; exploration of the Outer Continental Shelf, and the \nenergy tax package, just to name a few.\n  These amendments offered on this Energy bill dealing with electricity \nare not specious amendments, they are substantive amendments. The \nCantwell amendment vote was 48 to 50. Without arm-twisting on the other \nside, Senator Cantwell would have won. These are serious amendments \npeople wish to offer. They are not single amendment issues. I expect \nthere will be several amendments on each subject. We ended with a good \nproduct last year when we let the Senate work its will on the \nlegislation. We need to spend adequate time this year to get a similar \nresult.\n  I see the Senator from Florida on the floor. My understanding is that \nhe wishes to speak.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I wonder if it would be possible to propound this \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator has been here all day. It is \nmy understanding that the Senator wishes to speak; is that right?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes, for perhaps only 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I thought the Senator had longer to speak.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will accommodate the leadership. Whatever is \nthe pleasure of the leadership.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the Senator has no right to decide who \nspeaks. They have to seek recognition.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I have said several times during the \nday, and yesterday and the day before, I have the greatest respect for \nthe Senator from New Mexico. But the Senator from Florida, who is \ngracious and said he would take just a few minutes, has a right to \nspeak as long as he wants to before we have votes on this.\n  Mr. THOMAS. The Senator from Wyoming was on the floor before he was, \nhowever.\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator cannot dole out the time. He has no right \nto dole the time out to other Senators, Madam President.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have the floor, and I have the right to \nspeak about anything I want to speak about. The fact is, the Senator \nfrom Florida has been here several times today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President----\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor, Madam President. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Florida has been here several times during \nthe day. He has a right, prior to our entering into this unanimous \nconsent agreement, to speak for as long as he wants. He said he chooses \nnot to do that, and that is in keeping with the courtesy that this \njunior Senator from Florida extends to everybody. I want to make sure \nhe doesn't have hurt feelings and that he has the opportunity to speak. \nHe knows the rules of the Senate and he has a right to speak if he \nwishes.\n  Having said that, I am willing now to have this unanimous consent \nagreement proffered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe the following debate in relation to the listed amendments: Bingaman \nNo. 1413, 10 minutes equally divided in the usual form; Bingaman No. \n1418, 10 minutes equally divided in the usual form. I further ask \nconsent that following the debate, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 1413, to be followed by a vote on amendment \nNo. 1418, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Feingold-\nBrownback amendment No. 1416, provided there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask if my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, would modify his \nunanimous consent request to allow the Senator from Florida, prior to \nthis kicking in, to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, not wishing to object, I just indicate \nthat I did not intend to ask for 10 minutes of debate on each of my two \namendments, and then in addition ask for 2 minutes equally divided. I \njust intended to have some time to refresh people's memories of what \nthe two amendments were, since they were proposed and debated \nyesterday.\n  As far as I am concerned, once I have had a chance to describe my \namendment, and there has been any discussion in opposition, we can vote \non the first of the Bingaman amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Senator to further modify the \nrequest to eliminate the 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote.\n  Mr. THOMAS. That will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The statement of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, is printed in \nthe Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1413\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, as I understand it, I now have 5 \nminutes to describe the first of the two amendments I have offered to \nthe electricity title of the bill.\n  Let me make the obvious point at the beginning of my description, and \nthat is that the amendment tries to do two basic things. It proposes \nlanguage which would ensure that someone at the Federal level--in this \ncase, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--has jurisdiction to \nreview purchase and sale of generation companies\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\nand generation assets, the companies that actually produce the \nelectricity about which we are talking and which we have all come to \nexpect to get when we turn on the switch and see the room light up.\n  We ought to have someone with authority over that because under the \nDomenici substitute as it now is, nobody has authority at the Federal \nlevel. It is not realistic to suggest the States can handle that \nproblem. They cannot. There is no prohibition in law, and there will be \nnone under this proposal, to one company acquiring all the generation \nin one particular region or one company acquiring all the generation in \none part of the country. We should have someone reviewing the \nacquisitions of that generation capacity to be sure that ratepayers are \nlooked out after. That is the first thing the amendment does.\n  The second thing the amendment does is to prohibit cross-subsidy \nbetween utility companies and affiliated companies that may be in the \nsame general holding company. We are eliminating the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, so there is going to be no restriction as provided \nunder that act. We need to be sure that cross-subsidy does not occur.\n  I have an article dated December 26 of last year in the Wall Street \nJournal which does a very good job of pointing out the problem that \nneeds to be fixed. It says:\n\n       Energy companies burned by disastrous forays into \n     commodities trading and other unregulated businesses are \n     increasingly seeking to pass some of the financial burden on \n     to their utility units. This could lead to higher electricity \n     rates for consumers in coming years.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       Utilities are being nudged to buy assets from affiliates to \n     make loans to down-at-the-heels siblings or pass more money \n     to their parent companies.\n\n  The article goes through a series of examples of how this is \nhappening.\n  One example I thought was particularly constructive was Duke Energy. \nIn July of 2001, a Duke accountant contacted regulators complaining \nthat expenses generated by unregulated parts of the company were being \ntransferred to the books of Duke's utilities.\n  We need a capability at the Federal level to protect the ratepayers \nand to ensure that does not happen. We do not have that in the \nunderlying Domenici substitute. The underlying substitute does say that \nthe Commission shall look out to be sure the public interest is served, \nand that is useful. That, unfortunately, is very general.\n  What we need in the law, I firmly believe, is a bright line \nrequirement that in order for these kinds of acquisitions and sales to \noccur and to be approved, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nought to determine that there is not going to be a cross-subsidy as a \nresult, that utilities will not be loaded down with debt from \nnonutility companies held by the same company. We need to keep the \nprotection in the bill.\n\n  Utilities are a different kind of business. It is important that the \nlights turn on when we flick a switch. It is important that other \nutilities function. In this case, in this electricity title, we need to \nbe sure that ratepayers are adequately protected.\n  I am persuaded that this amendment will strengthen the bill. I hope \nvery much my colleagues will support it. It is exactly the same \nlanguage we had in the bill last year, and last year there was an \neffort to delete the language which I am offering as a second-degree \namendment, and that effort lost in a vote of 67 to 29. So a majority of \nthe Senate is on record supporting the language I have proposed as an \namendment to the underlying Domenici substitute. I hope Members will \nsupport the amendment. It will strengthen the electricity title. I very \nmuch believe it is good public policy and will serve us well in the \nyears ahead when some of these problems recur, as I fear they will.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wish to make a point in case there \nare people observing the Senate. Senator Nelson from Florida indicated \nhe had been waiting a long time--maybe all day--to be heard. There are \na lot of Senators all day long who would like to come to the floor and \nbe heard. The Senate is not the place where we just come down to the \nfloor and automatically, if we come here, we ought to be heard. We have \nbusiness, and we have rules. I am glad the Senator found time and we \nallowed 5 minutes and we allowed Senator Byrd 30 minutes, but we are \nengaged in a bill we are trying to pass.\n  I had a lengthy discussion with my friend from Nevada, and I have no \ndoubt he wants to get this bill finished. I thank him for his \nwillingness to move along. We will have another amendment ready pretty \nsoon.\n\n  My objection to the Bingaman amendment is very simple. He alludes to \nlast year and what happened with amendments such as his last year. \nThere was no alternative last year. There is an alternative this year. \nIt is the underlying electricity bill, which clearly protects the \ncitizens, the users, and all of those concerns about mergers.\n  The merger review in our section is supported by groups such as the \nNational Rural Co-ops, the rural power people, and many others. If, in \nfact, we did not have protection in this area with reference to \ngobbling by merger, obviously they would not be for this underlying \nbill. So I oppose this amendment because we do not have to expand \nFERC's merger authority. They have merger authority.\n  Under current law, electric merger departments are heavily regulated. \nFERC, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission must \nreview proposed mergers for their impact on competition. States also \nreview proposed mergers. Expanding FERC's authority to cover the \nacquisition of generation facilities is unnecessary. We have plenty of \nmerger authority if that is what we are worried about. We are getting \nrid of undue regulation. There is no need to impose more.\n  Further, changing FERC's review standards will impede efficient \ntransactions, and we do not need that today, either.\n  So while I have great respect and admiration for my friend, I believe \nthe electricity bill that is pending before us, which has been \ncarefully put together, has broad support all based on the fact that it \nfits all the pieces together properly. It should be left alone. We do \nnot have to add more merger review layers.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, my understanding is that at this \npoint, under the unanimous consent agreement, I am allotted 5 minutes \nto talk about my second amendment. Is that accurate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1418\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I will describe this second Bingaman \namendment which was offered last evening. It was offered at a time when \nvery few Senators or their staffs were in their offices and were not \nfollowing this issue, I am afraid. The amendment tries to clarify a \npoint in the bill that I think is very important.\n  Senator Domenici's substitute contains a delay in the issuance of \nFERC's standard market design rulemaking and it delays it until July of \n2005, and that is not of concern. I accept that. Many believe the rule \ngoes too far, should be dramatically modified, changed or completely \nabrogated, but others think we should go ahead right away. He has \ndecided to put it off until July of 2005. So I am not involved in that \nin my amendment.\n  My amendment leaves the delay of the standard market design rule in \nplace so it will still be delayed until July of 2005. However, in an \neffort to prevent FERC from renaming its rule, I believe that was the \npurpose that Senator Domenici and his staff had in an effort to keep \nFERC from renaming its rule and issuing that same rule, or something \nvery close to it, under a different title, the bill would prohibit any \nrule or order of general applicability on matters within the scope of \nthe rule. I think the clear meaning of that\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\nlanguage is that FERC could not issue a rule or order a general \napplicability on any issue that is dealt with in the proposed standard \nmarket design for 2 years from now.\n  Standard market design covers a world of issues. One example, FERC \ncurrently has a rule in process related to interconnections to the \ntransmission grid. No matter what that rule said, FERC would be \nprohibited from issuing that rule, as I read this language. I do not \nthink that was the intent of my colleague from New Mexico or others who \nworked on this bill.\n  There are even rules that the Commission is required to issue by \nprovisions in the bill. We have various provisions in other parts of \nthis bill that say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall issue \nan order on this issue, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall \nissue an order on this subject. The bill requires rules on mergers, on \ntransmission access by public power entities, on participant funding, \nand on other matters.\n  We are in the ironic position of having this one provision which says \nan order cannot be issued, a general applicability, on any subject that \nis covered by standard marketing design and at the same time we are \nsaying you have to go ahead and issue orders of general applicability \nin these other areas.\n  So I am trying to get that clarified. I do not believe we are in \ndisagreement on the substance but I do think it is important that we \nprovide clear language or else we will be shooting ourselves in the \nfoot.\n  The amendment I am offering says we would not want FERC issuing any \nfinal rule or order of general applicability establishing a standard \nmarket design. I think that is what we are trying to do. That is all my \namendment does is to clarify that is what we are trying to do. I hope \neverybody will support it. I think it will make very clear that FERC \nwill be able to go ahead and do the work that it is required to do in \nthe next couple of years, between now and July of 2005. If we have \nanother crisis such as we have had out in California or out in the west \ncoast, we are going to be expecting FERC to issue orders of general \napplicability. They should be doing that. They should not be issuing a \nstandard market design, and I am not suggesting they should, but they \nshould have the authority to issue orders of general applicability and \nthat is exactly what my amendment would give them.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will support the amendment and we can \nimprove the bill by doing so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, one of the most difficult negotiations \nin this bill was getting the language that prohibited the finalization \nof SMDs until July 1, 2005. The occupant of the chair knows that. That \nis what we have been talking about. Other Senators wanted a longer \ntime. Some wanted a shorter time. Well, Senator Bingaman changes the \nlanguage surrounding that July 2005 agreement. Frankly, I would be \nletting down all of those different groups that worked together to \nnegotiate the language that said the finalization of SMDs will be \ndelayed until July 1, 2005; by changing the words around it, all kinds \nof groups will be saying we have let them down; we changed what we \nagreed to.\n  In other words, I regret to say that the exact words surrounding this \n2005 letter expansion are binding. Senator Bingaman wants to clarify it \none way. There will be a whole group of people who worked on it saying, \nwell, I did not want it clarified that way. I wanted it clarified \nanother way.\n  The point is, it will work like it is. It might work like he wants it \nto work but the problem is we agreed to these words. Believe me, I am \nnot agreeing to words just for words. They will work. It is just that \nthe distinguished Senator would like to be more precise, more specific, \nhis way. In doing that, he puts this Senator, who has worked this out \nwith all of these other people, in a bind that if I say, yes, let's \nchange it, then we are going to have telephone calls besieging Senators \nall over saying vote no; the senior Senator from New Mexico is not \ndoing what he told us he would do.\n  Now, I regret that but that is just the result of the way we do \nthings. I am very proud of the words, the date, and the negotiation. I \ndo not lose a lot of Senators on that language and that date. Maybe six \nor eight wanted more time but we got a pretty good deal for almost \neverybody. So I just cannot take the risk. I am sorry.\n  With that, I do not need any more time. I yield back any time I have \nremaining.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1413\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the first Bingaman amendment, which is \nthe pending subject matter, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wonder if the minority whip will \nadvise me--we are on the electricity title--are we ready to vote on \npassage of the electricity title or do you have additional amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I indicated last night, we have Senator \nDayton who still wishes to offer amendments. Senator Cantwell has at \nleast two more amendments. Senator Feinstein has an amendment. Those \nare the ones I know of at this time. And Senator Boxer has an \namendment. Senator Cantwell is here. She has a very important amendment \nto offer.\n  I relate to my distinguished friend, the manager of this bill, that \nSenator Kennedy is here and wishes to speak also. We are in a position \nwhere we are ready to move forward on the electricity title with a \nnumber of amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does Senator Kennedy have an amendment?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Mexico will have to ask Senator \nKennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. It has been the decision of the leadership to have a \nvote on Judge Pryor tomorrow. Under the agreement, we will have 1 hour \nfor debate. This is an important nomination. I wish to address the \nSenate on that matter since we are going to be under very strict time \nlimitations on the morrow.\n  We had that series of votes. I want to accommodate the managers of \nthe bill. If there is an amendment that needs to be disposed of, I will \nbe glad to wait; otherwise, at some point, I wish to address the Senate \nbecause this is an extremely important nominee. The nomination was just \nreported out of committee, and we will be voting in a very short period \nof time on the nominee. It is an extremely important nomination. If the \ndecision was to not have that vote on the morrow, I am glad to withhold \nmy statement and make my statement at the time the Senate addresses the \nnomination. I will certainly work with the floor managers to work out a \ntime that is suitable, but I am ready to speak. If there is a pending \namendment, and it is the desire of the floor manager to move ahead, I \nwill accommodate him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, I will speak to the majority leader, as soon as an \namendment is laid down, with reference to the issue Senator Kennedy \njust raised. I understand if we proceed on an amendment, we will have \nan hour or so, at which time I will talk with the majority leader and \ntell him of your desire and others to speak, and see what his wishes \nare in that regard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There are others who wish to speak in addition to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will mention the Senator's name.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, earlier today I alerted the Senate that we \nwould have members of the Judiciary Committee come to the floor, and we \nhave members of the Judiciary Committee here today. We have the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, who is a three-decade member of that committee. We \nhave Senator Schumer, who is a relatively new member of that committee. \nSometime tonight they are going to speak on the Pryor nomination. I \nindicated that would happen, and that is going to happen. They have an \nabsolute right to speak. I know the Senator from Massachusetts is being \nkind and generous, but he has a right to speak. It can either be done \nnow or 5 minutes from now or 10 minutes from now, but the Senator from \nMassachusetts is going to get the floor, and he is going to speak on \nthe Pryor nomination, as I alerted the Senate today that would happen.\n  We did not make the choice that we would vote for the seventh time on \nEstrada today. The votes have not changed. We did not make the decision\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\nwe would vote on Priscilla Owen. We have voted three times, and the \nvotes have not changed. We did not make the decision that the Pryor \nnomination would be voted on without a single bit of debate on the \nSenate floor, but just move it forward for cloture. This is not as if \nit is a surprise.\n  We telegraphed our intentions today that there would be members of \nthe Judiciary Committee who would come to the Chamber and speak, and \nthat is going to happen tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I cannot do anything more than that, \nand I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts accepts my \nstatement as an honest statement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will leave the floor. I will find the leader, and I \nwill tell him what is going to happen. I will seek his advice and give \nhim my advice. I very much appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts \nletting me know. We have a number of amendments left. We have important \nlegislation before us. It is absolutely impossible to do the people's \nbusiness if, in fact, during the next 12 hours we have 6 or 8 hours \ntaken up by speeches with reference to a judge. We will get it done, \nbut we will be here Sunday, which is all right with this Senator. I do \nnot think I want to let that happen under my watch as manager, but I \nguarantee my colleagues, for those who insist they are going to speak, \nI can assure them we are going to be here.\n  Sooner or later the speeches will run out, and we will be here, and \nwe will take up the pending amendments on this bill. I have been told \nthat by the leader unequivocally. I assume that is true if only 60 \nSenators stick around. So long as we do not lose a quorum, I presume we \nare going to be here on Friday, on Saturday, and on Monday to finish \nthis bill. Senators have their rights, but we have an obligation to do \nthis work.\n\n  I say to the distinguished whip, if he will call up the next \namendment, I will leave the floor and find out what the leader will do \nabout this, and perhaps we can come up with some accommodation with \nreference to this issue. I thank Senator Kennedy for his willingness to \nlet me do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will proceed then. I just wish to \nindicate, as someone who also has been a bill manager, I understand \ncompletely the frustration the Senator from New Mexico has and his \ndesire to move along. As Senator Reid mentioned, we did not anticipate \nat the time this nominee was reported out that we would have a vote so \nearly in the consideration.\n  Then last week, the chairman of the committee made a very extensive \nstatement about the nominee and also the procedures of the committee \nitself, and I want to attempt to correct that record.\n  We are on the eve of a vote on the nominee, and that has been \nestablished by not the Senator from New Mexico but by the majority \nleader. We are just trying to meet our responsibilities as members of \nthat committee who have strong views and want to share those views with \nthe membership and we also feel a responsibility to tell, to the extent \nthe American people are interested, what our reservations are in terms \nof the merits and the process.\n  I say to the Senator from New Mexico, I plan to be here this evening, \nand if it is the desire of the floor managers to consider another \namendment, I am glad to take my turn, although I do think we ought to \nhave at least an opportunity to speak in the next few hours.\n  I will begin my statement on this nominee. If it so works out and the \nSenator from New Mexico wants to intercede, I will be glad to try to \naccommodate him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long does the Senator intend to speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I expect to talk probably 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from New Mexico have the floor or the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would rather not get caught into a precise time limit \nat this time but my general sense is about 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield? I will get right back to him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me repeat----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think I have the floor but I will \nyield to the Senator from New Mexico for whatever comment he wants to \nmake.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for a couple of minutes, and it will not take any \nlonger.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. First, I say judges are important, \nand speaking on behalf of or against judges is very important. I say \nthat not only to the Senators but to our majority leader. It is also \nvery important that we pass an Energy bill. We have been waiting for \nweeks and weeks. This committee was asked to put a bill together. The \nSenator from New Mexico wants to get the Energy bill finished. Clearly, \nI find nothing in the rules that says the Senator from Massachusetts is \nnot entitled to make his speech of 30 minutes or up to an hour. I do \nbelieve it is important, nonetheless, that somewhere along the line \nthere be some accommodation and that we proceed to get the Energy bill \nfinished. I understand there are four or five amendments. I wish I \ncould see them sooner or later so I will know what they are about but \nnobody owes me that, either. We will take it as it comes.\n  I will ask the distinguished majority leader to be accommodating so \nwe can get this bill finished, but I am doing that with great \ntrepidation, not as to Senator Kennedy but as to whether there is a \nwillingness to pursue this bill with vigor if that accommodation is \nmade. I am not sure about that based on some things that have been \nhappening but I hope it is. It is with that in mind that I will talk to \nthe leader, hoping it does mean that if accommodation is made, we will \nproceed with dispatch on the Energy bill.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have been listening to this discussion. Am I correct \nin saying that the Senator would not be seeking to speak now if the \nother side had not indicated that they were intending to try to bring \nthe nomination of Mr. Pryor to the Senate on tomorrow? Is that right?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is not inserting himself into the debate on \nthe Energy bill seeking to slow the Energy bill down; he is prompted to \ndo this by the fact that the other side is scheduling this nominee for \na vote, I understand, with no debate whatsoever. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, that is correct. It is not the members of the \nJudiciary Committee who are holding up the consideration of the Energy \nbill. It is the decision to put before the Senate, under the legitimate \nprocedures of the Senate, a cloture petition to have a vote on this \nnominee, effectively shutting off all the debate.\n  Quite clearly, my own belief is if we had the time, and also had the \ntime during the August recess, to complete the investigation which \nneeds to be done on this nominee, the Senate would be much better \ninformed, the American people would be much better informed, and the \njudiciary would be much better served. That is not the decision of the \nleadership and, therefore, we believed that as the day wore on, after \n5, we would at least have an opportunity, since this is an enormously \nserious nominee for a very serious position and there are very serious \ncharges, to address the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that twice this week, if I am \nnot mistaken, we have had to go off of the Energy bill, which we are \nbeing told we must move forward, in order to\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\naddress other judgeship nominees who had previously been voted on a \nnumber of times. So we have been diverted off the track of the Energy \nbill by these judicial nominees, not of our doing but because of the \nscheduling which the other side has undertaken.\n  I know our assistant leader has been concerned about that as well, if \nI am not mistaken, in that regard. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. As the Senator remembers, I \nthink those votes were in the late morning and even interrupted \ncommittee work at that time, which many of us were involved in, let \nalone the consideration of the Energy bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10218-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10218-S10251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, contrary to the widespread impression of \na partisan breakdown in the judicial nomination process, Democrats in \nthis closely divided Senate have, in fact, tried our best to cooperate \nwith the President on judicial nominations. We have largely succeeded, \neven though there are a handful of nominees who we believe are too \nextreme.\n  Since President Bush's inauguration, the Senate has confirmed 140 of \nhis nominees and so far blocked only 2. We have said ``no'' in those \ncases partly because these few nominees were too extreme for lifetime \njudicial appointments and partly because the White House and the Senate \nmajority have tried to jam the nominations through the Senate without \nrespect for the Senate's advice and consent role under the Constitution \nand without respect for the Senate rules and traditions.\n  The nomination of Mr. Pryor illustrates all of these issues. Even his \nadvocates concede that his attitudes and beliefs are the very extreme \nof legal thinking. I am confident that when the Members of the Senate \nand the public fully understand and consider his prejudices and \nattitudes, a majority of the Senate, with the strong support of the \npublic, will agree that he does not merit confirmation to a lifetime \nseat on an appellate court that often has the last word on vital \nissues, not only for the 4\\1/2\\ million people of Alabama but also for \nthe 8 million people of Georgia and the 15 million people of Florida. \nIn fact, this nomination does not belong on the Senate floor at this \ntime.\n  The Pryor nomination was reported out of the committee as a result of \na gross violation of the same committee rule of procedure which caused \nthe Cook and Roberts nominations to be held up in the Senate floor \nearlier this year. The Judiciary Committee has a rule which clearly \nprevents the termination of debate on a nominee unless a majority of \nthe committee, including at least one member of the minority, is ready \nto vote on the nominee.\n  This rule, Rule 4, was adopted at the insistence of Senator Hatch, \nSenator Thurmond, and other Republicans in 1979, when I was chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, as a reasonable protection for the minority. \nAfter the rule was ignored in the Cook and Roberts case, we thought we \nhad resolved this matter amicably and equitably. Both nominees were \nlater confirmed based on a clear understanding that Democrats would not \nin the future be deprived of their rule 4 rights.\n  After all, these rules were put in place at the start of this \nCongress, with the support of the Republican chairman of the committee, \nand now we have seen a blatant and flagrant disregard, which is not \njust an issue of procedure but affects the substance of this issue in a \nvery important way.\n  Just as important is the reason why Democrats were unwilling to vote \non this nomination in the committee. The reporting of this nomination \nwas totally premature because the committee was forced to move to a \nvote in the midst of a serious investigation of substantive questions \nof candor and ethics raised at the hearing by the nominee's own \ntestimony, by his answers and non-answers to the committee's followup \nquestions.\n  On Friday, Chairman Hatch presented a version of the history of this \nnomination and this investigation which does not comport with the \nfacts. I want to go through that history so the Senate can fully \nunderstand that Democrats have proceeded expeditiously and responsibly \nand that the rush to judgment in the committee last week was an effort \nto cut off an important investigation. The full Senate deserves to know \nits result before it considers this nomination.\n\n  The basic facts on this issue are straightforward. Democrats did not \ninvent the issue. Years before this nomination, lengthy articles in \nTexas and DC newspapers raised the question of the propriety of the \nactivities of the Republican Attorneys General Association.\n  It was reported that the organization sought campaign contributions \nto support the election of Republican attorneys general because they \nwould be less aggressive than Democratic attorneys general in \nchallenging business interests for violations of the law. Some \ndescriptions of this effort characterize it as a shakedown scheme. The \nleaders of the association denied the allegation but refused to \ndisclose its contributors. They were able to maintain secrecy by \nfunneling the contributions through an account at the Republican \nNational Committee that aggregated various kinds of State campaign \ncontributions, thus avoiding separate public reporting of the \ncontributions or the amount of these gifts. The issue received \nsignificant press coverage during the 2002 U.S. Senate campaign in \nTexas especially since several Republican attorneys general have \ndenounced the association as fraught with ethical problems.\n  Since Mr. Pryor had been identified publicly as a leader of the \nassociation's efforts and the ethical issues raised by it, these issues \nare obviously relevant to his qualifications. Senator Feingold asked \nthe nominee about it at the June 11 hearing. Until this point in the \nhearing, Mr. Pryor was, in Senator Hatch's own words, ``no shrinking \nviolet.'' He had been open and honest about his personal beliefs and \nideological views. He did not retreat a single step or hedge his \nopinions. Nor were there any ``confirmation conversions'' taking new \nviews, contradicting old ones. Mr. Pryor was a model of outspokenness, \nwith clear recollections of the details of briefs, legal opinions, \nspeeches, and other complex legal issues.\n  Only on the issue of the Republicans Attorney General Association \nwere his statements cramped and fudged, his recollections virtually \nnil. His answers were unresponsive and incomplete. They raise serious \nquestions about his candor and truthfulness. He was asked a broad \nquestion reciting the allegations against the association. He was asked \nwhether, if the allegations of soliciting contributions from potential \ntarget corporations are true, his own role in the association would \npresent at least an appearance of conflict of interest. His answer was \nwhat would have been called a ``nondenial denial'' in the Watergate \ndays. He said the contributions were made to the Republican National \nCommittee, not to the association. He said that ``every one of these \ncontributions, every penny, was disclosed [by the Republican National \nCommittee] every month.''\n  The association's own materials show that its contributions were \nbeing given to the association and that the writing of checks to an \naggregated account of the Republican National Committee was merely a \nway to use a reporting loophole to mask the association's contributions \nand the amounts of their gifts.\n  Even more startling, Mr. Pryor's assertion that every penny of the \ncontributions was disclosed by the Republican National Committee was a \nclear misrepresentation. The fact is, the association and its members \nhave explicitly refused to disclose the contributions. Republican \nNational Committee reports did not mention any association funds, let \nalone every penny. Mr. Pryor's statement raised a giant red flag.\n\n  Senator Feingold immediately told the nominee there would be followup \non this issue in written questions. On June 17, Senator Feingold and I \nboth asked the followup questions. We gave him an opportunity to review \nthe previous answers and make them more responsive. He refused. He \nsaid: ``I stand by them.'' We asked about other details of the \nassociation's operation and his specific role in it. Once again, his\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nanswers were unresponsive and silent on key facts.\n  This careful lawyer could remember the most esoteric details of \ncomplex legal cases going back many years but could not remember a \nsingle company or person he himself had solicited for the association. \nHe could not recall whether any of the leading tobacco or other \ncompanies identified by the President were contributors. He could not \nremember the name of a single association member or contributor or \nwhether he had ever personally received any of the campaign funds.\n  Typical was this question and answer: I asked, ``To the extent that \nthe RAGA designated system funds were transmitted to or through another \nentity, did that entity disclose publicly the funds raised by or for \nRAGA?''\n  His answer was a non-answer: ``To my knowledge, RAGA complied with \nall the applicable campaign laws and its operations.\n  He later said, ``I never solicited for RAGA a contribution from any \nperson who has been the subject of an investigation or legal action of \nmy office.'' He refused to say whether someone else on behalf of the \nassociation had made such solicitations. He refused to say whether \ncontributions came from companies his office might have investigated, \nbut did not.\n  These issues that were raised about the telephone companies, about \nthe calls, about the meetings, about the breakfast meetings, who was \nthere, have all been left open. There is strong evidence that is in \nconflict with what the nominee has presented. This is part of the \ncommittee's work in terms of the future, to get to the bottom of this, \nin fairness to the nominee and so that the Senate will be able to make \nits judgment.\n  Senator Hatch's floor statement made much of the number of times the \nPryor nomination appeared on the committee's agenda. In fact, the Pryor \nnomination was on the agenda for June 19 but the listing was obviously \npremature since the answers to our questions had not even arrived. The \nanswers were received on June 25. Again, Pryor was placed on the agenda \nfor the next day, but before any of us had a chance to examine his \nintricate web of answers, partial answers and non-answers. The \nnomination was obviously not even close to ready for consideration. \nEven our first look at the answers made clear there would have to be \nfurther investigation, more followup questions. Even Senator Hatch \nrealized proceeding the next day would be inappropriate.\n  By this time, Pryor's statements had been widely reported and had \ncome to the attention of many people who knew the facts and some who \nmight cast light on the facts that Mr. Pryor could not recall. On July \n2, during the Fourth of July recess, just before the long holiday \nweekend, extensive new material from one such source arrived at the \nminority office in the committee. After a brief initial review to \nassess the authenticity and relevance, the material was turned over to \nthe majority staff when the Senate returned from the recess. At the \nsame time, the chairman's staff was fully briefed about the process by \nwhich the materials had reached the committee.\n\n  Then, contrary to the chairman's floor assertion, a bipartisan group \nof investigators questioned the source of material in detail. No \nquestion was raised about the authenticity of the materials. On the \ncontrary, when the joint staff shortly thereafter interviewed the \nauthor of the document, she confirmed the source had full access to \nthem.\n  The material was then distributed by each side to each member. After \nreviewing the documents, the minority requested that a bipartisan \ninvestigation be conducted. That investigation was to begin July 15, \nwith calls to the association's former finance director and executive \ndirector. Until then, not a single document had been disseminated \noutside the committee.\n  However, on that day, the majority gave the documents to the nominee \nand to the Justice Department. Someone on the Republican side gave them \nto a strongly pro Pryor columnist on the Mobile Register newspaper. The \ncolumnist called the former finance director, a close Pryor ally and \nformer campaign director. That call was made before the investigators \ncould reach her, warning her that she could expect a call from the \ncommittee staff. Although the call to her did produce some useful \ninformation, it also marked the beginning of a consistent effort by the \nmajority investigators to interfere with the investigation.\n  After the interviewee stated that she might well have the files of \nthe association, the Democratic investigator requested she provide them \nto the committee. The Republican investigator told her not to comply \nwith the request and not even to comply with the request to at least \nbegin searching for association materials in her possession.\n  The Mobile Register columnist disclosed and discussed the documents \non July 16, and others in the press wrote about them on the 17th. The \ncommittee had a brief discussion of the documents on the 17th with the \nexpectation that the just started investigation would continue on a \nbipartisan basis in accordance with an investigative plan provided to \nthe majority.\n  However, at that point, the Republican investigative staff began \ninforming the interviewees that the calls to them were not part of an \nofficial committee investigation, implying that they did not have to \ncooperate.\n  Between July 17 and July 23, many calls were made in accordance with \nthe plan. Many of these calls did not reach the parties called.\n  By the time of the committee's meeting scheduled for July 23rd, the \ninvestigators had just begun accumulating significant information in \naccordance with the investigation plan. The day before the meeting, all \nnine Democrats, having considered the information available up to that \npoint, wrote to the chairman and informed him that the investigation \nwas producing serious and disturbing information, that it would require \nsubstantial addition time, that his investigators were interfering with \nit, and that after it was complete, we would want to question the \nnominee under oath.\n  The Republican staff had offered interviews with the nominee before \nthat time, but the Democratic investigators had declined to participate \nuntil the basic investigative work had been done, and in any event, the \nDemocratic members wanted to question the nominee in person under oath \nat the appropriate time.\n  At the meeting on July 23, the chairman rejected the minority's \nrequest out of hand. He insisted on a vote on the nomination without \ncompletion of the investigation and without further questioning of the \nnominee under oath. That was the situation when Senator Leahy invoked \nthe committee's Rule IV to prevent a premature vote on the nomination. \nThe chairman refused to follow Rule 4 and insisted on an immediate \nvote.\n  The nine Democrats on the committee voted against reporting the \nnomination, and the 10 Republicans voted to report it, with one member \nof the majority noting that his vote to report did not mean he would \nnecessarily vote for the nominee on the floor. He also noted that he \nwould want to review the results of the investigation with the nominee \nbefore any floor vote.\n  Despite the lack of co-operation from the majority staff, the \ninvestigation has continued. It has developed new information which \nexpands both the scope and the gravity of the original concerns. It \ntends to show not only that the nominee was not candid with the \ncommittee, but that his statements may have been intended to obscure \nfacts that would raise extremely serious ethical or legal questions \nabout the nominee's activities.\n  I raise these points because the chairman has suggested that these \nissues are not serious. They are very, very serious. I do not know how \nit will ultimately come out after the investigation is complete, but as \nI said in committee, the nomination comes to the floor with a ticking \nethical time bomb which might explode at any moment.\n  There is no doubt that this nomination is not ripe for a vote of the \nfull Senate. The committee majority was not willing to finish its job \nbefore reporting the nomination to the Senate. But that is no reason \nfor the Senate to allow the nomination to be voted on, before these \nmatters are thoroughly reviewed, and the nominee has responded.\n  On the issue of the merits, Mr. Pryor is simply too ideological to \nserve as a Federal court judge. The concern is not\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\nsimply that Mr. Pryor is a conservative. The question is not whether \nall of us agree with his views. Mr. Pryor's litigation positions, \npublic statements and his writings leave little doubt that he is \ncommitted to using the law not simply to advance a ``conservative'' \nagenda, but a narrow and extreme, ideological agenda.\n  Mr. Pryor's record is clear. He is an aggressive supporter of rolling \nback the power of Congress to remedy violations of civil rights; he is \na vigorous opponent of the constitutional right to privacy and a \nwoman's right to choose; he is an aggressive advocate of the death \npenalty, even for individuals who are mentally retarded. He is \ncontemptuously dismissive of claims of racial bias in the application \nof the death penalty. He is an ardent opponent of gay rights.\n  More than just disagreeing with much of the Supreme Court's \njurisprudence over the last 50 years on issues such as privacy, the \ndeath penalty, criminal justice, and the separation of church and \nstate, Mr. Pryor has dedicated his advocacy and litigation to rolling \nback widely accepted legal principles and laws. What we know about Mr. \nPryor leaves little doubt that he will try to advance that agenda if \nhe's confirmed as a Federal judge.\n  At his hearing and in answers to written questions, Mr. Pryor, for \nthe most part, adhered to his past, extreme, views. He did not renounce \nhis view that the Supreme Court's decisions in Miranda v. Arizona and \nRoe v. Wade were the worst examples of judicial activism or that the \nRoe decision was an abomination. What are we expected to believe? That \ndespite the intensity with which he holds these views and the years he \nhas devoted to dismantling these legal rights, he will still ``follow \nthe law'' if he is confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit? Repeating that \nmantra again and again in the face of his extreme record does not make \nit credible that he will do so.\n  We know the cases that Mr. Pryor has won at the Supreme Court to \nnarrow Federal rights, and the effect of these cases on the lives of \ndisabled workers--of breast cancer victims like Patricia Garrett--and \nof the many older workers who face discrimination by State agencies.\n  Mr. Pryor's agenda is more far-reaching. He has consistently \nadvocated views to narrow individual rights far beyond what any court \nin this land has been willing to hold.\n  Just this term, his radical views were rejected by the Supreme Court. \nIn its recent term, the Supreme Court rejected his argument that States \ncould not be sued for money damages for violating the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. The Court rejected his argument that States should \nbe able to criminalize private sexual conduct between consenting \nadults. The Court also rejected his far-reaching argument that counties \nshould have the same immunity from lawsuits that States have.\n  What is more disturbing, Mr. Pryor has plans for narrowing Federal \npower far beyond the Supreme Court's current case law. The Supreme \nCourt has held that Congress has broad power under the spending clause, \nbut Mr. Pryor's agenda would restrict Congress's power under that \nclause. He has praised a district court's decision to limit the ability \nof individuals to enforce spending clause statutes. That decision would \nhave reversed more than 60 years of Supreme Court precedents, and it \nwas rejected unanimously by the Sixth Circuit. Seventy-five \nconstitutional law scholars had joined a brief opposing the decision. \nYet, Mr. Pryor said that the District Court decision was ``sublime'' \nand ``brilliant.''\n  He has even argued in a race discrimination case that Alabama should \nnot be subject to a lawsuit under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. That argument was unanimously rejected by the Eleventh Circuit, \nbecause it would have reversed decades of settled Supreme Court law. It \nshows how far he would go--trying even to limit Federal power to \naddress race discrimination under the 14th amendment, even though \ncombating race discrimination is the amendment's very purpose.\n  These examples rebut the notion, repeatedly urged by Mr. Pryor's \nsupporters, that Mr. Pryor is simply ``following the law'' or that his \nviews are within the mainstream. Again and again his statements and \nlitigation positions make clear that his agenda to ``make the law'', \nand again and again his radical views to change decades of Supreme \nCourt jurisprudence are rejected by the Federal courts.\n  Mr. Pryor even seems to resist the application of Supreme Court \ndecisions with which he disagrees. In 2002, Mr. Pryor authored a \nfriend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court arguing that it did not \nviolate the eighth amendment to execute people who are mentally \nretarded. The Court rejected his argument by a 6 to 3 vote in Atkins v. \nVirginia. Yet this past May, Mr. Pryor attempted to prevent a prisoner \nwith an IQ of 65--and whom even the prosecution had noted was mentally \nretarded--from raising a claim under Atkins. The Eleventh Circuit \nunanimously rejected Mr. Pryor's arguments, and stayed the execution of \nthe Alabama prisoner.\n  Do you call that mainstream? Judicial mainstream?\n  Mr. Pryor does not simply advocate these views in public life. He has \nused his position as Attorney General to advance his own ideolgical \nagenda. His State was one of only three States to submit an amicus \nbrief in support of Texas in the Lawrence case on gay rights. His \nrestrictive view of the constitutional right of privacy and his \nargument that States should be allowed to criminalize homosexual \nactivity were rejected by the Supreme Court in its decision last month.\n  He was the only State attorney general--with 37 on the other side--to \nsubmit an amicus brief opposing the remedy in the Violence Against \nWomen Act. He was the only attorney general to argue to the Supreme \nCourt that Congress has no power to make provisions of the Clean Water \nAct enforceable against the States.\n  Do we understand now? He was the only State attorney general, with 37 \non the other side, to submit an amicus brief opposing the remedy in the \nViolence Against Women Act; the only attorney general to argue to the \nSupreme Court that Congress has no power to make provisions of the \nClean Water Act enforceable against the State. He had ridiculed the \nSupreme Court of the United States for granting a temporary stay of \nexecution of a prisoner in a capital case who even the prosecution had \nnoted was mentally retarded. The Eleventh Circuit unanimously rejected \nhis arguments and stayed the execution of the Alabama prisoner, and the \nproponents of this nominee say he is in the mainstream? The mainstream \nof thinking?\n  Mr. Pryor has vigorously opposed gun control laws. He says the \nvictims of violence who sue gun dealers or manufacturers failing to \nfollow the Federal law are ``leftist bounty hunters.''\n  He filed an amicus brief for the State of Alabama opposing a law \nlimiting possession of firearms.\n  In this case, a Federal district court judge dismissed an indictment \nagainst a man in Texas who had possessed a firearm while under a \nrestraining order for domestic violence, in violation of Federal law. \nThe judge ruled that the law violated the second amendment. Alabama was \nthe only State to file an amicus brief in the Fifth Circuit. The brief \nbroadly argued that the Federal Government's interpretation of the \nstatute was so broad that it constituted a ``sweeping and arbitrary \ninfringement on the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.''\n  Mr. Pryor's argument went far beyond what the Fifth Circuit or any \nother court has held. The concern is that here again Mr. Pryor was \nusing the attorney general's office in Alabama to advance his own \npersonal ideological agenda in a Texas case, and that he will continue \nthis mission if his nomination is confirmed.\n  What he was trying to intervene on was the fact that you have a law \nthat restricts the ability for someone to bear an arm who is under a \nrestraining order for domestic violence. Do we understand this? State \nlaw has said people who are under restraining orders for domestic \nviolence should not bear arms. Attorney General Pryor is saying, ``Wait \na minute. That violates the second amendment.'' And we are saying that \nthis is in the mainstream of judicial thinking? A State law says that \nwhen you have domestic violence and an individual is under a \nrestraining order, that individual can't bear arms. He is trying to \noverride it and you say that is in the mainstream?\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\n  Mr. Pryor has ridiculed the Supreme Court of the United States for \ngranting a temporary stay of execution in a capital punishment case. \nAlabama is one of only two States in the Nation that uses the electric \nchair as its sole method of execution. The Court granted review to \ndetermine whether the use of the electric chair was cruel and unusual \npunishment. For Mr. Pryor, however, the Court should not have even \npaused to consider this eighth amendment question.\n  Listen to this. He stated that the issue ``should not be decided by \nnine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court.''\n  He stated that the issue ``should not be decided by nine octogenarian \nlawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court'' of the United States.\n  Talk about respect for the law and respect for the Supreme Court. All \nof us know that the courts may support our views at times. We may \ndiffer with the other courts. We just saw this in recent times when \nthey made a decision on the outcome of an election. Many had concerns \nabout it. It was supported by the American people because of the great \nrespect that we have for the Supreme Court. And he is talking about \n``nine octogenarian lawyers who happen to sit on the Supreme Court.''\n  Mr. Pryor's many inflammatory statements suggest that he lacks the \ntemperament to serve as a judge. He is dismissive of concerns about \nfairness and racial bias in capital punishment. He has stated: ``make \nno mistake about it, the death penalty moratorium movement is headed by \nan activist minority with little concern for what is really going on in \nour criminal justice system.''\n  Many of his statements reflect an alarmingly politicized view of the \njudiciary--hardly appropriate for someone who wants to serve as a \nFederal judge. In a speech to the Federalist Society, he praised the \nelection of George Bush as the ``last best hope for federalism'' and \nended his speech with these words a ``prayer for the next \nadministration: Please God, no more Souters.''\n  That is obviously a derogatory remark about a very distinguished \njurist, Justice Souter.\n  He was thankful for the Bush v. Gore decision because, as he said, \n``I wanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary \nand judicial selection so we can have no more appointments like Justice \nSouter.''\n  I hope that his nomination will be rejected.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, is the Senator from New Mexico \nrecognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I conferred with the majority leader, \nand he is thinking about the situation we are in. I would like to chat \nfor a little bit as one who greatly appreciates the Senate, the \ncommittees, and the jobs we all have and the job I have.\n  While the majority leader is thinking about matters and deciding what \nto do, I want to talk a little bit about the situation.\n  First of all, let me say there is no question that the United States \nof America needs an Energy bill and needs an Energy bill sooner rather \nthan later. We have already passed the time to have an Energy bill. As \nfar as I am concerned, whatever this interference of a judge and a \njudge's vote and Senators on the other side of the aisle wanting to \nspeak, the way I look at it, I would let them all do it. In fact, I \nwould say to the Democratic Members of that committee, why don't you \nall speak? I would set up the vote on the judge at the earliest \npossible time under the rules, and let them speak if we have to stay \nhere all night. Let them all speak. Then we will have the judge out of \nthe way sooner than later. Then we would just say to everybody, fine. \nOne day we were supposed to be debating the Energy bill and we debated \nthe judge, so we will stay here an extra day. I would just say, let's \nstart tomorrow, and after you talk for the next 9 hours, instead of \nworking on the Energy bill, let us go to work and let us do the Energy \nbill. That might mean instead of Friday we would be here Saturday. We \nwould just substitute one day called Saturday for a day called \nWednesday. Wednesday was the day we ought to be working on the Energy \nbill, but there has been a decision to speak to a very important \nsubject which the other side of the aisle has thought to be very \nimportant, and that is their privilege. They think it is important to \ntalk about a judge. I think it is important that we in fact get an \nEnergy bill. I think there is only one way to do both of them. That is \nto let the Democrats talk as long as they would like. If they want to \ntalk now, or want to talk for the rest of the night, or want to talk \nright up until the time we are supposed to vote, then sooner or later \nthat vote will be over. That will be one of the jobs we have in front \nof us.\n  Then I would turn to the next job we have, and that is the Energy \nbill. If we don't get to that until tomorrow morning, we will then be \non the Energy bill. Then we will decide how much time we want to take \non the Energy bill. Then the public will know where we are.\n\n  Everything will have been done: Democrats will have gotten to talk \nall they wanted on a judge and the Republican leader will have brought \nup the judge and the Senate having voted on the judge--whatever \nhappens, a cloture vote, approval, nonapproval, but the vote will be \nover, and we will be back on the Energy bill. Then we will have nothing \nelse before us.\n  Straightforward, looking out to the public of America, looking across \nthe aisle to our friends and saying: You had it your way. Now, are we \nready? Are we ready to go and finish the Energy bill the American way? \nYou can't have both of them. You can have one or the other. You can \nhave one at a time but you can't have both at the same time.\n  So I think it is pretty easy. I don't think it is the only way, \nthough. I think the majority and minority leaders can, in fact, reach \nan agreement. That is not the business of the Senator from New Mexico \nbut I believe they could reach an agreement.\n  Let me repeat, if nobody wants to agree, and the Democrats want to \ntalk--and they have told us absolutely they have the right to talk, not \nabout the Energy bill, about a judge. And I am not being critical. \nThere is a judge nominee who they claim they want to talk about. I \nthink they ought to talk about it. I think they ought to talk right up \nuntil the time we vote. But sooner or later we will vote on that judge \nand then we ought to come back to the Energy bill. Then we can tell the \npublic, clear and simple, there is no judge in the way, there is \nnothing in the way. Here we are, full speed ahead.\n  We have as many days as we need. We have Friday--well, that would \nstill only be Thursday. We have the rest of Thursday. We have Friday. \nWe have Saturday. Then certainly some people would not want to work on \nSunday but then we could come back Monday. If the Democrats think we \nneed 4 more days, we could have 4 more days.\n  I, frankly, believe, without any doubt, you can finish this Energy \nbill in a day and a half, and people can have all the time they want on \nimportant matters--maximum, 2 but you can finish it in 1\\1/2\\ to 2 \ndays.\n  So from this Senator's standpoint--I repeat, I do not speak for \nanyone but myself as the chairman of the Energy Committee and someone \nwho has worked pretty hard to get a bill I think is pretty good but \nthat I would like to take to conference someday with the House and get \nan Energy bill for the country. This bill does not please everybody but \nit is pretty good.\n  I have been pondering it, but I think probably the best thing to do \nis to make arrangements to do them both, to do the judge and to do the \nbill. If that is what the other side wants, to take the time that I \nthink belongs to the Energy bill so they can speak, I would say, let \nthem do it. But that time will end. When that time ends, we go to the \nEnergy bill and then there will not be any excuses--that will be it.\n  Whatever are the amendments--my friend, the whip, has told me there \nare three or four more on the electricity\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\nsection--let's have them. We can do them whenever that time comes that \nI have just described, one after another, just like we have done. None \nhave passed yet. That is not to say some will not in the future.\n  Then we will go to the other ones, three of which are important to \npeople but that do not even belong on this bill. And they are \nimportant. They are going to take a lot of time. They literally do not \nbelong on this bill.\n  So I have spent a lot of time so far. I am willing to spend a lot \nmore. I don't think it needs 3 more days of the time of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. I think it needs 2 days. But I can't do that so long \nas the other side wants to talk about a judge. I can't do both. The \npublic ought to know that. It just can't be done.\n  Having said that, let me repeat, let's do both. But let's have an \nunderstanding that when we are finished with the judge--and the \nDemocrats will have had all the time they needed to talk about the \njudge; and that is fine; we have the ranking member here; he might want \nto talk about him--then we will go to the Energy bill, and we will stay \nhere Friday and Saturday and Sunday and Monday and finish the Energy \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from New Mexico \nsaid, the public should know. The public should know the following: The \nlast 4 weeks the distinguished majority leader has been saying we are \ngoing to complete the Energy bill in 1 week. For 4 weeks, the minority \nhas said: We cannot do that. There is not enough time to do that.\n  Last year, when we worked our way through this bill, there were 140-\nsome odd amendments. This year, we have had stops and starts on this \nbill. The majority leader said we have been on it 16 days. Everyone \nknows that is simply not factual. We have been on it days but these \nwere Fridays and Mondays when nothing was going on here.\n  Now, the public should know that in addition to having a difficult \ntime finishing this bill in 1 week, the majority leader has made the \ndecision to schedule votes on judges.\n  The public should know that the vote we took today on Miguel Estrada \nwas the seventh time we have voted on this judge. There has not been a \nsingle vote change all seven votes but yet the valuable time of the \nSenate was taken on this wasteful exercise.\n  We also voted, for the third time, on Justice Owen from Texas. Votes \nhave not changed on that. Also, another waste of time.\n  My friend from New Mexico says: Well, let's finish the debate on \nPryor and then go to energy. The problem with that is, we have been \ntold there is going to be another cloture motion filed on a judge. \nThere has been no time spent on the floor on her, either, a woman from \nCalifornia by the name of Kuhl. So using the logic of the Senator from \nNew Mexico, then we would take and debate all day Thursday, and some of \nFriday, prior to the vote on that.\n  We have not caused the stops and starts on this bill. Not only have \nwe had stops and starts dealing with judges, which have slowed this up \nimmensely, but we also have had thrown in here two trade bills, the \nSingapore and Chile trade bills. We still have 6 hours to complete on \nthat debate.\n  The public should know there is not a single Democrat who opposes an \nEnergy bill. We think this Energy bill is imperfect and there should be \namendments filed on it. We have not filed a single amendment that has \nbeen, in any way, an effort to slow down this bill. There have been \nmeaningful and important debates, and every vote has been extremely \nclose. Had there been not arm-twisting on the other side on the \nCantwell amendment and the Feingold amendment--people in the well \nwanted to vote with us but did not. As we know what happens down here \nin close votes, they were unable to vote with us.\n  These are not meaningless amendments. They have been very important \namendments. As I have explained on several occasions, we have other \namendments that are just as meaningful as these that have been filed.\n  We have also heard my friend from New Mexico say: We want to do this \nthe American way. I don't know what that means. But that is what this \nis. We are in the Senate and we are doing things the American way, as \nestablished by the U.S. Constitution. That is how we are going to do \nthings.\n  We did not make the decision to have the parliamentary posture as it \nis. That has been made by the majority leader. He has a right to do \nthat, but he also has the obligation to know that the stops and starts \non this Energy bill has made it virtually impossible to pass this bill.\n  Now, to have threats made--and that is what they are: You are going \nto be here Friday afternoon; you are going to be here Saturday, Sunday, \nMonday, Tuesday--well, that is the way it is. But always remember, any \ninconvenience that is caused to the Democrats will be caused to the \nRepublicans also. Remember, there are two more of them than there are \nof us, so they will have a little extra inconvenience.\n  But this Senator and all 48 other Senators who are here in the \nminority are willing to work to complete whatever work needs to be \ndone. But we are not going to be rushed into voting for a judge such as \nthe man from Alabama who has been hustled out of the Committee of the \nJudiciary without proper debate in the committee itself. We are going \nto have proper debate in the Senate. We are going to have the American \npeople know because the public should know. We are going to do it the \nAmerican way.\n  We are going to hear the ranking member of the committee, who, by the \nway, has been responsible for our approving, during this \nadministration, 140 Federal judges.\n  We have turned down two. The American public should know that. That \nis the American way. One-hundred and forty to two isn't that bad. \nAnybody who has a basic knowledge of math understands those are pretty \ngood odds.\n  There is also a complaint that the distinguished ranking member has \nrequested votes on some of these judges. Well, yes, and we have six \njudges now who could have been approved during the 4 hours we are going \nto be wasting on these cloture votes. In fact, we probably could have \ndone all of them in the 4 hours set aside. Of course we could have.\n  The plaintive cries create no pity on our side. We are here ready to \nwork on the Energy bill. If they don't want Senators from the Judiciary \nCommittee and others speaking about Pryor, then let's not have a \ncloture vote tomorrow. Let's not have a cloture vote on Kuhl on Friday. \nWe can spend more time on the Energy bill.\n  Until the majority leader understands that he is his own worst enemy, \nwe are going to continue what we are doing to protect the rights of the \nAmerican people because the public should know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I must say I completely agree with the \nsenior Senator from Nevada on this. The senior Senator from New Mexico, \nwho was in the Chamber, expressed concern about time being taken \ntalking about William Pryor's nomination. We are not the ones who \nscheduled William Pryor's nomination in the middle of the Energy bill.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Utah, chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, is in the Chamber. He knows the concerns expressed \nby members of the committee that this nomination was voted out of \ncommittee before investigations underway involving Mr. Pryor were \ncompleted.\n  It is passingly strange that when we say that after the nomination \nhas been moved prematurely out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with \npending questions, very serious questions involving the conduct of that \nnominee unresolved, but it gets sort of rocketed onto the floor. Then \nwe are asked to lie down and just let it go through without even saying \nwhy we object.\n  First, the rules of the Senate Judiciary Committee itself were \nviolated. Rule 4 was violated. The matter is still coming up. The \ndistinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader \nhad a conversation in which the distinguished majority leader assured \nus that this would never happen again. Within a few weeks of that \nassurance, it happens again, an assurance that no nomination of this \nnature would come up if it was sent out\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\nin violation of rule 4 of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was. The \nnomination is up. And we don't ask questions about it?\n  Then we hear some on the other side say: Our judges are being \nblocked. Well, it is true; 2 out of 140 have been. But at the same \ntime, they want to quietly voice vote all these other judges through so \nthat nobody will notice that we are passing judges. One of the reasons \nwe have asked for rollcall votes on a number of them is to show how \neasy it is to pass a judge where there is a consensus.\n  In those rare instances where people have actually been consulted \nabout a judge and where a judge has been nominated who is not going to \nbe an ideological arm of either political party but, rather, be an \nindependent judge, they go through easily.\n  In this case, the Republican leadership--not the Democratic \nleadership, the Republican leadership--filed a cloture motion on the \nnomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit. So we are going to \nhave this premature debate.\n  I hope there is one aspect on which we can get closure in the Senate. \nIn connection with this nomination, supporters of the administration \nhave leveled the unfounded charges that Democratic Senators are anti-\nCatholic. This charge is despicable. I have waited patiently for more \nthan 2 years for Republican Senators to disavow such charges. So far, \nonly one has, the distinguished Presiding Officer. This is a \ndespicable, slanderous charge. It is one calculated to throw us back \ninto a time that maybe some in this Chamber may not remember. Some of \nus have parents who do remember when anti-Catholic bias ran rampant in \nthis country.\n  It is outrageous, of course, that Republicans will not knock down \nthese slanderous charges of anti-Catholicism and allow them to go \nforward. This slander and the ads recently run by a group headed by the \nPresident's father's former White House counsel and a group whose \nfunding includes money raised by Republican Senators and the \nPresident's family are personally offensive. They have no place in this \ndebate or anywhere else.\n\n  For a charge of anti-Catholicism to be leveled against any Member of \nthis Chamber, Republican or Democratic, is wrong. But for those who \nstay silent and allow it to go forward, who take part in it, the only \nway for a lie to get traction is for people to remain silent. And those \nwho could stop this lie in a hurry remain silent.\n  I challenged the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee who \nare so fond of castigating special interest groups and condemning every \ncritical statement of a Republican nominee as being somehow a partisan \nsneer, to condemn this ad campaign and the injunction of religion into \nthese matters. Only the junior Senator from Georgia now presiding \nresponded to that challenge. Other Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee and of the Senate have either stood mute in the face of these \nobnoxious and disgusting and scurrilous charges or, worse, they have \nfed the flames.\n  Today, Republican Senators have another chance to do what they have \nnot yet done and what this administration has not yet done--disavow \nthis campaign of division and those who have played wedge politics with \nreligion. I hope the Republican leadership of the Senate and of the \nJudiciary Committee will finally disavow the contention that any \nSenator is being motivated in any way by religious bigotry, just as I \nand others on this side of the aisle have defended members of the \nRepublican side of the aisle when they have been attacked on their \nreligion. We find it so painful that not only do they remain silent \nwhen people on this side of the aisle are attacked on their religion \nbut in some instances have even continued the attack in statements they \nhave made outside this Chamber.\n  When we began debate on the nomination of Miguel Estrada in February, \nI made a similar request with respect to the charges that Senators were \nbeing anti-Hispanic. The other side never withdrew that ridiculous \ncharge. Instead, the special interest groups and others trying to \nintimidate the Senate into voting on that nomination broadened the \nattack to include Hispanic members of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus, MALDEF, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, past \npresidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association, and many other \nHispanic and civil rights organizations that opposed the Estrada \nnomination. It was so bad that one Hispanic organization that supported \nMiguel Estrada issued a statement that the charge was wrong, that they \ncertainly didn't believe it applied to any Member of the Senate, and \nurged the Republicans to stop it.\n  They didn't, but they were urged by other Hispanic groups to stop it. \nThe demagoguery, divisive and partisan politics being so cynically used \nby supporters of the President's most extreme judicial nominees needs \nto stop. There are at least five judicial nominations on the Executive \nCalendar on which we can join as Democrats and Republicans. I would be \nwilling to bet that they would be confirmed by an overwhelming vote.\n  I remember when we had a circuit court of appeals judge nominated by \nPresident Bush. For a month, the Democrats tried to get a vote on that \nnominee. For a month, one Republican had an anonymous hold and refused \na vote to go forward. There are people we could vote on. Why don't \nthey? We took a month to get the Republicans to release the anonymous \nhold on Judge Edward Prado, who was nominated by President Bush. \nInterestingly enough, I finally found out why. They didn't want a vote. \nThey wanted to attack us for not voting on him, even though we were the \nones asking to vote on him. It is Alice in Wonderland to the tenth \npower.\n  Now, the assistant minority leader suggested going to these matters \nand making progress. I have suggested scheduling rollcall votes on \nthese nominees and making further bipartisan progress. Instead, we \nwaste time on cloture motion after cloture motion after another cloture \nmotion in connection with the most controversial of this President's \nnominees. Now I find out why. I am told by members of the press that \nthe Republicans said this was supposed to be our issue this week. We \nare not getting appropriations bills done, we are not going to finish \nthe Energy bill, or do anything else, so we are going to tie up the \nSenate with a number of cloture votes. Then they all went out with \ntheir talking points with members of the press to tell them how \nterrible it was that we were having these votes, which they scheduled.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I listened to some of the complaints on the floor \nrecently while I was in my office. They were concerned about not moving \nahead on energy. I guess the obvious question is--we didn't bring up \nthe judge; we are not requiring a vote on the judge; we are not \nrequiring a vote on the trade agreements; and there is no requirement \nto vote on the trade agreements this week. There is no requirement to \nvote on this judge this week. So isn't the proposition that those who \nare scheduling this place, who insist on a vote on a judge, insist on \nbringing up trade agreements in the middle of the discussion on energy, \nisn't that what is causing the delay?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely right. The \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader pointed out just a short \nwhile ago that we have had a number of votes on the Energy bill, which \nwere very close votes, which could have gone either way. We had a good \ndebate going and we were actually voting. Now, instead we spend more \ntime in quorum calls and bringing up judicial votes that are not going \nanywhere.\n  I must say to my friend from North Dakota, as ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, if we would have taken the time that has been \nwasted on things not going anywhere, if we had taken time to vote \nthrough some of the judges, where I believe we could get consensus of \nboth Democrats and Republicans, and vote and confirm them and let them \ngo to the bench, that would be a better way. We spent a whole month, as \nI mentioned, trying to get the Republicans to allow a vote on Judge \nEdward Prado for a circuit court of appeals position. He had been \nnominated by President Bush and was strongly supported by President \nBush. For a month, they blocked it from going to a vote. We found out \nafterward it was because they went to the same members of the press \nthey have\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\ngone to this week and they said: This is terrible. The Democrats aren't \nallowing us to vote.\n\n  Democrats, time after time, came on the Senate floor and said we can \nhave unanimous consent to go to a vote, and they objected.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, further inquiring of the Senator from \nVermont, is it the case, then, that there are judge candidates that \ncould be brought to the Senate floor without any controversy at all, \nwhich would require very little time? Those are not the ones brought to \nthe floor. Very controversial nominations are brought to the Senate \nfloor, and complaints arise because someone wants to debate it. Isn't \nit the point that we didn't bring this judgeship to the floor for a \ncloture vote?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. In fact, I say to my friend that the one time we did \ntry to bring one of President Bush's circuit court nominees to the \nfloor and ask to have him considered, for a month we were not allowed \nto because the Republicans objected. I have not done a whip check, but \nI am willing to bet that if we brought them to a vote, and they are on \nthe calendar now, they would get confirmed. Even in the time we have \nhad quorum calls and discussions on this today, we could have brought \nthem up and had a series of 10-minute rollcall votes. And I am willing \nto bet we would have passed them all.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator indicated we were dealing with very important \nissues today. Indeed we were. I mention the Cantwell amendment, which \nlost by two votes. It was a very significant amendment which I think, \nin the rear view mirror of public policy, will turn out to be one of \nthe most important amendments turned down by the Senate dealing with \nenergy.\n  We know what is happening on the west coast. Firms bilked people out \nof billions of dollars. There is substantial criminal investigation \nstill ongoing and the proposition today on the Energy bill was \nimportant: Will there be adequate protections for consumers, and will \nwe do something about the scandals that occurred on the west coast and \nstand up and support the interests of consumers and prevent \nmanipulation of energy markets? That amendment failed by two votes. \nThere was a significant debate, a big amendment. These are big, \nimportant issues.\n  The question is, Why are we not continuing to work on the Energy \nbill? What interrupted it? Have we done that or has someone else \nbrought something else to the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I answer my friend from North Dakota that \nwe have been willing to move forward on amendments on the Energy bill. \nWe are not the ones who brought up the extraneous cloture votes which \nare not going anywhere. Maybe some want to get off the Energy bill. I \nnote that the distinguished Senator mentioned Senator Cantwell's \namendment. I was very proud to support that amendment. It was excellent \nand, as the Senator said, it would protect the consumers.\n  It was interesting because, at one point, she had the amendment won, \nand you heard the snap, crackle, and pop, not of Rice Crispies but the \narms being twisted and snapped as votes were being changed. Most of the \npower company lobbyists were saying to the leadership on the other side \nthat you cannot allow that to go through, and votes were being changed. \nIt came within two votes.\n  I agree with the Senator from North Dakota that people are going to \nlook in the rear view mirror and say Senator Cantwell was right, and \nthat should have been allowed to go through.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, and I am sorry to \ncontinue to inquire, at this point, is there a cloture vote that is now \nscheduled on Mr. Pryor? Is there a vote scheduled and, if so, when is \nit scheduled?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is scheduled for tomorrow under the \nnormal circumstances, unless there has been an agreement entered into \notherwise. That would be an hour after we come into session. Unless the \nestablished quorum is waived, we could go to a vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I inquire further, if a cloture motion has \nbeen filed and it ripens tomorrow and we presumably would have a \ncloture vote on this nomination tomorrow, for those tonight who are \nconcerned about not moving ahead on energy, we could resolve that by \nvitiating the cloture motion vote tomorrow.\n  I was sitting in my office listening to those complaining that we are \nnot moving ahead on energy, understanding it was not us who brought \nthis judgeship forward. We did not put forward the proposal that we \nhave to do two free-trade agreements this week.\n  It seems to me, at least with respect to the judgeships, perhaps what \nought to be done is unanimous consent ought to be entertained to \nvitiate the cloture vote tomorrow on this judge and move on. After all, \nthere is no reason that we have to vote on this judge tomorrow. This \nnomination has not been waiting a great length of time. It can be done \nin September. For those who are worried about moving ahead on energy--\nand we should--it seems to me what we probably ought to do is join \ntogether and vitiate this cloture vote, move on, and continue with the \nEnergy bill tonight. Does the Senator think that is an appropriate \ncourse?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell my friend from North Dakota, not \nonly would it be an appropriate course because cloture is not going to \nbe invoked primarily because, for one major reason because of his \nqualifications, but also because the rules of the Judiciary Committee \nwere not followed in having this nomination go out.\n  We could very well at that time, if we want to get judges through, \nnot have this cloture vote, which is not going to go anywhere. We have \nJames Cohn, of Florida. During this time we could have voted on him to \nbe a judge. We could have voted on Frank Montalvo, of Texas. These are \nnominees I would support and I think a majority of us would support. \nXavier Rodriguez, of Texas, could have been voted on. The Republicans \nhave made no effort to bring them up, even though we told them they \ncould. H. Brent McKnight, of North Carolina--these are people we would \nallow to being brought up. We would allow the home State Senators to \ntake a few minutes to speak about them. In fact, they could bring them \nall up and do them in a stack of 10-minute rollcall votes. They would \nhave gone through in the amount of time of some our quorum calls today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may address the Senator from Vermont \nwith one final inquiry, it seems to me if the issue in the Senate is we \nhave limited time and we have a substantial amount of work to do on \nenergy--I was at the White House yesterday. President Bush called a \nnumber of us down to the White House to talk about the urgent need to \npass this Energy bill. If that is, in fact, the case--and I believe it \nis and the majority leader has said it is--in order to get back on this \nEnergy bill, it seems to me what we should do--and I encourage the \nmajority leader to do this--is vitiate the cloture vote on the \njudgeship. We do not need to do it this week. We all know we do not. He \ncan decide we do not have to bring up the two free-trade agreements \nthis week. There is nothing urgent about those agreements. That need \nnot be done this week.\n  If the President is correct--and I believe he is--and if the majority \nleader is correct--and I believe he is--that this Energy bill ought to \nmove, it is urgent public business, then let's move back to the Energy \nbill and do it now. I encourage the majority leader to make that \ndecision.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Vermont has the time. I thank the \nSenator from Vermont for yielding to me. I, again, say to the majority \nleader, I do not want to hear people complaining about the fact that we \nare not on the Energy bill. We are not making progress on the bill \nbecause the majority leader and others said we have to move to the \njudgeships and then move to the trade agreements.\n  The fact is, they are the ones taking us off the Energy bill, not us. \nWe ought to offer the next amendment right now on the Energy bill and \nvitiate the cloture vote tomorrow morning on the judgeship. That will \nsolve the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for questions but not \nfor comments. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas asked if I will yield for a question. I will yield without losing \nmy right to\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\nthe floor or my right to reclaim the floor within 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from North Dakota \nand the Senator from Vermont will agree to a unanimous consent request \nthat we have a final vote on the Energy bill by noon on Friday and in \nexchange for that, we will vitiate the cloture votes on the two judges \nthat are in the queue right now. I think we can probably get unanimous \nconsent on that on our side fairly quickly.\n  If the Senator from North Dakota agrees with that, we will be happy \nto move forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the floor. I am not on the Energy \nCommittee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think that is what the Senator from North Dakota \nsuggested.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me respond this way. I have been in the \nSenate for 29 years. I love the Senate. I love following our normal \ncourse of doing business. The Senator from Pennsylvania has raised an \nappropriate question. I suggest that is a question that should be \ndirected to the Republican leader and the Democratic leader and the \nchairman and the ranking member of the committee, which is the normal \ncourse of doing business, the way we have always done it. Naturally, I \nwould be guided by the direction of the Republican and Democratic \nleaders, not only in the Senate but in the committee.\n  Obviously, I am not in a position to speak for the Republican or \nDemocratic leaders or the Republican chairman or Democratic ranking \nmember on this issue. The Senator from Pennsylvania is perfectly within \nhis rights in raising the issue, and I hope that might prompt a \ndiscussion with them.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for one more \nquestion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, would it make the most \nsense to have a final vote on the Energy bill when we have finished our \nwork on the Energy bill? And wouldn't that best be accommodated by not \ngoing off and on to come up with judgeships and trade agreements? \nWouldn't the best approach to reaching a final vote on the Energy bill \nbe to stop bringing to the floor of the Senate other business, business \nthat need not be done now?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will answer this way: We have diverted \nsome 6 to 10 hours off the Energy bill now. I see my friend, the senior \nSenator from Nevada. I know over the years he has worked very closely \nwith his counterpart on the Republican side and usually tried to work \nout a finite list of amendments to the Energy bill. Again, based on my \nexperience, my years in the Senate--almost three decades--I find \nusually if we stay on a bill that is your important bill, if you do not \nkeep going off it for the trade agreements about which the Senator from \nNorth Dakota spoke, or these various cloture motions, if we keep going \noff these bills, then nobody feels the pressure to work things out.\n  On the other hand, if we just stay on the bill and people bring up \namendments, we will find which ones are close amendments and actually \nhave a chance of being adopted and which ones are not going to be \nadopted. Usually the Republican and Democratic leadership get together \nand whittle down the finite number. Then, as the Senator from \nPennsylvania suggested, we are usually in the position to find a time \nfor a final vote.\n  My suggestion is that we use what he has suggested but stay on the \nEnergy bill, work toward a finite list of amendments. We will then know \nwhen they are going to take place and how much time they are going to \ntake. And then we will know when we are going to have final passage. We \ncan do that and then go back to anything else they want.\n  If we are going to keep going back to these judges--as I said, we so \nfar stopped two of President Bush's judges and confirmed 140, unlike \nthe 60 of President Clinton's judges who were stopped by the \nRepublicans, usually because someone objected anonymously. We have done \nit out here on the floor where we stood up on the nomination.\n  I am one Senator who actually takes seriously the role of the Senate. \nThere are only 100 of us, and we are given the privilege to represent \n270 million Americans. But we also have a very unique place. There is \nno other parliamentary body in the world quite like the Senate. We have \nthis unique spot where we have checks and balances, especially on \nconfirmations. The Constitution does not say advise and rubberstamp; it \nsays advise and consent.\n  Nobody should underestimate our commitment to the independence of the \nFederal judiciary and to our constitutional duty to advise and consent \non these lifetime appointments. Nobody should underestimate our \ncommitment to the protection of the rights of all Americans--\nRepublicans and Democrats, Independents--in every part of this Nation.\n  The Senate was intended to serve as a check and balance in our unique \nsystem of Government. We fail our oaths of office as Senators if we \nallow the Federal judiciary to be politicized, if we cast votes that \nwould remove their independence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to yield \nto the distinguished senior Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, then I will continue my speech.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania withdraw his objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No, I do not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, then I would----\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask how much time the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia desires?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do not think more than 10 or 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. My personal belief is we ought to let her go ahead, and I \nwould encourage my colleague to do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would renew my----\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that we----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have the floor. I would renew my request.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator add that I be given time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Along with the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, I \nrenew my request that I be allowed to yield now to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from California.\n  Mr. HATCH. I add to that, when the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is finished I would be granted the floor for my remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. For how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois objects.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reserve the right to object, Mr. President. I inquire \nof the Senator from Utah how much time he would want to be recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not have an exact time, but I would hope not too \nlong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, if the Senator from Utah would give me a fair \napproximation so I can request to follow him in speaking order, that is \nall I am asking for.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would estimate up to an hour.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I will ask for the floor when the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont ends his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Vermont yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada \nfor a question.\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Vermont, it is my understanding \nthat the Senator has approximately 15 or 20 minutes on his speech. What \nthe Senator wanted to do is yield to the Senator from California for 10 \nor 12 minutes, I think she said. Then it is my understanding that the \nrequest was the Senator from Utah be recognized for up to an hour, and \nthen following that I would like to modify the request that the Senator \nfrom Illinois be recognized for up to 45 minutes\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada cannot propound a \nunanimous consent request. He does not have the floor. The Senator from \nVermont does.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on behalf of both myself and the Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Hatch, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nSenator from California be recognized for no more than 15 minutes; the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah be recognized for up to an hour; and \nthen the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois be recognized for \nup to 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tried to accommodate the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Who is trying to accommodate the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Who is trying to accommodate the Senator from Vermont. I \nwill try to do that even though the Senator from Utah wants to speak \nlonger than I thought. But he is, after all, the chairman of the \ncommittee. I was willing to stop my speech at this point to accommodate \nhim. We have probably taken longer in making these unanimous consent \nrequests.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have a suggestion. Why does not the distinguished \nSenator end his speech and we will go to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia before me, and then I will try to be less than an hour?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask that that be the order; that I \ncomplete my speech, yield to the Senator from California, and then the \nSenator from Utah be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the distinguished junior Senator from \nPennsylvania. He said the reason he objected is because he felt it was \nan unequal distribution of time. If that is the case, we want to make \nsure there is an equal distribution of time. Through the chair, to the \nSenator from Utah, I am wondering who wants to speak after the Senator \nfrom Utah. I am trying to figure out how to balance this out fairly.\n  We recognize that Senator Kennedy spoke for 20 minutes or so.\n  Mr. HATCH. He spoke for half an hour.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest to my colleagues that we do this, \nas we have offered before: We allow the Senator from California to \nspeak, and then the Senator from Utah, and then, as we have done \nbefore, we go back and forth.\n  Mr. REID. I do not think we should go back and forth. Whoever gets \nrecognized should speak after the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is fine.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to recognize \nthe Senator from California, and then be in order to recognize the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I understand the unanimous consent \nrequest, we are now moving forward to debate this judgeship so that we \ncan have a cloture vote in the morning, much to the angst of many who \nbelieve we should be on the electricity title of the Energy bill. So I \nask when is it in order for us to ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \ncloture vote in the morning so we might do what every one of us in this \nChamber knows we should be doing, and that is be back on the energy \ntitle to try to finish the Energy bill?\n  I ask the Presiding Officer when might it be in order for me to seek \nunanimous consent to vitiate the cloture vote tomorrow morning so we \ncan get back to the Energy bill now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can make a unanimous consent at \nany time he gains the floor in his own right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would that include the time during a reservation of \nanother unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it would not.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would renew any request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say for the purpose of edification of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, the two leaders have met and talked and our leader \nwent to the Democratic leader and actually suggested to do just that, \nvitiate in exchange for a time certain this week to finish this bill, \nwhich is what I know the Senator from North Dakota was looking to do.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No, that is not the case.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As a result, that was not accomplished. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota said that was not acceptable, so as a result we are \nnow stuck on what seemingly some Members of this Chamber would like to \ntalk about.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, continuing to reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I continue my reservation to object. Let me just say that \nI speak fairly well for myself on this floor, and I have never \nsuggested that in exchange for anything we have a time certain. What I \nsuggested is that if we want to finish this Energy bill, we be able to \noffer the amendments on the title and debate the amendments. We are not \ngoing to get to that point if we keep interrupting the Energy bill with \njudges and trade agreements.\n  If we believe this is urgent--and the President says it is, I believe \nit is, others believe it is--let's get back to it this moment. Let's \nvitiate the cloture vote tomorrow on the judgeship. Let's hold over the \nfree-trade agreements until September and decide this is important, as \nwe have always said it was, and move to finish this Energy bill. I am \nnot talking about a time certain. The time for finishing it is when we \nfinish the amendments, have debate on the amendments, and have votes on \nthe amendments.\n  We can do that if I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the cloture vote \ntomorrow, but I guess I cannot do that under a reservation of \nobjection.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will withhold my request for the moment \nwithout losing my right to the floor so that the Senator from Utah \nmight make a point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving my right to object, Mr. President, it is not \nunusual to have multiple matters heard by the Senate. It is certainly \nnot unusual to have cloture votes on judges, especially under the \ncurrent situation. I would be happy to quit debating General Pryor \ntonight, even though there has been probably close to an hour of the \nSenate's time utilized on this debate, and just go to the cloture vote \ntomorrow, quit playing around with the Energy bill that we know is \nbeing slow-walked, and try to finish the Energy bill before the end of \nthis week.\n  There is no excuse for not having a cloture vote on Judge Pryor or \nJudge Kuhl on Friday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, regaining my right to the floor, I probably \ncould have completed my speech during this\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\ntime, but I was trying to save everybody some time. I was trying to \naccommodate the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, who is the \nchairman. I think everybody has agreed now to the request I have made.\n  I would renew my request that the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia be recognized, the ball then goes back to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am prompted to do this by the statement of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  It is outrageous you should suggest you would schedule the judge for \ntomorrow on a cloture vote and not provide time for debate, which is \nthe issue that is at stake here. We need the debate on the judge, and \nthen you say, well, you are interfering with the progress of the Energy \nbill.\n  Who was it who scheduled the judge for tomorrow? That is where the \nintrusion came in terms of the process of dealing with the Energy bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. People have a right to schedule the judge.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And at the same time assert that you have to pass the \nEnergy bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is the first time we have ever----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor. Is \nthere an objection to the unanimous consent?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, Mr. President, I know everyone stands riveted to \nhear the rest of my speech. I was trying to complete the speech so the \nSenator from California could be recognized.\n  Mr. President, sometimes after all this work, the Senate actually \ndoes work. Those who are watching someday will explain what exactly has \nhappened.\n  To continue, the Senate has already confirmed 140 of this President's \njudicial nominees, including 27 circuit court nominees. We could have \nconfirmed at least five more this week if the Republican leadership \nwould have worked with us to schedule votes on them. That stands in \nsharp contrast to the treatment of President Clinton's nominees by a \nRepublican-controlled Senate from 1995 through 2001, when judicial \nvacancies on the Federal courts were more than doubling from 16 to 33.\n  Opposition to Mr. Pryor's nomination is shared by a wide spectrum of \nobjective observers. Mr. Pryor's record is so out of the mainstream \nthat, even before last month's hearing, a number of editorial boards \nand others weighed in with significant opposition.\n  Last April, even the Washington Post, which has been exceedingly \ngenerous to the Administration's efforts to pack the courts, termed Mr. \nPryor ``unfit''. Both the Tuscaloosa News and the Hunstville Times \nwrote in early May against the nomination. Other editorial boards \nacross the country spoke out, including the San Jose Mercury News and \nthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Since the hearing, that chorus of \nopposition has only grown and now includes the New York Times, the \nCharleston Gazette, the Arizona Daily Star and the Los Angeles Times. I \nask unanimous consent to print the full package of these editorials and \nop-eds in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 11, 2003]\n\n                             Unfit To Judge\n\n       President Bush must have worked hard to dream up an \n     escalation of the judicial nomination wars as dramatic as his \n     decision this week to nominate Alabama Attorney General Bill \n     Pryor to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. A \n     protege of Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, Mr. Pryor \n     is a parody of what Democrats imagine Mr. Bush to be plotting \n     for the federal courts. We have argued strongly in favor of \n     several Mr. Bush's nominees--and urged fair and swift \n     consideration of all. And we have criticized Democratic \n     attacks on nominees of substance and quality. But we have \n     also urged Mr. Bush to look for common ground on judicial \n     nominations, to address legitimate Democratic grievances and \n     to seek nominees of such stature as defies political \n     objection. The Pryor nomination shows that Mr. Bush has other \n     ideas.\n       Mr. Pryor is probably best known as a zealous advocate of \n     relaxing the wall between church and state. He teamed up with \n     one of Pat Robertson's organizations in a court effort to \n     defend student-led prayer in public schools, and he has \n     vocally defended Alabama's chief justice, who has insisted on \n     displaying the Ten Commandments in state court facilities. \n     But his career is broader. He has urged the repeal of a key \n     section of the Voting Rights Act, which he regards as ``an \n     affront to federalism and an expensive burden.'' He has also \n     called Roe v. Wade ``the worst abomination of constitutional \n     law in our history.'' Whatever one thinks of Roe, it is \n     offensive to rank it among the court's most notorious cases, \n     which include Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson, after all.\n       Mr. Pryor's speeches display a disturbingly politicized \n     view of the role of courts. He has suggested that impeachment \n     is an appropriate remedy for judges who ``repeatedly and \n     recklessly . . . overturn popular will and . . . rewrite \n     constitutional law.'' And he talks publicly about judging in \n     the vulgarly political terms of the current judicial culture \n     war. He concluded one speech, for example, with the following \n     prayer: ``Please, God, no more Souters''--a reference to the \n     betrayal many conservatives feel at the honorable career of \n     Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter.\n       Mr. Pryor has bipartisan support in Alabama, and he worked \n     to repeal the provisions in that state's constitution that \n     forbade interracial marriage. Bush this is not a nomination \n     the White House can sell as above politics. Mr. Bush cannot \n     at once ask for apolitical consideration of his nominees and \n     put forth nominees who, in word and deed, turn federal courts \n     into political battlegrounds. If he sends the Senate nominees \n     such as Mr. Pryor, he cannot complain too loudly when his \n     nominees receive the most researching scrutiny.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Tuscaloosanews.com, May 4, 2003]\n\n                 Pryor's Opinion Goes Beyond Mainstream\n\n       Attorney General Bill Pryor's opinion that lumps \n     homosexuality in with abusive crimes such as child \n     pornography, bestiality, incest and pedophilia puts him well \n     within the camp of recent nominees to the federal bench but \n     well outside the mainstream of American life.\n       Pryor was nominated by President Bush to a seat on the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which has jurisdiction \n     over Alabama, Georgia and Florida. A legal argument Pryor \n     wrote earlier this year, which just came to light last week, \n     parallels comments by Sen. Rick Santorum, that landed the \n     Pennsylvania Republican in hot water recently.\n       The amicus brief, penned by Pryor and signed by attorneys \n     for South Carolina and Utah, declared that states' support \n     for the Texas sodomy law in the Supreme Court case of \n     Lawrence vs. Texas, which the court is expected to decide in \n     June or July. Pryor argues the Texas law should be upheld, \n     otherwise constitutional protections ``must logically extend \n     to activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, \n     bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest \n     and pedophilia (if the child should credibly claim to be \n     `willing').''\n       Hardly so.\n       It is a long step from sanctioning, or even tolerating, \n     consensual private activity between two adults to permitting \n     abusive crimes such as pedophilia. The law is perfectly \n     capable of drawing such distinctions in theory and in \n     practice.\n       We have cautiously supported Pryor's nomination, while \n     taking issue with a number of his controversial positions. \n     These include his defense of state Supreme Court Chief \n     Justice Roy Moore's decision to display the Ten Commandments \n     in the state Judicial Building, his opposition to multi-state \n     lawsuits against tobacco companies and his defense of utility \n     companies in upgrading their coal-fired power plants without \n     adding new pollution control devices.\n       Several of Bush's nominees for federal bench hold extreme \n     anti-gay views. Timony Tymkovich, confirmed to an appeals \n     court last month, has compared homosexuality to cockfighting, \n     bestiality, prostitution and suicide.\n       Pryor's confirmation hearings have not yet been set. The \n     Judicial Committee will certainly want an explanation of his \n     incendiary comments, which unfortunately are typical of the \n     nominees they will be asked to consider.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Huntsville Times, May 4, 2003]\n\n                           Pryor's Preaching\n\n       Churches promote faith; courtrooms promote justice.\n       Attorney General Bill Pryor usually has been what few \n     Alabama politicians seem to know how to be: principled. \n     Though unabashedly a conservative Republican, Pryor has \n     usually been more nonpartisan than partisan.\n       More than once, he has ignored the prevailing political \n     winds to do what he thought was right. Trying to reform the \n     state's sentencing system is a prime example. One that he \n     thought was right again. But this time Pryor has gotten it \n     wrong.\n       In a ``friend of the court'' brief filed almost three \n     months ago regarding the Texas sodomy case before the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, Pryor compared homosexual acts to \n     ``prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession \n     of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia.''\n       This is the same case, of course, the Pennsylvania Sen. \n     Rick Santorum, another conservative Republican, made \n     similarly troubling remarks about.\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\n       The problem here is neither that Pryor has a certain point \n     of view that others may not share, nor that he expressed it. \n     In the United States, we all have a right to think and speak \n     freely.\n       The problem is that as the attorney general of Alabama--and \n     President Bush's nominee to the 11th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals--Pryor did not separate his personal moral views from \n     his public role as a promoter of justice.\n       Bill Pryor has championed causes that many Republicans and \n     not a few Democrats would probably have walked away from: \n     such as the removal of the interracial marriage ban from the \n     state constitution and the recruitment of mentors for \n     underprivileged children, to mention a few.\n       Alabama has benefited from having him as attorney general, \n     and would probably benefit if he decided to seek an even \n     higher elected office one day.\n       Perhaps the nation would too, but not if Pryor plans to use \n     a judicial appointment as an opportunity to give his moral \n     points of view the heft of the law's brief seems to be a part \n     of a trend to infuse public policy and the law with morality \n     of an abashedly religious strain.\n       Until God--or whoever or whatever it is you do or do not \n     worship--decides to clarify the myriad matters of faith that \n     have caused us to separate into different churches, temples, \n     mosques, sects, and beliefs, it would be best for those who \n     believe to enjoy their beliefs in a way that allows others to \n     enjoy theirs--or to enjoy not having any beliefs at all.\n       Churches are supposed to promote faith, and courtrooms, \n     justice. If Pryor is confirmed to the 11th Circuit, he would \n     do well to honor this distinction.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the San Jose Mercury News, May 21, 2003]\n\n                           Coup in the Courts\n\n       President Bush has treated judicial nominations like tax \n     cuts: Declare, with a straight face, that the extreme is \n     reasonable and that any opponent is obstructionist.\n       In the case of judgeships, that means nominating one \n     conservative ideologue after another, knowing that Democrats \n     in a Republican Senate have neither the will nor a way to \n     challenge and defeat most of them.\n       Instead, the Democrats have picked their shots--and they \n     should continue to do that.\n       Contrary to his protestations, Bush has had tremendous \n     success. In his first 28 months of office, the Senate has \n     approved 121 of his nominations--better than President \n     Clinton averaged over his administration. Bush has named one \n     out of seven active federal judgeships.\n       What's at stake is whether Bush will be able to stuff the \n     federal courts with judges narrow in their view of minority \n     and women's rights, staunch in opposition to abortion, and \n     intent on overturning decisions that have been long accepted \n     by the courts and the public.\n       Individuals like James Leon Holmes, nominated to a federal \n     court in Arkansas, who has written that the role of a woman \n     ``is to place herself under the authority of the man.'' And \n     Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, who characterized Roe v. \n     Wade, the decision establishing a right to an abortion, as \n     ``the worst abomination of constitutional law in our \n     history.''\n       The latest troubling nomination is that of Los Angeles \n     Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl to the 9th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. That court is the ultimate authority, save for the \n     U.S. Supreme Court, for a huge swath of the West, including \n     California.\n       As an eager young lawyer in the Reagan administration, Kuhl \n     fought the IRS to retain a tax-exempt status for Bob Jones \n     University despite its record of religious and racial \n     discrimination. The Supreme Court later overturned that \n     decision 8-1. As a deputy attorney general, she co-wrote a \n     brief calling on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe. v. Wade. \n     Three years ago, she dismissed the suit of a breast-cancer \n     patient who claimed a violation of privacy after a drug-\n     company salesman watched her examination without her \n     permission. That appallingly insensitive ruling was also \n     overturned.\n       Kuhl has plenty of supporters among lawyers, including \n     Democrats, who say she's a good trial judge. If so, that's \n     where she should stay--not placed on an appeals court where \n     decisions are binding an all lower courts.\n       Both home state senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne \n     Feinstein, oppose Kuhl's appointment; traditionally, that's \n     been enough to sink a nomination. But Senate Republicans are \n     pushing ahead, after slipping by the Judiciary Committee on a \n     party-line vote.\n       Democrats have used the filibuster to delay two nominations \n     to federal appeals courts, that of Washington attorney Miguel \n     Estrada and Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen.\n       Bush deserves the right to appoint capable, smart, \n     conservative judges. But senators must exercise their \n     constitutional veto over nominees whose values and judicial \n     philosophy are way out of the mainstream.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 20, 2003]\n\n                         Not Fit for the Bench\n\n\n                alabama's pryor is a walking stereotype\n\n       The problem with Senate Republicans during the Clinton \n     administration was that they too often assumed the \n     president's nominations to the federal bench were wild-eyed \n     liberals. Now that a Republican president is in the White \n     House, the Democrats and their friends are playing tit-for-\n     tat by viewing Mr. Bush's nominations as reactionary by \n     definition.\n       The Post-Gazette has deplored these tendencies, which have \n     made it difficult to sort out the slanderous caricatures from \n     the solid characters. It is why we rose strongly to the \n     defense last year of Western Pennsylvania's D. Brooks Smith, \n     a Republican nominee who was eventually confirmed for an \n     appeals court seat after seeing his record distorted by \n     liberal special-interest groups.\n       One trouble with crying wolf is that, just as in the old \n     story, sometimes a real wolf turns up. Such a one is Alabama \n     Attorney General Bill Pryor, whom The Washington Post \n     observed in an editorial ``is a parody of what Democrats \n     imagine Bush to be plotting for the federal courts.''\n       If Mr. Pryor is confirmed for a seat on the 11th U.S. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, he will be well placed to begin \n     preying on a number of settled legal precedents and \n     doctrines. Roe v. Wade? ``The worst abomination in the \n     history of constitutional law'' in the United States, he \n     said. Separation of church and state? He's cozy with the \n     religious right, so he looks favorably on such things as the \n     display of the Ten Commandments on public property. Protect \n     the environment? Mr. Pryor thinks the feds should get out of \n     that business and leave it to the states.\n       And so it goes with this reactionary's reactionary, who \n     would be in the mainstream only if it were far to the right.\n       On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee put off voting \n     on Mr. Pryor's nomination amid concerns raised about his \n     fund-raising activities for the Republican Attorneys General \n     Association, specifically focusing on how accurately he \n     answered the committee's questions.\n       This is no small matter, but it was dismissed as ``pure \n     politics, pure and simple'' by Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin \n     Hatch, R-Utah. In a sense, he was right, except that the \n     process began in the White House. This nomination is entirely \n     political, meant to curry favor with President Bush's right-\n     wing constituency.\n       The delay represents an opportunity for Pennsylvania's Sen. \n     Arlen Specter, who has a reputation for reason and moderation \n     but has been fretting for days about exposing his flank to a \n     right-wing challenger in the primary. Whatever happens with \n     the fund-raising questions. Sen.

Mr. Pryor is \n     among the most extreme of the Bush administration's far-right \n     judicial nominees. If he is confirmed, his rulings on civil \n     rights, abortion, gay rights and the separation of church and \n     state would probably do substantial harm to rights of all \n     Americans. Senators from both parties should oppose his \n     confirmation.\n       Mr. Pryor, who has been nominated for a seat on the Federal \n     Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, has \n     views that fall far outside the political and legal \n     mainstream. He has called Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion-\n     rights ruling, ``the worst abomination'' of constitutional \n     law in our history. He recently urged the Supreme Court to \n     uphold laws criminalizing gay sex, a position the court \n     soundly rejected last month. He has defended the installation \n     of a massive Ten Commandments monument in Alabama's main \n     judicial building, which a federal appeals court recently \n     held violated the First Amendment. And he has urged Congress \n     to repeal an important part of the Voting Rights Act.\n       Moderates in the Senate and in the legal community have \n     repeatedly called on the Bush administration to stop trying \n     to stack the federal judiciary with far-right partisans like \n     Mr. Pryor. But the White House and its supporters have chosen \n     instead to lash out at these reasonable critics. In a \n     shameful bit of demagoguery, a group founded by Boyden Gray, \n     a White House counsel under the first President George Bush, \n     has run newspaper ads accusing Mr. Pryor's critics in the \n     Senate of opposing him because he is Catholic.\n       At today's committee meeting, much of the attention will be \n     on Arlen Spector, the Pennsylvania Republican who could cast \n     the deciding vote. Mr. Specter owes it to his constituents to \n     break with the White House and vote against Mr. Pryor, whose \n     extremist views are out of step with most Pennsylvanians'. \n     Standing up for an independent, nonideological judiciary is \n     an urgent cause, and one that should find support on both \n     sides of the aisle.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Charleston Gazette, June 30, 2003]\n\n                      Extremist Far-Right Nominee\n\n       President Bush hopes to pack the federal judiciary with \n     numerous ultraconservative appointees who eventually will \n     revoke women's right to choose abortion--a goal of the \n     Republican national platform--and make other legal changes \n     desired by the party's ``religious right'' wing.\n       Many of the White House appointees are evasive about their \n     personal views when questioned at Senate confirmation \n     hearings.

He said he once \n     refused to take his family to Disney World on a day that gays \n     attended, because his personal ``value judgment'' dictated \n     it.\n       In the past, he has sneered at the U.S. Supreme Court as \n     ``nine octogenarian lawyers'' because the justices delayed an \n     execution that Pryor desired.\n       The New York Times commented:\n       ``As Alabama attorney general, Mr. Pryor has turned his \n     office into a taxpayer-financed right-wing law firm.

The latest is William H. Pryor, the Alabama \n     Attorney General.\n       Pryor's nomination to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is \n     outrageous. It is designed, as are the president's other \n     ideological nominations, to appeal to the base instincts of \n     the right-wing, conservative Christian element of the \n     Republican Party.\n       Pryor makes no attempt to distance himself from his \n     outlandish comments. He has said that if a Texas law \n     outlawing homosexual sex were overturned, it would open the \n     door to legalized ``prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, \n     bestiality, possession of child pornography and even invest \n     and pedophilia.''\n       That statement is breathtakingly bigoted.\n       But Pryor is a multi-dimensional ideologue. Here's his \n     stance on Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision allowing \n     abortion: The law is ``an abominable decision'' and ``the \n     worse abomination in the history of constitutional law.'' He \n     opposes abortion even in the case of rape.\n       Though these are his personal opinions about legal \n     decisions, he says, he would uphold the law as an appellate \n     court judge. That is disingenuous, at best. He admitted \n     during a Senate hearing that in a meeting with a conservative \n     group, he ended by saying a ``prayer for the next \n     administration: Please, God, no more Souters.''\n       David Souter, a Supreme Court justice appointed by the \n     first President Bush, is widely scourned by conservatives \n     because he is a moderate rather than a conservative Supreme \n     Court justice.\n       Only once during questioning before the Senate Judiciary \n     hearing on his nomination did Pryor backtrack on previous \n     remarks. He admitted he made an inappropriate remark when he \n     referred to the Supreme Court as ``nine octogenarian lawyers \n     who happen to sit on the Supreme Court.'' He made the comment \n     after the Court issued a stay of execution in his state. They \n     stay was issued in order to determine whether the use of the \n     electric chair was unconstitutional.\n       His background also includes efforts to allow students-led \n     prayers in schools; defense of an Alabama judge who displays \n     the 10 Commandments in his courtroom; and support of Alabama \n     prison guards who handcuff prisoners to hitching posts during \n     the summer.\n       Civil rights activists signed a letter arguing against \n     Pryor's confirmation. The letter said the group was alarmed \n     that Pryor ``. . . is not only an avowed proponent of the \n     modern states rights movement, now called federalism, but he \n     has also asked Congress to `repeal or amend' Section 5 of the \n     Voting Rights Act, which he said is an `affront to \n     federalism.' '' The section requires Justice Department \n     approval to changes in voting procedures made by states.\n       This ideologue is also delusional. Pryor believes that only \n     guilty people are executed in this country. The judicial \n     system, he said, has ``extraordinary safeguards, many \n     safeguards.'' Further, he said, ``the system catches \n     errors.''\n       One of the benefits of nominating a right-winger like Pryor \n     is that the president gets valuable political points for it. \n     Even if Pryor is not confirmed by the Senate, and he should \n     not be, the president still wins. In this age of cynical \n     politics, Bush will get credit among the most distasteful \n     elements of his party for nominating one of their own for a \n     seat on the bench.

Go-along-to-get-along \n     Republicans may want to approve Pryor rather than buck their \n     president.\n       But the appointment of Pryor, 41, to a lifetime seat on the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals would be an endorsement of an ominous \n     view of American law. At this month's Senate Judiciary \n     Committee hearing, he defended--even amplified on--his \n     disturbing views. His candor is refreshing but it leaves \n     squirming senators no cover.\n       ``Congress . . . should not be in the business of public \n     education nor the control of street crime,'' he has argued, a \n     position at odds with Bush's education initiative and support \n     for beefed-up law enforcement and tougher criminal penalties.\n       Pryor contends that the Constitution does not grant the \n     federal government power to protect the environment. He \n     regards Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision \n     upholding the legal right to an abortion, as ``the worst \n     abomination of constitutional law in our history'' and hopes \n     that the landmark ruling will be overturned.\n       He would urge repeal of the 1965 Voting Rights Act \n     requirement that the federal government review state and \n     local changes to voting procedures that may affect \n     minorities. It's ``an affront to federalism and an expensive \n     burden,'' Pryor believes.\n       Before the Supreme Court last week struck down Texas' anti-\n     sodomy statute, he argued for upholding that law and another \n     like it in Alabama. If the Constitution protects the choice \n     of a sexual partner, he contends, it also permits \n     ``prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality . . . and \n     even incest and pedophilia.'' He also believes that the 1st \n     Amendment's establishment clause should permit a two-ton \n     granite representation of the Ten Commandments to sit in an \n     Alabama courthouse.\n       These views and Pryor's lack of judicial experience caused \n     the American Bar Assn. to splinter over his fitness for the \n     appeals seat.\n       With the Senate already having confirmed so many of Bush's \n     picks for the federal bench, there's no argument for this \n     unqualified nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have also heard from a number of organizations and \nindividuals concerned about justice before the Federal courts.

The ABA's evaluation also indicates concern about this \nnomination. Their Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Mr. \nPryor a partial rating of ``not qualified'' to sit on the Federal \nbench. Of course this is not the first ``not qualified'' rating or \npartial ``not qualified'' rating that this administration's judicial \nnominees have received. As of today, 20 of President Bush's nominees \nhave received some form of ``not qualified'' rating. Perhaps that is a \nreflection of the ideological basis for so many of these nominations, \nand the concern on the part of some on what has been a rather compliant \nABA committee that these nominees cannot be fair to every litigant who \nmay come before them.\n  Like Jeff Sutton, Bill Pryor has been a crusader for the federalist \nrevolution, but Mr. Pryor has taken an even more prominent role. Having \nhired Mr. Sutton to argue several key federalism cases in the Supreme \nCourt, Mr. Pryor is the principal leader of the federalist movement, \npromoting state power over the Federal Government.\n  A leading proponent of what he refers to as the ``federalism \nrevolution,'' Mr. Pryor seeks to revitalize State power at the expense \nof Federal protections, seeking opportunities to attack Federal laws \nand programs designed to guarantee civil rights protections. He has \nurged that Federal laws on behalf of the disabled, the aged, women, \nminorities, and the environment all be limited.\n  He has argued that the Federal courts should cut back on the \nprotections of important and well-supported federal laws including the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Clean Water Act, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. He has \nrepudiated decades of legal precedents that permitted individuals to \nsue States to prevent violations of Federal civil rights regulations. \nMr. Pryor's aggressive involvement in this ``federalist revolution'' \nshows that he is a goal-oriented, activist conservative who has used \nhis official position to advance his ``cause.'' Alabama was the only \nState to file an amicus brief arguing that Congress lacked authority to \nenforce the Clean Water Act. He argued that the Constitution's commerce \nclause does not grant the Federal Government authority to prevent \ndestruction of waters and wetlands that serve as a critical habitat for \nmigratory birds. While this is a sign to most people of the extremism, \nMr. Pryor trumpets his involvement in these cases and is proud of his \nwork to limit Congress's authority.\n  Bill Pryor's passion is not some obscure legal theory but something \nin which he has believed deeply since he was a student and something \nthat guides his actions as a lawyer. Mr. Pryor's speeches and testimony \nbefore Congress demonstrate just how deeply-rooted his views are, how \nmuch he seeks to effect a fundamental change in the country, and how \nfar outside the mainstream his views are. Mr. Pryor's judicial ideology \nis something in which he deeply believes, not just an argument that he \nmakes as a lawyer.\n  Mr. Pryor is candid about the fact that his view of federalism is \ndifferent from the current operation of the Federal Government--and \nthat he is on a mission to change the Government to fit his vision. His \ngoal is to continue to limit Congress's authority to enact laws under \nthe 14th amendment and the commerce clause--laws that protect women, \nethnic and racial minorities, senior citizens, the disabled, and the \nenvironment--in the name of sovereign immunity. Is there any question \nthat he would pursue his agenda as a judge on the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals--reversing equal rights progress and affecting the \nlives of millions of Americans for decades to come?\n  His strong views against providing counsel and fair procedures for \ndeath row inmates have led Mr. Pryor to doomsday predictions about the \nrelatively modest reforms in the Innocence Protection Act to create a \nsystem of competent counsel. When the U.S. Supreme Court questioned the \nconstitutionality of Alabama's method of execution in 2000, Mr. Pryor \nlashed out at the Supreme Court, saying\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\n``[T]his issue should not be decided by nine octogenarian lawyers who \nhappen to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.'' Aside from the obvious \ndisrespect this comment shows for this Nation's highest Court, it shows \nagain how results-oriented Mr. Pryor is. Of course an issue about cruel \nand unusual punishment ought to be decided by the Supreme Court. It is \naddressed in the eighth amendment, and whether or not we agree on the \nruling, it is an elementary principle of constitutional law that it be \ndecided by the Supreme Court, no matter how old its members.\n  Mr. Pryor has also vigorously opposed an exemption for persons with \nmental retardation from receiving the death penalty, exhibiting more \ncertainty than compassion. He authored an amicus curiae brief to the \nSupreme Court arguing that the Court should not declare that executing \nmentally retarded persons violated the eighth amendment. After losing \non that issue, Mr. Pryor made an unsuccessful argument to the eleventh \ncircuit that an Alabama death-row defendant is not mentally retarded.\n  Mr. Pryor has spoken harshly about the moratorium imposed by former \nIllinois Governor George Ryan, calling it a ``spectacle,'' and saying \nthat it will ``cost innocent lives.'' How can someone so sure of his \nposition be relied upon to hear these cases fairly? Over the last few \nyears, many prominent Americans have begun raising concerns about the \ndeath penalty, including current and former supporters of capital \npunishment. For example, Justice O'Connor recently said there were \n``serious questions'' about whether the death penalty is fairly \nadministered in the United States, and added: ``[T]he system may well \nbe allowing some innocent defendants to be executed.'' In response to \nthis uncertainty, Mr. Pryor offers us nothing but his steadfast belief \nthat there is no problem with the application of the death penalty. \nThis is a position that cannot possibly offer a fair hearing to a \ndefendant on death row.\n  Mr. Pryor's troubling views on the criminal justice system are not \nlimited to capital punishment. He has advocated that counsel need not \nbe provided to indigent defendants charged with an offense that carries \na sentence of imprisonment if the offense is classified as a \nmisdemeanor. The Supreme Court nonetheless ruled that it was a \nviolation of the sixth amendment to impose a sentence that included a \npossibility of imprisonment if indigent persons were not afforded \ncounsel.\n  Like Carolyn Kuhl, Priscilla Owen, and Charles Pickering, Bill Pryor \nis hostile to a woman's right to choose. There is every indication from \nhis record and statements that he is committed to reversing Roe v. \nWade. Mr. Pryor describes the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade \nas the creation ``out of thin air [of] a constitutional right,'' and \nopposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest.\n  Mr. Pryor does not believe Roe is sound law, neither does he give \ncredence to Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He has said that, ``Roe is not \nconstitutional law,'' and that in Casey, ``the court preserved the \nworst abomination of constitutional law in our history.'' When Mr. \nPryor appeared before the committee, he repeated the mantra of those \nwho desire confirmation, saying that he would ``follow the law.'' But \nhis deeply held and intense commitment to overturning established \nSupreme Court precedent that protects fundamental privacy rights makes \nit impossible to give his promises any credence.\n  Bill Pryor has expressed his opposition to fair treatment of all \npeople regardless of their sexual orientation. The positions he took in \na brief he filed in the recent Supreme Court case of Lawrence v. Texas \nwere entirely repudiated by the Supreme Court majority just a few weeks \nago when it declared that the ``The petitioners are entitled to respect \nfor their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or \ncontrol their destiny by making their private conduct a crime.'' Mr. \nPryor's belief is the opposite. He would deny certain Americans the \nequal protection of the laws, and would subject the most private of \ntheir behaviors to public regulation.\n  Mr. Pryor's comments have revealed an insensitivity to the barriers \nthat disadvantaged persons and members of minority groups and women \ncontinue to face in the criminal justice system.\n  In testimony before Congress, Bill Pryor has urged repeal of Section \n5 of the Voting Rights Act the centerpiece of that landmark statute \nbecause, he says, it ``is an affront to federalism and an expensive \nburden that has far outlived its usefulness.'' That testimony \ndemonstrates that Mr. Pryor is more concerned with preventing an \n``affront'' to the States' dignity than with guaranteeing all citizens \nthe right to cast an equal vote. It also reflects a long-discredited \nview of the Voting Rights Act. Since the enactment of the statute in \n1965, every Supreme Court case to address the question has rejected the \nclaim that Section 5 is an ``affront'' to our system of federalism. \nWhether under Earl Warren, Warren Burger, or William Rehnquist, the \nUnited States Supreme Court has recognized that guaranteeing all \ncitizens the right to cast an equal vote is essential to our democracy \nnot a ``burden'' that has ``outlived its usefulness.''\n  On all of these issues, the environment, voting rights, women's \nrights, gay rights, federalism, and more, William Pryor's record of \nactivism and advocacy is clear. That is his right as an American \ncitizen, but it does not make him fit to be a judge or likely to be \nfair on such issues. I think the length and level of his devotion to \nthese issues creates a situation in which his impartiality on such \nissues would reasonably be questioned by litigants in his court. He \nshould not be confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished Senator from California, and \nI intend to take the floor as soon as she is through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Object to what?\n  Mr. HATCH. You cannot object.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the Senator from Utah, does the chairman of the \ncommittee, have the opportunity to yield the floor to another Member of \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He does not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What did the Senator from Utah just try to do?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It was a nice thing.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom California be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I want to say to \neveryone who is listening, in case you are confused, we are not on the \nEnergy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Is there an objection to the unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Utah?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me take the floor. I am going to yield \nthe floor in just a second.\n  I expect the distinguished Senator from California to be recognized \nso she can take 15 minutes. Then I am going to warn the Senate, right \nnow, the minute she is through, I want the floor back, and I have a \nright to have it as the leader on the majority side. Am I right, \nparliamentarily?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is seeking recognition. \nHe has priority of recognition as the majority manager.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota will state his \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah stated that when he \nfinishes his presentation, he expects the Senator from California to be \nrecognized, after which he expects to be recognized.\n  Does the Senator from Utah have a right to yield the floor to the \nSenator from California?\n  Mr. HATCH. I didn't do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He does not have the right to yield the floor, \nbut he did not propose that as a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has priority \nrecognition as manager of the bill. He\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\nmay seek the floor on that basis following the presentation by the \nSenator from California, not by prearrangement, however; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the \nchairman of the committee and I thank the ranking member.\n  I have served on this committee for 10 years. I love this committee. \nThe Presiding Officer serves on this committee. It is a challenging \ncommittee. It is particularly challenging for me because I am a \nnonlawyer. I have had a great opportunity to work across the aisle on \nany number of different proposals with the chairman of the committee, \nwith the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, with Senator Lindsey Graham, \nwith others. I have enjoyed it. There has always been a spirit of \ncollegiality.\n  However, that spirit of collegiality is at a crossroads. Something \nvery ugly has been injected. It has to do with this nominee, and it has \nto do with circumstances around this nominee. I will spend a few \nmoments discussing them. This kind of thing that has been going on has \nto stop.\n  Last week, the Democratic members of the committee were accused by \noutside groups, and even some of our colleagues on the committee, of \napplying an anti-Catholic religious litmus test on the nomination of \nWilliam Pryor. These charges are false. They are baseless. They are \noffensive. And they are beneath the dignity of a Senate committee \ntasked with making very important decisions on the future of the \nFederal judiciary.\n  We have heard a lot about the ad. I never thought I would see an ad \nlike this. It is a rather insidious ad. I will not show it, but I will \ndescribe it. It is two courtroom doors. Atop it says ``Judicial \nChambers.'' On the doorknob hangs a sign that says ``Catholics Need Not \nApply.'' When I saw this ad, I thought we were going back decades. When \nI saw this ad, I thought: Uh-oh, if there is one thing I know--and I \nhave watched cities polarized, I have seen assassinations result from \nthe polarization--I know what happens when people seek to divide. One \nof the easiest ways to divide is to use race or religion in an adverse \nmanner. That is what this ad sought to do. It sought to divide.\n  Then I watched C-SPAN the other night. I saw clergy discussing the \nad. I saw them beginning to believe that religious litmus tests were \nbeing used by the Judiciary Committee. Now, in fact, that has never \nbeen the case.\n  Senator Schumer pointed out during Mr. Pryor's markup in the \ncommittee that this kind of thing is becoming somewhat of a pattern. \nOnce it becomes a pattern, no one really knows where it goes.\n  We have not opposed a lot of nominees. The ranking member has made \nthat clear: 140 nominations have gone through. Just today we had a \nhearing in the morning. I introduced two California judges who were \ngoing through in a 4-month period of time, new judges produced because \nthe chairman and the ranking member agreed there was a very heavy \ncaseload in San Diego and there should be a number of new judges. They \nwere nominated in May. Already these judges have had their hearing. So \ngood things do happen.\n  However, each time we have opposed a nominee, there has been bias \nused as a rationale for those who do not agree with us, to purport that \nbias is part of our rationale. It happened with an anti-Hispanic charge \nwith Miguel Estrada, an anti-woman charge with Priscilla Owen, an anti-\nBaptist charge with Charles Pickering, and now with William Pryor an \nanti-Catholic charge.\n  You have no idea what happens when this begins to circulate \nthroughout the electorate. People do not know exactly what goes on. It \nis a dastardly thing to do. In a sense it is scurrilous, because it \ncaters to the basic insecurity of all of us who share a religion that \nmay be different from someone else's. So it has a truly insidious \nquality to it.\n\n  To call us antiwoman--I don't have to tell you how bizarre it is for \nme to be called antiwoman. And to say we have set a religious litmus \ntest is really equally false.\n  Many of us have concerns about nominees sent to the Senate who feel \nso very strongly, and sometimes stridently, and often intemperately \nabout certain political beliefs and who make intemperate statements \nabout those beliefs. So we raise questions about whether those nominees \ncan be truly impartial, particularly when the law conflicts with those \nbeliefs.\n  It is true that abortion rights can often be at the center of these \nquestions. As a result, accusations have been leveled that any time \nreproductive choice becomes an issue, it acts as a litmus test against \nthose whose religion causes them to be anti-choice. But pro-choice \nDemocrats on this committee have voted for many nominees who are anti-\nchoice and who believe that abortion should be illegal, some of whom \nmay even have been Catholic. I do not know because I have never \ninquired.\n  So this truly is not about religion. This is about confirming judges \nwho can be impartial and fair in the administration of justice. I think \nwhen a nominee such as William Pryor makes inflammatory statements and \nevidences such strongly held beliefs on a whole variety of core issues, \nit is hard for many of us to accept that he can set aside those beliefs \nand act as an impartial judge--particularly because he is very young, \n41; particularly because this is a lifetime appointment; and \nparticularly because we have seen so many people who have received \nlifetime appointments then go on and do just what they want, regardless \nof what they said. So it is of some concern to us.\n  I hope these accusations will stop. I hope we can focus on the merits \nof each nominee, not on baseless allegations against Members of the \nSenate who are trying to do their constitutional duties.\n  I am very concerned because, to date, not a single Member on the \nother side has said they believe these ads are baseless, have said they \nknow we do not practice this kind of decisionmaking. No one has \ndisavowed these ads.\n  So I call on the committee to disavow these ads. I call on the \nadministration to disavow these ads. And I call on them to set the \nrecord straight.\n  There was a time in our history when the phrase ``Catholics need not \napply'' was used to keep countless qualified Americans from pursuing \nthe American dream. The same can be said for ``no Jews need apply'' and \n``no Irish need apply.'' And, much like Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nwhen she first looked for her first job and I first looked for my first \njob, really ``women need not apply.''\n  In fact, I lost my first job to a man who was less qualified than I, \nbut I was a woman and I had a small child and at that time that was not \nmuch coin of the realm to get a job. So I was beaten out many times by \nmen who were less qualified--had less academic experience, less \ngraduate experience, et cetera.\n  These were dark times in American history and many of us in this body \nremember those times. But every one of us should be absolutely \ncommitted to preventing those days from ever recurring. What this is a \nsign of is that those days are beginning to occur again.\n\n  I hope we do not see political cheap-shot artists bringing painful \nphrases back for the purposes of intimidating Senators and stacking \nFederal courts. We should be above that in this debate. This is the \nSenate, as the distinguished Senator from Nevada has said, and our \nconstitutional duty should not be marred by false allegations or \nintimidating political tactics. Our Nation's history in fighting \nbigotry of all kinds must continue. I urge my colleagues very sincerely \nto condemn these tactics and move on to debating the merits of \ncontroversial nominees.\n  Now a second event at the Pryor markup also disturbed me greatly and \nwas especially troubling because we faced a repeated refusal to \nacknowledge the clear application of a longstanding committee rule on \nending debate. Without the violation of the rule, Mr. Pryor would still \nbe before the Judiciary Committee, as I deeply believe he should be.\n  The Judiciary Committee rules contain a clause known as Rule 4 that \nprevents closing off debate on a nominee unless at least one member of \nthe minority agrees to do so.\n\n[[Page S10233]]\n\n  It isn't used a lot but it has been used before when I have been on \nthe committee.\n  During debate on the Pryor nomination, the Ranking Member attempted \nto invoke this rule because members of the minority did not believe \nthat an ongoing investigation into Mr. Pryor's nomination had been \ngiven sufficient time.\n  Serious allegations were made about Mr. Pryor's truthfulness to the \ncommittee during the hearing, and staff had been looking into those \nallegations. Put simply, the job has not been completed.\n  But, as Chairman Hatch did earlier this Congress with regard to the \nnomination of Deborah Cook and John Roberts, he chose to ignore this \nrule and force through a vote over the objections of every member of \nthe minority on the committee.\n  We thought the issue had been resolved during discussions over what \nhappened last time, but apparently we were wrong.\n  The rule contains the following language:\n\n       The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to \n     bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is \n     objection to bringing the matter to a vote without further \n     debate, a rollcall vote of the Committee shall be taken, and \n     debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter \n     to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the \n     affirmative, one of which must be cast by the Minority.\n\n  That is a reading on its face. It stands on its face. It is what it \nis.\n  Over the last few decades, it has clearly meant that unless one \nmember of the minority agrees to cut off debate and move straight to a \nvote, no vote can occur. This is one of the only protections the \nminority party has in the Judiciary Committee. Without it, there might \nnever be debate at all. A chairman could convene a markup, demand a \nvote, and the entire process would take 2 minutes. This is not how a \ndeliberative body should function, and more importantly, it is contrary \nto the rules. Either the rules are observed or we have chaos on the \ncommittee. If we do not like the rules, we should change the rules. But \nwe should follow the rules.\n  As I understand it, this rule was first instituted in 1979. Senator \nKennedy was chairman of the committee at the time. It has been followed \never since.\n  Senator Hatch, our current chairman, has also followed the rule. I \nmake no bones about the fact that I am very fond of the chairman, but \nhe has been going through some kind of a change lately, and I don't \nquite know what it is.\n  During the markup of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the civil rights division, there was some fear that \nRepublicans, who had the votes to defeat the nomination would move \ndirectly to a vote and prevent any debate on the issue at the \nmarkup. Democrats, on the other hand, wanted the chance to explain \ntheir position, and maybe even try to change some minds on the other \nside.\n\n  During that markup, then, there was significant discussion about what \nrule 4, the rule about cutting off debate, really means. At one point, \nit is interesting to note, Chairman Hatch himself commented that:\n\n       At the appropriate time, I will move to proceed to a vote \n     on the Lee nomination. I assume there will be no objection. \n     It seems to me he deserves a vote. People deserve to know \n     where we stand on this issue. Then we will, pursuant to Rule \n     IV, vote on whether to bring the Lee nomination to a vote. In \n     order to vote on the nomination, we need at least one \n     Democrat to vote to do so.\n\n  That is precisely what we are discussing. The situation then was the \nsame as the situation regarding Mr. Pryor. In order to vote on the \nnomination, we need at least one Democrat to vote to do so. But we \nnever even had the chance to vote on cutting off debate.\n  I don't need to lecture this body that we are a nation of laws. We \nknow that. We expect these laws to be obeyed. This is a Senate of \nrules. Our rule book is 1,600 pages long. There is no greater expert on \nrules than the senior Senator from the great State of West Virginia. \nRules have always been observed. Some of them are complicated. This \nhappens to be pretty simple, and we all understand it.\n  I want to spend a moment on the materials that have been before us \nthat are being investigated. The materials in question came to the \nJudiciary Committee just 2 or 3 weeks ago.\n  Those materials raise real questions about whether Mr. Pryor misled \nthe committee about his activities on behalf of the Republican \nAttorneys General Association, a fundraising organization that I \nbelieve raises serious concerns about conflicts of interest.\n  For instance, questions have been raised about whether Mr. Pryor \nraised money from tobacco companies, while at the same time arguing \nagainst pursuing those companies through litigation. I don't know \nwhether this allegation is true or not true. None of us do. I wasn't \nreally prepared to vote. But we should look into it and we should be \nable to match his statements to the committee with the facts.\n  There are other areas where the documents given to the committee \nsuggest that Mr. Pryor may not have been completely forthcoming at his \nhearing.\n  We will never get past the partisan bad-feelings that are \nincreasingly apparent in the Judiciary Committee if we cannot even rely \non having our rules followed to the extent of carrying out an \ninvestigation with materials about which none of us knew existed when \nwe had the hearing on the nominee.\n  On the merits, this is a nominee who has been before us for just a \nfew months.\n  I mentioned the investigation. I mentioned rule 4. But let me go into \na couple of the merits from our side and from our point of view.\n  He used his position as Attorney General to limit the scope of \ncrucial civil rights laws like the Violence Against Women's Act, the \nAge Discrimination In Employment Act, the American with Disabilities \nAct, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Family Medical Leave Act.\n  He said that he doesn't believe that the Federal Government should be \ninvolved in ``education or street crime.''\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I beg your pardon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. I would rather finish my remarks. If I have time \nleft, I will yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wanted to clear up a misstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Pryor calls Roe v. Wade ``the worst abomination \nof constitutional law in our history.'' He has written that he could \n``never forget January 22, 1973, the day seven members of our highest \ncourt ripped out the life of millions of unborn children.'' That is a \nquote. It is a very strong statement.\n  He has lobbied for the repeal of section V of the Voting Rights Act.\n  After the Bush v. Gore decision, Pryor made the astounding statement, \n``I'm probably the only one who wanted [the decision] 5-4 . . . I \nwanted Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary and \njudicial selection so we can have no more appointments like Justice \nSouter.''\n  This is a sitting attorney general taking on a Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court by name. I have never heard of that before. Of course, \nthere is always a first time. It was also an attack on a Justice who \nwas well known as being more moderate than he was expected to be and \nwho does not simply toe a party line.\n  So is Mr. Pryor saying he would want only those judges who remain \ncompletely faithful to the ideology of those who choose them? Is he \nsaying that Justice Souter is simply not conservative enough? I think \nhe is.\n  Mr. Pryor has taken positions so extreme that they are at odds with \nthe rest of the Nation's attorneys general. For example, he was the \nonly attorney general to argue against a key provision in the Violence \nAgainst Women Act on federalism grounds.\n  So there is a reason we feel strongly about it.\n  My experience is that in appointing someone to the trial bench when \nthat individual has never been a judge is probably a good idea, even if \nthey are an attorney general. One can make some judgments about people \nwho hold political office and who are strong advocates as to whether in \nfact they can separate themselves from their ideology, whatever that \nideology may be.\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\nI believe people can do this. I voted for Jeffrey Sutton because I had \nthat belief. In this case, I am not so sure because the rhetoric is so \nstrident and so very intemperate.\n  The Senator from Alabama, who is present on the floor, believes he \ncan, and there are people who believe he can. But I think the jury is \nout because there is a venture into an attack on a sitting U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice, there is a characterization of a landmark Supreme Court \ncase as ``an abomination,'' and other things as well. There is an \nattack on many significant--significant to those of us on this side of \nthe aisle--pieces of Federal legislation.\n  Truly, this is a nomination that deserves and merits debate--an open \ndebate. But I would like the debate to take place with the observation \nof the rules of the committee and after the investigation that is \nongoing is finished.\n  I hope the Senator from North Dakota's importuning to leadership is \ntaken. We don't need to have a cloture vote at this time on this \nnominee. That cloture vote can come after the results of the \ninvestigation are finished--certainly after the Energy bill--because I \nthink if a cloture vote is taken, these arguments I have made on the \nmerits of the case are really going to be dispositive as far as votes \non our side are concerned.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I thank very much the chairman \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia as well. I feel very deeply toward her. I think she is a \nwonderful person, and I think she is a fine Senator who works very hard \non the Judiciary Committee. And I appreciate her kind remarks about me.\n  Mr. President, let me make something clear. I keep hearing that we \nare going to vote on judges. Well, I certainly wish that were the case. \nWhat we are talking about is a cloture vote tomorrow, and one on \nFriday. It is not unusual at all, in fact it is a matter of course, for \nthe Senate to double track various items in the interests of the body \nto keep on top of matters.\n  The two trade bills are extremely important for this country, with \ntwo of our greatest allies and supporters, Chile and Singapore. It \nneeds to be done. There is no reason to have hours of debate on it. \nThere are some hard feelings about it, and so forth, but it can be \ndone.\n  We could have debated this in the hour before the cloture vote, which \nis what the rule calls for. If we invoke cloture, there will be ample \nopportunity to devote time to the total debate on General Pryor.\n  But now let me just make another point or two. The distinguished \nSenator from California is very upset at him because he actually took \nup to the Supreme Court an issue on the Violence Against Women Act. She \ntakes great umbrage at that. Unfortunately, he won. So to indicate that \nhe may be outside the mainstream or somebody who should not be \nsupported because he wins in front of the Supreme Court--and almost \neverything they criticize, as far as Supreme Court matters are \nconcerned, he has won on, until this last term when he lost on a couple \nof issues. And in every case he followed what he believed the law was \nregardless of his own personal beliefs. By the way, I am one of the \ncoauthors in the Congress of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  So to criticize him for something that the Supreme Court agrees with \nhim on gives an indication who is outside the mainstream. It isn't \nGeneral Pryor. And there is case after case after case where he wins \nthat has been criticized by our colleagues over there as though somehow \nor other he has been off the charts when it comes to the law. He has \nbeen on the charts. I admit, he has lost some, too. But I don't know of \nanybody who has taken multiple cases to the Supreme Court who has won \neverything. I know a few who have had pretty good records--and he has \none of the better records as an attorney general in this country.\n  My Democratic colleagues assert, in laundry list format, that General \nPryor is basically against everything they are for. He is ``out of the \nmainstream.'' We hear that over and over again. Pryor is against civil \nrights, disability rights, minorities and women themselves, the \nenvironment--the whole thing, presumably, and of course--abortion \nrights.\n  I am paraphrasing just one Democratic Senator's statement during the \nmarkup on July 23, 2003, but it is a fair representation of the types \nof assertions against General Pryor that are designed not to debate his \nfitness for the Federal bench but, rather, to strangle debate before it \nbegins. To paint this excellent nominee as so ``extreme'' as to be not \nworth discussing.\n  By the way, we did not bring this debate up tonight. I did not want \nto stand here tonight and answer these so-called allegations. My \nfriends on the other side did. They are the ones who interrupted the \nEnergy bill, which is being slow-walked. And we all understand that--as \nalmost everything has been this year.\n  These are what you call obstructionist tactics. And that is what is \ngoing on here. For them to come out here on the Senate floor and act \nlike, well, we are interrupting the energy debate--it is almost more \nthan I can take.\n\n  This energy debate is very important. It should be over. And I would \nbe happy to end it right now, have the cloture vote tomorrow. I will \neven give up the hour before cloture, if they want to, to keep working \non the Energy bill. But, no, that is not what they are doing. This is \nall a slow-walk to try to make this Congress look as if it isn't a good \none, even though, in spite of these slow-walks, we have done bill after \nbill after bill, some of them extremely important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Let me provide you with a succinct but very different, and much more \nrealistic picture of General Pryor.\n  General Pryor has been criticized as insensitive to the rights of the \ndisabled because he argued in the Garrett case that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act could not, under section 5 of the 14th amendment, \nvalidly abrogate States' 11th amendment immunity and authorize money \ndamage suits against States in Federal court.\n  But the Supreme Court agreed with General Pryor. He is being \ncriticized by others on the Senate floor for cases that he has won in \nthe Supreme Court.\n  He has also been criticized as insensitive to age-based \ndiscrimination because he and a bipartisan group of 23 other State \nattorneys general--23 other bipartisan State attorneys general--argued \nin the Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents case that the provision of the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act that allowed money damage suits \nagainst States in Federal courts was invalid under the 11th amendment, \nsomething that they should have argued because it is an important \nissue.\n  But, again, the Supreme Court agreed with General Pryor. He is being \ncriticized for winning cases in the Supreme Court as though he is the \none who is out of the mainstream. I don't think it takes any brains to \nrealize who is out of the mainstream. It is not General Pryor.\n  And we have heard criticism that he is insensitive to women's rights \nbecause he argued in the case of U.S. v. Morrison that neither the \ncommerce clause nor the 14th amendment provided Congress with the \nauthority to enact one civil remedies provision of the Violence Against \nWomen Act. But the Supreme Court agreed with him again.\n  Further, General Pryor has been criticized as anti-environment \nbecause of his argument in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County \nthat the Army Corps of Engineers did not have the authority, under the \nFederal Clean Water Act, to exercise Federal jurisdiction over entirely \nintrastate bodies of water--in this case, an abandoned gravel pit.\n  He was arguing for his State, which is what attorneys general are \nobligated to do. He even urged the Court not to reach the issue of \nwhether the Commerce Clause allowed Congress to regulate entirely \nintrastate bodies of water. The Court did not reach the Commerce Clause \nissue and again agreed with General Pryor's statutory interpretation \nargument.\n  So I guess those who oppose Pryor are saying when the Supreme Court \nagrees with you that an environmental statute should be interpreted in \naccordance with its actual language, rather than expanded through \nbureaucratic fiat, that makes you extreme\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\nand anti-environment, especially when you win the case in front of the \nSupreme Court. Talk about turning the world upside down.\n  General Pryor has even been criticized as insensitive to civil rights \nconcerns because of his argument in Alexander v. Sandoval that there is \nno private right of action under title VI of the Federal Civil Rights \nAct to challenge Alabama's policy of issuing drivers' licenses only to \nEnglish speakers--a policy that I understand is no longer in effect. \nOnce again, the Supreme Court agreed with his argument, holding that \nCongress, not Federal courts, should create causes of action to enforce \nFederal laws. That proposition should not be controversial, nor should \nsupporting it be held against General Pryor, who again won in the \nSupreme Court.\n\n  Finally, let me just give one more example. The Supreme Court, \nincluding Justice Souter, agreed with General Pryor's argument in the \nScheidler v. NOW case that Federal antiracketeering laws could not \nproperly be applied to pro-life protest groups who admittedly had not \nengaged in any activities covered by those laws with respect to the \ntargets of their protests. So while General Pryor may have criticized \nJustice Souter, they do not always disagree when it comes down to \ninterpreting the law.\n  Let me say this. A nominee is not an extremist--or should I put the \nword ``extremist'' in quotes because it seems to be a special word that \nis used so often by our colleagues--a nominee is not an extremist when \nthe positions he has taken have been consistently supported by Supreme \nCourt majorities. We know who the extremists are, and it isn't General \nPryor.\n  We will hear more about these cases, and I'm not saying Bill Pryor \nhas won all of these arguments at the Supreme Court. Not even the best \nlawyers can win them all, and he did lose a couple in this last \nsession. But to say that Bill Pryor is ``out of the mainstream,'' when \nhe has been such a successful advocate for his State in the Nation's \nhighest Court, is plainly wrong.\n  Anybody who makes that argument should think twice before they make \nthat type of argument.\n  We are in the middle of a slow walk here, trying to make the Senate \nlook bad--not by Republicans but by the other side. Frankly, to \ncomplain about double-tracking important things like a circuit court of \nappeals judgeship, the third branch of Government in our society, I \nthink is hitting a little bit below the belt.\n  It is certainly not unusual for cloture votes on judgeship nominees \nwhen the other side is filibustering for the first time in history \nFederal judicial nominees. I made the mistake of saying the Fortas \nnomination was the only filibuster up until now. I was wrong. I was \ncorrected by none other than former Senator Robert Griffin who led the \nfight against Fortas. He said: We weren't filibustering, and they knew \nit. They knew we had the votes to beat them up and down and they are \nthe ones who called for the cloture vote, which they barely won. They \nonly had 45 votes, and there were 12 who weren't there, many of whom \nwere going to vote against Fortas for justifiable reasons.\n  So these filibusters going on now are the only ones we've ever had in \nthe Senate. My colleagues on the other side are fond of saying: There \nhave been 140 Bush judges confirmed by us and only two have been \nfilibustered. That is two too many. Constitutionally, that is two too \nmany. One is one too many. I have to admit there were a few on our side \nduring the Clinton years who wanted to filibuster some of those judges. \nI personally stopped them with the help of the leadership and others \nwho thought it through that we should not be filibustering judges. It \nis the wrong thing to do. It should not be done, but it is being done \nhere.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will just wait for a few more minutes, I \nwant to make a point on Rule 4. For the life of me, I can't understand \nhow anybody reading the Judiciary Committee's Rule 4 would interpret it \nany differently than the way I did. I was surprised to see my comments \nduring the Bill Lan Lee nomination used against me. What happened there \nwas, I was Chairman. We had the votes to stop the nomination. The \nDemocrats didn't want us to stop the nomination because it would have \nbeen embarrassing and might have made it more difficult for them to \nrecess-appoint Lee, who I would have supported for any other job in \nGovernment but not that one. Because I knew he would get there and he \nwould use the power of the civil rights office to bring litigation \nagainst communities, municipalities who would have to give in rather \nthan spend millions of dollars in defense fees and accept full scale \nracial quotas. My fears were confirmed. Because they recess-appointed \nhim and he did bring that kind of litigation.\n  But with the Lee nomination, the Democrats started a filibuster of \ntheir own nominee. There was no reason for them to make any arguments. \nI would have given them a vote up or down right there. They started the \nfilibuster. I, in graciousness, agreed not to have a vote. I have to \nadmit I myself was in error by making some of the statements I did \nbecause I didn't realize the importance of this, nor had I even looked \nat Rule 4. But let's look at this Rule.\n  It says: ``The chairman shall entertain. . . .'' That means this is a \nrule that forces the chairman to entertain a nondebatable motion to \nbring a matter before the committee to a vote. It is a way of forcing \nthe chairman to give a vote that you could not otherwise give if the \nchairman decided not to do it.\n  ``The chairman shall entertain a nondebatable motion to bring a \nmatter before the committee to a vote if there is objection to bringing \nthe matter to a vote without further debate''--a rollcall vote, in \nother words. If the chairman refuses, they can then demand a rollcall \nvote of the committee to be taken. It is nondebatable. It has to \nhappen. And ``debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the \nmatter to a vote without further debate passes with 10 votes in the \naffirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority.''\n  Anybody with brains can read that and say: That is a rule that forces \na recalcitrant chairman to have to call a vote. But any competent \nperson reading that can also conclude, as have I, having consulted with \nthe two Parliamentarians beforehand, that a chairman cannot be \nforeclosed from his right to call a vote. Because if that were the \nrule, that means the minority would always control whether there would \never be a vote on a judge. That can't possibly be the rule, though that \nis what Democrats now are trying to say it is, with regard to the \nCommittee's vote on General Pryor.\n  We are all well aware by now that Democrats invoked the Judiciary \nCommittee's rule 4 to try to block a committee vote on General Pryor's \nnomination. Their interpretation of this rule was and is simply \nincorrect, and let me explain why.\n  Rule 4, entitled ``Bringing a Matter to a Vote,'' was clearly \nintended to serve as a tool by which a determined majority of the \ncommittee could force a recalcitrant chairman to bring a matter to \nvote. In fact, the rule provides, ``The Chairman shall entertain a non-\ndebatable motion to bring a matter before the Committee to a vote.'' On \nJuly 23, there was no motion to bring a matter before the committee to \na vote. In fact, there was an objection to voting, which I overruled. \nThus, on its face, rule 4 was inapplicable to the Pryor nomination.\n  If we followed the interpretation that Democratic members of the \ncommittee urged, it would mean that the committee minority would \nessentially control the committee's agenda. Essentially, the \ncommittee's chairman, on behalf of the majority, could not bring any \nnomination or piece of legislation to a vote without the affirmative \nvote of at least one member of the minority. So the chairman would have \nno right to call for a vote--the minority could restrict that right at \ntheir discretion.\n  No chairman would suffer such limitations on his power. The \nlimitation that exists in rule 4 as properly interpreted is entirely \nreasonable: that all members of the committee's majority, plus one \nminority member, can force the committee to have a vote over the \nobjection of the chairman--who, in that case, clearly would not be \nrepresenting his committee's majority. Rule 4 does not, as Democrats, \nwould currently, expediently, have it allow the minority to prevent a \nvote. Rule 4\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\ndoes not authorize filibusters in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, there has been no inconsistency in \nthe interpretation of this rule. During the Clinton administration, in \nan effort to prevent the defeat in committee of a controversial Justice \nDepartment nominee and spare both committee Democrats and the \nadministration considerable embarrassment, I chose not to exercise the \ninherent power that I and all committee chairmen have to bring a matter \nto a vote. President Clinton ultimately made a recess appointment of \nthe nominee. In retrospect, my graciousness to the other side, and my \nreliance on rule 4 to accomplish this was admittedly not the best \ncourse of action. I nevertheless believe that I had the power to bring \nthat matter to a vote, and that I used the discretion of the chairman \nto decide not to do so.\n  In short, there was no violation of committee rules or process in \nbringing the Pryor nomination to a vote on July 23, and any argument to \nthe contrary was merely a last-ditch effort to prevent the full Senate \nfrom considering it.\n  Unfortunately, that effort continues, in a manner equally offensive \nto the ultimate rules that govern the Senate, the U.S. Constitution.\n  The fact is, this was the fifth markup that General Pryor was on, \nhaving had his confirmation hearing on June 11. And there were \ncontinual Democratic efforts to try and thwart these markups every \ntime. I went along with a number of those efforts just out of \ngraciousness. But on July 23 everybody knew we were going to vote \nbecause at the prior markup they invoked the two-hour rule, the \nDemocrats did, so that we couldn't possibly, during the time the Senate \nwas in session, vote on Mr. Pryor.\n  I said: Well, then we will meet after the Senate goes out, which \nwould get around the two-hour rule. That meant about 9 o'clock at night \nthat night, the Thursday before we finally voted. Everybody knew I had \nthe votes. Everybody knew I was going to go ahead. We gave them all day \nto resolve any problems they had in this so-called ``investigation'' \nwhich is as phony as any investigation I have ever seen. By the time we \ngot ready, nobody told me about this, but by the time we got ready for \nthe vote or for the Senate to go out of session and for us to meet--and \nwe worked all day to make sure we would have a quorum--I was informed \nthat there was a personal exigency that existed, a legitimate personal \nexigency, that was known about earlier in the day, and I agreed to not \ncontinue the markup.\n  I put it over then until the next Wednesday, a full week, and said: \nGet the staffs together, interview the four witnesses you want to, \ninterview General Pryor in the process, but next Wednesday we are going \nto vote. There have been comments that our staff stalled that. That is \nnot true. I believe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts tried \nto make that point. That is not true.\n  As a matter of fact, the Democrats' staff refused to interview or ask \nquestions of Mr. Pryor who could have easily answered them all, and \nwould have, and in fact already had answered all of these questions at \nhis hearing and in writing. It was a phony ``gotcha'' type of a \nsituation which Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are putting \nnominees through.\n  Let me talk about the religious problem. I am getting a little tired \nof this. The outside groups have been outrageous with the smears they \nhave brought upon Republican judicial nominees. If you made one mistake \nin your life or what they perceive to be a mistake, you are going to be \nsmeared because of it. That perceived mistake is going to be enough for \nthese groups to try to ruin your whole career. The tactics used against \nJudge Kuhl are a perfect illustration. Her whole career she has had the \nsupport of Democratic and Republican judges and everybody else in \nCalifornia who really counts, it seems to me, as far as judges are \nconcerned. They found one thing they can beat into the ground, they \nthink. I don't think even that is valid. I think we can rebut that \ncase. And yet they are going to stop this brilliant woman who has a \nwell-qualified rating, their gold standard, from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  What is particularly offensive is what the outside groups have done \nagainst some of our nominees because of religious beliefs. By the way, \nthroughout the extensive, lengthy, one-of-a-kind hearing on Judge \nPryor, there were consistent questions about his deeply held beliefs. \nThis has caused a lot of people to become very upset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry. I am happy to yield for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Utah because he has hit on a \npoint that is deeply disturbing to me as a member of the Senate. I \nunderstand the Constitution talks about, we shall establish no \nreligion, and that is generally termed, in many cases, the separation \nof church and State, although the words ``separation of church and \nState'' do not appear in the Constitution.\n  What appears to be going on in the Judiciary Committee by Members of \nthe other side of the aisle is not a separation of church and State, \nbut a separation of anybody who believes in church and faith from any \npublic role. I do not believe that is what the Constitution was founded \nto do. I listened to the comments of the Senator from California who \nsaid because of General Pryor's ``strongly held beliefs'' basically he \ncannot be impartial.\n  So if you have strongly held religious beliefs, because of your \nstrongly held religious beliefs----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will not. Because of those beliefs that are referred \nto continually, the ``strongly held beliefs''----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have a----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor and the \nSenator has yielded for a question to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Are the beliefs that are referred to--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator yielded to me for a \nquestion, which I am about to ask.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If a Member of the Senate characterizes the words of \nanother Member of the Senate incorrectly, can those words be taken \ndown?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Utah, when the other side uses \nthe term ``deeply held beliefs'' over and over again, which we have \nheard on certain issues, would the Senator from Utah characterize what \nthose ``deeply held beliefs'' might pertain to, and on what issues, and \nwhat they might tie to from the perspective of religious beliefs?\n  Mr. HATCH. At least in one instance over and over it was on the issue \nof abortion. Several Democrats asked questions about that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. With respect to abortion and Mr. Pryor's beliefs, if \nthe Senator from Utah will allow me, I would like him to comment on a \nletter just received today, written by Carl Anderson, who is with the \nKnights of Columbus. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Knights of Columbus,\n\n                                     New Haven, CT, July 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to express concerns as to \n     the way the nomination of Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor \n     for the federal appeals court in Atlanta is being handled in \n     the Senate.\n       Many have questioned Mr. Pryor's fitness for this position \n     because of his ``deeply held beliefs,'' in particular his \n     opposition to abortion. Yet this ``deeply held belief'' is \n     grounded in Mr. Pryor's adherence to his Catholic faith, \n     which unequivocally declares abortion to be a grave evil.\n       Raising Mr. Pryor's ``deeply held beliefs'' in terms of his \n     qualifications to serve on the\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\n     federal bench thus suggests a de facto religious test for \n     public office, something clearly prohibited by the \n     Constitution. Of even more concern, it comes perilously close \n     to suggesting that Catholics who faithfully adhere to their \n     church's teaching on abortion, and perhaps other public moral \n     issues, are unfit to serve their country in the federal \n     judiciary.\n       Those who fault Mr. Pryor's ability to serve on the federal \n     bench argue that his deeply held beliefs preclude him from \n     judging and applying the law impartially. In effect, they are \n     trying to put Mr. Pryor in the very uncomfortable and very \n     unjust position of choosing between following his faith or \n     serving his country. No candidate for any public office \n     should be put in such a position. As Attorney General of \n     Alabama, Mr. Pryor has already demonstrated an unquestioned \n     record of applying the law impartially. He has already shown \n     that one can be a faithful Catholic, with ``deeply held \n     beliefs'' and still render unimpeachable service to his \n     country and fellow citizens.\n       Perhaps it is worth remembering on this occasion that many \n     distinguished jurists have dissented from the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Roe v. Wade including the current Chief Justice \n     of the United States and former Justice Byron White. To \n     suggest that such jurists are unfit to serve on the Federal \n     Bench does a disservice to the confirmation process itself. \n     Moreover, it is worth reiterating that the Catholic Church \n     teaches that abortion is unjust, not as a matter of faith, \n     but as a matter of natural justice which obligates all \n     citizens regardless of religious belief or lack thereof. This \n     is attested to by the many persons of diverse religious \n     belief or none at all who find abortion to be gravely unjust.\n       As head of the world's largest Catholic fraternal \n     organization and as a former member of the United States \n     Commission on Civil Rights, I am dismayed that the course of \n     Mr. Pryor's nomination compels me to make a point which by \n     now should be obvious: a good Catholic can also be a good \n     public servant. Much as I would wish otherwise, a \n     continuation of the trend that critics of Mr. Pryor's \n     nomination have set in motion will compel American Catholics \n     to face religious bigotry of a kind many of us thought to be \n     extinct in this nation. I urge that Mr. Pryor be judged \n     solely on his ability, his qualifications and his judicial \n     temperament.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Carl A. Anderson,\n                                                   Supreme Knight.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to refer to a couple of paragraphs and I want \nthe Senator to comment, because this is the point that I think is very \nimportant. There is a code word going on here--code words. When you \nhear the term ``deeply held beliefs''--I know the Senator from Illinois \nwas upset when I used the term ``religious'' as a characterization. I \nthink it is a completely accurate characterization of exactly what is \ngoing on. I am not alone. I will read a portion of the letter:\n\n       Many have questioned Mr. Pryor's fitness for this position \n     because of his ``deeply held beliefs,'' in particular his \n     opposition to abortion. Yet, this ``deeply held belief'' is \n     grounded in Mr. Pryor's adherence to his Catholic faith, \n     which unequivocally declares abortion to be a grave evil.\n\n  I am ending the quotation from Mr. Anderson's letter, and I just \nsuggest that it is obvious to anyone that this code word is an \nantireligious bias--not an antireligious bias if you don't hold your \nfaith deeply, but only if you do. Would the Senator from Utah care to \ncomment on this letter I just quoted briefly from?\n  Mr. HATCH. First, I have seen the letter dated July 30, 2003, which I \nbelieve the Senator has put into the Record. The first time I have seen \nit is tonight.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, the July 30 letter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right. I am concerned about this. I know some of these \noutside groups have been doing this regularly. I personally do not \nbelieve the distinguished Senator from California is--and I hope none \nof the other Democrat Senators on the committee are--against Mr. Pryor \nbecause of his religious beliefs. But I have to admit that people all \nover the country have been calling me and talking to me and saying, how \ncould it be anything else? People are drawing that conclusion, and I \nwill be honest with you, I am concerned about it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I \nwant to read the next paragraph and get his comment:\n\n       Raising Mr. Pryor's ``deeply held beliefs'' in terms of his \n     qualifications to serve on the Federal bench thus suggests a \n     de facto religious test for public office, something clearly \n     prohibited by the Constitution.\n\n  Would the Senator from Utah agree that the religious test for holding \nan office with the Government of the United States of America would be \nunconstitutional?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no question about that. We all have to agree that \nour Constitution states no religious test shall ever be required as a \nqualification to any office of public trust in the United States. I \ndon't believe any Senator would intentionally impose a religious test \non the President's judicial nominees. I do not think any Senators are \nguilty of anti-religious bias. However, I am deeply concerned that some \nare indirectly putting at issue the religious beliefs of several \njudicial nominees.\n  I will give you one illustration. During the Pryor hearing, General \nPryor's religion was an issue--and this is why I have raised it, which \nI have never done before. One Senator accused General Pryor during the \nhearing of ``asserting an agenda of your own, a religious belief of \nyour own.'' In his opening statement, another Senator stated:\n\n       ``In General Pryor's case, his beliefs are so well known, \n     so deeply held that it is very hard to believe that they are \n     not going to deeply influence the way he comes about saying \n     `I will follow the law,' and that would be true of anybody \n     who had very deeply held views.''\n       The only deeply held views that I know outside of belief in \n     the law would be his own personal religious beliefs. I will \n     just say this on another point. On the subject of Roe v. \n     Wade, Senator Schumer said, ``I for one believe that a judge \n     can be pro-life, yet be fair, balanced, and uphold a woman's \n     right to choose. But for a justice to set aside his or her \n     personal views, the commitment to the rule of law must \n     clearly supersede his or her personal agenda. . . . But based \n     on the comments Attorney General Pryor has made on the \n     subject, I have some real concerns that he cannot because he \n     feels these views so deeply and so passionately.''\n\n  I don't know how you read it any other way.\n  Another Senator told General Pryor:\n\n       I think the very legitimate issue at question with your \n     nomination is whether you have an agenda, and that many of \n     the positions you have taken do not reflect just an advocacy, \n     but a very deeply held view and a philosophy, which you are \n     entitled to have, but you are also not entitled to get \n     everyone's vote.\n\n  As you know, General Pryor is openly pro-life.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, does the Senator from Utah, \nwho I know is not Catholic, know that as part of the Catholic faith, \none of the central teachings with respect to faith and morals is that \nit is not an option under the Catholic church doctrine to be a faithful \nCatholic and not be pro-life. It is a core teaching of the church. It \nis not an optional teaching or a recommended teaching; it is a core \nteaching of the church. So to be a faithful Catholic, according to the \nchurch, someone has to embrace this opposition to abortion. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. I am so advised. I have studied the Catholic faith \nand I respect it deeply, as I do all religions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So according to what the Senator has just said, someone \nwho considers oneself a faithful Catholic, faithful to the core \nteachings of the Catholic church, which leaves no leeway on the issue \nof abortion, under that understanding, someone who has a deep faith and \nunderstands that with deep faith as a Catholic comes the requirement to \nbe against abortion, that as a result of that deep faith and as a \nresult of that deep faith in Catholicism, having to subscribe to the \nchurch's teaching on abortion, would that not lead, in a sense, to a \nprohibition by some Members of having anybody who is a faithful \nCatholic as a member of the judiciary?\n  Mr. HATCH. I cannot speak to that. All I can say is that I will take \nthe Senator's statement at face value, as I know he is a practicing \nmember of the Catholic faith, and I respect him for that. I know he is \nvery sincere, and I know he has even written about it. But I am \nconcerned.\n  Three of the people we have been told will be filibustered are \ntraditional pro-life, Catholic conservatives. Certainly, Pryor is one \nof them. Kuhl is another. Holmes is another. It is a matter of great \nconcern. I have to say that these inside-the-Beltway outside groups \nwill use anything; they will distort a person's record. It is abysmal \nwhat they are doing, and they are well heeled to the tune of millions \nof dollars, which they spend spreading this bile all over the Senate. \nUnfortunately, I believe there are some in this body who do not decry \nwhat they are doing.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield for another question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just described what is my \nunderstanding as a Catholic of what the teachings of the church are and \nwhat the responsibilities as a faithful Catholic are as a member of the \nchurch. I also understand the oath of office you take and the role that \nyou play as a civil servant in a government and that you have an \nobligation to serve and to adhere to the law, particularly when you are \nsworn to uphold that law.\n  Are there any examples where Attorney General Pryor upheld the law \neven though he, as a Catholic, as a person of deep beliefs, went ahead \nand followed the law even though his personal viewpoints may have been \ndifferent?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think there are all kinds of examples. Let me go through \na few, if I can. Hopefully, this will be helpful in what the good \nSenator has asked for.\n  General Pryor's record speaks with far more authority and with much \ngreater eloquence than the fulminations against him. His record of \nenforcing the Supreme Court dictates on abortion is unquestioned. He \nhas enforced them all. Despite criticizing them all as a traditional \npro-life, Catholic conservative, he has criticized abortion but he has \nupheld the law.\n  Although he has been attacked for his federalism arguments before the \nSupreme Court, the Supreme Court sided with him in most of those cases. \nArguing that Congress does not have the power that it has assumed \nthrough certain legislative acts is not activist or radical. It is \nprincipled, entirely consistent with our constitutional separation of \npowers, and it is General Pryor's duty as State attorney general.\n  In all the federalism cases he has argued, he advocated that only \ncertain portions of Federal laws were unconstitutional. In all cases, \nremedies remained available for aggrieved parties or the Federal \nGovernment. I cited some of these cases earlier.\n  Let me give another illustration. His critics have also attempted to \nportray him as an official without the respect for the separation of \nchurch and State. Again, it is simply beyond dispute that his record \nproves his repeated ability to enforce the law regardless of his strong \npersonal religious beliefs.\n  In an effort to defeat challenges to school prayer and the display of \nthe Ten Commandments in the Alabama Supreme Court, both the government \nthat appointed General Pryor and Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore urged \nGeneral Pryor to argue that the Bill of Rights does not apply to the \nStates.\n\n  General Pryor refused, even though his personal beliefs were \ndifferent, and he argued the case on much narrower grounds despite his \nown deeply held Catholic faith and personal support for both of those \nissues.\n  General Pryor has always been attacked for his statements urging \nmodification or repeal of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. However, \ndespite General Pryor's well-documented concerns about section 5 of the \nVoting Rights Act, he has vigorously enforced all provisions of the \nact. He successfully defended before the Supreme Court several \nmajority-minority voting districts approved under section 5 from a \nchallenge by a group of white Alabama voters. He feels deeply about \nthese issues.\n  He also issued an opinion that the use of stickers to replace one \ncandidate's name for another on a ballot requires preclearance under \nsection 5. Again, General Pryor enforced the law despite its conflicts \nwith his beliefs.\n  Despite the distortions, half-truths, and outright falsehoods we have \nheard about him from the usual leftist inside-the-Beltway interest \ngroups, General Pryor is a diligent, honorable, faithful man whose \nloyalties as a public servant have been to the law and its impartial \nadministration.\n  He has told us under oath he will continue to follow the law, just as \nhe has demonstrated in his distinguished career in Alabama. We should \nbe proud to give his nomination an up-or-down vote.\n  Throughout his hearing, it was one question after another on \nabortion--one question after another--and he made it clear that as much \nas he thinks that the outcome of the case of Roe v. Wade is an \nabomination, because it has resulted in the death of millions of unborn \nchildren--and he was very straightforward about it, very honest about \nit, and was complimented by my colleagues for his honesty, yet they \nwill not accept his honesty on this topic--he said he would enforce Roe \nv. Wade, which is the law.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, isn't there a case of the partial-birth \nabortion law in Alabama where he actually gave advice that would be \ncontrary to what his personal beliefs are with respect to the issue of \nabortion?\n  Mr. HATCH. After the Supreme Court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart, \nhe upheld that law by ordering state officials not to enforce the \nconflicting Alabama partial-birth abortion law. Earlier, he had \nenforced Alabama's partial-birth abortion law narrowly, to ensure \nconsistency with Supreme Court's dictates in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. Even though he disagrees violently with both of those cases from \na personal religious standpoint, but he enforced and upheld those laws, \nin the face of criticism from many of his conservative friends in \nAlabama.\n  Let me read one other item. At his hearing, I asked him this \nquestion:\n\n       So even though you disagree with Roe v. Wade, you would act \n     in accordance with Roe v. Wade on the Eleventh Circuit Court \n     of Appeals?\n\n  This was his answer:\n\n       Mr. Pryor. Even though I strongly disagree with Roe v. \n     Wade, I have acted in accordance with it as attorney general \n     and would continue to do so as a Court of Appeals judge.\n       Chairman Hatch. Can we rely on that?\n       Mr. Pryor. You can take it to the bank, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  To be honest with you, that is the way he is, and he is being \ncondemned for that.\n  I have to say that some of my colleagues on the other side have \nbecome tremendously annoyed and hurt by the issue of religion being \nbrought up in this matter, but the attacks on personal beliefs came \noriginally from these inside-the-Beltway groups. They are well heeled, \nwith money coming out of their ears, hiring all kinds of far left \nliberal lawyers to make these smear attempts and, frankly, that is what \nis distorting this whole process.\n  I suggest to my friends on the other side, they are going to have to \nstart some day standing up to these people, but they do not seem to be \nable to do it.\n  Frankly, during the Clinton years, I stood up to some of the right \nwing groups that were occasionally trying to distort somebody's record. \nWe did not see anywhere near what we are seeing today but I stood up. I \nam not asking them to do something I did not do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I remember a conservative group demanded of Senator \nHatch, with regard to Clinton nominees, that he sign a Hatch pledge. I \nask the Senator how he handled outside conservative pressure groups at \nthat time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as my colleague knows, I had to stand up to \nsome in my own caucus. Not many. There were some, one or two, who \nwanted to filibuster President Clinton's nominees. As the Senator will \nrecall, I stood up to that and said we are not going to filibuster \njudicial nominees. It is not right, and I believe it is \nconstitutionally unsound.\n  Some of the outside groups were sincere but they wanted to--I \nbelieved them to be sincere but wrong--distort some of these matters, \nand I refused to allow them to do it. They demanded to testify in a \nvariety of cases, and I told them no, we are not going to denigrate the \njudicial process with that type of stuff.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield for a further question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I note that the Senator made quite clear that elected \nSenators have the responsibility to decide matters, and they cannot be \ndriven by forces outside. We have to do it on the facts and the law, \nand he has been honorable and consistent on that. He deserves great \npraise. Some of the criticism that has come his way from those who are \nnow altering the historic ground rules of confirmation is unjust and \nwrong.\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\n  As a former attorney general of Alabama and knowing that the attorney \ngeneral had the power in Alabama to direct district attorneys on how to \nenforce certain Alabama laws, I ask the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee is he aware that even though Attorney General Pryor \nstrongly believes that partial-birth abortion is one of the worst forms \nof abortion of all, that he wrote a letter directing district attorneys \nto narrowly construe an Alabama partial-birth abortion statute because \nhe had concluded under the Supreme Court law that parts of it was \nunconstitutional?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, the Senator is right.\n  He is a very serious practicing Catholic. He despises Roe v. Wade. He \nmakes very strong and principled arguments against it. He did not mince \nany words when he was asked, Did you call it an abomination? And he \nsaid: Yes, I did, sir.\n  When they asked why, he said he called it an abomination because, \nwords to the effect, he believes that it led to the deaths of millions \nof unborn children. Yet when it came down to enforcing the law on \npartial-birth abortion, that he despises, he enforced the law, and he \ndirected his prosecutors in the State to do likewise.\n  I do not know whether we can find any better people than that. There \nare a lot of politicians who have been attorneys general who I do not \nthink would have done that in the face of their personal beliefs, but \nhe did because he is dedicated to the law. He knows if one does not \nuphold the law, even if they disagree with it, it would not be long \nuntil we would not have any laws. The Constitution would go itself, and \nhe understands that. He is a brilliant man, graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Tulane, which is a fine law school, and was editor in chief of the \nLaw Review, something that very few people have the privilege of doing, \nand that is because he was one of the best students in his class.\n  Frankly, he has more than shown an aptitude to the law and an ability \nto follow the law.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield for another question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor, I will be happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the Senator aware, being an Alabama official myself \nand keeping up with these things, that when Attorney General Pryor, not \nrequired to do so but following what he believed was the proper \nprocedure, directed the district attorneys who would be enforcing this \npartial-birth abortion law to construe the statute narrowly, that he \nwas criticized by pro-life groups, sincere, wonderful people, and one \nwent so far as to say that his decision had gutted the partial-birth \nabortion law?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That is exactly right. He took a lot of flack for it and \nhe believed the way they did, but he also made it clear that that is \nthe law and that he was going to follow it. He followed it as an \nelected political official.\n  Now, if he can follow the law impartially as an elected political \nofficial, imagine the honor he would bring to the bench, where it's his \njob to be impartial. He did not have to do it as an elected political \nofficial, although I would not have respected him had he not, but as a \njudge, I think we have more than ample evidence that this man would \nfollow the law regardless of his personal beliefs. Yet he has been \nsmeared by the outside groups on his personal beliefs. It is just that \nsimple.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one more question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have researched his record and background. I find \nthat even though he does firmly believe that abortion is an immoral \npractice, that other than the matter I just raised about directing on \npartial-birth abortion not to enforce parts of the law, he has not \ntaken any action in any way to use the power of his office to undermine \nthe law of the Supreme Court on that matter. I just wonder if the \nSenator would agree with that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do agree with that. The Senator knows Bill Pryor better \nthan anybody. He worked for the distinguished Senator when he was \nattorney general. I am absolutely amazed at how many Democrats and \npeople of diversity and others in Alabama are supportive of him. The \npeople who knew him best are the people who support him. The people of \nAlabama know him best. Yet we are going to second-guess that, for \npolitical reasons?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To get to the rest of this letter by Carl Anderson, who \nis the head of the Knights of Columbus nationwide, I want to read the \nconcluding paragraph and ask the Senator to comment as to whether he \nagrees with Mr. Anderson in his conclusion as to what is going on with \nthis nomination. He says this:\n\n       As head of the world's largest Catholic fraternal \n     organization and as a former member of the United States \n     Commission on Civil Rights, I am dismayed that the course of \n     Mr. Pryor's nomination compels me to make a point which by \n     now should be obvious: a good Catholic can also be a good \n     public servant. Much as I would wish otherwise, a \n     continuation of the trend that critics of Mr. Pryor's \n     nomination have set in motion will compel American Catholics \n     to face religious bigotry of a kind many of us thought to be \n     extinct in this nation.\n\n  Does the Senator agree that such continuation of activity could lead \nto such bigotry?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I believe it can be, and I believe there is some \nfrom the outside groups. I do not think there is any question. I would \nnot want to attribute that to any of my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, although I have to admit this issue of abortion is becoming \na litmus test issue to Democrats, that is pro-abortion. I think that is \nwrong. I remember what the media did to Republicans during the Reagan \nadministration, continually trying to say there was a litmus test. I \nknow there was not because the person who vetted all the judges is a \nformer staffer of mine who is now on the Michigan Supreme Court. I know \nit is not being done by this administration. But literally, Democrats \nare making abortion a litmus test issue.\n\n  The Democrats are fond of saying, yes, but we have passed all kinds \nof Bush judges, 140 of them so far. Well, they cannot stop them all. So \nthey selectively pick people like General Pryor who clearly has very \nstrongly held views but who clearly has abided by the law. They ignore \nthat he abided by the law and attack him on his strongly held views. In \nlarge measure, it comes down to the issue of abortion because he \ndiffers with them on the policy issue of abortion.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is the Senator familiar with a letter written by Austin \nRuse, president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, \nwhich was sent yesterday?\n  Mr. HATCH. I just saw it tonight, so I am familiar. I have not read \nit in detail, but I am familiar with it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Utah that I wanted to bring \nup this letter. This is not the only Catholic group that has expressed \nconcern about what is code worded as ``deeply held beliefs'' but seems \nto be a little stronger than that. I will read the second paragraph of \nthis letter and ask the Senator to comment again on this:\n\n       I think of the young mother, struggling to raise her \n     children in what is a challenging culture. She raises them to \n     be good citizens and good Catholics. What should this mother \n     tell her children? ``Sorry, in order to serve our government, \n     you will have to shed your Catholic beliefs.'' Putting \n     Catholics in this position is shameful and not a proper \n     measure of our great land?\n\n  I ask the Senator if he has any thoughts on this issue?\n  Mr. HATCH. This is the first time I have seen this letter. To him, \nthis is a very important issue. The views he expresses are drawn from \nwhat he's heard at the hearing and the markup. Reasonable people can \ndraw these conclusions from the markup, from the debate.\n  It is coming down to where abortion is the be-all and end-all issue \nto my colleagues on the other side. Sure, they cannot vote against \neveryone. I don't know how many of these people are pro-life or pro-\nchoice. I never ask anyone that.\n  The fact is, I can see why people are drawing this conclusion. I will \ngive a\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\nfew other reasons they are drawing that conclusion before we are \nthrough here tonight.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield for another question, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed an article by Bishop Charles J. \nChaput, Archbishop of Denver, written as a result of this nomination. \nThe article talks about a friend of his in Alabama and the fact there \nwere not very many Catholics in Alabama in the 1960s when he was \ngrowing up and how Alabama has changed to the point where they can \nelect a Catholic as their attorney general.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From www.archden.org, July 30, 2003]\n\n              Some Things Change, Some Things Really Don't\n\n       Some things change, and some things don't.\n       In the summer of 1963, a friend of mine--she was just 11 at \n     the time--drove with her family to visit her sister, who had \n     married and moved away to Birmingham, Ala. Stopping for gas \n     in a small Alabama town on a Sunday morning, her father asked \n     where they could find the local Catholic church.\n       The attendant just shrugged and said, ``We don't have any \n     of them here.''\n       The family finished gassing up, pulled out of the station--\n     and less than two blocks away, they passed the local Catholic \n     church.\n       Most people my age remember the '60s in the South as a time \n     of intense struggle for civil rights. Along with pervasive \n     racial discrimination, Southern culture often harbored a \n     suspicion of Catholics, Jews and other minorities. Catholics \n     were few and scattered. In the Deep South, like Alabama, \n     being Catholic often meant being locked out of political and \n     social leadership.\n       Today, much of the old South is gone. Cities like Atlanta \n     and Raleigh-Durham are major cosmopolitan centers. Time, \n     social reform and migration have transformed the economy \n     along with the political system. The South today is a tribute \n     both to the courage of civil rights activists 40 years ago, \n     and to the goodness of the people of the South themselves.\n       Most people, most of the time, want to do the right thing. \n     And when they change, they also change the world they \n     inhabit, which is one of the reasons why the Archdiocese of \n     Atlanta can now draw thousands of enthusiastic Catholic \n     participants to its Eucharistic Congress each year in a state \n     where Catholics were once second-class citizens. It also \n     explains how a practicing Catholic, William H. Pryor, can \n     become Alabama's attorney general--something that was close \n     to inconceivable just four decades ago.\n       I've never met Mr. Pryor, but his political life is a \n     matter of public record. He has served the State of Alabama \n     with distinction, enforcing its laws and court decisions \n     fairly and consistently. This is why President Bush nominated \n     him to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and why the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee approved him last Wednesday for \n     consideration by the full Senate.\n       But the committee debate on Pryor was ugly, and the vote to \n     advance his nomination split exactly along party lines. Why? \n     Because Mr. Pryor believes that Catholic teaching about the \n     sanctity of life is true; that the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. \n     Wade decision was a poorly reasoned mistake; and that \n     abortion is wrong in all cases, even rape and incest. As a \n     result, Americans were treated to the bizarre spectacle of \n     non-Catholic Senators Orrin Hatch and Jeff Sessions defending \n     Mr. Pryor's constitutionally protected religious rights to \n     Mr. Pryor's critics, including Senator Richard Durbin, an \n     ``abortion-rights'' Catholic.\n       According to Senator Durbin (as reported by EWTN), ``Many \n     Catholics who oppose abortion personally do not believe the \n     laws of the land should prohibit abortion for all others in \n     extreme cases involving rape, incest and the life and the \n     health of the mother.'' This kind of propaganda makes the \n     abortion lobby proud, but it should humiliate any serious \n     Catholic. At a minimum, Catholic members of Congress like \n     Senator Durbin should actually read and pray over the \n     ``Catechism of the Catholic Church'' and the encyclical \n     ``Evangelium Vitae'' before the explain the Catholic faith to \n     anyone.\n       They might even try doing something about their ``personal \n     opposition'' to abortion by supporting competent pro-life \n     judicial appointments. Otherwise, they simply prove what many \n     people already believe--that a new kind of religious \n     discrimination is very welcome at the Capitol, even among \n     elected officials who claim to be Catholic.\n       Some things change, and some things don't. The bias against \n     ``papism'' is alive and well in America. It just has a \n     different address. But at least some people in Alabama now \n     know where the local Catholic church is--and where she \n     stands--even if some people in Washington apparently don't.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. This article reads in part:\n\n       I have never met Mr. Pryor, but his political life is a \n     matter of public record. He has served the State of Alabama \n     with distinction, enforcing its laws and court decisions \n     fairly and consistently. This is why President Bush nominated \n     him to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and why the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee approved him last Wednesday for \n     consideration by the full Senate.\n       But the committee debate on Pryor was ugly, and the vote to \n     advance his nomination split exactly along party lines. Why? \n     Because Mr. Pryor believes that Catholic teaching about the \n     sanctity of life is true; that the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v. \n     Wade decision was a poorly reasoned mistake; and that \n     abortion is wrong in all cases, even rape and incest. As a \n     result, Americans were treated to the bizarre spectacle of \n     non-Catholic Senators Orrin Hatch and Jeff Sessions defending \n     Mr. Pryor's constitutionally protected religious rights to \n     Mr. Pryor's critics, including Senator Richard Durbin, an \n     ``abortion-rights'' Catholic.\n\n  He concludes with:\n\n       Some things change, and some things don't. The bias against \n     ``papism'' is alive and well in America. It just has a \n     different address. But at least some people in Alabama now \n     know where he local Catholic church is--and where she \n     stands--even if some people in Washington apparently don't.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Utah if he has seen that article.\n  Mr. HATCH. I had not seen it before tonight, that I was aware of. I \nhad been told the Catholic bishop had written this article. I can see \nwhy he has drawn this conclusion. I can see why anyone would.\n  I hear the moaning and groaning and scheming, but I happen to be a \nmember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I belong to \nthe only church in the history of this country that had an \nextermination order out against it, where our people were brutally \nmurdered and driven from State to State leaving trails of blood.\n  I don't like religious discrimination in any way. I can see why \npeople are drawing these conclusions from this debate. I can see why \npeople draw such conclusions when you start attacking a man because he \nhas deeply held beliefs. Earlier, I read one statement from Pryor's \nhearing, questioning his religious beliefs. It was made; and anyone \nwith brains would say, what are his deeply held beliefs? He is a \ntraditional pro-life Catholic conservative. And I guess that is not a \ngood thing to be if you're before this body seeking confirmation to the \nfederal bench.\n  I think it is a good thing to be. I don't think it is bad to be a \nliberal pro-life Catholic. I think it is important to live your \nreligion, regardless of what religious persuasion you are. I understand \nreligious discrimination. The name of my church is the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints, yet I am unacceptable in certain groups \nbecause they don't think we are Christians. I will match my \nChristianity up against anyone's. I read the Bible all the time. I try \nto read it from beginning to end every year. I pretty well do that. It \nis the greatest book in the world. And it is the greatest literature. \nBut I understand discrimination. Some people will not handle the music \nI write because they don't think I am Christian. I don't mean to bring \nthat up here except that it applies. I understand that. I understand \nwhy people feel this way. If my colleagues on the other side don't \nunderstand it, I say shame on them.\n  When abortion becomes the be-all and end-all in the judicial \nnomination process--which is what these outside groups, almost every \none of them, are committed to on the Democratic side--it is a serious \nissue. There are serious decent people on both sides of that issue. But \nwhen it becomes the be-all and end-all litmus test whether a person can \nserve--that's wrong. And don't give me the argument we have approved \nall kinds of people who may be pro-life. Of course, Members cannot vote \nagainst everybody.\n  But we are filibustering, for the first time in history, good people, \njudicial nominations to the Federal courts of the United States of \nAmerica, for the first time in history. I know a lot of it comes down \nto abortion. I did not let that happen when I was chairman during the \nClinton years. I don't think it should happen right now, especially \nsomebody such as Pryor who has a reputation for obeying and standing up \nfor the law even though he disagrees with it.\n  As a politician he has that reputation. I imagine if he can do it as \na politician, he can do it and we can take his word on it that he would \nabide by the law and sustain the law of the land as a judge. Yet the \nprincipal argument against him is that he won't enforce the law \nregarding abortion. There are\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\nother arguments used, all of which are false, in my opinion. This \nabortion issue is becoming the be-all and end-all issue for Democrats \nin the Senate. There is always somebody who wants to enforce an \nabortion litmus test, but we stopped it on our side. It ought to be \nstopped on their side.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield for another question, I \nsincerely thank the Senator from Utah for his yielding to me for these \nquestions and for his very articulate defense of this nominee and the \nprinciple which I believe and I think the Senator believes in.\n  One of the reasons I brought the article up was, many people outside \nof this Chamber--not just Catholic, not just Christian, but of all \nfaiths--are deeply concerned about what is going on in this Chamber. I \nthank the Senator for his willingness to stand up and to have the \ncourage to articulate that. I make the point that he is not alone in \ncoming to the conclusion he has come to, that many people in this \nChamber have come to, that this litmus test that is being applied \nultimately is a religious one.\n  Mr. HATCH. The practical application.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Which is a very threatening thing.\n  I say for the record, as a pro-life Catholic, I voted for hundreds of \nClinton nominees who I knew were not pro-life--hundreds of them--never \nvoted against one of them, never filibustered any of them. I will match \nup my fervor in defense of human life against anyone in this Chamber. \nBut not once did I vote against one.\n  Why? Because that is not my role as a Senator, as a civil servant. I \nknow my duties under the Constitution. I know my role. I know what I am \nsupposed to do. What we are experiencing here now is not, again, the \nseparation of church and state but the separation from anybody who is \nfaithful to their church from the state. That is turning separation of \nchurch and state that would cause any of the Founders to be spinning in \ntheir grave today. It is exactly what--you can call it anything you \nwant--but that is exactly what is going on.\n  The greatest of the freedoms we have in this country, the greatest \nthat any country can have, is the freedom to believe the freedom to \nthink. Because if you don't have the freedom to think what you want and \nthe freedom to do what you want, the freedom to speak, to assemble--the \nfreedom to do anything else is meaningless. It is the first of all \nfreedoms. That is under assault in this process.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Utah for standing up in defense of this.\n  Mr. HATCH. If my colleague will stay a few minutes longer, because I \nwant to make one more point in this area and it needs to be made--a \ncouple maybe.\n  I believe the Senator has put the letters and op-ed piece from the \nCatholic Leader into the Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record--because \nthese are people who are good people writing these letters. And they \nare just starting. An avalanche is coming. This is from the Union of \nOrthodox Jewish Congregations of America, July 23:\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We write to you with regard to the \n     Judiciary Committee's consideration of the nomination of \n     William Pryor, the current Attorney General of the State of \n     Alabama, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh \n     Circuit.\n       The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the \n     nation's largest Orthodox Jewish umbrella organization \n     representing nearly 1,000 congregations nationwide, is a non-\n     partisan, religious organization and--like most other \n     organizations in the American Jewish community--it has been \n     the UOJCA's longstanding policy neither to endorse nor oppose \n     judicial nominees in the confirmation process. However, to \n     our dismay, we have witnessed several of our community's \n     organizations deviate from this shared policy in recent weeks \n     and oppose the confirmation of Mr. Pryor.\n       Moreover, we are profoundly troubled by the manner in which \n     this opposition has been framed. We thus feel compelled, \n     unlike our fellow communal organizations, to remain faithful \n     to our non-endorsement policy but express our view on a \n     critical issue that has been raised in connection with this \n     nomination--Mr. Pryor's personal religious faith and his \n     capacity to serve as a federal judge in light of that \n     personal faith.\n       As a community of religious believers committed to full \n     engagement with modern American society, we are deeply \n     troubled by those who have implied that a person of faith \n     cannot serve in a high level government post that may raise \n     issues at odds with his or her personal beliefs. There is \n     little question in our minds that this view has been the \n     subtext for some of the criticism of Mr. Pryor. We urge you \n     and your colleagues to emphatically reject this aspersion and \n     send a clear message that such suggestions, whether explicit \n     or implied, are beyond the pale of our politics. In our view, \n     Mr. Pryor's record as Alabama's Attorney General demonstrates \n     his ability to faithfully enforce the law, even when it may \n     conflict with his personal beliefs.\n       The role of religion and of religious citizens in American \n     life was much discussed during the last presidential \n     campaign. To our nation's credit, it was discussed in a \n     serious and meaningful way, which revealed a national \n     consensus favoring a society where citizens of many faiths \n     are not only welcome in our society, but encouraged to bring \n     their faith into our nation's ``public square.'' We urge you \n     to ensure that the deliberations over William Pryor's \n     nomination do not undermine the great progress we have seen \n     on this issue so critical to America's civil society.\n       We pray your committee's deliberations will be fair and \n     serve the nation well.\n\n  There are a lot of people concerned about this around here. Let me \nmake this point. I want to respond to the concerns of my dear friend, \nSenator Feinstein. She is one of my dearest friends in this body. I \nthink the world of her.\n  She made comments about an ad that used the slogan, ``Catholics need \nnot apply.'' I don't have a copy of it here on a poster.\n  She used that because she wants us to decry this ad.\n  Well, I am not happy with this ad.\n  But I can see why people have done this, because they believe that \nthis--these debates are devolving to the point of attacking a person \nfor his or her personal beliefs, in the case of Pryor, Kuhl, Holmes, \nothers.\n  Let me respond to Senator Feinstein's concerns about the ad that used \nthe slogan ``Catholics need not apply.'' In fact, it was the liberal \ngroups, the liberal inside-the-beltway groups, that used the slogan \n``Catholics need not apply'' to argue against Republicans for \nsupporting the Charitable Choice legislation in 2001.\n  Let me put one of these ads up, along with the words of the Americans \nUnited for Separation of Church and State. Here is the paragraph down \nhere:\n\n       Ashcroft's Charitable Choice provisions allow a government-\n     funded program to hang a sign that says ``Catholics need not \n     apply.''\n\n  I will not read the rest of it. We will put it into the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Americans United Urges Senate To Reject Ashcroft Nomination for \n                            Attorney General\n\n\nBUSH NOMINEE'S VIEWS ARE `OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM,' SAYS AU'S BARRY LYNN\n\n       In written testimony submitted to the U.S. Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and \n     State today urged senators to reject the nomination of John \n     Ashcroft for attorney general.\n       ``[W]e at Americans United have come to the conclusion that \n     Senator Ashcroft's policy positions and legal opinions are so \n     far outside the mainstream that it is doubtful he could \n     enforce the very laws and rights that the attorney general \n     must protect and uphold,'' said Barry W. Lynn, executive \n     director of Americans United. ``We call on this committee to \n     reject his confirmation.''\n       In his statement to the Senate panel, Lynn noted that \n     Ashcroft has frequently expressed contempt and disdain for \n     the Supreme Court and its legal precedents. (Hearings on the \n     nomination begin today.)\n       For example, Lynn pointed to Ashcroft's comments to the \n     Christian Coalition in 1998, where the former Missouri \n     Senator said, ``A robed elite have taken the wall of \n     separation designed to protect the church and they have made \n     it a wall of religious oppression.''\n       Responded AU's Lynn, ``Ashcroft's characterization of the \n     Supreme Court as a `robed elite' shows a lack of respect \n     unbefitting a candidate for attorney general. It is a phrase \n     more commonly associated with religious extremists and anti-\n     government militias than our nation's chief law enforcer and \n     protector of civil rights and liberties.''\n       Lynn also told the Senate committee that Ashcroft's \n     legislative efforts reflect a disregard for constitutional \n     principles.\n       ``Senator Ashcroft's contempt for First Amendment case law \n     is not merely rhetorical, but also took legislative form,'' \n     Lynn said. ``During his sole Senate term, Ashcroft \n     developed legislation called `charitable choice,' a plan \n     that allows religious groups to receive taxpayer funds to \n     perform government services and then discriminate in the \n     employment of staff people to run the program.\n       ``Ashcroft's Charitable Choice provisions allow a \n     government funded-program to hang\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\n     a sign that says `Catholics Need Not Apply' or `Unwed Mothers \n     Need Not Apply,' '' Lynn added. ``Such a scheme amounts to no \n     less than unconstitutional government-funded employment \n     discrimination.''\n       Lynn found Ashcroft's comments to students at Bob Jones \n     University in 1999 particularly revealing about the attorney \n     general nominee's commitment to government neutrality on \n     religion. In the speech, Ashcroft said that America has ``no \n     king but Jesus.''\n       ``Such a statement shows a total lack of regard for the \n     principle that it is the U.S. Constitution that serves as the \n     basis for our laws and national life, not one faith \n     tradition,'' said Lynn. ``Our Constitution guarantees \n     unqualified religious liberties for each of us, regardless of \n     our beliefs.''\n       Ultimately, Lynn argues that Ashcroft's hostility for our \n     constitutional principles disqualify him for the position of \n     attorney general.\n       ``As the nation's top law enforcement officer, the attorney \n     general must represent all Americans,'' Lynn noted. ``He must \n     stand for the rights of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, \n     and Hindus. He must advocate for those who are completely \n     devout about religion as well as those who are totally \n     indifferent toward it. He must understand certain things \n     about America--that the nation was not founded on any one \n     particular set of religious beliefs but rather was \n     deliberately designed to extend freedom to them all. Our \n     nation guarantees this freedom to all faiths by erecting a \n     wall of separation between church and state.\n       ``Senator Ashcroft views this wall as one that fosters \n     oppression, not freedom,'' Lynn concluded. ``By taking this \n     position, he puts himself at odds with both the early \n     American statesmen who built that wall--men like Thomas \n     Jefferson and James Madison--and more importantly, the \n     decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. For these reasons, we \n     respectfully ask this committee to reject John Ashcroft's \n     confirmation as attorney general of the United States.''\n       Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group \n     based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization \n     represents 60,000 members and allied houses of worship in all \n     50 states.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's go to People for the American Way. It is estimated \nthat People for the American Way have between $12 and $30 million given \nto them, mainly by the Hollywood crowd and big business people, to do \nwhat they do in this town, which is to distort Republican nominees' \nrecords. This is People for the American Way. I will not read it all:\n\n       Charitable Choice, a bad choice for government and \n     religion.\n\n  Here is the paragraph.\n\n       An Evangelical church running a government-funded welfare \n     program could state that ``Catholics need not apply,'' in a \n     help wanted ad.\n\n  I do not recall any Democratic Senators expressing outrage about \nthat. I did not see one comment about the fact that the liberals have \nused this language against the Charitable Choice legislation.\n  Whether you agree with that or whether you agree with General Pryor, \nor not----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the chairman of the committee if he is aware of \nany time in which the Senate, having set a precedent, tended to unset \nit lately?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no doubt that we have unset precedents in this \nbody.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My fear, I say to my friend from Utah, is that we \ncrossed the Rubicon on the issue of filibustering judges.\n  Mr. HATCH. No question about that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I can recall as recently as the last year of the \nClinton administration, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nothers and myself voting for cloture on judges that we personally \nopposed and subsequently did oppose, even though we knew there was a \nchance of killing them on filibuster. I think of Paez and I think of \nBerzon.\n  Does the chairman of the committee share my view that we may have \ngone so far now that this would be the pattern forever in the Senate, \ndenying judges up-or-down votes because we find them unacceptably \nliberal or conservative or too steeped in personal beliefs that they \nare willing to express before the committee?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no doubt, to answer the Senator's question, if we \ncontinue down this pathway we are going to devolve to where people with \nstrongly held religious beliefs are not going to be able to serve in \nthis country. That is what it comes down to. I have no doubt that if we \ncontinue to violate the Constitution by allowing filibusters against--\nunder our advise and consent mandate in the Constitution, we are going \nto wind up with a mess on our hands that we will not be able to repair. \nSo we have to get out of this. I call on our colleagues on the other \nside to get real here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further, I inquire of the Senator from Utah, the \nchairman of the committee, whether he thinks it will now be routine for \nevery nominee to be asked their personal beliefs on a whole range of \nissues, personal and religious beliefs on a whole range of issues, and \nbe expected to answer those kinds of questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think we will go that far. At least while I am \nchairman of the committee we are not going to do that. I did ask him \nwhat his religion was, after all of these questions that were asked in \na very extensive hearing where religion was put squarely in issue by \nthe other side. I did ask him that because I wanted to establish that \nthis had gone too far.\n  I don't intend to ever ask that question again. I don't think my \ncolleagues will. The distinguished Senator from Vermont said he will \nnever ask that question, and he criticized me for doing so. But I think \nit was highly justified under the circumstances, and I think we made a \npretty good case tonight that it was justified, although I am sure some \nof my colleagues will take umbrage.\n  But let them take umbrage. People all over this country are starting \nto say there is litmus test arising. Certainly there are outside groups \nthat are trying to smear our nominees--especially Attorney General \nPryor, Judge Kuhl, and Mr. Holmes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask the chairman of the \ncommittee. He may well have received--I know I did and other Members of \nthe Senate did--a letter today from William Donohue, Ph.D., who is \npresident of the Catholic League For Religious and Civil Rights. He \nsaid, among other things, in his letter:\n\n       Some of Pryor's critics are themselves Catholic and thus \n     resist the contention that is being opposed because of his \n     religion. But they do so by falsely claiming that on the \n     subject of abortion, there is more than one acceptable \n     position for Catholics to take. They are dead wrong. Catholic \n     teaching on abortion is unequivocal: It is gravely sinful. \n     This is not a matter of dispute--it is a matter of doctrine \n     that all Catholics are expected to uphold. Especially public \n     officials.\n       The danger, then, is that Bill Pryor may be rejected \n     because of his religious convictions.\n\n  I think what is so disturbing here to many of us--I am personally not \na Catholic--is that you could adhere to the teachings of your church \nand then in effect be penalized for it even though there is no evidence \nthat in carrying out your duties as a public official you wouldn't \nfollow the law.\n  I ask the chairman: Are we being penalized for our own personal \nreligious convictions in seeking public positions?\n  Mr. HATCH. There are people all over this country who are coming to \nthe conclusion that Bill Pryor is being treated that way. Personally, \nif you are going to apply abortion as a litmus test, and that is his \ndeeply held personal belief, even though he has exhibited more than an \neffort to obey the laws no matter what they are, I can see why people \narrived at that conclusion.\n  I see why Mr. Donohue feels that way. This is getting to be an \navalanche. The new code words for some are that, well, I don't \npersonally believe in abortion but I believe a woman ought to have a \nright to choose.\n  Give me a break. That is a nice excuse. But that certainly is not \nacceptable, it seems to me, to many religions, including the Catholic \nfaith, as has been said by these letters.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter to which I referred from Dr. Donohue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Catholic League\n\n\n                               for Religious and Civil Rights,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 25, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: You will soon be voting on the candidacy of \n     Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor for the federal appeals \n     court in Alabama. As president of the nation's largest \n     Catholic civil rights organization, I ask that you subject \n     him to the same standards as you would any candidate. I am \n     also asking that you challenge any colleague of yours who may \n     attempt to subject Pryor to a de facto religious test.\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\n       I have plainly said there are no anti-Catholics in the U.S. \n     Senate. But I have also said that this does not empty the \n     issue.\n       Bill Pryor's deeply held opposition to abortion as a moral \n     issue, as well as his deeply held opposition to the \n     jurisprudential reasoning as evidenced in Roe v. Wade, have \n     made him a lightning rod for abortion-rights advocates. In \n     other words, it is precisely Pryor's religious convictions \n     that are bring scrutinized. Given the cast of mind of some of \n     his critics, it makes it virtually impossible for practicing \n     Catholics to ascend to the federal bench.\n       Some of Pryor's critics are themselves Catholic and thus \n     resist the contention that he is being opposed because of his \n     religion. But they do so by falsely claiming that on the \n     subject of abortion, there is more than one acceptable \n     position for Catholics to take. They are dead wrong. Catholic \n     teaching on abortion is unequivocal: it is gravely sinful. \n     This is not a matter of dispute--it is a matter of doctrine \n     that all Catholics are expected to uphold. Especially public \n     officials.\n       The danger, then, is that Bill Pryor may be rejected \n     because of his religious convictions. This would be \n     outrageous and that is why I am asking you to do what you can \n     to prevent this from happening.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        William A. Donohue, Ph.D.,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the committee, \nisn't the important thing whether there is demonstrable evidence that a \nnominee has been unwilling to follow established law and it is my \nunderstanding--I ask the chairman whether it is his understanding--that \nAttorney General Pryor has followed the law when it was very tough to \ndo so as an elected official in Alabama.\n  I believe our friend from Alabama, the junior Senator from Alabama, \nMr. Sessions, cited a number of cases upon which Attorney General \nPryor, as an elected official and not insulated from the wishes of the \nvoters, took very tough positions on various issues because he was \nfollowing the law. Isn't that the fundamental question that we ought to \nask of nominees, whether to the left or to the right? Will you follow \nthe law? And if they have demonstrated examples where they have done \nso, that would be relevant to whether or not they ought to be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. HATCH. It certainly would. We have reached a point on the \nJudiciary Committee where a person who has always had an honorable \nreputation such as General Pryor is immediately told by my Democratic \ncolleagues that he cannot follow the law because of his deeply held \nbeliefs. Come on. He has more than shown that he follows the law even \nthough sometimes it is totally in conflict with his religious beliefs \nbecause he is a great lawyer. He realizes that if you do not follow the \nlaw, pretty soon we will not have any laws. The quickest way to get rid \nof the Constitution is to not abide by it. Even though there are \ndecisions by the Supreme Court that I abhor, and that I think are bad \ndecisions to start with, the fact is that when it is the law, I believe \nwe ought to abide by it.\n  He has more than amply shown that he would, even under severe \ncriticism by his supporters--by his own Governor who appointed him, by \nthe Supreme Court Chief Justice who begged him to make certain \narguments, he abides by the law. Yet his assertions and his word as a \nman of integrity and honor all his life are given short shrift.\n  Democrats are playing this phony ``gotcha politics'' game, in which \nthey ``investigate'' unauthenticated--and many believe, stolen \ndocuments--and we object but participate only to keep our side \ninformed. After weeks of their ``investigation,'' they didn't find one \nthing inconsistent with Pryor's testimony. They called almost everyone \nnamed in these documents. I don't know if they got all of them on the \nphone. But they didn't find one thing wrong. Pryor made himself \navailable twice, so they could ask any question they wanted to ask, but \ntwice, they didn't ask a single question. Then they come here and said \nthey haven't had the full investigation. Give me a break.\n  It is getting to be where it is hard for people of devout beliefs to \nnot be criticized if those beliefs contradict abortion rights.\n  Look. We have people on our side who feel very deeply about that. \nSome of them--very few--wanted to filibuster. We stopped it because we \nknew it would be terrible for this body to go through filibustering \nnominees to the Federal judiciary.\n  But now Democrats are filibustering nominees. When a person of the \nintegrity of Bill Pryor is constantly called into question because of \ndeeply held beliefs, I can see why people from all over the country are \nstarting to ask what his deeply held beliefs are. They are religious \nbeliefs because he is a traditional pro-life Catholic--and God forbid \nconservative--and that is, frankly, behind this in the eyes of many \npeople.\n  I don't want to attribute that to my colleagues on the committee but \nI believe they are letting this happen. I call on them to help stop it.\n  The reason I bring up these two posters tonight is because these \nliberal groups use these slogans that ``Catholics need not apply'' to \nargue against Republicans for supporting Charitable Choice legislation. \nWhen that slogan was used against Republicans, I did not hear any \noutcry from my friends on the other side. I did not hear any outcry. \nSpecifically, Americans United for Separation of Church and State \nargued against John Ashcroft's nomination for Attorney General. Their \npress release stated that Ashcroft's Charitable Choice provisions allow \na government-funded program to hang a sign that says ``Catholics Need \nNot Apply.''\n  That is ridiculous. But that is what they did. I did not hear any \nscreaming about that. I did not hear any of this righteous indignation \nfrom our colleagues over here about that. We didn't dignify it; at \nleast I didn't.\n  People for the American Way, which I think has a very checkered \nreputation in this town--I am getting so I don't believe anything they \ndo--criticized the Bush administration for supporting Charitable Choice \nlegislation. They said:\n\n       Charitable Choice opens the door to government approved \n     discrimination. . . . An evangelical church running a \n     government-funded welfare program could state that \n     ``Catholics need not apply.''\n\n  I am sure some will say maybe they will do that. Maybe they will. I \ndon't know. But they are saying a lot of the best welfare programs in \nthis country, a lot of the best programs in this country--from the \ntaking care of people standpoint--are done by religious organizations, \nincluding the Catholic Church.\n  Where was the outrage back in 2001 when the liberals were using the \nslogan ``Catholics Need Not Apply'' against the Bush administration and \nJohn Ashcroft?\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle were silent. I did not hear \none of them complain about that.\n  I met with some 50 people yesterday from all over the country who \nbelieve we are devolving into an antireligious body because of what is \ngoing on here.\n  Again, it is all coming down to abortion.\n  All we have asked is for Senators not to filibuster judges. We think \nit is a dangerous, unconstitutional thing to do. Judicial nominees of \nany President deserve an up-and-down vote, especially once they are \nbrought to the floor. There are all kinds of ways of stopping them \nbefore they get to the floor, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nunderstand those ways.\n  But I can tell you this, we can match the decency of our approach any \nday of the week to what went on during the Reagan and Bush 1 \nadministrations, and now what is going on in this administration--any \nday of the week--statistically, number-wise, fairness, from a dignity \nstandpoint.\n  All we want are up-and-down votes for these nominees, especially once \nthey are brought to the floor. What is really bothering our friends on \nthe other side is, we do have a right to bring people to the floor \nbecause we have this one-person majority. Can you imagine how much good \nwork we could do if we had a few more in the majority? It would not be \nnearly this screaming and shouting and this bitterness that sometimes \ndoes arise, coming primarily from outside.\n  I think the public has a right to know exactly where their Senators \nstand on these issues. If you do not like Bill Pryor, vote against him. \nIf you think that his religious views are going to color his decisions \non the bench, vote against him. If I thought that, I would vote against \nhim.\n  The public needs to know, how are you going to vote on these issues? \nSome of our colleagues are afraid to take on these outside groups. We \ndid. I did. I have been condemned by some of them, even to this day, \nfor having done\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\nso. And I put through a lot of Clinton judges. The all-time champion \nwas Ronald Reagan: 382 judges in his 8 years. He had 6 years of a \nRepublican Senate to help him, only 2 years with Democrat opposition, \nand he got 382. It was remarkable. Guess how many Clinton got, with \nonly 2 years of his own party in control of the Senate? In 6 years, \nwhere I was chairman, 377--5 less than Reagan. Had it not been for some \nof the holds on the other side--one Senator was not getting his, so he \nstopped another from getting his--I think Bill Clinton would have been \nthe all-time confirmation champion, with 6 years of a Republican \nSenate. We treated him fairly. Now, you can always find something to \ncomplain about on both sides, but he was treated fairly under the \ncircumstances. And I know it, and I know he knows it.\n  These people deserve an up-and-down vote, at least once they come to \nthe floor. Justice delayed is justice denied. There are many of these \ncases, among the litany of people the Democrats have indicated they are \ngoing to filibuster--it is not just two. Pryor looks like he is going \nto be filibustered. Kuhl looks like she is going to be filibustered. \nHolmes looks like he is going to be filibustered. We have talked about \nPickering being filibustered. You can go down through some others as \nwell--Boyle from North Carolina, et cetera.\n  Our courts cannot work if we don't have judges to run them. What is \nreally bothering some of our colleagues on the other side is that in \nrelation to the American Bar Association, their gold standard during \nall my 6 years as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the \nClinton years has suddenly not been a gold standard but a tin standard \nto them, because people like Miguel Estrada, with the unanimously well-\nqualified highest rating of the American Bar Association, are stopped. \nFor what reason? They do not even have a good reason.\n\n  The first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia, and not even a valid reason--at least I have \nnot heard one yet, and I have heard everything they have said.\n  Priscilla Owen, you can't find a better woman. Priscilla Owen became \na top-flight partner in one of the major law firms, broke through the \nglass ceiling for women, has been a mentor for women, is unanimously \nwell qualified, and a justice on the Texas Supreme Court. She has all \nkinds of Democrat support from Democrat co-justices right on through \nthe State--the people who know her the best. And she is being \nfilibustered.\n  Bill Pryor is as good a man as I have seen come before the committee; \nyes, a person with very deeply held views. He might be filibustered.\n  Judicial nominees' qualifications should matter most. And a person's \njudicial qualifications ought to be the sole criteria by which we judge \nthem. You cannot find better people than the ones I have been \nmentioning. I don't understand it. I don't understand why the other \nside is doing this. But they are doing it. And I think they are hurting \nthis process tremendously.\n  All I want--and all any reasonable person should want--and all the \npublic wants--is to have an up-and-down vote. Let these people be voted \nupon. If they are defeated, I can live with that. But if they are not \ndefeated, they should be able to serve without having their reputation \nsmeared, which is what these outside groups are doing. I don't think \noutside groups of the left or the right should be doing that. And they \nare distorting this process like I have never seen it distorted before.\n  Now, Senator Feinstein was not here when I showed that the left used \nthis slogan ``Catholics Need not apply.'' I don't think it is a good \nidea, whether these ``Catholics need not apply'' signs or ads come from \nthe left or from the right. And I would prefer them to be stopped.\n  I don't like my colleague from Vermont thinking that I think he has \neven an ounce of religious bigotry. I do not. He needs to know that. \nBut he can't just slide off and not recognize that this is where we are \nbeing taken by some of the attitudes and some of the approaches that \nare going on in the Senate Judiciary Committee--at least that is what \nthe people outside think, religious people.\n  I have to tell you something, some of the greatest judges in this \ncountry are Catholics--and from every other religion. And some of the \ngreatest ones have deeply held beliefs. But they are honorable, decent, \nhonest people, just like Bill Pryor.\n  Now, look, what really has offended me and got me going here today--\nand I knew we were not going to go any further on energy tonight \nbecause the Democrats brought this up. We have an hour scheduled for \nthe debate early in the morning tomorrow for a cloture vote. They don't \nwant this cloture vote. Why not? It takes 15 minutes. And they are \ntrying to say that we are tossing energy over the hill. They brought it \nup. And I am not going to let them get away with it anymore.\n  I care a lot for my colleagues on the other side. There is not one I \ndo not like. That is not the usual BS around here. I do like my \ncolleagues, and they know it. I don't feel good pointing out to them \nthat what they are doing is dangerous for this process, and that people \nall over this land are starting to get some wrong ideas--maybe right \nideas. I think these church leaders are not too far off. In fact, they \nmay very well be right. They took the time to let us know how they \nfeel.\n  But to come out here tonight and start this mess, and make these \npoints, and then say that we are not willing to get the Energy bill \ndone--come on. We have been doing a slow-walk around here for weeks now \non the Energy bill. My colleagues on the other side know that Senator \nDomenici has had some health problems and that it has been very \ndifficult for him, but he is a gutsy, strong Senator, one of the \ngreatest ones who has ever sat here. And he is never going to let you \nknow that he has been hurting. But they know.\n  We can do this bill by the end of this week, and we can still have \nour votes on cloture, which need to be done because the Senate is \ncapable of doing multiple things. If we were not, we would not have \nlasted for over 200 years. And we can do those trade bills, too, if we \njust have a modicum of cooperation from the other side. But, no, there \nis a slow-walk here. And some on our side--in fact, it is a growing \nnumber--are starting to believe that slow-walk is to try to make the \nSenate look bad. You can't make it look bad because we have had a lot \nof legislation go through this year. And we are going to keep plugging \naway until we get more that this country needs. But it sure is a chore \nevery step of the way.\n  I don't want to hear these phony arguments that we can't have 15 \nminutes for a cloture vote, or even an hour debate beforehand. We can \nstart at any time in the morning.\n  Most people do not even get moving around here until 10 o'clock. We \ncan do that without interfering with the energy debate. Senator \nDomenici was willing to be here all night long, if he had to, to take \namendments and move this along. I think we Republicans were ready to be \nhere for as long as it took to support him and others on the Democrat \nside who believe we need an Energy bill.\n  But to come out here and make these points against Bill Pryor that \nare not only false but demeaning to this body is wrong.\n  I am going to yield the floor. I know my colleague would like to \nspeak. I am tired of hearing these arguments how holy some on the other \nside are. But I tell you this, there are people all over this land who \nare starting to think this system is not fair to people of belief, to \npeople who have deeply held beliefs. I want you to know I am one of \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank so much the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. He has been a consistent defender \nof an independent judiciary. He takes those issues exceedingly \nseriously. He has defended them when there was a Democratic President \nand he was Chairman of the majority-Republican Judiciary Committee. He \ndefended the President's legitimate prerogatives in nominations. He has \nbeen consistent on that and everybody knows it. There is no basis to \ncriticize him.\n  Bill Pryor is a friend of mine. He is one of the finest, most decent \npeople I have ever known. There is not a Member of this body or a \nmember of any of these outside groups that has any more integrity, any \nmore decency, any more\n\n[[Page S10245]]\n\ncharacter than Bill Pryor. He is a sterling individual, an honest man. \nHe tells the truth.\n  When asked, ``if you disagree with a law or a court opinion that goes \nagainst your values, will you enforce it?'', he said: ``Senator, you \ncan take it to the bank.'' Not only did he say that, as so many of our \nnominees have and as we have accepted, he has demonstrated it time and \ntime again as Attorney General of Alabama.\n  It is really extraordinary to me. I don't think there is a politician \nin America who has so consistently taken very difficult positions in a \npolitical environment--positions most people would say a politician was \ncrazy to take--than Bill Pryor. He did it, and there is only one \nprinciple guiding him. What is that principle? It was required by the \nlaw. He is a man of the law.\n  Yes, he is a Christian gentleman. When he makes a statement, part of \nhis religion teaches that it ought to be an honest statement. So when \nhe said, ``if the courts rule on something I don't agree with, if it my \ncontradicts my views on abortion, I will follow the law,'' you can take \nit to the bank. That is the kind of man Bill Pryor is.\n\n  There has been an awful lot of railing about this ad by the Committee \nfor Justice. It has a courthouse chambers with a little sign on it, and \nthe sign says ``Catholics need not apply.'' Isn't this a legitimate \ncommentary on how people feel about what is happening here? You can \nagree or disagree, and say it is not a really an accurate statement if \nyou want to. I say it is legitimate commentary.\n  My colleagues went into a conniption fit about it. The ranking member \ntwice, in two separate hearings, called this ad despicable. Let me read \nfor you what it says.\n\n       As Alabama Attorney General, Bill Pryor regularly upheld \n     the law even when it was at odds with his personal beliefs. \n     Raised a Catholic, those personal beliefs are shared by \n     Mainers all across the Pine Tree State. But some in the U.S. \n     Senate are attacking Bill Pryor for having ``deeply held'' \n     Catholic beliefs to prevent him from becoming a Federal \n     judge. Don't they know the Constitution prohibits religious \n     tests for public office? Bill Pryor is a loving father, a \n     devout Catholic, and an elected Attorney General who \n     understands the law. The job of a judge is to uphold the law, \n     not legislate from the bench. It's time for his political \n     opponents to put his religion aside and give him an up-or-\n     down vote. It is the right thing to do. Thanks Senators Snowe \n     and Collins for making sure that the Senate stops playing \n     politics with religion.\n\n  I think that is a legitimate ad. It represents the view of a lot of \nAmericans. There is nothing despicable about that. But I will tell you \nwhat is despicable. It is despicable to lie and distort and \nmisrepresent this fine man's reputation, to impugn his integrity, to \nsuggest he did one thing wrong when he and a group of attorneys general \nraised money for the Republican Attorneys General Association. They are \ncandidates for office. They raise money all the time. There is nothing \nwrong with that. But the Democrats insisted there be an investigation, \neven though they had the records for many weeks.\n  Parenthetically, let me just talk about how they got those records. \nThe records came to Senator Kennedy, not to the chairman of the \ncommittee, myself, or the senior Senator from Alabama. Senator Kennedy \nhad them for some time before anyone else knew they existed. The lady \nwho gave them to him had been an associate of a certain Lannie Young in \nAlabama, who recently pled guilty to a bribery scheme investigated by \nthe United States Attorney's Office and Attorney General Bill Pryor. So \nshe leaks those documents to Senator Kennedy, and then, at his staff's \nsuggestion, to Senator Leahy. And then the Democrats want to have an \ninvestigation. So the chairman's staff says, OK, let's get the attorney \ngeneral on the phone. You can interview him, ask him any questions you \nwant to ask him about this effort to raise funds for the committee.\n  The bipartisan investigative staff had the phone call. The chairman's \nstaff asked many detailed questions, and Attorney General Pryor's \nanswers corroborated his testimony before the committee during his \nhearing and in written questions. The Democrats refused to ask Attorney \nGeneral Pryor any questions. Why? Because they wanted to stall his vote \nin committee. It was already the fourth time his hearing had been set. \nThe time had come up for a vote to be cast on his nomination in \ncommittee. The Democrats didn't want a vote. So they dragged it out, \npartly by invoking a rarely used two-hour rule, cut off debate, and \nobstructed a vote.\n\n  The chairman then said we were going to continue the investigation \nagain that night. He gave the Democrats another chance to call Attorney \nGeneral Pryor on the phone. They again turned down this opportunity. So \nthe investigation dragged on for over another week. They were given yet \nanother chance to get Attorney General Pryor on the phone and ask him \nany questions they had about this alleged issue. Instead, they called \n20 of the alleged contributors on the list. They called employees of \nthe Republican Attorneys General Association. Not one contradiction was \nfound. Nothing unethical was found. Yet the Democrats continue to sully \nhis reputation by implying that the investigation proved that Pryor \nmisled the Committee. This is wrong, because not one person in this \nbody has the integrity of Bill Pryor, I would say. This is a fine, \ndecent man who has lived his life doing the right thing. I feel \nstrongly about that. I won't back down.\n  I will tell you some other things that are despicable in the attack \non Bill Pryor. One of our Senators just said recently on this floor, \nwith regard to Bill Pryor's participation in a certain Supreme Court \ncase: He used his power as attorney general to obstruct the enforcement \nof the Violence Against Women Act in Alabama.\n  Now that is the kind of thing People for the American Way do. That is \nthe kind of attack the Alliance for Justice puts out. I am sure some \nstaff person put that language together for the Senator, and perhaps \nshe made her speech and didn't really understand what she was saying.\n  That is a false and unfair statement. Let me tell you what he argued \nwith respect to the Violence Against Women Act. He participated as \namicus in an appeal to the Supreme Court questioning whether the part \nof that act creating a federal civil remedy for a purely intrastate act \nviolated the Commerce Clause. Pryor argued his position to the Supreme \nCourt, and the Supreme Court agreed with him.\n  This falsehood about Bill Pryor's indifference to violence against \nwomen is also ironic, because he has a tremendous reputation in the \nState of Alabama for standing up for the victims of domestic violence. \nKathryn Coumanis is one of the leaders in the State in the movement to \nprotect women against domestic violence. She heads the Penelope House. \nShe has written on Bill Pryor's behalf and noted that the women's \ngroups in the State involved in the issue of violence against women put \nBill Pryor in their Hall of Fame. Yet we have people on this floor and \nwe have outside groups saying Bill Pryor does not care about violence \nagainst women. That is flat-out wrong.\n  We have seen some outside groups attack Bill Pryor, saying that he \nwas against the disabled. These groups should have been ashamed of \nthemselves. Who are they? The ACLU, the People for the American Way, \nthe National Abortion Rights Action League, Alliance For Justice. They \nwork together and they have a tremendous amount of money. They created \nthis supposed issue, sent out information to newspaper editors and made \nthese allegations that Bill Pryor had gutted the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, and he didn't care about people with disabilities. \nThey said so directly.\n  But what did he really do? He argued in the Garrett case against the \nconstitutionality of one small part of the Americans With Disabilities \nAct that said a State employee could sue the State of Alabama, or any \nother State, for money damages in federal court for violations of the \nAct. It was a suit against the University of Alabama, a State \ninstitution; and the Attorney General of Alabama, charged with the \nresponsibility of defending the State, said this in his brief: I \nbelieve in the Disabilities Act. I believe people with disabilities \nshould be treated fairly. The State of Alabama believes that under the \nFederal statute this person can get his or her job back. The Federal \ncourt can issue an injunction against the State of Alabama to remedy a \nviolation. But the Congress could not allow this State employee to sue \nthe State for money damages because, under the Eleventh Amendment \nprinciple of sovereign immunity, a state\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\ncannot be sued for money damages in federal court. This is because the \npower to sue is the power to destroy. A State always controls and \nlimits the power of a suit against itself.\n  Bill Pryor took this argument to the Supreme Court. What did the \nSupreme Court do? The Supreme Court ruled Attorney General Pryor was \ncorrect. And in any event, this affected only 4 percent of all the \ncases that might be brought, because only 4 percent of the employees in \nAmerica work for States. Most States have disability rights \nprotections, anyway. They don't need to file under the Federal Act.\n  This is why it is wrong and despicable and dishonest to say Bill \nPryor lacks sensitivity for the disabled simply because he legitimately \ndefended the State of Alabama and won in the Supreme Court. This attack \nshould not have been made.\n  Some say Bill Pryor is an activist. I would say he is an active \nattorney general. He is constantly working to preserve the rule of law \nand protect the legitimate interests of the people of Alabama. That is \nwhat he is paid to do. He is absolutely not an activist in the way \nChairman Orrin Hatch defines it. As Chairman Hatch defines it, an \nactivist is a nominee for the bench who will not restrain himself or \nherself to the law, but in fact seeks to carry out and further their \npersonal ideological agenda by twisting the meaning of words in \nstatutes and the Constitution, and to otherwise act in a way that \nallows their personal views to dominate their legal requirements. An \nactivist who seeks to be on the bench is someone who ought to be \nscrutinized carefully.\n\n  Bill Pryor is no activist. In fact, he is absolutely committed to the \nrule of law. His whole life and whole political philosophy has been \nbuilt on the fact that judges should be true to the law whether they \nagree with it or not. That is the whole purpose of the rule of law. \nThat is why this Nation is so wonderful, why we have so much freedom. \nWe follow the law to an extraordinary degree. A lot of countries that \nhave great potential never reach it because they don't have a rule of \nlaw that ensures predictability and justice.\n  As attorney general, Bill Pryor had to be an advocate. He proved to \nbe a great one. As attorney general, he consistently has followed the \nlaw courageously, even when he knew he might face complaints from \nfriends and allies. Members of the Senate should study his testimony \ncarefully and evaluate his real record, not the trumped-up charges, not \nthe bogus attack sheets being produced by outisde groups, and not \nmischaracterizations by these groups, some of which themselves have \nvery out-of-the-mainstream positions.\n  Let me say, parenthetically, that a number of these groups have \nextreme views on the separation of church and State. Some of these \ngroups believe there can be no drug laws, that we ought to legalize \ndrugs. Some believe there can be no laws against pornography. The ACLU \nopposes laws against child pornography. Who is out of the mainstream \nhere?\n  And let me ask you this: Why would leading African-American Democrats \nlike our Congressman Artur Davis, a Harvard graduate and a lawyer \nhimself, former U.S. Attorney; why would Representative Joe Reed, \nchairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference, a member of the \nDemocratic National Committee, one of the most powerful political \nfigures in Alabama for 30 years; why would Representative Alvin Holmes, \nRepresentative Holmes, a lieutenant with Dr. Martin Luther King, who \nhas been beaten for his commitment to civil rights, all speak up for \nhim? Why does the former Democratic Governor of Alabama speak so highly \nof him? Why does the Speaker of the Alabama House speak so admiringly \nof him?\n  All these people support him because he is not as Beltway attack \ngroups have caricatured him. He has been a champion of liberty and of \ncivil rights. Much has been changed in Alabama over the years. We have \nthe highest number of elected African-American officeholders in the \nUnited States. On the day we had General Pryor's nomination hearing, it \nmarked the anniversary of a sad day in which Governor Wallace stood in \na schoolhouse door. But you must know that Bill Pryor was not part of \nthat. He was a mere child at that time. Secondly, his parents were John \nF. Kennedy Catholic Democrats. I suspect this hearing might change some \nof their views. When he gave his inaugural speech after winning \nelection as attorney general, with 59 percent of the votes, he opened \nthat speech with these very telling words:\n\n       Equal under the law today; equal under the law tomorrow; \n     equal under the law forever.\n\n  Not segregation today, tomorrow, and forever, but equality. That is \nhow he led off his speech, and that is the kind of man Bill Pryor is. \nThose words were a fitting response 40 years after a promise of another \nkind.\n  Bill Pryor is one of the good guys. He does the right thing. He \nfrequently has refused pleas from his Republican friends when he \nthought the law didn't support their position. For example, those \nfriends rightly believed the legislative district lines had been \ngerrymandered in the State, making it very difficult for Republicans to \nwin legislative seats.\n  In fact, although we had in Alabama two Republican Senators, five \nRepublican Congressmen, and a Republican Governor, only a third of the \nstate legislature was Republican. Some Republicans felt that this was a \nredistricting problem. So they filed a voting rights suit arguing that \nthe majority-minority legislative districts were improper. They asked \nfor support from the Republican Attorney General. He would not take \ntheir side. He courageously led the case, as it turned out, for the \nAfrican-American Democratic position.\n  He lost before the three-judge district court--and backed up by an \namicus brief from the NAACP--won in the U.S. Supreme Court. His \nargument was plain and simple. He said the plaintiffs did not have \nstanding to file a lawsuit. Whether the lawsuit had been meritorious or \nnot, it was not a legitimate lawsuit because they did not have \nstanding. Attorney General Pryor took it to the Supreme Court, and the \nSupreme Court ruled with him. Some of my friends and some of Bill's \nfriends are still mad about that situation, but he believed that was \nthe right thing to do under the law, and he made that call as the \nattorney general for the State of Alabama.\n  He had taken an oath to defend the State of Alabama. These \ngerrymandered districts were the laws of the State of Alabama, endorsed \nby the legislature. So he defended the districts even when it went \nagainst the interest of his political allies.\n  That is why Joe Reed and Alvin Holmes speak highly of Bill Pryor. \nThey have seen him in action.\n  On one of the church-and-state issues that came up not long after he \nwas appointed Attorney General by our former Governor, the Governor had \na firm view about separation of church and State. Basically, he did not \nthink there was much separation. He read the Constitution pretty \nplainly. The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting \nthe establishment of a religion, and the Governor thought that meant \nthe United States Congress, not the State of Alabama. He did not adhere \nto the view that the 14th amendment incorporates the First and applies \nit to the States.\n  Then-Governor James said: What is wrong with coaches leading the \nplayers in prayer? He wanted Bill Pryor to file a lawsuit to vindicate \nhim. Shortly after having been appointed Attorney General--at a very \nintense and emotional time in the State, with the Governor of the State \nspeaking up for prayer in schools--Bill Pryor had to make a tough \ndecision. He had to review the law carefully.\n  What did he do? He filed a respectable brief in court. He would not \nfile the brief the Governor wanted, so the Governor got his own lawyer \nand he also filed a brief. As I know as a former Attorney General of \nAlabama, only the Attorney General is legally allowed to speak for the \nState in court. So Bill Pryor, as Attorney General, filed a brief \nsaying that the Governor--who had just appointed him--did not speak for \nthe State of Alabama.\n  Opponents said that Bill Pryor somehow is a tool of the chief justice \nof the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, who has deep convictions about \nhow the Constitution and the laws ought to be applied with regard to \nseparation of church and State, and who put in a monument in the court \nrecently that had the Ten Commandments on it. The judge did not think \nanything was wrong with that. He met with the Attorney General, and \nthey discussed legal actions against him to remove\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\nthe monument. They did not reach an accord. The attorney general did \nnot agree with the Chief Justice on his views of what the law was. So \neventually, the Chief Justice had to hire his own lawyer and file his \nown brief, and Attorney General Pryor filed a more limited brief \npointing out that if you go to the Supreme Court of the United States, \nthere are several different depictions of the Ten Commandments on the \nwalls of the U.S. Supreme Court. He basically said: What is good for \nthe U.S. Supreme Court ought to be good for the Alabama Supreme Court.\n\n  Opponents say Bill Pryor is extreme on religious issues. That is not \ntrue. For example, I mentioned earlier how he stood up and did what was \nright with regard to the pressure from the Governor on school prayer. \nAfter that decision, there was much confusion in the State. School \nboards did not know what to do; teachers were leading prayer; others \nsaid you cannot do that. What was the law?\n  To answer that question, Attorney General Pryor wrote guidelines for \nschool systems in Alabama advising them on what they could legally do \nas teachers, principals, and coaches, and what they could not do, and \nwhat children could do and what they could not do.\n  The Atlanta Journal Constitution wrote an editorial praising him for \nstepping up in a tough, emotional time and providing good leadership. \nAnd, indeed, the Clinton Administration basically adopted verbatim Bill \nPryor's guidelines, and sent them around the country to other schools.\n  This idea that he is some sort of extremist is absolutely false. This \nis a courageous lawyer who does the right thing day after day, time \nafter time to a degree I have never seen before by any politician in my \nlife.\n  On abortion, they say he has deeply held beliefs about abortion; he \ncannot be trusted to be a judge. The distinguished Senator from \nKentucky a few moments ago hit it exactly correctly. When a nominee has \ntaken a view that they believe abortion is wrong, then it is perfectly \nproper for the Senate to inquire about that. What should the inquiry \nbe? Senators should not say: Mr. Pryor, we want you to grovel down here \non the floor; we want you to renounce your views about abortion; we \nwant you to say, ``I don't believe that anymore,'' as a price for being \nconfirmed--that is absolutely wrong.\n  What should Senators say? They should say: Mr. Pryor, you have \nexpressed your view that abortion is bad, that you do not think Roe v. \nWade was rightly decided; but will you follow it? Then see what he \nsays. Senators do not have to accept what he says; they can inquire \nfurther. To those inquiries, Bill Pryor said ``Of course, I will follow \nthe law, Senator. You can take it to the bank.'' What is significant is \nthat Bill Pryor has a record showing that he will live up to that \nanswer.\n  As far as I can tell, there have been only two instances in his \npublic life in which he has dealt with abortion. The first had to do \nwith Alabama's partial-birth abortion statute, that severely restricted \npartial-birth abortion. Partial-birth abortion is a very horrible \nprocedure. Overwhelmingly, Americans reject it. The American Medical \nAssociation said it is never justified as a medical procedure. And \nAlabama passed legislation to virtually eliminate it.\n  As Attorney General, he superintended the State's district attorneys \nwho enforced this law. He sent them a directive in 1997 stating that \nparts of the partial-birth abortion bill were unconstitutional and \ncould not be enforced. Isn't that proof that he will follow the law \neven if he disagrees with it?\n  The other example involving abortion was when Attorney General Pryor \nissued stern warning that those who threatened violence against \nabortion clinics, or against those who sought to exercise the \nconstitutional right to abortion at those clinics, would be fully \nprosecuted.\n  So outside groups attack him on his deeply held beliefs, even deeply \nheld religious beliefs, and they suggest that somehow he is an \nextremist because he personally thinks that abortion is a taking of \ninnocent human life.\n  Bill is a thoughtful person. He is not some automaton for any church \nor any person. He thinks about these issues carefully. He has shared \nhis views about it. He believes that the life that is in the womb has \nall the characteristics of what that life will be as an adult. There is \nno doubt that it is going to become a human being. He believes that we \nought not to withdraw the law's protection from that life. That is his \nview.\n  But the Supreme Court has not bought it. In Roe v. Wade and Planned \nParenthood v. Casey they held differently. Bill Pryor said: I \nunderstand that. I will follow the Supreme Court precedents.\n  How do we know he will? Because he did it even with respect to the \npartial-birth abortion statute in Alabama. So I do not know what more a \nperson can do to prove his fidelity to the rule of law.\n  Bill has gained great support in the State. He is a man who is \nrespected across party lines, across racial lines. Representative Alvin \nHolmes wrote this powerful letter on his behalf, and he told the story \nabout Alabama's old constitutional provision that prohibited \ninterracial marriages. Of course, that had been struck down some time \nago by the United States Supreme Court. It was unconstitutional, but it \nremained in the constitution.\n  Alvin Holmes, as a lieutenant for Dr. Martin Luther King, and still a \nvibrant battler for civil rights in Alabama, said it ought to come out \nof the constitution. Attorney General Bill Pryor, as Alvin Holmes said, \nwas the only white politician in the State, Democrat or Republican, who \nsupported him. They got it out of the legislature, put it on the \nballot, and the people of Alabama eliminated it from our constitution. \nBill Pryor campaigned for that elimination throughout the State because \nhe thought it was wrong that our constitution would have those words \nstill in it.\n  This is a man of quite extraordinary character, a man of great skill \nand ability, who has taken cases to the Supreme Court and won them to \nan extraordinary degree.\n  So I submit there is nothing wrong with the ad that that group put \nout to defend Bill Pryor. It is basically an honest evaluation of the \nsituation. Somebody might disagree with it, but it is honest.\n  In contrast, many of the attacks on Bill Pryor have not been honest. \nOutside groups have been unfair and have deliberately twisted his \nrecord. What they have done is not right.\n  Some in this chamber say we need collegiality. They say Republicans \nshould renounce this outside ad about ``Catholics need not apply.'' I \nwould say this to my friends: Let's see you renounce some of these \nridiculous, obscene, despicable misrepresentations of Bill Pryor's \nrecord and his character. I would like to see that.\n  Yes, we do have a problem with collegiality, but I do not think it is \nthe result of Chairman Hatch's leadership. When he was Chairman of the \nCommittee, we moved 377 Clinton nominees. Only one was voted down. When \nhe was Chairman of the Committee, not one time did we vote down a \nClinton nominee on a party-line vote. During that short time, a year \nand a half or so, that the Democrats had a majority in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, they voted down in committee, on a party-line \nvote, two President Bush nominees.\n\n  In May, President Bush nominated 11 judges for the court of appeals. \nHe renominated one Democrat who had been nominated by President \nClinton, but not confirmed, and two Democrats overall. The Democratic \nJudiciary Committee promptly moved the 2 Democrats and confirmed them. \nAlmost 2 years later, several of the remaining nine had not even had a \nhearing in committee. This was an unprecedented slowdown of the \nconfirmation process.\n  The Democrats met and decided deliberately and consciously to change \nthe ground rules for confirmation. There is no doubt about that. Who is \nchanging the ground rules? I submit it is the Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee, by some of their tactics. They started an \neffective filibuster in the committee, creating a situation in which 9 \nout of the 19 members of the committee could withhold a vote by relying \non a misinterpretation of Rule IV. I have never heard of that.\n  The chairman properly ruled under Rule IV that the chairman has the \nprerogative to bring a matter up for a vote.\n  Their citation of rule IV ignores what it says the purpose of that \nrule.\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nThe first sentence says to bring a matter up for a vote and to deal \nwith a recalcitrant chairman who will not allow a matter to be voted \non, if you get one member of the other party and a majority vote, then \nyou can bring a matter up for a vote even if the chairman does not \nagree. But the rule does not give a group a right to filibuster and \nkeep a vote from occurring, which is what they wanted to do.\n  We have had two open, notorious and unprecedented filibusters on the \nfloor against superb circuit court nominees, Miguel Estrada and \nPriscilla Owen. Both received the highest rating by ABA, and both have \nextraordinary records. In the history of this country, we have never \nhad filibusters of circuit and district judges, but the Democrats have \nstarted two now because they decided to change the ground rules.\n  Now we have these Members come down on the Senate floor and act all \nupset that somehow collegiality is being upset here. They do not know \nwhy the chairman has determined to move nominations forward and not let \nthem be obstructed and delayed. I call on the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle who speaks for this party. There would not be a \nfilibuster of these nominations if he did not approve it. He needs to \nremember the history of this body. It is a mistake for him to lead the \nDemocrats into an unprecedented period in which we filibuster \nPresidential nominees for the federal courts.\n  I firmly believe a fair reading of the Constitution is that \nnominations for judgeships should be confirmed based on a majority \nvote. Any fair reading of the Constitution will show that. That is why \nwe have never filibustered in the history of the country, but the \nDemocrats have now created what in effect is a supermajority \nrequirement to block the right of nominees to an up-or-down vote.\n  There are many more things I could say about Bill Pryor. But I will \nnot do that tonight. I appreciate the indulgences of my colleagues and \nthe staff. This battle to allow people to have honest personal views, \nso long as those views do not influence their official interpretations \nof existing law, is an important battle for America. I intend to be a \npart of it and a lot of others do, too. It is not going away. We are \nnot backing down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, to those of us who have been given this \ngreat honor to serve in the Senate, there is a moment when we are asked \nto take the oath of office. In taking that oath of office, we swear to \nuphold one document. That document, of course, is the Constitution of \nthe United States of America.\n  We are not asked our religion, nor our beliefs in our religion. We \nare only asked if we will take an oath to God that we will uphold this \nConstitution. All of us take it very seriously and all of us take the \nwording of this Constitution very seriously because within this small \ndocument are words that have endured for more than two centuries. There \nwas wisdom in that Constitutional Convention which America has relied \non ever since.\n\n  Sometimes people say, times have changed. And we do amend the \nConstitution from time to time. By and large the principles that guided \nthose men who wrote this Constitution have guided this Nation to \ngreatness. I am honored to be a small part of this Nation's history and \nto serve in the Senate.\n  I looked to this Constitution for guidance for this debate tonight, \nand I find that guidance in Article 6 of the Constitution. Let me read \na few words from that book.\n\n     . . . no religious Test shall ever be required as a \n     Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United \n     States.\n\n  Most of the men who wrote this Constitution were religious people. \nThey had seen the abuse of religion. They had seen leaders in other \ncountries using religion for political purposes and against other \npeople. They came to this land and said, it will be different in \nAmerica. We are going to protect your right to believe. We are not \ngoing to establish a government church and we will say in our \nConstitution that no religious test will ever be required of a person \nseeking a nomination for public office in our land.\n  Those are very absolute and clear words. I am a Catholic, born and \nraised. My mother and father were Catholics. My children have been \nraised in the Catholic faith. In my lifetime, I have seen some amazing \nthings happen. In 1960, I was about 15 or 16 years old. There was a \nPresidential race with a candidate by the name of John Fitzgerald \nKennedy of Massachusetts. That may be the first Presidential election I \nfollowed closely. I remember watching the Los Angeles convention on my \nblack-and-white television at home in East St. Louis. I took a special \ninterest because I had a stake. The John Fitzgerald Kennedy candidacy \nwas the first opportunity since Alfred Smith for the election of a \nCatholic to be President of the United States. We do not think twice \nabout that now, but in 1960 it was a big deal. And a big problem for \nJohn Kennedy. So much so that he feared he might lose the election over \nthat issue.\n  He did something that was historic and I guess unprecedented. He went \nto Texas and addressed a Baptist convention to explain his view of the \nrelation of church and State because there were real concerns. Many \npeople felt that those who were believers of the Catholic church were \nso connected and so committed to the teachings of the church and to the \nleader of the church, the Pope in Rome, that they could not make \nobjective decisions on behalf of the United States; they would be \nclouded in their judgment because of the demands of their faith.\n  John Kennedy, a Catholic, went to Texas to a Baptist convention to \ntell those gathered that his first allegiance as President was to the \nUnited States and not to any religion. He said: I believe in America \nwhere the separation of church and State is absolute.\n  Many people think that statement and that visit turned the election \nfor John Kennedy, an election which he won by just a very small margin. \nIt dispelled the fears and concerns of many people across the country \nthat a Catholic would be first loyal to Rome and then loyal to the \nUnited States.\n  It is an interesting thing to reflect on the view of Catholics in \npublic life in 1960 and the debate which is taking place tonight. The \nissue has come full circle. Now there are those who argue that because \na nominee comes before the Senate and professes to be a Catholic that \nwe cannot ask that nominee questions about his political beliefs. There \nare many religious beliefs that are also political beliefs. There are \nsome religious beliefs that are not. You can be an adherent to the \nJewish religion, keep kosher, and I cannot imagine how that becomes a \npolitical issue. What is the purpose of asking a question about that? \nBut whether you are Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, or Muslim, it is \nappropriate to ask any nominee for a judicial position, Where do you \nstand on the death penalty? That is a political issue. It is a social \nissue. And yes, it is also a religious issue.\n\n  Some have argued tonight if a person comes before the Senate with \nstrong religious convictions that somehow we are disqualified from \nasking questions about political issues. I see it much differently. I \nthink the Constitution makes it very clear we should never ask a person \ntheir religious affiliation. Article 6 of the Constitution says that is \nnot a qualification for public office.\n  So what business do we have asking that question? But to say that \nbecause a person's political beliefs also happen to be their religious \nbeliefs, that for some reason we cannot ask questions about them, goes \nentirely too far.\n  Consider a so-called church in my State, the World Church of the \nCreator in Pekin, IL. A deranged individual named Matt Hale--who could \nnot be approved by the committee on character and fitness after he had \npassed law school and therefore was never licensed to practice law--\ndecided to create a church and an Internet Web site in the name of that \nchurch, the World Church of the Creator, and started peddling the most \nvenomous beliefs imaginable--bigoted, hateful, racist, anti-Semitic \nbeliefs in the name of religion. This church and its so-called \nteachings drew some demented followers. It culminated one day when one \nof those followers went on a shooting spree, killing a basketball coach \nof Northwestern University, Ricky Birdsong, and then driving over to \nthe University of Indiana and gunning down an Asian student, and was \nfinally apprehended.\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\n  When Matt Hale was asked about the activities of this individual, he \nsaid, that is just our religion. Their religion.\n  If someone who comes before us with unusual beliefs and political \nissues says, stop, you cannot ask me about those beliefs because they \nare my deeply held personal religious convictions, are we then \ndisqualified? If we are, imagine where that can lead.\n  In this case we have an individual, William Pryor, Attorney General \nof Alabama, who is a Catholic. The reason I know that is the chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch, asked him. That is the \nfirst time I can recall in the 4\\1/2\\ years I have served on this \ncommittee that it has ever been asked of any nominee. Tonight Senator \nHatch said he would never do it again. I am glad to hear him say that. \nI hope he never does that again and I hope no committee chairman of any \ncommittee ever asks any nominee for office their religion. The \nConstitution makes it clear we should not. But the exception was made \nby Senator Hatch and he asked Mr. Pryor his religion.\n  That triggered this ad campaign which we have discussed tonight and \nthis heated debate which many have followed in the Senate. We have had \nMembers come to the Senate, one who is a Catholic, saying, This is what \ngood Catholics believe.\n  I guess I was raised in a little different branch of the Catholic \nchurch, maybe a branch that believes there ought to be a little more \nhumility in religious belief. I don't like to stand in judgment of my \npeers as to whether they are good people or not; let their lives speak \nfor themselves. And I certainly would never stand in judgment of \nsomeone's adherence to a certain religious belief. That is personal, as \nfar as I am concerned. But not personal to some of my colleagues.\n  They come to the floor and make pronouncements about who is a good \nreligious person and who is not. I am not comfortable with that. In \nfact, I am a little bit uncomfortable discussing this issue of religion \nin the Senate, but I have no choice. It has been brought before us.\n  What I believe is this: Within the Catholic church there are many \ndifferences of opinion, even within the church members who serve in the \nCongress. I know of one or two who I think are really close to adhering \nto all of the church's beliefs in the way that they vote, but only one \nor two, because although those who come to the floor want to argue to \nyou that the Catholic Church is only about one issue, abortion, there \nare many of us who believe it is about a lot of issues.\n\n  It is about the death penalty--the death penalty, where the church \nhas been fairly clear in its position. Again, I am troubled that I \nwould even read this and put it into the Congressional Record, but I \nhave no choice, based on what has been said over the last 3 hours. This \nis a statement by Pope John Paul II, St. Louis, MO, January 22, 1999:\n\n       The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who \n     are unconditionally pro-life, who will proclaim, celebrate, \n     and serve the Gospel of life in every situation. A sign of \n     hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human \n     life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone \n     who has done great evil. Modern society has the means of \n     protecting itself without definitively denying criminals the \n     chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made most recently at \n     Christmas for a consensus to end the death penalty, which is \n     both cruel and unnecessary.\n\n  The words of Pope John Paul II. You didn't hear much reference to the \nCatholic Church's position on the death penalty tonight by those who \nwere saying that William Pryor is being discriminated against because \nof his Catholic beliefs. Perhaps it is because Mr. Pryor not only \nsupports capital punishment, he fought State legislation in Alabama \nwhich sought to replace the electric chair with lethal injection.\n  I am not going to stand in judgment as to whether or not he is a good \nCatholic. That is not my place. But I bring this issue before my \ncolleagues so they can understand that the Catholic Church is about \nmore than one issue. There are those who hold beliefs which may or may \nnot agree with all the teachings of that church, and that is within \ntheir conscience and their right to do. It is not mine to judge.\n  But for us to be told repeatedly by the other side of the aisle that \nto oppose William Pryor is to be against him because he is Catholic is \njust plain wrong, and I resent it. I resent it because, frankly, there \nare many reasons to oppose his nomination--because of his political \nbeliefs.\n  Oh, yes, some relate to his religion and some don't. But what we are \ntold in the Constitution is that distinction makes no difference; \nwhether they are religious or not, stick to political beliefs. And I \nbelieve my colleagues have really tried to do that on the committee.\n  Let me also say I was disappointed that the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, earlier quoted, I believe out of context, \nthe statement made by Senator Feinstein of California. It was unfair to \nher because she had left the floor and he characterized some of her \nremarks in ways that I don't believe she intended. To make certain that \nthe record is clear, I asked her staff to provide me with a copy of the \nspeech which she gave, and I would like to read an excerpt of that \nspeech given on the floor this evening by Senator Feinstein to clarify \nand make certain the Senate understands that the quote which was \nreferred to earlier by the Senator from Pennsylvania was inaccurate.\n  I quote what Senator Feinstein said:\n\n       Each time the Democrats oppose a nominee, we are accused of \n     some sort of bias unrelated to the merits. With Miguel \n     Estrada, we were accused of being anti-Hispanic. With \n     Priscilla Owen, anti-woman. With Charles Pickering, anti-\n     Baptist. And now, with William Pryor, anti-Catholic.\n       These charges have been described by some as \n     ``scurrilous,'' and I agree. To describe Democrats as anti-\n     Hispanic after the many Hispanic Clinton nominees that were \n     stopped in their tracks by a Republican majority is \n     disingenuous at best.\n       To call us anti-woman, well, [as Senator Feinstein said] I \n     don't have to tell you how bizarre it is for me to be called \n     anti-woman.\n       And to say we have set a religious litmus test is equally \n     false.\n       Many of us have concerns about nominees sent to the Senate \n     who feel so very strongly about certain political beliefs, \n     and who make intemperate statements about those beliefs that \n     we raise questions about whether those nominees can be truly \n     impartial.\n       And it is true that abortion rights are often at the center \n     of those questions. As a result, accusations have been \n     leveled that anytime reproductive choice becomes an issue, it \n     acts as a litmus test against those whose religion causes \n     them to be anti-choice.\n       But pro-choice Democrats have voted for many nominees who \n     are anti-choice and who believe that abortion should be \n     illegal--some of whom may have even been Catholic. I don't \n     know, because I have never inquired.\n       So this is not about religion. This is about confirming \n     judges who can be impartial and fair in the administration of \n     justice. And when a nominee like William Pryor makes some \n     fairly inflammatory statements and evidences such strongly \n     held beliefs on such core issues, it is hard for many of us \n     to accept that he can set aside those beliefs and act as an \n     impartial judge.\n\n  Somehow, that was characterized as questioning General Pryor's \nreligious beliefs. I do not think any fair reading would reach that \nconclusion. In fact, I think Senator Feinstein was as careful as we all \nhave been to draw that clear and bright line that the Constitution \nrequires us to draw.\n  She said at one point there--and it may come as curious to people \nfollowing the debate--that she is not certain about how many Catholics \nwe voted for because, you see, that is not one of the required \nquestions when a person applies for a judgeship in this country. We do \nknow, though, just by taking a look at some of their resumes, that they \nbelong to some organizations which suggest that they might be Catholic. \nSo I would like to say for the record that the argument that we have \nsomehow discriminated against Catholics who are opposed to abortion is \nnot supported by the evidence.\n  We have, for example, confirmed a circuit judge who was active in the \nKnights of Columbus and the Serra Club and sits on the board of a \nCatholic school--Michael Melloy.\n  We confirmed a district court judge who is a member of the parish \ncouncil of his Catholic church, the president's advisory board of a \nJesuit High School Parents' Club, the St. Thomas More Society for \nCatholic lawyers, and his State's chapter of Lawyers for Life--Jay \nZainey.\n  We confirmed a district court judge who was the former president of \nCatholic Charities of her city's diocese and a member of both the \nCatholic League\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\nand of the St. Thomas More Society--Joy Flowers Conti.\n  This serves as clear evidence that Democrats do not have an abortion \nlitmus test for judicial nominees. There have been many we have \nconfirmed who were opposed to Roe v. Wade and have made it very clear \nthat they are opposed to it.\n  Some names that I can refer to very quickly: John Roberts, DC \nCircuit; Jeffrey Howard, First Circuit; John Rogers, Sixth Circuit; \nDeborah Cook, Sixth Circuit; Lavenski Smith, Eighth Circuit; Timothy \nTymkovich, Tenth Circuit; Michael McConnell, Tenth Circuit; and the \nlist goes on.\n  So for colleagues to stand before us and say we discriminate against \nCatholics, the record doesn't show it. There are people who clearly \nhave Catholic affiliations in their background who have been approved \nby this committee and are supported by Democrats. For them to argue \nthat we have a litmus test and turn down judges just because they \noppose abortion denies over 140 nominees coming out of the Bush White \nHouse, most of whom are pro-life and most of whom disagree with Roe v. \nWade personally and still have won our approval. I read a partial list.\n  In my own situation, I am pro-choice. I have personal feelings \nagainst abortion but believe that in my public capacity women should \nhave the right to choose. And yet in my own home State of Illinois, of \nthe 12 judges I have had the privilege to appoint to the Federal bench, \nat least 3 I have come to learn afterward were pro-life. I learned it \nafterward because I didn't ask them in advance. It really wasn't a \ncondition for their appointment as far as I was concerned. I just want \nthem to be fair minded and balanced. Whether they disagree with me on \nthat issue or one other issue is really secondary.\n  So what we have before us today is an effort by the proponents of \nWilliam Pryor to ask us to look beyond his political beliefs and really \nturn this into a debate about religion. I hope we don't do that. I hope \nwe don't do it for his sake and I hope we don't do it for the sake of \nthe Senate.\n\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee meeting of last week was one of the \nsaddest times I have spent as a Senator. I saw things happen in that \ncommittee that I hope will never be repeated. I saw members of the \ncommittee raise the issue of religion in a way which the Constitution \nhas never countenanced and I hope and pray has never happened before in \nthat committee. I hope it never happens again.\n  The nomination of William Pryor is fraught with controversy. This \nwhole question about his involvement with the Republican Attorneys \nGeneral Association--we haven't even completed that investigation. This \nman's nomination comes to the floor before questions have been asked \nand answered that are serious questions about possible ethical \nconsiderations.\n  I won't prejudge the man as to whether he will be cleared of any \nsuspicion or not. But in fairness to him, in fairness to the process, \nin fairness to the Senate, should not we have completed that \ninvestigation before he was reported from committee?\n  When it comes to critical issues involving Mr. Pryor's background, a \nlot of different groups have raised questions about him. The argument \nis being made on the other side that the only reason you can possibly \noppose William Pryor is if you are anti-Catholic.\n  How then do you explain the editorials in opposition to his \nnomination? Editorials from Tuscaloosa, AL; editorials from Huntsville, \nAL; the Washington Post; Charleston, SC; St. Petersburg, FL; Arizona; \nthe Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Honolulu Adviser; Pittsburgh \nnewspapers--the list goes on.\n  Are we to suggest that all these newspapers that oppose his \nnomination are anti-Catholic? Not if you read the editorials. They have \ngone to his record and they have come to the conclusion that he is not \nthe appropriate person to serve in this circuit court capacity.\n  Let me tell you some of the issues they raise. Mr. Pryor's zeal to \nblur the lines between church and state, a line that was clearly drawn \nin our Constitution and clearly drawn by John Kennedy, Presidential \ncandidate, is a problem. He is so ideological about the issue that he \nhas confessed, ``I became a lawyer because I wanted to fight the \nACLU.'' He then derided that organization as standing for ``the \nAmerican `Anti-Civil' Liberties Union.'' I asked him if he would recuse \nhimself in cases involving the ACLU. He said no, but he pledged:\n\n       As a judge, I could fairly evaluate any case brought before \n     me in which the ACLU was involved.\n\n  Mr. Pryor and I are just going to have to disagree on that particular \nstatement.\n  He has been a staunch supporter of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore \nand his midnight installation of a 6,000-pound granite Ten Commandments \nmonument in the middle of the State courthouse. The Eleventh Circuit \nCourt recently ruled that the display was patently unconstitutional and \nhad to be removed.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Senator Feinstein asked him to explain \nhis statement that:\n\n     . . . the challenge of the next millennium will be to \n     preserve the American experiment by restoring its Christian \n     perspective.\n\n  He ducked the question.\n  I think if you are going to serve this Nation and you are going to \nserve this Constitution, you have to have some sensitivity to the \ndiversity of religious belief in this country. To argue that this is a \nChristian nation--it may have been in its origin but today it is a \nnation of great diversity. That diversity is protected by this \nConstitution. Obviously, Mr. Pryor has some problems in grasping that \nconcept.\n  On the issue of judicial activism, not only does Mr. Pryor have \nproblems with separation of church and state, he also has problems \nseparating law and politics. He believes that it is the job of a \nFederal judge to carry out the political agenda of the President. How \nelse could you interpret his comments about the Bush v. Gore case in \nthe year 2000 when he said:\n\n       I'm probably the only one who wanted it 5 to 4. I wanted \n     Governor Bush to have a full appreciation of the judiciary \n     and judicial selection so we can have not more appointments \n     like Justice Souter.\n\n  That is a statement by William Pryor.\n  On another occasion, he said:\n\n       [O]ur real last hope for federalism is the election of Gov. \n     George W. Bush as President of the United States, who has \n     said his favorite Justices are Antonin Scalia and Clarence \n     Thomas. Although the ACLU would argue that it is \n     unconstitutional for me, as a public official, to do this in \n     a government building, let alone at a football game, I will \n     end my prayer for the next administration: Please God, no \n     more Souter.\n\n  I ask Mr. Pryor, a member of the Federalist Society, whether he \nagrees with the following statement from the Federalist Society \nmission: ``Law schools and the legal profession are currently strongly \ndominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a \ncentralized and uniform society.'' I have asked this question of almost \nevery Federalist Society member that has been nominated by President \nBush. Mr. Pryor is the only person who gave me a one word answer. He \nsaid, ``Yes.''\n  On the issue of federalism, Mr. Pryor has been a predictable, \nreliable voice for entities seeking to limit the rights of Americans in \nthe name of States' rights. He has filed brief after brief with the \nSupreme Court arguing that Congress has virtually no power to protect \nState employees who are victims of discrimination.\n  Under his leadership, Alabama was the only State in the Nation to \nchallenge the constitutionality of parts of the Violence Against Women \nAct, while 36 States filed briefs urging that this important law be \nupheld in its entirety--the exact opposite position of one Attorney \nGeneral William Pryor.\n  He also filed a brief in the recently decided case of Nevada v. \nHibbs. He argued that Congress has no power to ensure that State \nemployees have the right to take unpaid leave from work under the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. A few months ago the Supreme Court \nrejected his argument and said:\n\n       Mr. Pryor, you have gone too far this time.\n\n  The issue of women's rights has been well documented. I will not go \ninto those again.\n  On the issue of voting rights, Mr. Pryor urged Congress to eliminate \na key provision in the Voting Rights Act which protects the right to \nvote for African Americans and other racial minorities. While \ntestifying before this committee in 1997, Mr. Pryor urged Congress to \n``seriously consider . . . the repeal or amendment of section 5 of\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nthe Voting Rights Act'' which he labeled ``an affront to federalism and \nan expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness.''\n\n  Given the importance of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to the \nability of African Americans and other racial minorities to achieve \nequal opportunity in voting, this call for its repeal is deeply \ndisturbing. Thankfully, the Supreme Court and Congress disagreed with \nMr. Pryor about the importance of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n  There was one case involving inmates' rights which I thought was \nparticularly noteworthy. He has been a vocal opponent of the right of \ncriminal defendants. In Hope v. Pelzer, Attorney General Pryor \nvigorously defended Alabama's practice of handcuffing prison inmates to \noutdoor hitching posts for hours without water or access to bathrooms. \nThe Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pryor's arguments citing the ``obvious \ncruelty inherent in the practice,'' and calling the practice \n``antithetical to human dignity'' and circumstances ``both degrading \nand dangerous.''\n  In a July 2000 speech, Attorney General Pryor was outspoken in his \ndisdain for the Supreme Court's reaffirmation in Dickerson v. United \nStates of the constitutional protection of self-incrimination first \narticulated in Miranda. He called the Dickerson decision, authored by \nChief Justice Rehnquist an ``awful ruling that preserved the worst \nexample of judicial activism.''\n  The list goes on.\n  In the case called United States v. Emerson, Attorney General Pryor \nfiled an amicus brief to argue that a man who was the subject of a \ndomestic violence restraining order should be allowed to possess a \nfirearm.\n  Let me repeat that.\n  The man who was the subject of a domestic restraining order should be \nallowed to own a firearm.\n  Mr. Pryor called the Government's position a ``sweeping and arbitrary \ninfringement on the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.'' He \nwas the only State attorney general in the United States of America to \nfile a brief in support of that position.\n  When it comes to tobacco, he has been one of the Nation's foremost \nopponents of a critical public health issue--compensation for the harms \ncaused by tobacco companies. He has ridiculed litigation against \ncompanies stating:\n\n       This form of litigation is madness. It is a threat to human \n     liberty, and it needs to stop.\n\n  Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore said:\n\n       Bill Pryor was probably the biggest defender of tobacco \n     companies of anyone I know. He did a better job of defending \n     the tobacco companies than their own defense attorneys.\n\n  Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a Republican, said of William \nPryor:\n\n       He's been attorney general for about five minutes, and \n     already he's acted more poorly than any other attorney \n     general.\n\n  On the issue of environmental protection, time and again he has \nlooked the other way when it comes to protecting our environment.\n  For people to argue that the only position against William Pryor is \nbased on his religion ignores the obvious. When it comes to his \npolitical beliefs, when it comes to his actions as attorney general of \nAlabama, time and time again he has taken extreme positions.\n\n  Should this man be entrusted to a lifetime appointment to the second \nhighest court of the land? I think not. Many others agree with that \nconclusion.\n  I certainly hope that when this debate ends, however it ends, that we \nwill call an end to the involvement of religion in this debate.\n  It has been a sad night for me to listen to what some of my \ncolleagues have said in an effort to promote the political agenda of a \ncertain part of America in an effort to promote the candidacy of an \nindividual. I am afraid many of my colleagues have crossed a line they \nshould never have crossed.\n  I hope and pray that before we utter the next sentence in relation to \nthe Pryor nomination that each of us who has taken an oath to uphold \nthis Constitution will stop and read article VI:\n\n       No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification \n     to any office or public trust in the United States.\n\n  Those words have guided our Nation for over 200 years. They should \nguide each of us in good conscience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I served in the Congress since 1972. I have \nhad the good fortune to listen to some brilliant statements made on \nvarious subjects over 21 years. But I have to say that the statement by \nthe senior Senator from Illinois tonight is the finest statement I have \never heard in some 21 years. I hope the people of Illinois know what \npride we have in Dick Durbin.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10251-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10251-S10252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--Continued\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, obviously we have not had the progress we \nhad hoped for on the Energy bill over the course of the last several \ndays. I know that Senators have indicated they still have amendments to \nthe electricity amendment. And it is clear to me there is not a \ndefinite sign as to when we might finish that issue.\n  Members have the ability to slow down this bill. With the lengthy \namendment list that is before us, there are many options to do that. \nAfter numerous discussions today, it is clear to me we are not on a \ncourse to complete this bill over the next couple of days.\n  It is important to do. I set out several weeks ago--actually 2 months \nago--stating that the objective would be to work aggressively over the \ncourse of this final week, having had the bill before us in May, \nspending a number of days before this week on this bill.\n  In spite of that commitment on my part to plow ahead, it appears to \nme now--Wednesday night at 10 o'clock--that the writing is on the wall: \nWe are not going to be able to complete the bill.\n  Having said that, I think it is important that Members have an \nopportunity to really prove their commitment to this underlying bill. \nAgain and again, I have heard: Yes, we want to pass a comprehensive \nnational energy policy. Although I hear that, and I express this \nwillingness--and I think that is probably right--it is important, \nbefore we leave for this August recess, to see what that commitment \nreally represents. Thus, I will shortly file cloture, and the Senate \nwill have the opportunity to go on record for completing a bill which \nwill accomplish just that--establishing a national energy policy.\n  Mr. President, in that regard, I now ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendments in order for me to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have to get ready for the Kuhl \nnomination, about which the two Senators from California feel very \nstrongly.\n  I know it is the chairman's intention to work through amendments \ntomorrow on S. 14, but I think there will be a lot of other issues done \nand there will not be amendments offered on that bill. As I indicated \nwhen I started this brief statement, the ultimate decision will be made \nby Senator Daschle, but I am giving the majority my thoughts this \nevening.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I have talked to both \nthe Democratic leader and the chairman, and we agree after the cloture \nvote to go to the bill to work through the amendments. I am very \nhopeful over the course of the morning and over the course of the day \nthat we will be able to make substantial progress on this important \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10253-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9 A.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, I have been trying to find \nthe appropriate wrinkle in this important debate on the Energy bill to \nshare with the Senate something that I heard on the radio this morning \nthat almost caused me to drive off the road.\n  Given the fact that we have, over the last couple of weeks, just gone \nthrough and passed an important bill with regard to the Department of \nHomeland Defense, given the fact that former Senators Warren Rudman and \nGary Hart have compiled a major report continuing to warn us that we \nare dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic \nterrorist attack in the U.S., and given the fact that we are all, every \nday, reminded of the war on terror and how we are going to protect \nourselves, something I heard on the radio this morning makes me wonder \nthat we must not be listening.\n  According to intelligence reports made public yesterday, terrorists \nmay be plotting suicide missions by hijacking commercial airliners, \nmost likely in the United States, but clearly it could be anywhere in \nthe world. Such a plot is detailed in a memo from our own \nTransportation Security Administration. I want to quote from it:\n\n       The plan may involve the use of five-man teams, each of \n     which would attempt to seize control of a commercial aircraft \n     either shortly after takeoff or shortly before landing at a \n     chosen airport. This type of operation would preclude the \n     need for flight-trained hijackers.\n\n  Madam President, the threat that we face from terrorist organizations \nis still with us ever since we were rudely awakened on September 11. \nAnd interestingly, at the same time that we are informed of these \npotential new terrorist plots, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, in a shocking disclosure that I heard on the radio \ntoday, reportedly intends to cancel air marshals on some of our most \nvulnerable commercial flights.\n  And if that is not enough, they are reportedly also cutting back on \nthe training for new air marshals. In the wake of these reports, the \nagency says it has every available air marshal deployed right now and \nadditional resources are being directed to this critical program. I \ncertainly hope so.\n  The air marshal program was instituted as the front line of defense \nagainst would-be hijackers. Just knowing there is someone trained and \narmed who is usually sitting in the first-class section if somebody is \ntrying to bust forward into the cockpit is a great comfort. What is the \nreasoning behind these reported cuts I heard on the radio that almost \ncaused me to run off the road? It is that the Transportation Security \nAdministration does not want to pay for the hotel rooms for the air \nmarshals for overnight stays.\n  What price do we pay for security? That is almost like saying, while \nwe are at it, we are going to get rid of the x-ray machines in security \nlines at the airports because we want to save on electricity, which, of \ncourse, is a ridiculous argument.\n  The Transportation Security Administration, according to the news \nreports, says it is trying to save $104 million. That might be a \nlaudable goal, but I suggest we ought to start looking at the $8 \nmillion program that has already been spent in the Pentagon that has \nrecently come to the fore and has caused such a flap. That is the \nprogram that would allow people to gamble on on the likelihood of \nterrorist attacks and assassinations, on which we have all joined in \nmutual disgust--that there was such a program.\n  Now having been denied that program, it will not continue, said the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense in testimony yesterday before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and yet that was an $8 million program.\n  I have been waiting all day to say--and I thank the Senators for \ntheir indulgence--that when it comes to the defense of our citizens, we \ncannot afford to cut corners. If we do, we will have forgotten the \nlessons of September 11. I hope the radio report I heard this morning \nthat they are seriously considering cutting back on the air marshals \nprogram is not true. Clearly, let's not forget the lessons of September \n11.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10255-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10255-S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

This report meets the \nrequirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con.

Current level for revenues is $1 million below the \nbudget resolution in 2003.\n  Since my last report, dated July 3, 2003, the Congress has cleared \nand the President has signed the following acts that changed budget \nauthority, outlays, or revenues: the Veterans' Memorial Preservation \nand Recognition Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-29), the Welfare Reform Extension \nAct of 2003 (P.L. 108-40), and the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act \n(P.L. 108-61).\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a cover letter and attached tables \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2003.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Private \nFirst Class Wilfredo Perez, Jr., United States Army, of Norwalk, CT. \nPrivate Perez's loyalty, patriotism, and selflessness has served to \nfurther the legacy of our great Nation's principles of freedom and \njustice. His service to our Nation is an example of the powerful spirit \nthat permeates American history. His country, his family, his Army, his \nbrothers-in-arms, and his friends from home will keenly miss Private \nPerez.\n  A mortarman in the 1st Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 4th Infantry \nDivision, PVT Perez and members of his unit were guarding a hospital \nwhere wounded comrades were being treated. In a contemptible and \ncowardly act, a grenade was lobbed from the upper floors of the \nhospital, killing PVT Perez and two other gallant soldiers.\n  PVT Perez, or ``Junior,'' as his family called him, was an outgoing \nand charming person, well liked and remembered fondly by both staff and \nclassmates of Norwalk High School as someone who had found focus and \nwas pursuing his dreams. He cared about his family, and had a \npropensity for the simple things in life, like playing golf with his \ndad, working on his car or skiing. He worked with his dad as a \nremodeling contractor prior to going into the Army and his family had \nhigh hopes for him as he started to plan for his future.\n  I am both proud and grateful that our military is made up of young \nmen and women whose values are exemplified by PVT Perez's service to \nthe United States Army and his country. PVT Perez was a messenger of \nhigh justice and idealism in the best tradition of American principles \nand patriotism.\n  I join a grateful Nation in extending my heartfelt condolences to his \nfamily. Thank you for sharing this outstanding soldier with us. His \ncountry, his Army, his brothers-in-arms and his friends at home will \nkeenly miss PVT Perez. You may be justifiably proud of his \ncontributions to a noble cause and a people in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10256-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10256-S10257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ANTHONY G. FREEMAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the end of this week, Anthony G. Freeman \nwill leave the post of Director of the\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\nWashington Office of the International Labor Organization, or ILO, \nafter almost a decade serving this specialized agency of the United \nNations in its liaison with the executive and federal branches of the \nU.S. Government. These last 9 years spent in this important role follow \nhis 33-year career as a U.S. Foreign Service Officer.\n  In that career, Mr. Freeman represented our country all over the \nworld: in Valencia, Spain and Rome, Italy; in Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo \nand La Paz. From 1983 to 1992, he served as Coordinator for \nInternational Labor Affairs and the Agency for International \nDevelopment. In that capacity, he was Special Assistant to three \nSecretaries of State.\n  Tony Freeman's professional focus has been advancing the role of \nfreedom of labor around the world, promoting the dignity and safety of \nworkers wherever they toiled. He was a labor specialist who served as \nlabor officer in many of his posts around the world. This experience \nwas developed over three decades, culminating in his last assignment at \nthe State Department as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for \nDemocracy, Human Rights and Labor. No one understands better than Tony \nFreeman that true democracy cannot exist without human rights and \nneither exist without the freedom of the working man and woman.\n  Some may not be aware of the importance that American labor has \nplayed in U.S. foreign policy through the decades. Some may not \nappreciate the role that the American worker has played in building \nalliances with workers around the world, conveying and supporting \ntraditions of freedom--freedom to work and to organize and to be free \nof oppression--that are an essential aspect of American society. \nAmerican unions, working through the State Department and working \nindependently, have done great work advancing freedom around the \nplanet, and continue to do so today.\n  American unions were some of the greatest forces fighting communism \nduring the cold war. The great Irving Brown, who I am pleased to say \nbecame my mentor and friend early in my career, when he introduced me \nto a fledgling Polish union named Solidarity, made his reputation \nimmediately after World War II, when he worked tirelessly with Italian \nand French labor movements to prevent those nations from succumbing to \nSoviet influence.\n  Lane Kirkland, the president of the AFL-CIO from 1979-1995, was a \nstaunch anti-communist who played an important role in defending \nSolidarity in its early years. I was happy to work with these great \nmen. I come from the working class. I worked as a lather to support my \nyoung family while I went to school, and I am proud to this day that I \nwas a union member. It was easy and natural for me to work with other \nanti-communists from the labor movement to help defeat Soviet tyranny. \nIn later years, Lane Kirkland would say to me, ``Orrin, if only your \ndomestic policy was as good as your foreign policy.'' ``Well, Lane,'' I \nwould retort, ``I could pay you the same compliment!''\n  After 33 years working labor issues at the Department of State, Tony \nFreeman accepted the position of Director of the Washington Office of \nthe International Labor Organization in late 1994. I first worked \nclosely with Tony in 1995 and 1996, when a misguided congressional \ninitiative threatened to defund U.S. participation in the ILO. It was a \ntime when the ILO needed to make itself relevant to U.S. audiences, \nparticularly Congress. Irving Brown's legacy with the ILO, when we all \nworked together to fight Soviet communism, was a great historical \nachievement, but that did not move policy-makers in Washington \nsearching for new roles for international organizations in the post-\nCold War era.\n  I joined with the late senator from New York, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, who, incidentally, did his doctoral dissertation on the ILO, \nto defend continued U.S. support for this organization. Supporters of \nthe ILO came to our offices, including representatives from the Labor \nDepartment, unions and U.S. businesses. The beauty and strength of the \nILO is that it is the only tripartite international organization of its \ntype in the world, where workers and employers from all member nations \njoin to address labor questions alongside their governments. We made \nour case that the ILO's relevance in an era of expanding trade and \nglobalization, as well as spreading transnational challenges like child \nlabor exploitation, was greater than ever.\n  And we prevailed, and the U.S. continues to play a role in that \nimportant body. All of the coordination to preserve that role was \norganized by Tony Freeman, and today I want to express my personal \ngratitude for that important work in 1996.\n  Tony's efforts did not peak then, and he spent the following years \nraising the ILO's visibility, and its new missions, before new \naudiences in the U.S. He developed closer ties between the ILO and \nhuman rights groups in the U.S. He drew their attention to the basic \nhuman right of working people around the world to have a voice in the \nworkplace, and to the work of the ILO to free people trapped in slavery \nand bondage, including the forced laborers in Burma. He strengthened \nthe common bond between the ILO and organizations and policy makers \nfighting to end abusive child labor and saw large increases in U.S. \nfunding for the ILO's child labor programs. In addition, Tony Freeman \nworked tirelessly to gain U.S. ratification of ILO conventions, and, \nduring his tenure at the ILO, he made a signal contribution to the \nefforts that led to U.S. ratification of Convention No. 176 on Safety \nand Health in Mines in 2001.\n  I understand that Tony will be teaching in Washington in the coming \nyears, as well continuing to offer his lifetime of experience and \ncounsel. I am relieved to hear this, because we still need Tony \nFreeman's experience. He has lived a great life of service to the \nworking man and woman, across all borders, and he has served the \nAmerican public well. Today, I wish to honor the work of Tony Freeman \nall these years. I thank him for his 33 years in the State Department. \nI thank him for the critical leadership he provided the International \nLabor Organization. I thank him for putting up with all my Irving Brown \nstories. I thank him for his friendship. Most of all, I wish to thank \nTony Freeman for his service to his country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10257-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Portland, \nOR. On November 13, 1988, Mulugeta Seraw was savagely beaten to death \nby three white supremacists. Seraw had been visiting with two other \nEthiopian males and was on his way home when he was attacked. Three \nmembers of the East Side White Pride jumped out of their car and beat \n27-year-old Seraw to death with steel baseball bats.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10257-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10257-S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              POSTWAR IRAQ\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, President Bush did the right thing today \nby taking personal responsibility for the inclusion of misleading \nintelligence information in this year's State of the Union. But he has \nyet to turn his full attention to the more urgent matter at hand, \nwinning the peace in Iraq.\n  To finish the fight and help build a free Iraq, President Bush must \ncreate a new national and international consensus for the benefit of \nour Nation's security, the future of the Middle East and the well-being \nof America's fighting men and women.\n  A new consensus is only possible, however, if the administration is \nhonest enough to admit what is not working in Iraq and courageous \nenough to design a new approach that will.\n  The President must acknowledge a plain truth that everybody knows. \nThis war is not over, and his administration declared a premature \nvictory. Our military did a superb job toppling Saddam;\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nnow they need the support, the resources, and the right troops to \ndefeat the significant pockets of guerilla opposition that remain.\n  Unfortunately, unless we adjust our course, the management of postwar \nIraq may well be viewed by history as the most consequential \nmismanagement of an international crisis by any U.S. administration \nsince Vietnam.\n  Notwithstanding the deaths of Qusai and Odai Hussein, the joint U.S.-\nUK mission is in deep trouble. Nine months ago, I called for the \nadministration to enlist NATO in comprehensive planning for postwar \nIraq. What we are seeing now is the costs of failing to plan and \nrefusing to internationalize our approach.\n  The departure of Saddam Hussein from power is an opportunity to \nchange the course of history in the Middle East. That is one reason I \nsupported and celebrated Iraq's liberation. It could have been, should \nhave been, and still might prove a victory for people everywhere who \nrespect human rights, cherish freedom, seek to halt the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction, and believe that peace between Arabs and \nIsrael is both achievable and essential.\n  To succeed, we will need all the help we can get--from NATO and other \nallies, the U.N., and friends within the Arab and Muslim communities. \nThe President apparently believes that we can succeed largely on our \nown.\n  The American people are starving for some straight talk. There is no \nreason except failed Presidential leadership that 90 percent of the \nforeign troops in Iraq are American. As commander in chief, he should \nbe able to assure the families of our Armed Forces in Iraq that \nabsolutely everything is being done to help them achieve their mission \nand come home safely and soon. He could not honestly provide such an \nassurance today.\n  Our troops won't get the help or protection they need unless the \nadministration offers to share authority and responsibility for \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq. The President should not let past \ndisagreements or misguided ideology stand in the way. The \nadministration has little patience for diplomacy, so they argue that a \nU.N. framework means a loss of American control.\n  That is simply untrue. Like we did in Kosovo, we should ask the U.N. \nto provide a mandate for a coalition-led force that will work in \nconsultation with, but not under the control of, the U.N. civilian \nadministration. That will preserve the absolutely essential American \ncontrol of our forces, but create a framework in which many nations can \nparticipate comfortably.\n  The Bush administration must level with the world and with the \nAmerican people. A new consensus must be built on the truth. Winning \nthe peace in Iraq will require many months, probably several years. It \nwill cost tens of billions of dollars more than can be accounted for by \nIraqi oil revenues. It will entail grave, ongoing risks to our Armed \nForces. But it is a necessary, even noble, mission in which every law-\nabiding and freedom-loving country has a stake, and to which each \nshould be invited to contribute not as a favor to America, but as a \ngift to our common future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10258-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE NOMINEES TO DOJ\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2004 \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill. As chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I want to congratulate the members of the \nnew Appropriations Subcommittee on successfully completing the first \nannual appropriations bill providing funding for the new Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Just as the Department of Homeland Security has made momentous \nprogress in protecting our citizens while simultaneously creating a new \ngovernment agency, the members of the Homeland Security Subcommittee \nhave moved expeditiously to recommend funding in a responsible manner. \nThere is no bill more important to the citizens of Utah, and we \nrecognize the committee's important efforts.\n  The bill's appropriation of $28.5 billion accomplishes many things. \nOne of the most important is continued support of the Office for \nDomestic Preparedness. This office, which awards grants to State and \nlocal agencies to assist them in preparing our first responders, has \nhad a 1,500 percent increase in funding since September 11, 2001. \nToday's recommendation of $3.6 billion will bring the total amount \nspent on first responder preparedness to $8.8 billion since that \nfateful day.\n  Our Nation's airports are infinitely more protected than they were \njust one year ago. The bill continues this important work by providing \n$4.5 billion for passenger and baggage screening and airport security. \nIt also provides $4.9 billion for securing our borders. The bill funds \nthe US VISIT system development with $380 million. This new system will \nallow our Nation to collect, maintain and share appropriate information \nin order to determine the eligibility of foreign citizens wishing to \nvisit the United States.\n  I appreciate that the committee has decided not to earmark funding \nfor specific Congressional requests and to leave these decisions to the \nappropriate agencies. The defense of our Nation and in particular the \nprotection of our citizens will never be achieved by purely political \ndecisions, but through diligent hard work and strategic planning.\n  However, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention a program \nthat has already proven its effectiveness in protecting our citizens \nand was initiated by the Office for Domestic Preparedness. Last year, \nthe Office for Domestic Preparedness asked Dugway Proving Ground to \ndevelop and teach a Ph.D driven chemical and biological emergency \nresponder course. Dugway Proving Ground is our Nation's chemical and \nbiological defense proving ground. The result of these classes has been \nan unparalleled success and the student responses were overwhelmingly \npositive. Participants in the class were unanimous in their praise and \nthe Chief of the Chicago HAZMAT Unit categorized the program as ``one \nthat all first responders should attend.'' A student commented further \nthat ``This was the best use of time in my 25 year career.'' The \ncourses focused on agent characteristics, sampling, protection, \ndetection, decontamination and chem/bio production recognition, such as \nthe difference between clandestine drug laboratories, industrial \naccidents or chemical/biological production capabilities. Students also \nlearned to assess a situation in order to determine the proper course \nof action. Clearly, these first responder training courses at Dugway \nare a national resource and though the Committee did not recommend \nfunding for individual programs, I hope that the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness will continue to sponsor this important program.\n  I congratulate the committee on its fine work and urge the Senate's \napproval of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10258-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10258-S10259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CULTURAL BRIDGES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next week 54 high school students from \nthe Islamic and Arab world will arrive in the United States for a year \nof study under a new exchange program to help bridge the cultural \ndivide between America and the Islamic and Arab nations of the world. \nSecretary Powell will welcome the students at a ceremony at the State \nDepartment on Wednesday, August 5.\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\n  An initial $10 million for the Cultural Bridges Program was approved \nlast year by Congress for the coming academic year. I commend the State \nDepartment for moving so quickly to organize the program and bring the \nfirst group of high school students to the United States. By the end of \nthe summer as the new academic year begins, 135 high school students \nwill be here for a year of study in high schools in 23 States under the \nprogram.\n  The students are coming from many nations throughout the Islamic \nworld--Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan, \nSyria, Tunisia, Turkey, and Yemen, and from the West Bank and the Gaza \nstrip as well. Each student will live with an American host family, \nattend a local high school, learn first hand about our society and \nvalues, and enable our students to learn about them.\n  Officials in the State Department are already preparing their \nrecruitment and outreach efforts for the 2004-2005 academic year, when \nthey hope to double the size of the program. If all goes well, that \nnumber will double again in the following year.\n  The terrorist attacks on September 11 and the war in Iraq have \nbrought into sharp focus the many negative images and perceptions of \nour Nation abroad. Many Muslims believe our country is at war with \nIslam, not terrorism. With nearly 1.5 billion people living in the \nIslamic world today, we ignore these pervasive anti-American sentiments \nat our peril.\n  If the United States is to win a genuine victory in the war against \nterrorism, we must respond on many levels. We must ensure that our \ndefenses are strong, our intelligence is accurate, and our borders are \nsecure. But we must also do all we can to dispel the disturbing trend \nof anti-American rhetoric and beliefs. An effective way to do so is to \nengage Islamic peoples in the realm of values and ideas.\n  In a May 3, 2002 speech to the World Affairs Council in California, \nDeputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz spoke of the need to \nstrengthen voices of moderation in the Islamic world and to bridge the \n``dangerous gap'' between that world and the West. There is ``no time \nfor delay,'' he said.\n  As we have seen in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Middle East, some \nindividuals and factions and even governments have supported terrorist \norganizations, while others have condemned terrorism and pledged to \nhelp the United States in combating it. By reaching out in friendship \nto those who oppose terrorism we can reduce the breeding grounds for \nterrorism and begin to eliminate the sentiments that terrorist \nrecruiters exploit.\n  One of the most effective ways to engage the Islamic world is through \neducational exchange programs, which promote people-to-people contacts \nbetween Americans and other peoples.\n  Exchange programs help to build strong personal relationships and \ncombat the misperceptions about the United States that threaten our \nsecurity. Unfortunately, exchanges between the Islamic world and the \nUnited States are very limited today. Of the more than 500,000 foreign \nstudents in the United States, less than 5 percent are from the Arab \nMiddle East.\n\n  There are many benefits in reaching out to students while they are \nyoung and open-minded. Today's high school students are tomorrow's \nleaders. Working with them now can improve their attitudes about our \ncountry and build future relationships based on trust and \nunderstanding. As Secretary of State Colin Powell said in his August \n2001 statement on International Education Week: ``I can think of no \nmore valuable asset to our country than the friendship of future world \nleaders who have been educated here.''\n  What makes the Cultural Bridges Program unique is that it enables \nhigh school students from other lands to obtain firsthand knowledge of \nour country, our way of life, and our people. Our Government sponsors \nmany exchange programs for professionals, educators, journalists and \nacademics, but, until now, there has been no Federal program to bring \nhigh school students from the Islamic world to the United States.\n  After September 11, many Muslim countries condemned the terrorist \nattacks and pledged to help the United States fight terrorism. But in \nthe wake of the war in Iraq, anti-American sentiment is on the rise \nagain.\n  A June 2003 poll by the Pew Charitable Trust found strong public \nsupport for Osama bin Laden's views in Arab countries whose governments \nare friendly to the United States. According to the poll, 55 percent of \nthose in Jordan, 58 percent of those in Indonesia, 45 percent of those \nin Pakistan, and 49 percent of those in Morocco said they had \nconfidence in Osama bin Laden to ``do the right thing regarding world \naffairs,'' and so did 71 percent of those in the areas controlled by \nthe Palestinian Authority.\n  Our military action in Iraq has led to widespread fears throughout \nthe region that we will launch other aggressive action. Majorities of \nthose interviewed in Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, Lebanon, and \nJordan worried that their country might be attacked by the United \nStates. Even in Kuwait--where the public has a generally favorable view \nof the United States--53 percent expressed concern that the United \nStates could someday pose a threat.\n  Especially disturbing is the finding of little support in the Islamic \nworld for the war against terrorism--23 percent in Indonesia, 16 \npercent in Pakistan, 22 percent in Turkey, and 2 percent in Jordan and \nthe Palestinian Authority. In Morocco, only one in 10 back the effort, \nwhile in Lebanon, 30 percent support the war. Only in Kuwait and \nNigeria do majorities of the population now support the war against \nterrorism.\n  Clearly, we need to redouble our efforts to win the hearts and minds \nof peoples in the Arab and Muslim world, and change their negative \nperceptions about our country and values.\n  There are no better ambassadors for America than Americans \nthemselves, and this new high school exchange program is an important \nway to begin reaching out more effectively to the next generation of \nleaders in that world.\n  Jordan's King Abdullah is an excellent example of what can be \nachieved. He is a friend of the United States, a partner in the war \nagainst terrorism, and a voice of tolerance and moderation in the \nMuslim world.\n  In 1977, as a young Jordanian, he enrolled in a high school in \nMassachusetts and later came to Washington to study at a university. He \nis living proof of the value of building bridges of understanding and \ntolerance with other cultures.\n  We need to create as many opportunities as possible for young people \nthroughout the Islamic world to spend time in the United States and \nwith our citizens, and we should begin to do so now. I have been \ndelighted to work with Senators Lugar, Leahy, Chafee, Dodd, Hagel, \nSmith, Cochran, Brownback, Jeffords, Durbin, and Feingold on the \nCultural Bridges Program, and I am hopeful that it marks a new \nbeginning in our efforts to build forward lasting relationships with \nthe future leaders in the Muslim world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10259-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10259-S10260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FY 2004 ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                        silvery minnow provision\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending my friend \nand colleague from New Mexico and the Chairman of both the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, and the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee, for addressing a difficult situation on the Rio Grande \nRiver.\n  The provision at issue is Section 205 of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill and I would like to take this opportunity to engage \nSenator Domenici on that legislative language as part of the Senate's \nconsideration of the bill.\n  We worked on Section 205 together, and it concerns water use in the \nMiddle Rio Grande and compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA). \nMore specifically, Section 205 addresses the June 12, 2003 decision of \nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Rio Grande Silvery \nMinnow v. Keys, and does the following:\n  Recognizing that importing San Juan-Chama project water from the San \nJuan River basin to the Rio Grande basin does not jeopardize endangered \nspecies in the Middle Rio Grande, Section 205(a) clarifies that the \nBureau of Reclamation may not use discretion, if any, to unilaterally \nreduce or reallocate water to be delivered under San Juan-Chama project \ncontracts for endangered species purposes in the Rio Grande River \nBasin.\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\n  Section 205(b) also expressly recognizes that compliance with the \nMarch 17, 2003 biological opinion concerning water operations in the \nMiddle Rio Grande, as well as activities being conducted pursuant to \nP.L. 106-377, P.L. 107-66, and P.L. 108-7, constitute compliance with \nall ESA requirements as related to those actions, both federal and non-\nfederal, that are incorporated as the proposed action in the biological \nopinion. Notwithstanding Section 205, the Secretary is to continue \npursuing recovery of listed species in the Middle Rio Grande, including \nsupport for the Middle Rio Grande ESA collaborative program.\n  I believe we are in agreement on the effect of Section 205. Moreover, \nI think the legislation is an appropriate response to the Tenth \nCircuit's decision and strikes a proper balance by providing certainty \nfor all water users in the Middle Rio Grande basin while still \nmaintaining the policy that all water users have a shared interest and \nresponsibility to comply with the requirements of the ESA. Given the \nbenefits of this approach I would ask my colleague, as Chairman of \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, to maintain this approach \nin the conference with the House of Representatives and to include this \ninterpretive language as part of the conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate that my colleague and fellow New Mexican \nworked with me to help alleviate the current situation with the silvery \nminnow. I concur with his understanding of the language which is \ndesigned to narrowly address the silvery minnow situation in the Rio \nGrande. It is intended to prohibit the use of San Juan-Chama water in \nthe Rio Grande for endangered species purposes and to implement the \nMarch 17, 2003 Biological Opinion. I also concur with his view of the \nbenefits of Section 205 in general, and will strongly advocate for its \nretention in conference, as well as inclusion of this interpretive \nlanguage in the conference report.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration and explanation of this important matter. I believe that \nthis language offers hope for the minnow and protection for the people \nof New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10260-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MAKAN DELRAHIM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nexpress in public my thanks and appreciation to the Judiciary \nCommittee's Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Makan Delrahim. Makan's \ndeparture is a tremendous loss for the Senate and for me personally. \nBut, we are fortunate that he will continue to serve our country in his \nnew position in the Bush administration as Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.\n  Makan is, in my opinion, a fine example of a great American success \nstory. Makan's family fled from Iran when he was eight years old, and \nhe quickly learned English and immersed himself in American life.\n  After learning business fundamentals at his father's gas station, \nMakan unleashed his newfound American entrepreneurial spirit and \npursued several successful business enterprises before receiving a \nbachelor of science in physiology from UCLA. Later, he earned a law \ndegree from George Washington University and also a Master of Science \nin biotechnology from Johns Hopkins. On top of it all, he became a \nregistered patent attorney.\n  Clearly, his wide range of abilities and interests explain in part \nwhy he has served the Judiciary Committee and the Congress so \nexceptionally well. He is a brilliant thinker with the rare ability to \nquickly grasp a wide variety of complex issues.\n  It was a stroke of good fortune for me when, back in 1995, Makan \njoined my Judiciary Committee health staff for a term as an intern. As \nan intern, Makan distinguished himself as an exceptional talent, and \nafter spending a few years practicing law at the Patton, Boggs, I \nconvinced him to come back to the Judiciary staff as counsel handling \ne-commerce, antitrust and emerging technologies policy. I was once \nagain so impressed with his dedication and ability that in 2001, I \nasked Makan to serve as Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  As Chief Counsel, Makan has been my right hand, providing valuable \ncounsel on all matters that come before the Committee. I am \nparticularly proud of his leadership in the development and passage of \nHart Scott Rodino reform, the TEACH Act, the PATRIOT Act and the \nPROTECT Act, to name just a few. He has proved himself to be a skillful \nnegotiator with the ability to bring parties together on divisive \nissues. It is no wonder that Makan is widely respected on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Makan has worked tirelessly and capably, and I am afraid that his \noffice in the Dirksen Building has become his virtual home as he has \nworked late into the night and many weekends over these past years. If \nhe had stayed in private law practice and worked these hours, he would \nprobably be a billionaire by now.\n  As Staff Director, Makan has demonstrated the extraordinary ability \nto find the greatest strengths in each staff member and to foster those \nstrengths. And I am especially proud of Makan for helping me recruit a \nbrilliant and impeccably qualified staff, and in doing so, bringing an \nunprecedented level of diversity to the Committee.\n  We will miss Makan's charismatic style and his ready sense of humor. \nAnd, we will miss his extraordinary ability to multitask.

Mr. President, today I rise in honor of Monica \nConter Benning and Bernard Floyd Benning, Barney, on the celebration of \ntheir 61st wedding anniversary on August 20, 2003. Monica and Barney \nare the only surviving couple of the Pearl Harbor attack who both were \nin the immediate Pearl Harbor area at the time of the bombing. As the \ncourtship between these two officers evolved in the setting of World \nWar II, their experiences during the attack on America, December 7, \n1941, are an important part of American history.\n  Barney, a college ROTC 2nd Lt. from Niles, MI, was ordered to active \nduty to Hawaii in May 1941. Barney joined an anti-aircraft battery in \nFort Kamehameha at the entrance of the Pearl Harbor channel.\n  Army nurse 2nd Lt. Monica Conter of Apalachicola, FL served at Walter \nReed General Hospital in 1940-1941, and was the official model for the \nArmy Nurse Corps Recruiting Program. Monica was later assigned to the \nnew Hickam Field Hospital, adjacent to Pearl Harbor and separate by a \nlone chain link fence. Monica is the only nurse still living today who \nwas on duty at Hickam Field Hospital at the time of the attack. During \nthe attack on December 7th, a bomb fell on the hospital lawn about 60 \nfeet from the building, leaving a large crater. A banyon tree sapling \nwas planted in the crater several days after the attack. Today, beside \nthe huge tree is a granite monument and plaque, honoring Monica's \nservice as an Army nurse on duty that fateful day.\n  Monica and Barney Benning first met on a prearranged ``blind date'' \nin September 1941; the beginning of a lifetime together. Their \ncourtship continued with regularity until that ``Day of Infamy,'' \nDecember 7, 1941--the first terrorist attack on America. The following \nWednesday, when Barney appeared at Hickam Hospital in a dirty, wrinkled \nuniform, it was quite an emotional moment when they found each other \nalive.\n  ``Off Duty'' time was infrequent and often they were miles apart and \nusually on some kind of alert status until the American victory at the \nBattle of Midway in May.\n  They wed on August 20, 1942, in the temporarily camouflaged Hickam \nField Chapel; the original chapel was destroyed on December 7.\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\n  On August 20, 2003, they will celebrate their 61st wedding \nanniversary. I congratulate and praise this couple, members of our \nGreatest Generation, for serving America to protect our precious \ndemocracy. I applaud your bravery and dedication to preserving freedom \nfor all Americans.\n  Monica and Barney currently reside in Fort Myers, FL. They have two \nsons, Phil Benning and Gregory Benning and a daughter, Veronica \nBenning, as well as two grandchildren, Melanie and Lauren \nBenning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10261-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, Vail Blackwell Horton is a self-\ndescribed ``man with a vision on a mission.'' Vail was born 25 years \nago without legs and has since dedicated himself to enabling people \nwith disabilities to become active members of their communities.\n  As the founder and CEO of Ken Mobility, Vail and his team of \noutstanding employees are developing new technologies and services to \nempower people with disabilities. Innovative assistive devices like the \n``Keen Krutch'' and ``Sure Foot Forearm'' are engineered to \nsignificantly reduce the onset of painful conditions and ailments like \nosteoarthritis. Vail's products have helped improve the quality of life \nfor many with disabilities. One client raved: ``I can't find the words \nto tell you what your invention has done for my life . . . I am not as \nembarrassed to walk with my crutch because I think it is a real looker. \nIt has given me a badly needed boost to keep on fighting the fight to \nlive and walk in this world.''\n  In addition to Keen Mobility, Vail founded Incight, a nonprofit \norganization that focuses on employment and education issues for people \nwith disabilities. Appearing frequently as a motivational speaker, Vail \naims to ``educate and encourage individuals to acknowledge their \nhandicap, but not let it dictate their life.''\n  Vail's tireless spirit serves as an inspiration to us all. Today, I \nam proud to honor Vail Blackwell Horton as a Health Care Hero for the \ngreat State of Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10261-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WINCHESTER CELEBRATES ITS 250TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Winchester, \nNew Hampshire. This great American community is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding, and I am proud to recognize this historic \nevent.\n  Over 4,000 people call themselves citizens of Winchester. From the \ntown's incorporation in 1753 through today, they have had an enormous \nimpact on the economic and cultural development of not only New \nHampshire but our country as well. Winchester has long been a center \nfor commerce and manufacturing. Companies like the Ashuelot \nManufacturing Corporation, Thayer & Turner's Woolen Mill and Robertson \nBrothers's Paper Mill were early leaders in powering the expansion of \nthe United States. The A.C. Lawrence Leather Company is another notable \nexample of this proud heritage. It made thousands of boots and shoes \nwhich our troops needed during World War II. I know there are many \nresidents still living in town who used to work at AC Lawrence at this \ntime and I want to thank them for the vital contributions they made to \nsupporting our troops during that conflict.\n  The town's people have made significant contributions to the security \nof our country in many other ways. Colonel Samuel Ashley commanded a \nregiment of soldiers in the American Revolution. Major General Leonard \nWood, another Winchester native, became Chief of Staff for the Army \njust prior to the start of World War I. He was one of the first men to \nsee the war in Europe as a challenge to the American military \nestablishment. In response, he led a crusade for a larger and better \nprepared armed force. This effort involved an intensive speaking tour \nthroughout the United States and the launching of summer training camps \nfor college students in Pennsylvania, Vermont, North Carolina and \nMichigan. One can certainly conclude that our victory in World War I \nwas possible in large part because of General Wood's vision.\n  This town has also played an important role in the political history \nof New Hampshire. Francis Parnell Murphy, elected Governor of the State \nin 1937, was born here. Today, Tom Magee, Gus Ruth, Bill Kelly, Ken \nBerthiaume and Brian Moser, the current members of the Board of \nSelectmen, are carrying on this tradition of public service.\n  These people, and so many others, highlight the rich history for \nwhich the people of Winchester can justifiably be proud. As they \ncelebrate the Town's 250th birthday, I am honored to salute this great \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10261-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ONE SMALL SLICE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on June 10, 1903, 26-year-old \nGiovanni Castellano married 21-year-old Santa Basile in Milazzo, Italy. \nLess than 2 months later, on July 24, the newlyweds boarded the S.S. \nLahn steamship headed for the United States of America. On August 5, \n1903, Giovanni and Santa Castellano set foot on American soil at Ellis \nIsland, starting a new chapter in the American dream.\n  The story of the Castellano family in many ways reflects the typical \nAmerican immigrant experience. Giovanni and Santa settled in New York \nCity and presided over the development of a large family. The first \ngeneration born in America included Joseph, Jenny, Vincent, Florence, \nFaye, Steve, and Anthony. The members of this generation in turn had \nfamilies of their own, and so on. As the new century gets underway, the \nfourth generation of American Castellanos begins grade school.\n  The first generation of the Castellano family tended to marry other \nItalian Americans, the likes of Carizzo, Cambria, and Fidele. \nReflecting U.S. immigration patterns, there was the occasional \nMcElligot. Over time, the genealogy of the Castellano family came to \nreflect the diversity of America. Ullmann, Cinotti, Burk, Garcia, \nAnchustegui, and Pray are just some of the names that may be found on \nthe family tree now.\n  Many members of the Castellano family have stayed in New York but \nothers have moved throughout the United States. One hundred years of \nhistory have brought the Castellano family literally from sea to \nshining sea--from New York, Maryland and Washington, DC, to Colorado, \nNew Mexico, and California.\n  While many in the first generation of the Castellano family received \nonly a grade school education, succeeding generations have graduated \nfrom community colleges, State universities, private colleges, and the \nIvy League. The Castellano family has spawned teachers, stockbrokers, \ndelivery drivers, restaurateurs, soldiers, lawyers, doctors, dentists, \nbricklayers, and other professions; some have worked in business, some \nhave worked in public service. They have served their country in both \npeace and in World War II, Vietnam, and Somalia.\n  Next week is the 100th anniversary of Giovanni and Santa's entry into \nthe United States through Ellis Island--the beginning of the American \ndream for one family. Congratulations to the Castellano family; may the \ndream go on for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10261-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10261-S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION FOR NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER WEEK 2003\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I recognize the National Health \nCenter Week that will be celebrated from August 10 to 16, 2003. Health \ncenters provide services to over 10 million people living in \nunderserved areas through the United States, with about 50 percent of \nthe users being from rural areas such as South Dakota.\n  Community health centers have a longstanding history of providing \nquality primary health care services to medically underserved \npopulations. Providing care to one of every 12 rural Americans and \ntending to needs of the increasing number of uninsured individuals, \nhealth centers provide medical attention to those who would otherwise \nlack access to health care. A unique aspect of community health centers \nallows them to individualize their center to meet the specific needs of \na particular community. By partnering with community organizations, \nschools and businesses, health centers are able to best meet the health \ncare needs of individuals in each respective community.\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\n  I want to pay special recognition to the Community HealthCare \nAssociation in South Dakota, and all of the staff at the association \nfor the fine work they do on behalf of South Dakota. Furthermore, I \nwant to commend all of the dedicated health care professionals in the \nhealth centers throughout South Dakota who work day in and day out \ndevoting their lives to delivering critical health care to those most \nin need.\n  At this time, there are 25 community health centers serving \nindividuals across my State and I am working with my colleagues in \nCongress and the administration to greatly increase the number of these \ncenters nationwide. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nI am pleased to have recently voted in committee to increase funding by \n$122 million over last year's funding, for a total of $1.62 billion for \nthe Nation's community health centers next year. I will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to see that we are able to double funding for \nthese medical centers by 2006.\n  Once again, it gives me great pleasure to recognize the National \nHealth Care Center Week on behalf of the South Dakota Community \nHealthCare Association and the many thousands of South Dakotans who may \ncontinue to benefit through this important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10262-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO COLONEL CHARLES J. FIALA, JR., COMMANDER, BALTIMORE ENGINEER \n                 DISTRICT, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to \nColonel Charles Fiala, Commander and District Engineer of the Baltimore \nDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. COL Fiala is retiring after a \ndistinguished 25-year career in the U.S. Army, and I would like to take \nthis opportunity to congratulate him and commend him for his many years \nof service to our Nation.\n  Chuck Fiala graduated from West Point in 1978 and has served in \nnumerous staff and command positions here in the United States and \nabroad. Beginning as combat engineer platoon leader with the 194th \nArmored Brigade in Fort Knox, KY he quickly rose through the ranks. \nAmong other assignments he commanded C Company, 11th Engineer Battalion \nat Fort Belvoir; served as Executive Officer in U.S. Army Headquarters \nEurope in Heidelberg, Germany; and worked in the Pentagon for the \nOffice of the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff. During the \ncourse of his career, Chuck earned a master's degree in civil \nengineering from Purdue University and was also awarded a master's \ndegree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the National War \nCollege.\n  I came to know COL Fiala 3 years ago when he was first selected as \nCommander and District Engineer of the Baltimore District, U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers, and have had the privilege of working closely with \nhim on a number of water resource, environmental restoration, and \nmilitary construction initiatives in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic \nregion. Chuck has continued the tradition of outstanding leadership \nthat has been the hallmark of the Baltimore District. Under his \nleadership, numerous military construction and civil works projects \nwere initiated or completed including the Baltimore Harbor Anchorages \nProject, the straightening of the Tolchester Channel ``S'' Turn, the \nimprovements to the Brewerton Channel and the construction of military \nhousing at Fort Meade, to name only a few. Similarly, he directed and \noversaw several critical environmental restoration projects including \nthe cleanup of Fort Detrick's chemical and biological waste landfill, \nthe restoration of the north end of Assateague Island National \nSeashore, the Chesapeake Bay oyster recovery effort, and 10 habitat \nrestoration sites in the Anacostia River.\n  During his 25-year career in the Army, COL Fiala repeatedly \ndemonstrated exceptional abilities and dedication that have earned him \nrecognition and acclaim by his peers. He has been the recipient of many \nawards and decorations including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious \nService Medal, the Army Commendation medal, and the Parachute Badge. \nHis work ethic and principles of responsibility, reliability, and \ndedication will continue to serve as a standard for others who follow \nhim as District Engineer.\n  It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most \nhonorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens and country. Throughout his career Chuck Fiala has exemplified \na steadfast commitment to meeting this demand.\n  I want to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his hard \nwork and dedication and wish him and his family the best of luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10262-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MONT VERNON CELEBRATES 227TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr, President, I rise today in honor of Mont \nVernon, NH. This year, while the United States observed the 227th \nanniversary of our independence, the citizens of Mont Vernon have been \nplanning the celebration of the town's 200th birthday. It is therefore \ntimely and appropriate that we recognize this quintessential American \ncommunity.\n  From its first settlement in the early 1700s through today, Mont \nVernon has represented all that is great about the United States. \nAlthough it may not share the industrial or commercial legacy of its \nsister cities of Nashua or Manchester, the town's impact on our country \nhas been just as vital. This impact is best symbolized by the \nsacrifices the residents here have made in times of conflict. Fifty men \nfrom what was to become Mont Vernon served in the War of Independence; \nfive of them lost their lives. During the Civil War, 35 men enlisted in \nthe Union Army and, tragically, seven of them died. The whole community \ndemonstrated their support for these soldiers and for the cause for \nwhich they were fighting by voting at a special town meeting to provide \nwages and outfits for those men who volunteered to serve.\n  The town's dedication to protecting the ideals of this country was \nalso clear during both World War I and World War II. In the First World \nWar, nine residents fought in that conflict. In the Second World War, \ntwenty-three of them served including Mildred Coggin, Eleanor Carlton \nand Mary Holt Smith. These three women were nurses whose care of \ninjured soldiers was critical to the war effort.\n  Of course, Mont Vernon continues to stand for those qualities which \nmake New Hampshire such a special place to live: a dedication to public \nservice and the spirit of volunteerism. The town's representatives to \nthe New Hampshire General Court, Timothy Allen, Pam Coughlin and \nMargaret Hallyburton, are continuing in the path of the town's first \nelected official to that body, Major William Bradford. The members of \nthe current Board of Selectmen, Mike Fimbel, John Koch and Peter Savage \nare honorably serving in the tradition the first Board of Selectmen, \nwhose members included John Carlton, Joseph Langdell and Jacob Kendall, \nset in 1804.\n  So, on this the 200th anniversary of Mont Vernon, we salute its \ncitizens and honor their accomplishments, their love of country and \ntheir overwhelming spirit of independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10262-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10262-4", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10262-5", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10262-S10263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 1490.

A bill to eliminate the Federal quota and price support \nprograms for tobacco, to provide assistance to quota holders, tobacco \nproducers, and tobacco-dependent communities, and for other purposes, \nread the first time.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the introduction of the Tobacco Market \nTransition Act is an important milestone for tens of thousands of \nfarmers. I am proud to have been part of the bipartisan working group \nthat crafted this bill.\n  For decades, thousands of farmers in my state have depended on their \ntobacco quotas. They made significant investments in equipment and \nland. They paid into the no-net cost assessment program knowing that \nthe quota system they were locked into would provide for them. They \ndidn't get rich--most of the farmers in my State will tell you that \ntheir tobacco profits allowed them to send their children to college or \njust pay the bills.\n  But that financial security has been eroded. The Federal quota is at \nan all-time low. In fact, just in the past five years tobacco farmers \nhave seen their quotas cut in half. That same time has been \nparticularly difficult for my farmers, who have had to adjust to the \ndwindling quota while losing their crops and in some cases their entire \nfarms to three hurricanes, a massive ice storm and a severe drought.\n  It is time to end the Federal quota system. It is time to give these \nhard working men and women a chance to transition to other crops or to \nretire with dignity. And for those who want to continue to grow \ntobacco, we must end the antiquated quota system and give them a chance \nto compete with foreign producers just as if they were growing any \nother crop like corn or sweet potatoes.\n  Of course, this isn't just another crop. This is tobacco and the \ntobacco leaf is used to make addictive, deadly products. We must \naddress that fact. I am certain that before the year is out, the Senate \nHealth, Education and Labor Committee, of which I am a member, will \nconsider relevant legislation to protect public health. I welcome that \ncommittee's efforts. But in the debate surrounding the tobacco \nindustry, we cannot lose sight of the fact that thousands of honest, \nhard working people depend on the leaf for their economic livelihood.\n  People like Blythe and Gwendolyn Casey of Kinston, NC. Mr. and Ms. \nCasey began farming tobacco decades ago. They made a decent living \ndoing what they loved. As the years passed, they increased their \nproduction and made substantial investments in equipment and regulation \nbarns. They paid into the no-net cost assessment program and played by \nthe rules. They never got rich, but they were confident their \ninvestments would allow them to one day retire and remain on their \nfarm.\n  Through no fault of their own, they've watched the value of their \nquota essentially disappear. When they began farming, they never \nthought they would reach retirement age mired in debt. The Caseys, and \nthousands of tobacco farming families in eastern North Carolina face a \nbleak financial future unless Congress acts.\n  The Federal quota system has reached a crisis point and we must \nintervene. The Tobacco Market Transition Act is our best chance to \nstave off economic disaster for tens of thousands of farmers.\n  This bill represents a compromise literally years in the making. This \nbill is not perfect. But this bill could be the last hope for farmers.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Tobacco \nMarket Transition Act of 2003, which is a vital piece of legislation to \nfarmers in Tennessee and other tobacco producing States. As our \ncitizens and government respond to the dangers of cigarettes and \ntobacco, farmers and farm communities that have depended on this crop \nare contending with challenges greater than just the decrease in\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\ndemand. Tobacco growing quotas, the leasing of those quotas, and the \nFederal price support system have combined with decreasing demand to \nform the ``perfect storm'' to afflict tobacco farmers.\n  I grew up in east Tennessee, and small family tobacco farms were a \npart of the lifestyle and economic vitality in our region. Tobacco \nfarmers are currently suffering because of government programs and \ndeclining demand for their crops. The number of tobacco farmers in \nTennessee has decreased from more than 35,000 farms in 1980 to fewer \nthan 15,000 today. Revenue from tobacco in Tennessee has declined by \n$25 million over the same period.\n  This bill will provide a short term bridge to tobacco growers and \nquota holders, and the communities in which they live. Tennesseans who \nown quotas will receive a fair transition away from lease income they \nhave received. Growers will receive transition payments as well. The \nbuyout would last over six years and mean roughly $2 billion to the \nfamily farmers, quota lease owners, and communities in Tennessee.\n  Tobacco farming will continue to be faced with challenges, but \nsuccessful passage of this legislation will provide a safety net to \nfarmers and their communities. I applaud the work of Senator McConnell \non this important legislation and will work with him and our other \ncosponsors to provide the transition our tobacco farming communities \ndesperately need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1491. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nworkplace health incentives by equalizing the tax consequences of \nemployee athletic facility use; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the past few months, the Medicare \ndebate has focused our attention on a range of issues related to the \nfuture of health care in America. Central to our debate has been how to \npay for the dramatically rising costs of health care and whether we can \nafford a prescription drug benefit to treat the disease of an aging \npopulation.\n  The Medicare and Medicaid programs currently spend $84 billion \nannually on five major chronic diseases, diabetes, heart disease, \ndepression, cancer and arthritis. We have discussed options for paying \nfor the treatment of these diseases, but have spent far less time \nexploring ways to prevent them in the first place.\n  I believe that disease prevention and the promotion of healthier \nlifestyles offers us an excellent opportunity to begin reversing the \nsteep rise in health care costs we are facing today. Public health \nexperts unanimously agree that people who maintain active healthy \nlifestyles dramatically reduce their risk of contracting chronic \ndiseases. A physically fit population results in a decrease in health \ncare costs, reduced government spending, fewer illnesses and improved \nworker productivity.\n  Given the tremendous benefits exercise provides, I believe we have a \nduty to create as many incentives as possible to get Americans off the \ncoach and up and moving. With this in mind, I have introduced the \nWorkforce Health Improvement Program, WHIP Act. The WHIP Act mirrors \nsimilar legislation introduced by Rep. Pat Toomey, R-PA, in the House \nof Representatives and would allow for the favorable tax treatment of \nhealth club memberships as an employee benefit.\n  Specifically, it would clarify an employer's right to deduct the cost \nof subsidizing or providing health club benefits for their employees. \nIn addition, this legislation would exclude the wellness benefit from \nbeing considered income for the employees, i.e., employer contributions \nto the cost of health club fees would not be taxable income for \nemployees.\n  Current law already permits businesses to deduct the cost of on-site \nworkout facilities, which are provided for the benefit of employees on \na pre-tax basis. However, if a business wants, or needs, to outsource \nthese health benefits, they and/or their employees are required to bear \nthe full cost.\n  The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the current tax code to \nthe benefit of many smaller businesses and their employees. It also \nwould be an important step in reversing the devastating health trend \nthat our country is facing by promoting physical activity, reducing \nobesity and preventing disease.\n  According to the Surgeon General's ``Call to Action to Prevent \ndisease Overweight and Obesity,'' published in 2001, there are 300,000 \ndeaths a year in the United States that are associated with overweight \nand obesity. Repair physical activity reduces the risk of developing or \ndying from some of the leading causes of illness and death in the \nUnited States.\n  Further, physical activity can: reduce the risk of dying prematurely; \nreduce the risk of dying prematurely of heart disease; reduce the risk \nof developing diabetes; reduce the risk of developing high blood \npressure; help reduce blood pressure in people who already have high \nblood pressure; reduce the risk of developing colon and other types of \ncancer; reduce feelings of depression and anxiety; help control weight; \nhelp build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints; help older \nadults become stronger and better able to move about without falling; \npromote psychological well-being.\n  Public Health experts unanimously agree that active lifestyles result \nin decreased health care costs, reduced governmental spending, fewer \nillnesses, and improved worker productivity.\n  I ask you to join me in supporting this preventive health and fitness \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 1492. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Labor Management \nRelations Act, 1947 to provide special rules for Teamster plans \nrelating to termination and funding; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Multi-\nemployer Pension Security Act of 2003. This bill will strengthen and \nprotect the defined pension benefits of thousands of workers. These \nworkers have no other choice than to participate in the pension fund \nthat their employer offers. However, it is not just the employees who \nneed these plans to be reformed, but many employers realize that to be \nfiducially responsible that these reforms need to be made as well.\n  Nearly 44 million working Americans participate in defined benefit \npension plans. Of that amount, almost ten million people, approximately \n25 percent of all those who have defined pensions, participate in \nmulti-employer plans. Single-employer plans are completely managed \nunder a different system. Although recent policy debate has focused \nprimarily on single-employer plans, my reasoning in introducing this \nlegislation today is to broaden the pension plan debate by dealing with \nthe myriad of problems facing multi-employer pension plans.\n  This bill, the ``Multi-employer Pension Security Act,'' will provide \nmillions of active and retired workers who participate in these plans \nwith the long-term security of knowing their promised benefits will be \nfunded and safeguarded. This reform legislation is necessary and long \noverdue.\n  The funding levels in single-employer pension plans have been greatly \naffected by stock market losses, a sluggish economy and record-low \ninterest rates. These events have impacted multi-employer plans also. \nHowever, the issues affecting multi-employer plans are much broader \nthan that. These plans operate under a fundamentally different \nstructure. The main difference between single and multi-employer plans \nis that there is no minimum funding level required in multi-employer \nplans. Losses can mount until simply there is no more money and \nbenefits cannot be paid to the participants in multi-employer pension \nplans. My bill will correct his deficiency in current law.\n  This proposed legislation would address the lack of adequate funding \nstandards existing within the multi-employer pension plan system. Also \nhardworking employees who participate in these multi-employer pension \nfunds do not currently have the guarantee of insurance. When a multi-\nemployer pension plan is defunct or goes bankrupt, there is no Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to rely on--because multi-employer \nplans do not fall under the guise of the PBGC structure. My bill will \naddress that and give the folks participating in a multi-employer plan \nthe same governmental oversight as provided to participants of single-\nemployer plans.\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\n  Again, I introduce the Multi-employer Pension Security Act today \nbecause we, as a nation, must tackle these issues now to prevent \nfurther deterioration of these plans and we must be willing to assure \nour constituents that their promised pensions are available to them as \nretirees currently and in the future. Single-employer plans must not be \nthe only pension plan that Congress considers changes to because we are \nalso responsible to the almost ten million Americans participating in \nmulti-employer pension plans as well. I urge my colleagues to consider \nthis legislation. We must engage in a discussion that will lead to \npositive changes in multi-employer pension plans now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 1493. A bill to promote freedom, fairness, and economic \nopportunity by repealing the income tax and other taxes, abolishing the \nInternal Revenue Service, and enacting a national sales tax to be \nadministered primarily by the States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Tax \nAct of 2003. This bill will promote freedom, fairness, and economic \nopportunity by repealing the income tax and other taxes, abolishing the \nInternal Revenue Service, and enacting a national sales tax.\n  The Fair Tax, commonly referred to as a national sales tax, is a \nnecessary piece of tax reform that, should it pass, upon its inception \nwould uproot our current unjust progressive tax code and replace it \nwith a simpler, fairer one.\n  I believe our antiquated tax code, that was implemented in 1913, and \nhas since been modified numerous times, is overly complicated and \ndesperately in need of an overhaul. We are well beyond rectifying the \nunfairness in our current system by tinkering around the edges. All \nAmericans are in dire need of unbiased sweeping tax reform--and the \nfair tax is just that.\n  The Fair Tax Act of 2003 would repeal the individual income tax, the \ncorporate tax, capital gains taxes, all payroll taxes, the self-\nemployment tax and the estate and gift taxes in lieu of a 23 percent \ntax on the final sale of all goods and services. The eradication of \nthese taxes will not only bring about equality within our tax system, \nit will also bring about simplicity.\n  This bill will also provide for tax relief for business-to-business \ntransactions. These transactions, including used product transactions \nwhich have already been taxed, are not subject to the sales tax, \nthereby abrogating any double taxation.\n  Social Security and Medicare benefits would remain untouched under \nthe Fair Tax bill. There would be no financial reductions to either one \nof these vital programs. Instead, the source of the trust fund revenue \nfor these two programs would be replaced simply by a sales tax revenue \ninstead of a payroll tax revenue.\n  And lastly, under this bill, every American would receive a monthly \nrebate check equal to spending up to the Federal poverty level \naccording to the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. \nThis rebate would ensure that no American pays taxes on the purchase of \nnecessities.\n  The Fair Tax creates a fairer, simpler code that allows every \nAmerican the freedom to determine his or her own priorities and \nopportunities.\n  Ronald Reagan once said, ``I believe we really can, however, say that \nGod did give mankind virtually unlimited gifts to invent, produce and \ncreate. And for that reason alone, it would be wrong for governments to \ndevise a tax structure or economic system that suppresses and denies \nthose gifts.''\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  And as long as we continue to operate under our current skewed tax \ncode, we will continue to suppress and deny these unlimited gifts to \nthe American people who would otherwise thrive boundlessly under the \nFair Tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1494. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe special 5-year carryback of certain net operating losses to losses \nfor 2003, 2004, and 2005; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today, Senator Conrad and I are \nintroducing legislation that would greatly benefit out domestic \neconomy. Our legislation would increase the cash flow of many \nstruggling American companies, thus helping them hire and retain \nworkers and fund capital investments.\n  The legislation involves the ``net operating loss'' (``NOL'') rules \nunder the Internal Revenue Code. The NOL carryback and carryover rules \nare designed to allow taxpayers to smooth out swings in business income \nthat result from business cycle fluctuations and unexpected financial \nlosses.\n  Last year's economic stimulus bill, the ``Job Creation and Worker \nAssistance Act of 2002,'' allowed NOLs arising in 2001 and 2002 to be \ncarried back five years, rather than two years, as otherwise would be \nprovided under the tax law. The 2002 Act also removed a limitation that \nthe corporate alternative minimum tax (``AMT'') unfairly places on \nthese carrybacks. The 2002 Act thus gave taxpayers in many sectors of \nthe economy an enhanced ability to increase their cash flow through \nrefunds of income taxes paid in prior years.\n  Unfortunately, the same uncertain economic conditions that led to the \nenactment of last year's stimulus bill have continued. Many taxpayers \nare continuing to incur unexpected financial losses in 2003.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today would simply extend the \n2002 Act's NOL carryback rules to cover NOLs arising in 2003 and to \nNOLs that may arise in 2004 and 2005.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which \nwould give much needed relief to U.S. employers and would provide an \nadditional jump start to our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1495. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe consolidation of life insurance companies with other companies; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague, Senator Conrad, which will allow affiliated life and \nnon-life insurance companies to file consolidated tax returns. The \nrules currently on the books do not allow such consolidation, for \nreasons that are outdated and no longer applicable.\n  In general, consolidated return provisions under current law were \nenacted so that the members of an affiliated group of corporations \ncould file a single tax return. The right to file a ``consolidated'' \nreturn is generally available irrespective of the nature or variety of \nthe businesses conducted by the affiliated corporations. The purpose \nbehind consolidated returns is simply to tax a complete business entity \nrather than its component parts individually. Whether an enterprise's \nbusinesses are operated as divisions within one corporation or as \nsubsidiary corporations with a common parent company, a business entity \nshould generally be taxed as a single entity and be allowed to file its \nreturn accordingly.\n  Corporate groups that include life insurance companies, however, are \ndenied the ability to file a single consolidated return until they have \nbeen affiliated for a least five years. Even after this five year \nperiod, they are subject to two additional limitations that do not \napply to any other type of group: first, non-life insurance companies \nmust be members of the affiliated group for five years before their \nlosses may be used to offset life insurance company income, and second, \nnon-life insurance affiliated losses, including current year losses and \nany carryover losses, that may offset life insurance company taxable \nincome are limited to the lesser of 35 percent of life insurance \ncompany's taxable income or 35 percent of the non-life insurance \ncompany's losses.\n  There are no sound reasons to deny affiliated groups that include \nlife insurance companies the same unrestricted ability to file \nconsolidated returns that is available to other financial \nintermediaries, and corporations in general. Allowing the members of an \naffiliated group of corporations to file a consolidated return prevents \nthe business enterprise's structure from obscuring the fact that the \ntrue gain or loss of the business enterprise is the aggregate of each \nof the members of the affiliated group. The limitations contained in \npresent law are so clearly without policy justification that they \nshould be repealed.\n  Our legislation will repeal the two five-year limitations for taxable \nyears\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\nbeginning after this year, and it will phase out the 35 percent \nlimitation over seven years. The staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation has recommended repeal of two of the three limitations \naddressed by my bill--on the grounds of needless complexity. The third \nlimitation is, in effect, merely a minimum tax on life insurance \ncompany income. That limitation should have been repealed when the \nalternative minimum tax was enacted, and certainly has no place in the \ntax laws today.\n  We hope our colleagues will join us as cosponsors of this bipartisan, \nmuch-needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, and \n        Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1496. A bill to provide for the expansion and coordination of \nactivities of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention with respect to research and programs on \ncancer survivorship, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a \ngreat Texan and a great American, Lance Armstrong. Last weekend, Lance \nsailed to his fifth consecutive victory in the Tour de France. On the \nheels of his stunning victory, I am pleased to introduce the Cancer \nSurvivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2003.\n  To some, Lance's victories might begin to seem routine, winning year \nafter year after year. But when you dig beneath the surface, past the \nhype and drama of the Tour de France, you find that there's nothing \nroutine about Lance Armstrong.\n  By now, nearly everyone knows that Lance is a cancer survivor. It has \nbecome common knowledge, not because Lance uses it as an excuse or to \nseek sympathy. We know it because Lance has used his megaphone as a \nsports hero to raise awareness of cancer research and survivorship. He \nhas dedicated himself to helping others and turning his personal \ndevastation into a legacy of hope for those afflicted with cancer. When \nhe was diagnosed, he was given a 40 percent chance of living. His \nsurvival and amazing comeback have proved that cancer is not a death \nsentence.\n  Sixty-two percent of adults and 77 percent of children diagnosed with \ncancer this year will be alive 5 years from now. There are more than 9 \nmillion cancer survivors living today. These numbers are improving \nbecause of advances in detection and early diagnosis, effective \ntreatments, and healthier lifestyles by survivors and those at risk.\n  We must continue our commitment to research so fewer people will \nexperience cancer.\n  The bill I am introducing today expands cancer research by \nauthorizing the Office of Cancer Survivorship within the National \nCancer Institutes to study the long- and short-term physical \npsychological, social and economic effects of cancer. Research has \nshown that cancer survivors are often susceptible to other diseases. \nExpanding on this research will allow scientists and physicians to \nimprove patients' quality of life and help prevent other diseases and \ndisabilities.\n  Additionally, the bill expands the Centers for Disease Control \nprograms to improve cancer survivorship. For example, the CDC will \ntrack the status of survivors to identify what health risks they face \nand the successful course of treatment they have utilized. Other \nprograms will demonstrate how to prevent and control cancer, especially \nin medically underserved populations.\n  This legislation has the support of CDC and NCI. It also has the \nsupport of Lance Armstrong.\n  I have been privileged to meet with Lance on several occasions. He \nhas never boasted of his athletic feats or touted his ability to master \nthe world's toughest bicycle race. He speaks with passion of the Lance \nArmstrong Foundation and the work it does on behalf of cancer survivors \nand their families. When he mounts his bike each summer it is a symbol \nof hope for cancer survivors the world over.\n  This year's Tour de France was no exception. Many predicted Lance's \ndefeat and he had to overcome illness, fatigue and crashes to reach the \nfinish line. But he never gave up. The trademark dedication and \nperseverance that characterize him as an athlete and a survivor kicked \nin once again. He pedaled to victory over the course of 3 weeks, more \nthan 2,100 miles and 84 hours of cycling, winning with a lead of 1 \nminute and 1 second.\n  It was truly a stunning end to a remarkable race.\n  The record-tying fifth consecutive win places Lance among cycling's \nelite. Only four others can claim five-time winner of the Tour de \nFrance among their accolades. Only one other man has won it \nconsecutively. If Lance wins the yellow jersey next year, it would be a \nworld record. But whether he breaks the record or not, he is a hero to \nall of us.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lance Armstrong on a \ngreat victory and signing on as co-sponsors to this important \nlegislation to help carry his message of survivorship to the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                S. 1496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cancer Survivorship Research \n     and Quality of Life Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) There are more than 9,600,000 individuals in the United \n     States today who are cancer survivors (living with, through, \n     and beyond cancer).\n       (2) 61 percent of cancer survivors are 65 years of age and \n     older.\n       (3) 62 percent of adults diagnosed with cancer today will \n     be alive 5 years from now.\n       (4) In 1960, 4 percent of children with cancer survived \n     more than 5 years.\n       (5) 77 percent of children (age 0 through 14) diagnosed \n     with cancer today will be living five years from now.\n       (6) Three out of every four American families will have at \n     least one family member diagnosed with cancer.\n       (7) 24 percent of adults with cancer are parents who have a \n     child 18 years or younger living in the home.\n       (8) One of every four deaths in the United States is from \n     cancer.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Harkin and Senator Feinstein in introducing \nthe Cancer Survivorship and Quality of Life Act. It is fitting that we \nare introducing this important legislation today. Just three days ago, \nas the world knows, Lance Armstrong, the champion cyclist from Texas, \nwon his 5th consecutive Tour de France. His triumph is an extraordinary \nachievement in and of itself, and it is even more extraordinary, \nbecause just 6 years ago, he was diagnosed with a form of cancer--\ntesticular cancer--that is often curable when detected early, but that \nin his case had already spread to his abdomen, his lungs, and brain. \nTwenty-five years ago, he probably would not have survived. But with \nthe treatment and therapy now available and the same fighting spirit \nthat made him a winner yesterday, he won the battle against cancer and \nbecame a worldwide symbol of courage and achievement.\n  His success is also a vivid symbol of the rapid progress being made \nin the ongoing battle against cancer. Never before have there been such \nhigh rates of survival for what used to be an overwhelmingly deadly \ndisease. Cancer research has brought new and more sensitive screening \ntests and more accurate and less invasive diagnostic procedures. \nGreater arrays of treatments are available that can cure cancer \ncompletely or keep it at bay for many years.\n  As a result of these medical and technological advances, over half of \nall adults and over three-quarters of all children diagnosed with \ncancer today will be living five years from now and often far longer. \nExperts now refer to many forms of cancer as ``chronic diseases'' \nillnesses that never go away, but can be treated in ways enabling \npatients to focus on living instead of preparing for death.\n  In the United States today, there are almost 10 million cancer \nsurvivors, and 40 percent of them are younger than 65. The financial \ncost is large. Direct costs for cancer care and the indirect costs to \nthe economy are now estimated at $180 billion dollars per year. But \nmore important than the financial costs are the devastating personal \nand emotional costs to the patients, their families and loved ones, and \ntheir caregivers as well. Almost a quarter of adults with cancer are \nparents who have a child 18 years old or younger living at home. Nearly \n1.3 million people will be diagnosed with cancer this year--3,500 \npersons each and every day.\n  The National Cancer Institute and other federal agencies now devote \nthe majority of their funds to diagnosing and treating cancer, and we \nneed to continue strong federal support for these purposes. Greater \nsupport is clearly needed to deal with the issues affecting survivors. \nMany cancer survivors say that equally important is the ``non-medical'' \ncare that they have received, and that is the purpose of the bill we \nare introducing today.\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\n  The Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act creates a \nCancer Survivorship Office in the National Institutes of Health and a \nCancer Control Center in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nto develop effective ways to improve the quality of life for patients \nwith cancer and their families. Such efforts include education of \npatients about their cancer, their options for treatment, and how and \nwhen to ask for a second opinion. They also include information about \nsupport networks and other services in their community.\n  Under our bill, the Centers for Disease Control and the National \nCancer Institute will work together to expand their data collection to \ninclude information about survivors and improvements in the care of \nindividuals newly diagnosed with cancer, such as successful treatments, \nrehabilitation, and nutritional and exercise programs. Currently, there \nis no effective way for new information to be widely shared. Patients \nwho are cancer survivors or who have family members or loved ones with \ncancer understand the importance of this information. We introduce this \nbill with the full support of the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which has \nbrought the issue of cancer survivorship to our national attention. I \nurge the Senate to give our legislation the priority it deserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1497. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to revise and \nexpand the lowest unit cost provision applicable to political campaign \nbroadcasts, to establish commercial broadcasting station minimum \nairtime requirements for candidate-centered and issue-centered \nprogramming before primary and general elections, to establish a \nvoucher system for the purchase of commercial broadcast airtime for \npolitical advertisement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Our \nDemocracy, Our Airwaves Act.'' This legislation is designed to increase \nthe flow of political information in broadcast media and to reduce the \ncost to candidates of educating the electorate on their candidacy.\n  Consistent with broadcasters' obligations to serve the public \ninterest in exchange for being licensed to use the public airwaves, the \nbill would require broadcast licensees to air a minimum of two hours \nper week of candidate-centered or issue-centered programming before a \nprimary or general Federal election. This legislation also would \nestablish a program to provide candidates and national committees of \npolitical parties vouchers that they may use for political \nadvertisements on radio and television broadcast stations. An annual \nspectrum use fee paid by broadcasters would fund the voucher system. \nFinally, the bill would require broadcast television and radio stations \nto provide candidates and parties with non-preemptible advertising time \nat the lowest rate provided to any other advertiser.\n  At a recent Committee hearing I chaired on the public interest \nobligations of broadcasters, it became apparent that local broadcasters \nare not adequately covering political campaigns as part of their local \nnewscasts. The hearing examined the results of a study prepared by the \nLear Center Local News Archive, which found that over a seven-week \nperiod from September 18, 2002 through November 4, 2002, 56 percent of \nthe top-rated half-hour news broadcasts did not contain a single \npolitical campaign story. In the 44 percent of broadcasts that did \ncontain campaign coverage, the average campaign story was 89 seconds \nlong. When campaigned stories did air, only 28 percent contained \nstories where candidates spoke with the average sound bit being 12 \nseconds long.\n  This study illustrates the pressures on political candidates to raise \nmoney because they are forced to gain the public's attention through \nthe use of costly advertisements. Our democracy is stronger when a \ncandidate's success is achieved by ideas, not by dollars, and when an \nelectorate is informed by facts, not 12-second sound bites. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S.1497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join with the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, in introducing legislation that \nwe believe will significantly improve media coverage of elections and \nreduce the negative impact that skyrocketing TV advertising costs have \non Federal campaigns. And I am very glad that the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, has again joined us as an original cosponsor \nof this bill.\n  Although broadcast advertising is one of the most effective forms of \ncommunication in our democracy, it also diminishes the quality of our \nelectoral process in two ways. First, broadcasters often fail to \nprovide adequate coverage to the issues in elections, focusing instead \non the horse race, if they cover elections at all. Second, the \nextraordinarily high cost of advertising time fuels the insatiable need \nfor candidates to spend more and more time fundraising instead of \ntalking with voters. These two problems interact to undermine the great \npromise that television has for promoting democratic discourse in our \ncountry.\n  It need not be this way. The public owns the airwaves and licenses \nthem to broadcasters. Broadcasters pay nothing for their use of this \nscarce and very valuable public resource. Their only ``payment'' is a \npromise to serve the public interest, a promise that often goes \nunfulfilled. A study by the Committee for the Study of the American \nElectorate found that only 18 percent of gubernatorial, senatorial and \ncongressional debates held in 2000 were televised by network TV and an \nadditional 18 percent were covered by PBS or small independent TV \nstations. More than 63 percent were not televised at all. This is \nshocking in a democracy that depends on information and open debate.\n  The bill we introduce today addresses these problems by requiring \nbroadcast stations to devote a reasonable amount of air time to \nelection programming. It would also direct the FCC to create a voucher \nsystem in which candidates and parties would receive vouchers they \ncould use for paid radio or TV advertising time, financed by a \nbroadcast spectrum usage fee. Candidates would qualify for vouchers \nbased on a ratio matched to the amount of small dollar donations they \nraise.\n  Our proposal would allow candidates to leverage their grassroots \nfundraising and would provide greater campaign resources to candidates \nwithout requiring them to become more beholden to special interests. \nThe proposal would also make air time available to political parties, \nwhich could be directed to underfunded candidates and challengers who \nhave a harder and harder time getting their message out under the \ncurrent system as the costs of advertising continue to rise.\n  Senator McCain and I remain devoted to improving the way our \nelectoral process functions and reducing the impact of big money on our \ndemocracy. This bill will advance that cause in a very significant and \nnecessary way. I look forward to working with my colleagues to fine \ntune this bill and enact it into law. Together we can make campaigns \nless expensive, and more informative, using the public airwaves as a \ntool to improve our democracy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 1498. A bill to provide for the establishment of a Health \nWorkforce Advisory Commission to review Federal health workforce \npolicies and make recommendations on improving those policies; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Cochran, Landrieu, and Kerry entitled ``The Health \nWorkforce Advisory Commission Act of 2003'' is designed to create a \nHealth Workforce Advisory Commission to review Federal health workforce \npolicies and make recommendations on improving those policies.\n  In my own State of New Mexico, over 9 percent of our total workforce \nis employed in the health sector. The New Mexico work force is not \ndissimilar to the rest of the Nation, where the total health workforce \ncomprises 10.5 percent of the total U.S. labor force.\n  By 2020, the total population of New Mexico is projected to grow 32 \npercent and the population over 65 is projected to grow 80 percent, \ncompared to national growth projections of 18 percent and 53 percent, \nrespectively. But who will care for these burgeoning populations? New \nMexico ranks 33rd among States in physicians per capita, and we \ngraduate fewer new physicians per 1,000,000 population than the entire \nUnited States.\n  The problem is not simply one of too few physicians however. New \nMexico ranks 7th lowest among the States in per capita employment of \nLicensed Practical/Vocational Nurses and we have 7 nurse anesthetists \nper 100,000 population, while the national average is close to 9 per \n100,000 population. New Mexico ranks 49th in the Nation in then number \nof dentists per capita. In fact, while the State's population grew in \nthe 1990s by 12 percent, the number of dentists in New Mexico declined \n7 percent in the same time period. Among the 50 States, New Mexico \nranks 42nd in the number of pharmacists per 100,000 population.\n  We are reflection of a crisis occurring in States across the Nation: \na critical shortage in multiple areas of the health workforce in the \nface of a changing population whose health care needs are only going to \ngrow and increase in complexity.\n  It is estimated that by 2050 the U.S. will need to more than triple \nits number of long-term care workers; enrollment in nursing education \nprograms has been declining of the last 8 years; vacancy rates for \npharmacists in Federal facilities is up to 18 percent and 11 percent in \npublic hospitals. At the same time, the number of practitioners other \nthan physician grew rapidly in the 1990s. How does this growth interact \nwith the simultaneous shortages in other areas? How should the \nworkforce of the future best be structured to meet the rise in baby \nboomers and how should we prepare for this?\n  These are the issues that health workforce policies attempt to \naddress. There has been, and continues to be, a significant investment \non the part of Federal and State governments in measuring, monitoring, \nand analyzing the numbers and types of health professionals who are \ntrained and practice in the U.S. but despite such efforts, there remain \nsignificant problems in determining the appropriate number, type, and \ndistribution of such personnel needed to provide access to appropriate \ncare for Americans. The underlying problem is that health workforce \npolicies developed by various State and\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\nFederal entities tend to be profession or position specific. What is \nlacking is a perspective on health workforce policies that is both \ninteractive and global in nature. As health care becomes increasingly \ncomplex, and as the health needs of the Nation changes, it is \nimperative to have a means with which the dynamics of a changing health \ncare market and health care workforce can be assessed and addressed.\n\n  We are all aware of the critical nursing shortages so many areas face \nnow, the increasing difficulty in recruiting and retaining rural based \nphysicians, the shortages of pharmacists and pharmacy techs, and of \nskilled laboratory technicians. And there are organizations focused on \neach of these specific issues; but these issues overlap in the \nmarketplace and impact each other in ways we cannot currently define. \nIt is as if there were a giant health care workforce machine with 500 \ninteracting mechanisms and while there is a specific mechanic for each \nof these components, there is no mechanic looking at the machine as a \nwhole. The health workforce is more than the sum of its individual \nparts, and in order to enact effective Federal workforce policies, this \nmust be reflected in the analysis and creation of such policies. HWAC \nis designed to do that.\n  For these reasons, we have introduced legislation that will create a \nnew health workforce commission, or HWAC for short. This legislation \nrequires the creation of a national advisory commission to review and \nmake recommendations pertaining to Federal health workforce policies. \nSpecifically, it will: Review federal health workforce policy under the \nfollowing Acts and their titles: Social Security Act, titles 18 & 19; \nPublic Health Service Act Titles 7 & 8, NIH, DOD, and VA and other \npertinent Acts and titles; Analyze and make recommendations to improve \nthe methods used to measure and monitor the U.S. health workforce and \nthe relationship between numbers and mix of such personnel and access \nto appropriate health care; Review health workforce policies and other \nfactors and their impact on the ability of the health care system to \nprovide optimal medical and health care services; Analyze and make \nrecommendations pertaining to federal incentives, financial, \nregulatory, and otherwise, and federal programs currently in place to \npromote the education of an appropriate number and mix of health \nprofessionals to provide access to appropriate health care for U.S. \ncitizens; Analyze and make recommendations about the appropriate supply \nand distribution of physicians, nurses, and other health professionals \nand personnel to achieve a health care system that is safe, effective, \npatient centered, timely, equitable, and efficient; Analysis of the \nrole(s) and global implications of internationally trained physicians, \nnurses, and other health professionals and personnel in the U.S. \nworkforce; Analyze and make recommendations about achieving the \nappropriate diversity of the U.S. health workforce.\n  The Commission will be represented by national experts in health \nworkforce issues, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, \na wide spectrum of health professionals and personnel, and be \ngeographically balanced in its representation. The Commission will work \nclosely with other state and Federal advisory panels that deal with \nprofessional or work specific issues of health workforce policy. \nMembership in the Commission will be chosen by the Comptroller General, \nwith representation from a diverse group of fields in health care, \nincluding members who are recognized for their policy expertise in \nhealth workforce measurement, monitoring, and analysis, health \nservices, economic and other workforce related research and technology \nassessments. At least 25 percent of the members are to be health care \nproviders from rural areas, in order to ensure a geographic balance in \nrepresentation. Through the creation of HWAC, a nodal focus of \ninformation gathering, sharing, analysis, and implementation of the \nknowledge created about the dynamics of the U.S. health workforce will \nbe put into place.\n  This legislation was created with significant input and assistance \nfrom a variety of national organizations representing a cross section \nof the spectrum of the U.S. health workforce.

A bill to adjust the boundaries of Green Mountain National \nForest; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to expand the \nboundaries of the Green Mountain National Forest. This will allow for \nthe inclusion of lands that have already been purchased using Land and \nWater Conservation Fund dollars to be brought into the boundaries of \nthe national forest providing them full statutory protection. The \nForest Service supports this administrative action and has been \nextremely helpful in providing the information needed for this \nlegislation.\n  It is with pride that I can say that since I came to Congress in 1975 \nand began to seek funding for land acquisition in 1977 we Vermonters \nhave seen the Green Mountain National Forest expand from approximately \n264,100 acres to over 387,500 acres in size. This 123,400 acre \nexpansion will provide unmeasured opportunities for the American \npublic.\n  While there is much debate over the future management of our Nation's \nnational forests today, this should not diminish their importance. In \nVermont, where approximately five percent of land base is in federal \nownership, these lands are treasured for the opportunities they provide \nnot only to Vermonters, but to all who enjoy the Green Mountain \nNational Forest. This includes recreational activities from camping, \nhiking, mountain biking, and skiiing to job opportunities provided \nthrough timber management activities, the ski industry, and other \nsupport services, as well as for their intrinsic value by providing \nthat certain lands are set aside for in their natural state through \nwilderness protection and other special designations.\n  I am concerned that some will argue that we need to reduce our land \nacquisition dollars and to better manage what we already have. I do not \ndispute the need for better management, but I wholeheartedly disagree \nwith reducing our land acquisition efforts. At one time this Nation \nbelieved that our boundaries were limitless. Today we realize that land \nis a finite resource and as more is acquired for development less will \navailable for the American public to acquire for Federal ownership. \nThere will come a time when the only land one can freely access, \nthereby avoiding the ``No Trespassing'' signs, will be our Federal, \nState, and county lands. Visionaries see what tomorrow will bring and \nprepare for that today--those who are still building upon our public \nland base have that vision.\n  At the turn of the century, the 20th century that is, there existed \nthat vision, between then Chief of the Forest\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nService Gifford Pinchot and President Theodore Roosevelt who together \nexpanded the boundaries of the national forests immensely. We continue \nto need that vision, as seen by the efforts by those on the Green \nMountain National Forest, in continuing to fund land acquisition into \nthe future.\n  This need, for providing the American public with unfettered access \nto open lands, is of significant importance to those who live east of \nthe Mississippi; where more than 50 percent of the American public are \nwithin three hours of their national forests, but only have access to \napproximately one-quarter of the national forest land. I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this bill and continue to carry \nthat vision on the future to build upon our national forest system as \nwe start the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (by request):\n  S. 1501. A bill to amend title 49, United States code, to provide for \nstable, productive, and efficient passenger rail service in the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, by request, I am introducing the \nPassenger Rail Investment Reform Act, the Administration's long-awaited \nlegislative proposal for restructuring Amtrak and the intercity \npassenger rail program. In doing so, I want to express my appreciation \nto Transportation Secretary Mineta and departing Deputy Secretary \nMichael Jackson for meeting their commitment to me in April to deliver \nthe Administration's proposal before the August recess. I also want to \ncredit the work of the Amtrak Reform Council, the basis for several \nelements of the Administration's plan.\n  Amtrak began operation in 1971 as a for-profit corporation and was to \nbe free of all Federal support by 1973. Throughout its history, \nincluding between 1997 and 2001, Amtrak led Congress to believe that \nprofitability, or at least operational self-sufficiency was achievable. \nBut 32 years after its establishment, Amtrak is running annual deficits \nexceeding $1 billion; has run up a debt of nearly $5 billion; continues \nto operate trains that lose over $400 per passenger; and yet still has \nless than 1 percent of the intercity travel market. Clearly, reform is \nneeded.\n  I hope the legislation I am introducing today will serve as the basis \nfor developing a consensus about the future of Amtrak and intercity \nrail passenger service. Even Amtrak supporters should admit that \nwithout significant restructuring, the passenger rail program cannot be \nentrusted with billions of dollars of additional financial support from \nthe taxpayers, as some are proposing, particularly financing outside of \nthe annual appropriations process, which at least gives Congress the \nability to adjust Amtrak's funding based on its performance and use of \ntaxpayer dollars. Nor, in my view, should high-speed rail projects go \nforward until the Amtrak problem is solved.\n  My priority is to establish a network of train service that makes \neconomic sense, minimizes subsidies at all levels of government, and \nprovides fair and open competition for Amtrak. The Administration's \nproposal is a good start. Federal support for intercity passenger rail \nservice would be modeled after the existing transit program and consist \nof capital funding matched by the States and managed through a ``full \nfunding grant agreement'' process. States, rather than the Federal \nGovernment, would be responsible for funding operating losses after a \ntransition period.\n  Following the recommendation of the Amtrak Reform Council, the \nlegislation would divide Amtrak into an operating company which would \noperate train services, and an infrastructure company which would \nmaintain the Northeast Corridor (NEC). After a transition period, the \nservices provided by both companies would be subject to competition \nthrough competitive bidding. The NEC would be restored to a state of \ngood repair, and leased to and managed by an interstate compact. Amtrak \nwould not be privatized but would have to compete with companies in the \nprivate sector, ensuring a lower-cost solution for the taxpayers.\n  I intend to hold a hearing on the Administration's bill and the bill \nbeing introduced today by Senator Hutchison, the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine. If a \nconsensus can be reached on a responsible proposal to fund and reform \nAmtrak and provide for an improved rail passenger program, the \nCommittee will mark up legislation in the fall.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Passenger Rail Office, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I support Amtrak and believe we can \nhave a viable national passenger rail system. Unfortunately, we are far \nfrom realizing that goal. Outside the Northeast Corridor (NEC), trains \nseldom run on time, and service is abysmal. Lateness is often measured \nin days, not hours. Several years ago, when the airlines on-time rate \nfell below 75 percent it was considered a national emergency. At \nAmtrak, on-time records under 50 percent are business as usual. Rail \ncritics point to low ridership as the reason why we starve the national \nsystem. I contend that starvation is the reason for low ridership.\n  In the Northeast, a passenger can board a train here at Union Station \nand reasonably expect to be in New York City, about 225 miles away, in \nless than three hours. If one of my constituents buy a ticket from \nAustin to Fort Worth, a trip thirty-eight miles shorter than DC to New \nYork, the best he can expect is that it will take four and one-half \nhours. Of course, the Texas Eagle makes its schedule only 35 percent of \nthe time, so my constituent will likely waste even more time on this \nshort trip. An Austin businessman may prefer not to deal with airport \nhassles for such a short flight, and he may want to avoid the traffic \non I-35, but the train is not a reasonable option if he has a meeting \nin fort worth at a time certain.\n  This inequity cannot continue. Either we commit to building a rail \ntransportation alternative for the entire Nation, or we abandon the \npretense of Amtrak and turn it over to the States and private \ncompanies. Our motto for Amtrak is ``National or Nothing!''\n  Improving service on the national system will require creative \nthinking and innovative financing. We cannot continue to fund Amtrak \njust enough to keep it going until the next crisis. That is a road map \nfor failure. Private investment, State participation, and the \ncooperation of the freight railroads are all essential to achieving \nservice upgrades.\n  In Texas, most passenger trains are forced to operate at less than \nthirty miles per hour due to track conditions and freight operations. \nThe national system needs at least $38 billion in capital improvements \nto allow trains to meet a reasonable schedule. Safety improvements \nalone will cost $13.8 billion. The Northeast Corridor needs roughly $10 \nbillion to avoid an increased risk of accidents and a systemwide \nslowdown. Postponing these upgrades and repairs will only make them \nmore expensive.\n  In the 1950s, President Eisenhower convinced the Nation to pay for \nthe construction of the National Highway System. Fiscal realities have \nchanged since then, and we must find a way to creatively finance the \nrail infrastructure needs of the nation without draining resources from \nalternative modes of transportation and other federal priorities. \nMunicipal bonding and private investment are necessary components of \nany plan to restore and improve rail infrastructure.\n  Making this investment will not only improve passenger service, but \nalso upgrade freight operations throughout the country. Outside the \nNEC, freight and passenger trains must run on the same tracks. In \nexchange for an investment in upgrading those tracks, the freight must \nagree to allow Amtrak to meet its schedule. I realize the critical role \nplayed by freight railroads in the American economy, and I know this \nindustry has seen better days. That is why I urge them to work with us \nto achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. If we cooperate, freight \nrailroads will enjoy capital improvements they could not otherwise hope \nto afford, as we secure the future of passenger rail in this country. \nIt can be a win-win situation.\n  I was deeply disappointed to see Amtrak's proposed 5-year capital \nplan call for $9.1 billion in Federal funding, with more than $8 \nbillion spent in the Northeast Corridor. The national system must \nreceive more than the crumbs left over after the needs of the NEC have \nbeen met.\n  We will never have a better opportunity to accomplish this goal than \nright now. That is why I am introducing legislation along with Senators \nLott, Burns, Snowe and Smith to begin to bring the national system up \nto Northeast Corridor standards. My bill will strengthen the Federal \nrole by creating a National Passenger Rail Office at DOT, responsible \nfor coordinating with States and the railroads to assure the national \nsystem receive the improvements necessary to operate an effective \ninter-city passenger rail system. The legislation authorizes $12 \nbillion for Amtrak in operating assistance. Amtrak will be required to \nbring the national system up to an 80 percent on-time arrival rate. \nOnce a route has enjoyed reasonable on-time performance, it can be \nfairly evaluated from a cost-benefit perspective. 80 percent is a \nmodest goal, but it is not going to be easy to attain. If Amtrak is \nunable to meet performance requirements on a route, that route should \nbe opened for bidding by other operators.\n  If we fail to enact real change in this reauthorization bill, we may \nrun out of chances to obtain the elusive intermodal transportation \nsystem we profess to seek. We must decide whether we want to create a \nviable national system, or settle for a single rail corridor providing \never-deteriorating service to only one sector of the country. I will \nnot support any proposal that does not put the national system on par \nwith the Northeast Corridor. Today marks a new beginning, or the \nbeginning of the end. It's national or nothing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 205\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service on the subject of autism \n     awareness; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a postage stamp be \n     issued.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to show my support for the \nautism awareness resolution submitted today by my colleague, Senator \nColeman. Autism is a developmental disability which typically appears \nduring the first 3 years of life and impairs the communication and \nsocial skills in those affected. The result of a neurological disorder \naffecting the functioning of the brain, autism and its associated \nbehaviors occur in as many as 1 in 500 individuals, in a rate of 5 boys \nto every girl. Because autism is difficult to recognize and diagnose, \nit is important that families seek an evaluation by a medical \nprofessional experienced in diagnosing and treating the disorder.\n  This disability is about 10 times more prevalent today than it was in \nthe 1980s, with over 500,000 people in the U.S. today with some form of \nthis pervasive developmental disorder. Its frequency rate makes autism \none of the most common developmental disabilities. However, most of the \npublic, including many medical, educational, and vocational \nprofessionals, are still unaware of how autism affects people and how \nthey can effectively work with individuals with this diagnosis. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in my efforts to increase autism \nawareness, and support this resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 206--HONORING THE MEMORY OF DR.

Vonette, in 1951 founded \n     Campus Crusade for Christ International, which now serves \n     people in 191 countries through a staff of 27,000 full-time \n     employees and up to 500,000 trained volunteers;\n       Whereas his life focus was on students and laypersons, and \n     from the first he emphasized the role of women as full \n     partners in leadership in the various ministries;\n       Whereas Dr. Billy Graham, a long-time friend of the \n     Brights, has said: ``He is a man whose sincerity and \n     integrity and devotion to our Lord have been an inspiration \n     and a blessing to me ever since the early days of my \n     ministry'';\n       Whereas Dr. Bright lived simply, owning neither houses nor \n     land, and receiving no honoraria or donations for his \n     thousands of appearances across the world, and the scores of \n     writings and video presentations he developed;\n       Whereas when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, he \n     fulfilled a dream of more than 40 years of praying for Russia \n     by donating his entire pension to establish a ministry to the \n     students of Moscow State University;\n       Whereas Campus Crusade for Christ International operates \n     more than 70 ministries and projects which offer hope and \n     spiritual enlightenment across the globe to students on \n     hundreds of campuses, urban residents, including minorities, \n     the well-known Athletes-in-Action ministry, leaders of \n     governments, inmates of prisons, aid to families, aid to \n     health and education programs, aid to\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\n     families of military personnel, executives, entertainers and \n     musicians, and many others;\n       Whereas in 1979, Dr. Bright commissioned the JESUS film, a \n     feature-length documentary on the life of Christ, directed by \n     John Heyman, which has since been viewed by more than \n     5,100,000,000 people in 234 countries and has become the most \n     widely viewed, as well as most widely translated, in 786 \n     languages, film in history;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright is author of more than 100 books and \n     booklets, as well as thousands of articles and pamphlets that \n     have been distributed by the millions in most major \n     languages, including the widely regarded Four Spiritual Laws \n     of which 2,500,000,000 copies have been distributed;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright received 8 honorary degrees from \n     universities in the United States and other nations, and \n     numerous awards and honors from higher education, his home \n     state of Oklahoma, and his peers in religious, radio, and \n     television broadcasting;\n       Whereas, Dr. Bright was awarded the unique and prestigious \n     Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in 1996, presented \n     by Prince Phillip at Buckingham Palace in London, and was \n     received by Pope John Paul II in Rome where he addressed \n     world spiritual leaders in accepting its $1,100,000 prize, \n     which he directed be given to worldwide fasting for peace and \n     spiritual enlightenment;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright sought ecumenical and trans-\n     denominational cooperation throughout the world by building \n     more than 1,000 partnerships with other ministries, and in \n     1983, he and former President Ronald Reagan, along with \n     Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant members of the clergy, \n     informed Congress which voted to establish The Year of the \n     Bible to help focus on timeless truths for the Nation;\n       Whereas he helped create what media reports describe as the \n     largest non-denominational Christian ministry in the world, \n     and he rejected appeals to establish a single religious \n     denomination and would not allow his name to be attached to \n     any single denominational enterprise;\n       Whereas he urged followers to be ``salt and light,'' to \n     seek civility in society, and to be active in ministry to \n     prisons, hospitals, orphanages, and he declared the duties of \n     citizenship to be reliably informed, active in the study of \n     issues, voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, and \n     personal voting;\n       Whereas he never endorsed individual candidates or parties, \n     and encouraged laypersons to seek public service and often \n     called upon people in all lands to study American History, \n     declaring President George Washington as his secular hero \n     after Jesus of Nazareth and the Apostle Paul;\n       Whereas in response to a suggestion from a Member of the \n     United States Senate, he helped establish the Evangelical \n     Council for Financial Accountability to set high standards \n     and monitor their compliance, setting an example for all \n     charitable organizations;\n       Whereas Money magazine has often cited Campus Crusade for \n     Christ International as best or one of the top 5 non-profit \n     ministries for effective stewardship of donor dollars; and\n       Whereas in his last months he co-founded the Global Pastors \n     Network, a separate ministry to pastors worldwide with \n     helpful resources and a goal to start 5,000,000 home-based \n     studies of the attributes of God: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) sends its condolences to Mrs. Vonette Zachary Bright, \n     their grandchildren, their sons, Zac and Brad, and their \n     wives, Terry and Katherine, all of whom are also in full-time \n     Christian ministry; and\n       (2) does hereby honor the memory of Dr. William R. \n     (``Bill'') Bright, an ambassador of spiritual goodwill, whose \n     58 years of dedicated and effective service stand as an \n     outstanding example of selfless leadership to all humankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url":

RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF MTBE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (referred to in \n     this section as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide at low \n     levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster or \n     anti-knocking agent;\n       (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) \n     established a fuel oxygenate standard under which \n     reformulated gasoline must contain at least 2 percent oxygen \n     by weight;\n       (3) at the time of the adoption of the fuel oxygenate \n     standard, Congress was aware that--\n       (A) significant use of MTBE could result from the adoption \n     of that standard; and\n       (B) the use of MTBE would likely be important to the cost-\n     effective implementation of that standard;\n       (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component \n     additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences \n     for water quality;\n       (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate \n     standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making \n     substantial investments in--\n       (A) MTBE production capacity; and\n       (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to the \n     marketplace;\n       (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may \n     cause serious problems of drinking water quality;\n       (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water \n     sources throughout the United States;\n       (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low \n     concentrations;\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\n       (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water \n     supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of \n     MTBE consumption at low levels are yet unknown as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean \n     Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \n     Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--\n       (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;\n       (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE; and\n       (C) to maintain the environmental performance of \n     reformulated gasoline;\n       (11) Congress has--\n       (A) reconsidered the relative value of MTBE in gasoline; \n     and\n       (B) decided to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel additive;\n       (12) the timeline for elimination of use of MTBE as a fuel \n     additive must be established in a manner that achieves an \n     appropriate balance among the goals of--\n       (A) environmental protection;\n       (B) adequate energy supply; and\n       (C) reasonable fuel prices; and\n       (13) it is appropriate for Congress to provide some limited \n     transition assistance--\n       (A) to merchant producers of MTBE who produced MTBE in \n     response to a market created by the oxygenate requirement \n     contained in the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); and\n       (B) for the purpose of mitigating any fuel supply problems \n     that may result from elimination of a widely-used fuel \n     additive.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate; and\n       (2) to provide assistance to merchant producers of MTBE in \n     making the transition from producing MTBE to producing other \n     fuel additives.\n       (c) Authority for Water Quality Protection From Fuels.--\n     Section 211(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       (A) by inserting ``fuel or fuel additive or'' after \n     ``Administrator any''; and\n       (B) by striking ``air pollution which'' and inserting ``air \n     pollution, or water pollution, that'';\n       (2) in paragraph (4)(B), by inserting ``or water quality \n     protection,'' after ``emission control,'';

WILLIAM R. BRIGHT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 206, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       S. Res. 206, honoring the memory of Dr. William R. ``Bill'' \n     Bright, commending his life as an example to succeeding \n     generations.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one \nof the great spiritual leaders of the twentieth century, Dr. William R. \nBright. Dr. Bright, or Bill, as a number of us in this Chamber knew \nhim, was a man of great faith, great heart, and great strength. Bill \nBright's passing on Saturday, July 19, 2003, leaves a hole in my heart \nand the hearts of the many individual lives he touched. For this \nreason, I would like to take a few moments to remember the life and \nwork of Dr. Bright.\n  Bill was born in Coweta, Oklahoma, in 1921. He graduated from \nNortheastern State University in Oklahoma with a Bachelor of Arts \ndegree in economics and a minor in sociology. While a student, Bill \nalready showed promise as an energetic community leader. He served as \neditor of the university yearbook, was elected student body president, \nwas chosen as a member of Who's Who in American Colleges and \nUniversities, and was selected by students and faculty as the year's \noutstanding graduate. After graduation, he joined the extension faculty \nof Oklahoma State University for a time, and then moved to Los Angeles \nto launch a business career.\n  While in California, Bill attended the First Presbyterian Church in \nHollywood, where he became a Christian in 1945 and began an intensive \nstudy of the Bible. Never one who lacked commitment to those endeavors \nhe felt were of great importance, Bill engaged in 5 years of graduate \nwork at Princeton and Fuller theological seminaries, while still \ncontinuing his business interests. During his studies at Fuller, young \nBright became convinced that he personally needed to be working to help \nfulfill Christ's Great Commission to spread the Gospel to those around \nhim. Looking for opportunity to act on this calling, Bright began by \nsharing his faith in Christ with students on campus at UCLA, and \nactivity which gave birth to the present worldwide ministry of Campus \nCrusade for Christ International.\n  Bill worked faithfully to lead Campus Crusade for Christ from its \ninfancy in 1951 to its current size. Campus Crusade has grown to be one \nof the world's largest Christian ministries, serving individuals in 191 \ncountries through a staff of 26,000 full-time employees and more than \n225,000 trained volunteers. What began as a campus ministry now covers \nalmost every segment of society with more than 70 special ministries \nand projects which reach out to students, inner cities, governments, \nprisons, families, the military, executives, musicians, athletes, and \nmany others.\n  In addition to touching so many lives by the work of Campus Crusade, \nBright reached out to others through the print and visual media. Bill \nauthored more than 100 books and booklets, as well as thousands of \narticles and pamphlets, which have been distributed by the millions in \nmost major languages. In particular, his 1956 booklet title The Four \nSpiritual Laws has been printed in over 200 languages and distributed \nto mre than 2.5 billion people. Bright also commissioned the JESUS \nfilm, a documentary of the life of Christ, which has been viewed by \nover 5.1 billion people in 234 countries and has been translated into \n786 languages.\n  While Bill focused on serving others and would not like attention to \nbe drawn to himself, he could certainly not avoid attracting praise for \nhis great works of religious and community service. Dr. Bright held six \nhonorary doctorate degrees: a Doctor of Laws from the Jeonbug National \nUniversity of Korea, a Doctor of Divinity from John Brown University, a \nDoctor of Letters from Houghton University, a Doctor of Divinity from \nthe Los Angeles Bible College and Seminary, a Doctor of Divinity from \nMontreat-Anderson College, and a Doctor of Laws from Pepperdine \nUniversity. In 1971, he was named outstanding alumnus of his\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\nalma mater, Northeastern State University. He is listed in Who's Who in \nReligion and England's Who's Who in Community Service, and has received \nnumerous other recognitions. Among the most prestigious of these awards \nwas the Templeton Prize for Prgress in Religion in 1996, which is worth \nover $1 million. Bill, in his charity, donated all of this prize money \nto ministries training Christians internationally in the spiritual \nbenefits of fasting and prayer.\n  Bill Bright was a man of determination and spiritual vigor, a man who \nhad great faith, great hope, and great love for his Lord and for his \nfellow man. He was a man worthy of respect and emulation. I, and I know \nmany of my colleagues in this Chamber, extend our deepest condolences \nto Bill's wife, Vonetta, his sister, Florence, his brother, Forest, his \ntwo sons, Zachary and Brad, and his four grandchildren. We know that \nBill is now in a place of greater peace than ever he was on earth. We \ncommend him to his eternal rest and we thank him for his many years of \nfaithful service.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the matter be \nprinted in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 206) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 206\n\n       Whereas Dr. Bright died on July 19, 2003, at age 81 in \n     Orlando, Florida from complications related to pulmonary \n     fibrosis, a lung disease for which there is no known cure or \n     effective treatment;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright was an agnostic humanist and \n     materialist, and successful Hollywood businessman, until he \n     became ``overcome by the love of our great Creator God and \n     Savior'' in 1945, whereupon he spent 5 years in theological \n     studies at Princeton and Fuller Theological Seminaries;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright, with his wife Vonette, in 1951 founded \n     Campus Crusade for Christ International, which now serves \n     people in 191 countries through a staff of 27,000 full-time \n     employees and up to 500,000 trained volunteers;\n       Whereas his life focus was on students and laypersons, and \n     from the first he emphasized the role of women as full \n     partners in leadership in the various ministries;\n       Whereas Dr. Billy Graham, a long-time friend of the \n     Brights, has said: ``He is a man whose sincerity and \n     integrity and devotion to our Lord have been an inspiration \n     and a blessing to me ever since the early days of my \n     ministry'';\n       Whereas Dr. Bright lived simply, owning neither houses nor \n     land, and receiving no honoraria or donations for his \n     thousands of appearances across the world, and the scores of \n     writings and video presentations he developed;\n       Whereas when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, he \n     fulfilled a dream of more than 40 years of praying for Russia \n     by donating his entire pension to establish a ministry to the \n     students of Moscow State University;\n       Whereas Campus Crusade for Christ International operates \n     more than 70 ministries and projects which offer hope and \n     spiritual enlightenment across the globe to students on \n     hundreds of campuses, urban residents, including minorities, \n     the well-known Athletes-in-Action ministry, leaders of \n     governments, inmates of prisons, aid to families, aid to \n     health and education programs, aid to families of military \n     personnel, executives, entertainers and musicians, and many \n     others;\n       Whereas in 1979, Dr. Bright commissioned the JESUS film, a \n     feature-length documentary on the life of Christ, directed by \n     John Heyman, which has since been viewed by more than \n     5,100,000,000 people in 234 countries and has become the most \n     widely viewed, as well as most widely translated, in 786 \n     languages, film in history;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright is author of more than 100 books and \n     booklets, as well as thousands of articles and pamphlets that \n     have been distributed by the millions in most major \n     languages, including the widely regarded Four Spiritual Laws \n     of which 2,500,000,000 copies have been distributed;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright received 8 honorary degrees from \n     universities in the United States and other nations, and \n     numerous awards and honors from higher education, his home \n     state of Oklahoma, and his peers in religious, radio, and \n     television broadcasting;\n       Whereas, Dr. Bright was awarded the unique and prestigious \n     Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in 1996, presented \n     by Prince Phillip at Buckingham Palace in London, and was \n     received by Pope John Paul II in Rome where he addressed \n     world spiritual leaders in accepting its $1,100,000 prize, \n     which he directed be given to worldwide fasting for peace and \n     spiritual enlightenment;\n       Whereas Dr. Bright sought ecumenical and trans-\n     denominational cooperation throughout the world by building \n     more than 1,000 partnerships with other ministries, and in \n     1983, he and former President Ronald Reagan, along with \n     Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant members of the clergy, \n     informed Congress which voted to establish The Year of the \n     Bible to help focus on timeless truths for the Nation;\n       Whereas he helped create what media reports describe as the \n     largest non-denominational Christian ministry in the world, \n     and he rejected appeals to establish a single religious \n     denomination and would not allow his name to be attached to \n     any single denominational enterprise;\n       Whereas he urged followers to be ``salt and light,'' to \n     seek civility in society, and to be active in ministry to \n     prisons, hospitals, orphanages, and he declared the duties of \n     citizenship to be reliably informed, active in the study of \n     issues, voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, and \n     personal voting;\n       Whereas he never endorsed individual candidates or parties, \n     and encouraged laypersons to seek public service and often \n     called upon people in all lands to study American History, \n     declaring President George Washington as his secular hero \n     after Jesus of Nazareth and the Apostle Paul;\n       Whereas in response to a suggestion from a Member of the \n     United States Senate, he helped establish the Evangelical \n     Council for Financial Accountability to set high standards \n     and monitor their compliance, setting an example for all \n     charitable organizations;\n       Whereas Money magazine has often cited Campus Crusade for \n     Christ International as best or one of the top 5 non-profit \n     ministries for effective stewardship of donor dollars; and\n       Whereas in his last months he co-founded the Global Pastors \n     Network, a separate ministry to pastors worldwide with \n     helpful resources and a goal to start 5,000,000 home-based \n     studies of the attributes of God: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) sends its condolences to Mrs. Vonette Zachary Bright, \n     their grandchildren, their sons, Zac and Brad, and their \n     wives, Terry and Katherine, all of whom are also in full-time \n     Christian ministry; and\n       (2) does hereby honor the memory of Dr. William R. \n     (``Bill'') Bright, an ambassador of spiritual goodwill, whose \n     58 years of dedicated and effective service stand as an \n     outstanding example of selfless leadership to all humankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url":

We hope the majority \nleader could give us that assurance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, indeed it is in the unanimous consent \nrequest that a time will be determined by the majority leader in \nconsultation with the Democratic leader. It will not be in the middle \nof the night. We will find a mutually appropriate time.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/30/senate-section/article/S10452-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10452-S10453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1504\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
