Mr. President, I want to take several minutes to comment \non some good news from Tennessee, good news from Tennessee that \nunderscores the importance of having a good, strong leader as principal \nof K through 12 schools.\n  Last month, the national, nonprofit New Leaders for New Schools chose \nthe city of Memphis to participate in its education program. Memphis \njoins other cities--Chicago and New York and Washington--as a \nparticipant in this new and innovative reform effort in education. The \nprogram is called New Leaders for New Schools. It is the brainchild of \nJohn Schnur, a young social entrepreneur and education expert. He came \nup with the idea while at Harvard Business School. His idea was to take \nconcepts of business leadership and apply it to education K through 12.\n  As we all know, every successful company is led by a successful CEO. \nSuccessful schools, in turn, are really no different. Great principals \nmake for great schools. Really, it makes sense. New Leaders for New \nSchools trains outstanding individuals to become outstanding school \nprincipals. The program draws applicants from all walks of life, from \nformer bankers and dot commers, to teachers and, indeed, retired \nprincipals. What they share is a deep belief in the potential of every \nchild to succeed. These committed individuals are sent into urban \nschool districts to turn around poor performing schools. As they prove \ntheir effectiveness, they can earn flexibility in hiring and carrying \nout reforms.\n  In Memphis, New Leaders for New Schools will recruit and develop 60 \nnew principals over 3 years to serve in the public school system. City \nleaders are rightly excited about this great opportunity. The No Child \nLeft Behind Act does set high standards, and a strong and effective \nschool principal is key to meeting these goals.\n  I should note that 45 percent of Memphis school principals are \neligible for retirement in the next 3 years. Training the next \ngeneration of principals is critical.\n  I am excited for the parents and the teachers of Memphis. I am \nespecially excited for the schoolchildren of Memphis. With strong and \nmotivated leadership at the top, they will have even more opportunities \nto realize their potential.\n  Every child can learn. Every child can succeed. New Leaders for New \nSchools is one more step in moving our education system forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2019-7", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in recent weeks, Americans have witnessed \na steady stream of reports that raise grave questions about the \naccuracy of statements made by senior Bush administration officials \nleading up to the war in Iraq.\n  The unequivocal administration pronouncements that Saddam Hussein \npossessed weapons of mass destruction, was pursuing nuclear \ncapabilities, and had close ties with al-Qaida have not been proven or \nbeen proven unequivocally wrong.\n  Implications of these intelligence failures are far-reaching. While \nSaddam Hussein may be in prison, just this week CIA Director Tenet \nindicated America is still the target of terrorists who seek to kill as \nmany Americans as possible in any way available to them.\n  At no time in our Nation's history has the integrity of the people \nwho use intelligence and the people who produce intelligence been more \nvital to national security. Americans need to have confidence in both \nour policymakers and our intelligence community. To rebuild that \nconfidence, Americans have a right to know how the administration and \nhow our intelligence community could have been so wrong on matters of \nsuch grave import.\n  For a failure this massive, every aspect of America's national \nsecurity policymaking process should be put under the microscope: How \nwe collect information, how we analyze it, how it gets interpreted by \nadministration officials, and how the Senate performs its oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  Much of the discussion about our Iraq intelligence failures thus far \nhas focused on our incorrect assessments of the threat posed by Saddam \nHussein. While important, there is another vital piece of this story \nthat has been overlooked until this point. That is, the \nadministration's failure to plan for postwar Iraq and the consequences \nthat would arise from toppling Saddam Hussein.\n  The administration's myopic approach to planning for post-Saddam Iraq \ncontinues to have consequences for the safety of our troops and the \nlong-term security of our Nation and its interests. As a result, it is \ncritical that the Nation learn more about why the administration failed \nto plan for the contingencies of a post-Saddam Iraq. As officials from \nthe Bush administration, the United Nations, and the Iraq Governing \nCouncil seek to reach agreement on the administration's third and \nlatest proposal for forming the first official post-Saddam government, \nwe would be wise to look back at what went wrong.\n  A thorough, bipartisan investigation is warranted.\n  What makes the unfolding evidence of insufficient post-war planning \nmost troubling is that, in this instance, contrary to the questions of \nweapons of mass destruction, it appears that our intelligence was \nright.\n  There was a consensus among the intelligence community that removing \nSaddam would be the easiest part of our efforts to secure and rebuild \nIraq.\n  Our intelligence community, our military, and numerous independent \ngroups all concurred in the assessment that our gravest challenges \nwould come in the days after Saddam was ousted.\n  The greatest difficulty, all agreed, would come in the days following \nthe toppling of Saddam Hussein. Senior administration policymakers were \nrepeatedly warned by other officials within the government, as well as \na raft of independent outside experts, to plan accordingly.\n  Months before the start of the conflict, these officials and experts \ncarefully examined these issues and offered concrete proposals to \nmaximize our chances for bringing about a stable Iraq while minimizing \nthe risks to our troops and our taxpayers.\n  For instance, as far back as March 2002, a year before the invasion, \nthe State Department was working on a $5 million project entitled the \nFuture of Iraq. Experience from previous conflicts demonstrated the \nimportance of preparing in advance for our postwar duties.\n  And experience from the past gave us all a guide as to what to expect \nin Iraq.\n  Although there were many other officials and organizations making \nsimilar assessments, the State Department's Future of Iraq project \nprovides some useful insights into the information available to the \nadministration had it chose to listen.\n  In its 13-volume study plus a one-volume summary and overview, the \nFuture of Iraq project reached some prescient conclusions.\n  First, the project said Iraq would be disorderly after liberation and \nstressed that the days immediately after liberation would be critical--\nto both those who seek to work with us and those who do not.\n\n       The removal of Saddam's regime will provide a power vacuum \n     and create popular anxieties about the viability of all Iraqi \n     institutions . . . the traumatic and disruptive events \n     attendant to the regime change will affect all Iraqis, both \n     Saddam's conspirators and the general populace.\n\n  Second, this report stressed the importance of restoring basic \nservices as quickly as possible after the regime change. The report \n``stressed the importance of getting the electrical grid up and running \nimmediately--[this is] key to water systems, jobs. [This] could go a \nlong way to determining Iraqis attitudes' toward coalition forces.''\n  Third, the report warned about the problems created by a wholesale \ndemobilization of the Iraqi military.\n\n       The decommissioning of hundreds of thousands of trained \n     military personnel that [a rapid purge] implies could create \n     social problems.\n\n  Each of these conclusions should have waved a red flag to \nadministration officials: if addressed effectively, the transition will \nbe smoother; if ignored, the transition will be more difficult. More \ndifficult for our troops and more difficult for the Iraqi people.\n  Unfortunately, the administration apparently chose to ignore these \nand many other similar findings offered up by other groups. In fact, \nnews reports indicate that White House and senior Defense Department \ncivilian officials actually worked to exclude people who worked on or \nshared the views contained in the Future of Iraq report--views that \nhave proven to be 100 percent correct.\n  One of the most comprehensive reports about this issue can be found \nin James Fallows' article in the January/February 2004 Atlantic Monthly \nentitled ``Blind into Baghdad.''\n  I highly commend this article to my colleagues.\n  Unfortunately, the many warnings about post-war Iraq fell upon deaf \nears in the administration. For a variety of reasons, senior \nadministration officials in the White House and senior civilians in the \nDefense Department ignored these warnings, instead apparently opting to \nrely on dubious sources to back up their rosy predictions about how our \ntroops would be received by Iraqis and how smooth the transition would \nbe.\n  For example, the administration was repeatedly pressed for an \nestimate before the start of the war on the number of troops and the \ncost of the operation.\n  Even though press reports indicate administration officials had \nsigned off on a war plan in November 2002 that spelled out the size of \nthe forces necessary for an Iraq mission, the administration \npersistently claimed not to know the size of the forces needed or their \ncost.\n  As late as February 2003, 2 months after the President had authorized \nthe deployment of 200,000 troops to the region and less than 2 months \nbefore the start of the conflict, Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz \nsaid, ``Fundamentally, we have no idea what is needed unless and until \nwe get there on the ground.''\n  Even worse, the administration suggested that there would be no cost \nat all.\n  Administration officials stated that the proceeds from the sale of \nIraqi oil would be used to pay for the American military presence.\n  On March 27, 8 days after the war had started, Wolfowitz was again \npressed on a figure and indicated that whatever it turned out to be, \nIraq's oil supplies would keep it low: ``There's a lot of money to pay \nfor this. It doesn't have to be U.S. taxpayer money. We are dealing \nwith a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and \nrelatively soon.''\n  In April, after more than a month of conflict, Andrew Natsios, the \ndirector of USAID, said the total cost to the taxpayer would be no more \nthan $1.7 billion. ``We have no plans for any further-on-funding for \nthis.''\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\n  The administration either knew better at the time or should have \nknown better.\n  And our troops and the American people certainly deserved better. \nOver 500 Americans have been killed and over 3,000 wounded in Iraq. \nUnfortunately, these numbers are likely to continue to grow before our \nmission there is complete.\n  We have already appropriated over $150 billion for this operation, \nand this cost could easily double before we are through.\n  Let me take another example--the administration's statements about \nthe post-war environment we would encounter and the challenges we would \nface.\n  Although there are a few instances where administration officials \nwent on the record before the war warning that a war with Iraq could \nrequire a lengthy commitment, administration officials repeatedly \npainted the most optimistic portrait possible in order to gain support \nfor its strategy.\n  Vice President Cheney's remarks 3 days before the start of the war \ntypify much of what the administration was telling the American public.\n  When asked if the American people are prepared for a long, costly \nbattle with significant casualties, the Vice President said, ``Well, I \ndon't think it's likely to unfold that way . . . because I really do \nbelieve we will be greeted as liberators.''\n  This tragic miscalculation allowed the administration to abandon the \nintelligence-based, analytical process needed to plan successfully for \nthe occupation of Iraq. The administration sent a smaller force than \nour senior military officials initially recommended.\n  Our personnel were not suitably prepared for the immense economic, \nsocial, and political complexities that we should have known would \ninevitably arise after the fall of Saddam Hussein. And our troops and \nthe American people were not adequately equipped for the guerrilla \ntactics that have become all too common since President Bush declared \nan end to major combat operations.\n  Overall, the administration's overly optimistic attitude about post-\nwar Iraq has contributed to a far more costly and arduous effort than \nneeded to be the case.\n  Mr. President, not long ago, many of my colleagues and I had the \nhonor of having dinner with more than 100 soldiers and their families \nat Walter Reed Army Medical Center. These soldiers had all been wounded \nwhile serving their country in Iraq. I hope my colleagues will take the \nopportunity to visit these young men and women. After seeing first-hand \nthe kind of people our country has produced, I have never been more \nproud to be an American.\n  As I think of my night with these brave men and women who have \nsacrificed so much and asked for so little in return, I cannot help but \nthink: Did we do right by them? Did we do everything possible to put \nthem in a position to succeed at the least possible risk? Did we \nprovide them with a plan for success and the tools needed to carry it \nout?\n  In a statement last year, General Anthony Zinni, one of the most \nrespected and distinguished military leaders this country has produced, \ncommented on what we owed those who we placed in harm's way.\n  He said:\n\n       They should never be put on a battlefield without a \n     strategic plan, not only for the fighting--our generals will \n     take care of that--but for the aftermath and winning that \n     war. Where are we, the American people, if we accept this, if \n     we accept this level of sacrifice without that level of \n     planning?\n\n  The administration based its post-war planning on blind hope, and \nhope is not a plan. We owe it to our troops and ourselves to determine \nwhether we did everything we could to succeed in Iraq. Our success in \nIraq and future conflicts depends on it. Our need to ensure that we do \nright by our troops demands it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2021-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we will soon begin debating the merits of the tax bill \nthat will bring the United States into compliance with our World Trade \nOrganization's obligations and assist domestic manufacturers. I \nunderstand this bill has been renamed the Jumpstart JOBS Act, referring \nto the number of manufacturing jobs that have been lost in the past few \nyears, whether it is from businesses relocating their plants overseas, \nthe outsourcing of jobs, or increased efficiency that does not require \nas much manual labor.\n  I believe that every Senator in this body wants to help those \nAmericans who have been laid off to find new employment and to provide \nassistance to our domestic manufacturers that will lead to real job \ncreation. But when we talk about job creation, too often this body \noverlooks a project that would produce those jobs for Americans, that \nwould create jobs in all 50 States, and not just a few jobs but by at \nleast one estimate we would create over 1 million jobs across the \ncountry.\n  Certainly, the number of jobs nationwide will at a minimum--at a \nminimum--be in the thousands, and that project I am speaking of is the \nconstruction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48.\n  With the reality in mind that this project will lead to real job \ncreation, I would like to speak to the body this morning about three \nvery exciting announcements relating to the Alaska natural gas \npipeline.\n  Three consortiums have filed applications to build a gas pipeline \nfrom Alaska's North Slope. These proposals would transport the 35 \ntrillion cubic feet of known technically recoverable reserves to the \nstarved markets in the lower 48. This would happen at a rate of roughly \n4.5 billion cubic feet per day. Many believe there is upwards of 100 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas on the North Slope and quite \npossibly more than that.\n\n  The first announcement from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, a \nmajor U.S. pipeline company and a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway \nwhose chief investor is financier Warren Buffett. Partnering with \nMidAmerican will be Cook Inlet Regional Corporation and Pacific Star \nEnergy, which is a consortium of Alaska Native corporations.\n  This is great news for Alaska, and it is great news for America. \nIndividual Alaskans, Alaska Native corporations, and Alaska-owned \ncorporations will have ownership opportunities in the pipeline under \nthis proposal--this is good for Alaska's economy--and oversight of the \nmain transportation project that will be used to move Alaska's commonly \nowned resources to market.\n  Rather than just benefit from the jobs and influx of short-term \nconstruction spending, as we saw during the construction of the Trans-\nAlaska pipeline, this represents a significant long-term benefit to \nindividual Alaskans and their families.\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\n  Following MidAmerican's application, the three major producing \ncompanies in Alaska--ConocoPhillips, BP Exploration, and ExxonMobile--\nalso filed an application with the State. These three companies hold \nthe lion's share of the right to produce North Slope natural gas.\n  Late last week, a third group, which is the Alaska Gasline Port \nAuthority, filed another application to build a pipeline. This third \noption proposes a liquefied natural gas project that would take natural \ngas from the North Slope, liquefy it at tidewater in south central \nAlaska for transport to the west coast markets in the lower 48.\n  In the end, the project that best meets the needs of Alaska and the \nmarkets will get built, but too often in our discussions we overlook \nthe proposed LNG project in favor of the land route that goes through \nCanada. Two years ago, Alaska voters indicated their desire for \nconstruction of an LNG project, but we have to make sure the numbers \nmake sense and the proposal is good for the State of Alaska.\n  I inserted language in the omnibus appropriations bill that provides \nthe opportunity for the loan guarantees included in the Energy bill to \nbe available for the LNG project option; that is, if the Secretary of \nEnergy determines that it is the best project for purposes of this \nprovision. It is something that needs to be proven by the project \nsponsors. Again, it demonstrates the need for passage of the Energy \nbill.\n  In the meantime, we have three applicants that are vying to build a \ngas pipeline along the Alaska-Canadian highway, with a possible spur to \nsouth central Alaska for an LNG project. They have come forward, put \ntheir names on paper, and they are willing to begin negotiations with \nthe State. For all of these reasons, Alaskans are excited.\n  I need to back up and clarify. When the initial announcements were \nmade about filing the applications, both MidAmerican and the producers \nstressed the need to enact the regulatory streamlining, the judicial \nstreamlining, and the fiscal incentives that are currently contained in \nthe Energy bill for the construction of a natural gas pipeline to go \nforward. There should be no misunderstanding about this; the provisions \nin the Energy bill relating to these issues must be enacted into law if \nwe hope to see positive movement on this project.\n\n  These filings we have in place now in the State are not a guarantee \nthat the project will be built. These applications represent the \nbeginning of a dialog between the applicants and the State of Alaska, \nbut no one should interpret these events to mean that we do not need to \npass the Energy bill.\n  A cornerstone of our national energy policy is the production of \nAlaskan gas and delivery of the needed resources to markets in the \nlower 48. Members on both sides of the aisle recognize the benefit that \nAlaska gas means for America.\n  We have seen the volatility in the natural gas prices that had \nsignificant negative impacts on businesses and on families struggling \nto make ends meet and to keep their homes warm in the winter. The \nAlaska natural gas pipeline will bring welcome stability and a measure \nof predictability to the natural gas marketplace, as well as benefit \nconsumers across the United States.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I had an opportunity to read an article by a \ngentleman by the name of Douglas Reynolds, an associate professor of \noil and energy economics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Mr. \nPresident, you have read his book, I know, and have had good things to \nsay about what he has written in the past. I have a copy of the \narticle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Mr. Reynolds brought out the point, \nwhich I would like to emphasize, that providing the financial \nincentives for a natural gas pipeline is ``like a futures contract to \ninsure a more reliable natural gas supply source.''\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       Congress has the option to assure a future supply of Alaska \n     gas at a reasonable price, and to get that supply on line \n     sooner than markets alone will do it.\n\n  The effect would be to make Alaska's gas supply less reliant on NLG \nexporters with less chance for market manipulation.\n  To me, this just hits it right on the head. Consumers are facing \nincreasing prices of natural gas. We have the opportunity to access a \nreliable supply of energy that will be produced under some of the most \nstringent environmental standards in the world and we can do it now, \nbefore we become dependent on foreign sources.\n  Douglas Reynolds and I are not the only ones who agree with this \nviewpoint. Recognizing the United States need for natural gas, the \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the \nCongress last year that natural gas supplies represent a ``serious \nproblem'' to the national economy.\n  He noted U.S. policy with respect to natural gas is contradictory as \nwe encourage consumption more than production. The chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Domenici, has worked \ndiligently for more than a year to craft a bill that promotes many \nforms of renewable energy, encourages energy efficiency in the Federal \nGovernment and consumer products, increases the authorization of the \nlow-income home energy assistance program, and moves us closer to \nconstruction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline.\n  To allay the major concerns of Members that led to the filibuster on \nthe conference report on H.R. 6, the Senator from New Mexico has \nintroduced a new Energy bill that has significantly less impact on the \nFederal budget. The new Energy bill streamlines the permitting process \nfor the Alaska natural gas pipeline, expedites judicial review and \nprovides for Federal loan guarantees and accelerated depreciation to \nlessen the cost of financing the project.\n  To those of my colleagues in the Senate who want to see this project \nbuilt, who want to stop the rise of natural gas prices, who want to \nensure a reliable supply of natural gas, who want to create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs across the country, I say pass this new Energy bill.\n  The fiscal and regulatory provisions in the Energy bill are a \nprerequisite to the construction of this project. The longer we wait, \nthe longer we allow this important policy to remain caught in \ncongressional gridlock, the more our economy is going to suffer. \nSenators should not accept the status quo when it comes to energy \nproduction. We should instead work to pass this Energy bill so we can \ntell the American people help is on the way, so we can begin to \nrationalize the energy markets, and so we can work to become less \ndependent on foreign sources of energy.\n  The Alaska natural gas pipeline will be the largest construction \nproject of its kind ever completed. I believe the Federal Government \nshould play a role in reducing the risk involved with this project, \njust as the Federal Government played a role in bringing affordable \nelectricity to the South and to the Pacific Northwest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator's \ntime has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The provisions in the Energy bill fulfill the Federal \nGovernment's role in bringing this pipeline to fruition.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Feb. 22, 2004]\n\n            Gas Line Will Happen, But Alaska Must Negotiate\n\n                         (By Douglas Reynolds)\n\n       During winter break in the Lower 48, I heard over and over \n     again concerns about the price of natural gas. It is \n     currently about $7 per thousand cubic feet, when only a few \n     months ago it was $4. Some fear there is market manipulation \n     since stocks of gas in reserve are adequate and the winter \n     has not been colder than normal so far. Investigations have \n     already started.\n       However, there is a reason behind the price rise. While \n     this year there may be adequate supplies of natural gas, next \n     year may be a different story. As I explain in my book, Lower \n     48 and Southern Canadian natural gas production will decline \n     and the United States will face a supply gap with prices \n     climbing above $10.\n       However, supply is declining faster than I anticipated. The \n     market may merely be anticipating next year's supply gap--\n     increasing prices now to conserve reserves and to increase \n     production later.\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\n       Of course it is theoretically possible to have market \n     manipulation. But this is extremely difficult to do and only \n     works if the supply system is uncompetitive. The internal \n     North American market is not.\n       Interestingly enough, if people in the Lower 48 are upset \n     now about alleged manipulation of the natural gas market, \n     they sure won't be happy when the United States starts \n     depending more heavily on imported liquefied natural gas. \n     This is because with imported LNG, the LNG exporters \n     themselves will be able to manipulate natural gas prices and \n     do it with impunity. It will be like OPEC all over again.\n       There is a mechanism to reduce LNG exporter's ability to \n     manipulate the gas market. It is to get Alaska natural gas to \n     market more quickly. Congress still has a chance to change \n     the Energy Bill by putting back in the natural gas credit \n     provisions. I know such a move is highly unlikely, but it is \n     certainly something each Alaskan should be clambering for.\n       Interestingly enough, some experts would actually like to \n     put in tax credits for Lower 48 gas producers rather than for \n     Alaska gas even though Lower 48 producers are making money \n     hand over foot. If more gas existed in the Lower 48, the \n     current incentives would already be pushing supplies \n     higher.\n       The fact of the matter is, the Alaska pipeline tax credits \n     that were cut from the energy bill are like a futures \n     contract to insure a more reliable natural gas supply source.\n       In other words, Congress has the option to assure a future \n     supply of Alaska gas at a reasonable price, and to get that \n     supply on line sooner than markets alone will do it. The \n     effect would be to make America's gas supply less reliant on \n     LNG exporters with less chance for market manipulation.\n       Since consumers are already complaining over high natural \n     gas prices, I would think that having such tax credits and a \n     more reliable source of natural gas would be to America's \n     advantage. As it stands, American consumers will undoubtedly \n     begin to complain ever louder when it's apparent that Alaska \n     gas is stuck on the North Slope just waiting for the time \n     when prices reach outrageous levels before reserves are \n     finally developed.\n       Needless to say, our Alaska congressional delegation has \n     fought hard to help make the gas line a reality, but now it \n     is up to the state to take the initiative.\n       So will the gas line happen? Yes. But Alaska may have to \n     negotiate with the producers or other pipeline companies to \n     get a deal. I believe the best strategy for the state is to \n     give a progressive royalty and severance tax package for all \n     natural gas production.\n       That means a low royalty and tax percent during low prices \n     and a high royalty and tax percent during high prices. This \n     will give Alaska much more revenue than the current royalty \n     and severance tax system would give because of anticipated \n     high prices. It will also quicken the pace of developing a \n     pipeline. It does however imply more risk in Alaska's \n     revenues over the years.\n       The future price of natural gas will not be lower than $4 \n     on the East Coast and will easily stay in the $6 to $10 \n     range.\n       This is because Atlantic Basin LNG producers will be slow \n     to ramp up production even while Lower 48 production goes \n     into decline. Plus LNG exporters can manipulate market prices \n     exactly the way domestic suppliers have been accused of \n     doing. Alaska can take advantage of this and negotiate to get \n     a line done quickly and with greater profits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to very briefly address two subject \nmatters. As I understand it, we will be moving later this morning to \nthis ETI bill, or the extraterritorial income legislation. My fervent \nhope is that in addition to debating the underlying bill itself, we \nwill also have an opportunity to raise questions about a staggering set \nof issues that is unfolding in our country, and that is the outsourcing \nof jobs all across this Nation to foreign lands.\n  We all understand this happens from time to time, but the explosion \nthat has occurred in the last 36 months is deeply alarming to many \nAmericans. We now have lost some 2.6 million to 2.7 million jobs over \nthe last 36 months in the manufacturing sector alone. Many of these \njobs are showing up either offshore in places such as India, \nBangladesh, the People's Republic of China, or elsewhere. There is \ngreat concern in this country that we are losing a very important \nstrategic base in our Nation, not to mention these critically important \njobs which can never be replaced.\n  I inform my colleagues, and I know others feel similarly as I do, \nwhen we get to this bill there will be some opportunities to offer \namendments and to address the very issue of American jobs.\n  When we hear the administration say, as the chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers did just a few days ago, that \noutsourcing of jobs was a good thing for America, we begin to \nunderstand the depths of concern people have when the administration \nfails to understand, at least through its leadership, how critically \nimportant it is that we stand up and do what we can to preserve \ncritically important jobs, although not at the expense of international \ntrade. We all understand the importance of trade in a global economy, \nbut we also understand if we are going to be a vibrant participant in a \nglobal economy that we have to produce the goods or the services to \ncompete.\n  If not only low-income jobs are given away but also high-technology \njobs, information technology jobs, and engineering jobs, for instance, \nare leaving, then the ability of this country to compete in the 21st \ncentury is going to be severely disadvantaged.\n  I look forward to the coming hours today, tomorrow, and possibly \nFriday, to engage with my colleagues in some of this debate and \ndiscussion. It will be the first time since we have returned that we \nare going to have a real debate and discussion about jobs in this \ncountry and what we might do in this body to address those issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2023-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2023-S2024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DODD. Secondly, on an unrelated matter, I was alarmed but not \nterribly surprised to pick up the morning newspapers and to read what I \nthought might happen. I did not wish it to happen, but I thought it \nmight happen in the island nation of Haiti.\n  Over the past weekend, I warned, as others did, if we did not step up \nand try to support a democratically elected government, albeit a flawed \none but a democratically elected government, we would end up reaping \nwhat we sow. And we are doing just that.\n  In the headlines this morning we read things such as: Haiti rebel \nsays he is in charge and has taken over down there. The man's name is \nGuy Philippe. This is a person who has a dreadful human rights record. \nThese are people who ran death squads and are involved in the drug \ntrades. They are now taking over. Anarchy apparently is reigning in the \nisland nation of Haiti.\n  Parts of this article state the country is in my hands, this so-\ncalled rebel leader says. Although American officials denounced the \narmed rebels and said they should have no role in ruling Haiti, the \nAmerican forces did not take any action to counter them at all. They \nhave now taken over in that country and are apparently in charge down \nthere. Anarchy is reigning. There are bodies in the streets of Port-au-\nPrince.\n  What I feared might happen if we did not stand up and support a \ndemocratic government--and again I will say a flawed one, but when the \nUnited States decided we were going to put a foot in the back of this \nelected President and send him out of the country, we warned the vacuum \nwould be filled by the worst elements. In fact, I read over last \nevening and this morning that Baby Doc Duvalier, the worst oppressive \nleader in that country, and his father, wants to come back to Haiti \nunder this new operation that is going on down there.\n  I am terribly disappointed the administration failed to step to the \nplate. I knew it was going to be difficult, but if we cannot support \ndemocratically elected governments--and again I will repeat, whatever \nproblems Aristide had, they were not a few; they were \nmany. Nonetheless, he was chosen by the people of that country on two \ndifferent occasions, overwhelmingly so. If we are unwilling to stand \nand back democratically elected governments in this hemisphere and give \na wink and a nod to those who replace governments that have been duly \nelected, we will see a repetition of what occurred in Haiti elsewhere. \nWe are seeing it in Caracas, Venezuela, because we are endorsing the \nnotion that when we don't like leaders in certain countries, we will \nignore the chaos that can result from changing of government other than \nthrough the normal means of elected government. That is something that \ncan happen, and it has happened.\n\n  So I rise to express my deep disappointment that once again the \nadministration, in this hemisphere, is just failing terribly, and Haiti \nis a classic example of failure. We now have a huge mess on our hands.\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\n  I pointed out the other day, 30 percent of the population of the \nBahamas is now Haitian. Thirty percent of that country is now occupied \nby people who have fled Haiti because of the repression and economic \nconditions in that nation. Twenty percent of children never reach the \nage of 5 in Haiti. The average income is $250. It is a poor Black \ncountry, and as a result I don't think we give it the kind of support \nwe should have been giving it.\n  In fact, over the last 36 months we embargoed any assistance directed \nto the Government of Haiti. What kind of a country do we live in today \nthat turns to a nation only 300 or 400 miles off our shore, with people \nliving in desperate conditions, with the highest rate of AIDS in the \nhemisphere, and we have virtually nothing to say to them. Here we have \ntoday, once again, these impoverished, poor people down there, who had \nto live under dreadful governments over the years, finally get one they \nelect democratically, and because we don't like it, it is a failed \nleadership in our view, we walk away from it, and now you have thugs \nrunning the place again. It is not all our fault but, Mr. President a \nlarge part is. I am terribly disappointed about what has happened, and \nI wanted to rise this morning to express those sentiments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2024-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2024-S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GROWING OUR MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, few issues are as important to the \nAmerican people than the availability of good jobs in their \ncommunities. Manufacturing jobs have long provided quality employment \nfor generations of Americans. Today, however, we are losing these jobs \nat a terrible rate, and no State has been hit harder than my home State \nof Maine.\n  According to a study by the National Association of Manufacturers, on \na percentage basis Maine has lost more manufacturing jobs in the past 3 \nyears than any other State in the Nation. We have lost nearly 18,000 \nmanufacturing jobs during that period, good jobs that once provided \nlifelong employment to Mainers in towns such as Millinocket, Wilton, \nWaterville, Fort Kent, Dexter, Westbrook, and Sanford.\n  In response to this loss of manufacturing jobs, I have introduced \nlegislation, the Growing Our Manufacturing Employment Act, which is \naimed at reinvigorating the domestic manufacturing sector, boosting the \nlevel of domestic manufacturing, and preventing the further loss of \nthese important jobs.\n  Mr. President, I know this is a major problem in your State as well, \nand we have had many conversations on what we might do to help.\n  At the national level, we are finally beginning to see the economic \nrecovery for which Americans have been longing. Third and fourth \nquarter gross domestic product figures are up dramatically, the best \ntwo quarters since 1984, and analysts expect the gross domestic product \nto grow by 5.7 percent this year, which would make 2004 the best year \nin the past 20 years.\n  But even so, I don't have to tell you that parts of our economy \nsimply are not sharing in this good news. Nowhere is this more true \nthan in the manufacturing sector, where we have seen a steady erosion \nof good jobs. The number of American manufacturing jobs has declined \neach year since the end of 1997. In fact, if you look at the past 84 \nmonths, since March of 1997, the number of manufacturing jobs has \ndeclined each and every month, except for 7.\n  This loss of jobs has occurred under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations, so this is not a partisan issue. The final 3 years of \nthe Clinton administration saw 27 months of manufacturing job losses, \nand the greatest single monthly decline in manufacturing jobs occurred \nin July of 1998 when 219,000 American manufacturing jobs disappeared.\n  As I mentioned, nowhere is the reality of this job loss in the \nmanufacturing sector more acute than in my home State of Maine. The job \nlosses during the past 3 years in the manufacturing sector in Maine \nrepresent more than 22 percent of my State's total manufacturing \nemployment, a higher percentage of manufacturing jobs lost than in any \nother State.\n  Why are American manufacturing jobs disappearing? According to a new \nstudy conducted for the National Association of Manufacturers, one \nanswer is the disparity in manufacturing costs in the United States \nversus other countries. In fact, compared to other countries, it costs \nan average of 22 percent more to manufacture goods here.\n  While it would surprise no one that American manufacturers face \nhigher costs of doing business than manufacturers in countries such as \nChina or Mexico, it would be a mistake to assume that wage rates alone \nexplain those differences. They do not. In fact, the productivity of \nthe American worker is unrivaled, allowing American workers to receive \nmore value in wages for the goods they produce.\n\n  As the NAM study indicates, if wages were the only factor, then U.S. \nmanufacturers would be far more dominant in the global markets than the \ncurrent trade situation suggests.\n  It is other structural costs, such as the high corporate tax rate we \nimpose on manufacturers, that make it more expensive to manufacture \ngoods in the United States relative to the costs elsewhere. Indeed, the \nNAM study shows it is significantly cheaper to produce goods, even in \nhigh-wage industrialized countries such as Japan and France. This fact \nillustrates the critical impact these high structural costs have on \nmanufacturers in the United States.\n  In essence, these costs have the same effect as a tax, as imposing a \n22-percent additional tax on the cost of making goods here rather than \noverseas. To compete, American manufacturers must somehow do more with \nless, move operations overseas, or get out of manufacturing altogether. \nThe end result is fewer jobs, a weaker economy, and a manufacturing \nsector in crisis.\n  I believe a healthy manufacturing base is essential to our Nation's \nfuture. Not only is manufacturing a key source of skilled high-paying \njobs, but it is also critical to our economic and national security \nthat we have the ability to manufacture the goods we need in this \ncountry.\n  For all of these reasons, I am proposing the Growing Our \nManufacturing Employment Act. This bill would eliminate that 22-percent \ncost differential that American manufacturers face by providing a \nvariety of tax incentives. For example, a jobs tax credit would be \nprovided to manufacturers that employ displaced workers who are \nreceiving trade adjustment assistance. That would help get those \nworkers back to work.\n  In Maine alone, nearly 60 manufacturers are currently TAA-certified, \nand more than 4,200 Maine workers have been deemed eligible for \nbenefits under TAA since the beginning of 2002. The credit would only \nbe available to manufacturers that increase their employment level. The \navailability of this credit would be a powerful incentive to hire \nworkers who are receiving benefits because they have been displaced.\n  As important as it is to assist workers who are eligible for benefits \nunder trade adjustment assistance, however, this alone is not \nsufficient to address the crisis facing America's manufacturers. That \nis why my bill also includes a 2-year, across-the-board deduction of 9 \npercent on domestic manufacturing income, a tax break that would not be \navailable for income earned on overseas operations. This, too, would be \na powerful incentive, a powerful tax break, to help encourage \nmanufacturers to keep their operations in America. It would help offset \nthat disparity in costs.\n  In Maine, the sector that provides the most manufacturing jobs is the \nforest products industry, an industry that is struggling. Paper plant \nafter paper plant in Maine has been laying off workers or closing down \naltogether, hurting our economy and leaving thousands of hard-working \nskilled workers without jobs.\n  My proposal includes provisions to encourage the recovery of the \nforest products industry, which is critically important not only to my \nState but to many other States, as well.\n  My bill, for example, provides a tax credit for reforestation \nexpenses and changes the tax treatment for wood harvested on \nnonindustrial woodlots. These changes would both encourage sound \nforestry stewardship practices and also increase the wood supply by \nremoving artificial barriers to sound woodlot management. Taken \ntogether,\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nthese provisions will help to ensure an affordable, reliable wood \nsupply upon which so many manufacturing jobs in Maine depend.\n  Finally, this bill is designed to ensure that only companies that are \nhelping to build America's manufacturing base obtain its benefits. It \nhas both a carrot and a stick approach. Companies that move jobs \noffshore will see their benefits reduced. For example, they will not be \nable to claim that 9-percent deduction on operations that are located \nin the United States. Companies that choose to invert their corporate \nstructure altogether in order to avoid U.S. taxes will not be eligible \nfor this credit at all.\n  The crisis in the manufacturing sector demands our attention. It did \nnot start yesterday, and it will not be resolved tomorrow. Solutions \ncan and should be sought today.\n  The bill I have introduced is a good start, but additional remedies \nare needed. Manufacturing jobs arise in part because some of our \ntrading partners simply do not play by the rules. The Presiding Officer \nhas been a leader in this area. Our Nation's manufacturers can compete \nagainst the best in the world, but they cannot compete against nations \nthat provide huge subsidies and other help to their manufacturers.\n  I hear from manufacturers in my State time and again whose efforts to \ncompete successfully in a global economy simply cannot overcome the \npractices of the illegal pricing and subsidies of nations such as \nChina. That is why I will soon be introducing a second bill that will \nhelp ensure that nations such as China are held fully accountable for \ntheir actions by our trade remedy laws. Unfair market conditions cannot \ncontinue to cause our manufacturers to hemorrhage jobs.\n  I am hopeful that working together on this and other legislative and \nadministrative proposals, we can take the important steps needed to \nstrengthen American manufacturers, to preserve our manufacturing \ncapacity, and most of all, to help ensure that hard-working Americans \nhave the jobs they need and deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy to be, once again, on the \nfloor with a very important piece of legislation. With the cooperation \nof the Democratic leadership of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nBaucus, we bring to the floor a bill that was voted out of committee 19 \nto 2. Senator Baucus and I always work together as much as we can--that \nis, most of the time--to bring to the Senate a bill that can get \nthrough the Chamber because as so many people who watch the Senate \nregularly know, the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, can't \nfunction if it does not function in a bipartisan way.\n  So we proceed, then, with this bipartisan bill: the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Strength Act. If I refer to the acronym JOBS, it is jumpstart \nour business strength.\n  Since March 2000, long before President Bush took office, the \nmanufacturing sector has been under significant economic pressure. \nObviously, that has affected manufacturing workers. A recent CBO study \nestimates that going way back to March 2000, an estimated 3 million \nworkers have lost their manufacturing jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office attributes this job decline to the \nrecession that began in November 2000 and the weak economy in demand \nthat followed, part of it a result of September 11 and recovery not \ncoming as normal as recoveries do.\n  But we always tend to look at bad news. Bad news tends to make the \nfront pages of the newspaper. Good news tends to make the back pages, \nif there is good news printed at all.\n  There is good news on the horizon. That is, that new manufacturing \norders, just this past December, surged to their highest levels in 50 \nyears. They haven't been that high since July of 1950. And January was \nthe sixth consecutive month that manufacturing activity expanded. In \nDecember, the manufacturing employment index grew for the second \nconsecutive month, but the overall economy during that month added \n1,000 jobs only. That was, of course, disappointing. But it wasn't \ndisappointing from the standpoint of the manufacturing employment index \ngrowing because it seems that is the lagging sector of this recovery.\n\n  I believe we are on the right path for a strong recovery. In fact, \nthere has been a recovery underway since economists ruled that the last \nrecession ended October 1, 2001. But when a recovery ends, it is not \nalways visible. Of course, it is visible in most segments of the \neconomy by very strong indices that are there to prove that. But one \narea that is not is manufacturing employment. We do now have those 2 \nconsecutive months of increased employment.\n  I believe we are on the right path to strong recovery, but we must do \nmore to ensure manufacturing stays on the path of recovery. \nManufacturing is so vital to the overall health of our economy, \nincluding follow-on sectors that benefit: the service and financial \nsectors.\n  As government policymakers, which we are, we have to act to \nrevitalize the manufacturing sector. Today we have some good news on \nmanufacturing, and that is, the legislation we bring to the Senate, \nbecause it is going to help enhance employment in the manufacturing \nsector.\n  As I have said previously, but I cannot emphasize too much, by a vote \nof 19 to 2 this bill was voted out of the Senate Finance Committee. Our \nbill is a bipartisan balance of domestic tax relief and international \ntax reforms, all meant to strengthen American business. Not as an end \nin itself, but as business strengthens, jobs are created. We are \ntalking about jobs for Americans.\n  Most importantly, this bill is revenue neutral. That is important, \nwhen we read in the newspapers about facing a budget deficit. This bill \nthen will not add one dime to the Federal deficit. The JOBS bill will \nrepeal the current FSC/ETI regime and use all the money from repeal to \nprovide a 3-point tax rate cut on income from U.S.-based manufacturing. \nI emphasize U.S.-based manufacturing. We start those cuts phasing in \nnext year. This 3-point rate cut is only for manufacturing and only for \nmanufacturing in the United States. This bill will not help American \nmanufacturers that want to manufacture offshore.\n  I point out how our bill would approach this effort to help create \njobs in American manufacturing and do it on American soil as opposed to \nthe way that the Ways and Means Committee of the other body, and even \nother bills that will be offered in the upcoming debate, would face \nthese issues. Our bill reducing taxes applies to all that manufacture \nin America.\n  I wish to make clear to our colleagues this is a bill to help \nmanufacturing in the United States. American companies that manufacture \noverseas will not get the benefit of the corporate rate reduction. \nForeign corporations that want to come over here to America and build \nplants and employ people in this country would get the benefit. But \nthis bill is about helping American manufacturing that takes place in \nthe United States of America.\n  I wish to differentiate the approach we use from the approach the \nWays and Means Committee uses.\n  Unlike the pending Ways and Means bill, and other bills that will be \noffered during the upcoming debate, these cuts apply to all who \nmanufacture in America, regardless of size. So this is going to include \nsole proprietors, partnerships, farmers, individuals, family \nbusinesses, multinational corporations, and foreign companies that set \nup manufacturing plants in the United States. All of these enterprises \nwill benefit as long as they manufacture.\n  So the objectives of this bill are pretty simple. Three: Jobs, jobs, \njobs, meaning jobs that pay money because of manufacturing in America.\n  Manufacturing is important to all States, and I want to point out \nsome benefits. For my State of Iowa--the figures I have are for 2001--\nIowa's gross State product was $91 billion. Of that, $19 billion or 21 \npercent of the State's wealth was created by manufacturing. From 2001 \nto 2002, Iowa's exports grew by nearly 15 percent. We shipped nearly $5 \nbillion of goods out of Iowa, and that was during the year 2002.\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\n  In Iowa, we have 222,000 jobs in manufacturing. So that shows how \nimportant it is for the United States to be competitive in \nmanufacturing both home and abroad because of 222,000 jobs just in my \nState. Those kinds of export numbers translate into very good and \nlasting jobs at home. Many of our country's manufacturing jobs are \ndependent upon the current FSC/ETI international taxing regime.\n  I have a map behind me that makes this very clear. It shows by State \nthe jobs that are existing today because of the current FSC/ETI \nprovision: South Carolina, 47,000 jobs; my State of Iowa, 35,000 jobs; \nCalifornia, 429,000 jobs; Texas, 262,000; New York, 215,000; Illinois, \n156,000; Washington State, 107,000 jobs generated by FSC/ETI.\n  As my colleagues probably know, FSC/ETI stands for Foreign Sales \nCorporation, extraterritorial income. This is what was determined to be \ncontrary to our international trade agreements, and that is why we have \nthis legislation before us because if we do not do something about this \nissue, these numbers of jobs that are dependent upon this legislation \nare in jeopardy because our manufacturing will not be competitive with \nour foreign competition.\n  Of course, what this is all about is passing legislation that will be \nin agreement with our trade agreements and, consequently, still protect \nAmerican manufacturing as the FSC/ETI has done over the last 25 to 30 \nyears.\n  FSC/ETI reduces the income tax on goods manufactured in the U.S. and \nsold overseas. FSC/ETI is critical to the manufacturing sector. It can \nreduce taxes on exports by as much as 3 to 8 tax rate percentage \npoints.\n  The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says that 89 percent of \nthe Foreign Sales Corporation benefits go to manufacturing companies. \nMany of those companies are the largest manufacturing employers in the \nNation. This reduced rate of tax on exports of U.S.-manufactured goods \nkeeps our companies competitive in the international marketplace. It \nallows our companies to compete with the European Union countries, \nwhich happen to have a taxing system where they get a rebate on their \nvalue-added tax on exports.\n  If we did not have the Foreign Sales Corporation, we would be \nexporting more of our taxes, making us uncompetitive with the European \nCommunity that has a different taxing system, value-added tax, that \nthey do not export.\n\n  Several years ago, the European Union filed a claim with the World \nTrade Organization challenging FSC/ETI as an illegal export subsidy. \nHence, we are here repealing such an important provision because under \ntrading rules, according to the decision, we cannot have a subsidy if \nit is contingent upon the act of exporting. The World Trade \nOrganization ruled that the FSC/ETI is an illegal export subsidy and \nhas authorized the European Union to impose up to $4 billion a year of \nsanctions against U.S. exports.\n  The European Union has already started this because March 1, this \nyear, was the date to do it. The sanctions start at 5 percent of the $4 \nbillion, and they are going to increase 1 percent for each month if we \ndo not repeal the FSC/ETI provisions. They are going to cap out at 17 \npercent. So by November, these sanctions will be 12 percent. How are we \ngoing to compete when the tax benefits that were supposed to level the \nplaying field are not only used, but the European Union, in a legal way \nunder our trade agreements, is levying sanctions. Just as the United \nStates when the European Union lost a case on our beef--they did not \ntake our beef--we leveled sanctions against European products that are \ncoming into this country, all in a legal way but not necessarily in the \nbest way to conduct international trade.\n  So eventually, these sanctions are going to get up to 17 percent, and \nat that point the European Union will review the effectiveness of the \nsanctions, and further increases are possible.\n  The European Union has been consistent in its message, that the FSC/\nETI must be repealed; the same way that we were insistent upon Europe \nand we won a case in the World Trade Organization that they take our \nbeef.\n  This is a serious threat against American manufacturing, and Europe \nknows where to hit us. One of those is agricultural products, plus \npaper products, and also a number of important manufacturing \nindustries, and they are hitting us right now in our soft underbelly.\n  These sanctions are going to undermine the economic recovery that is \nunderway, as I indicated before--underway with 2 months in a row of a \npositive upturn in the manufacturing index. So I believe it is \nimportant for the United States to fulfill its obligations under our \ntrading rules.\n  Now, it so happens that we win a lot more cases than we lose, and it \nalso is true that the United States has been a leader--in fact, the \nentire world recognizes us as a leader, and they wait for us \nsometimes--in reducing trade barriers around the world. We have shown \nleadership for the last 60 or 70 years in this area going back to the \nreciprocity agreements of the 1930s of reducing trade barriers.\n  As we expect Europe to import our beef when we win a case, it seems \nto me that we must show leadership in complying with these rules. What \nthe World Trade Organization is all about is to bring the rule of law \nto what would otherwise be a jungle of international trade. That is \nbecause we get more business activity when there is predictability and \nunderstanding of how we are going to do business. Just as that is true \nin our domestic policy for business expansion, it is true in \ninternational trade; if there is predictability, we will get more \nbusiness expansion around the world.\n\n  Domestic law has made that possible within the United States. We need \nto support a regime that does the same thing in international trade \nbecause we have seen under that regime of rule of law in international \ntrade for the last 50 or 60 years the expansion of the world economic \npie.\n  We are not talking about something that is just good for the United \nStates. It is good for the United States. But we are talking about \nsomething that is good for the entire world.\n  We have a growing world population. If you don't have a growing world \neconomic pie, there will be less for more people and less for more \npeople means political, economic, and social instability, and chaos.\n  So we have seen under this regime of rule of law in international \ntrade that the world economic pie has grown tremendously, and to a \ngreat extent because of international trade.\n  The United States has led the way. We need to continue leading the \nway. There are some lobbyists who are suggesting this is no big deal, \nthis doesn't have to be done now, it can be done tomorrow, it can be \ndone next year, and somehow these sanctions don't mean anything. They \ndo mean something because they are going to make our products \nuncompetitive and then we can't sell. If these were put on John Deere \ntractors in Waterloo, IA, one-fourth of the jobs could go.\n  One-fourth of the jobs at John Deere tractor in my home State are \nrelated to trade. But we do have to abide by the rule of law in \ninternational trade unless we want chaos, unless we want the jungle.\n  These lobbyists say sanctions don't matter. They argue: After all, \nsanctions only start at 5 percent. They would say: There has been a \ndecline in the dollar. That is going to take care of that problem. With \na decline in the dollar, add on 5 percent, no difference.\n  But I will bet these lobbyists who are spreading this word that \nCongress doesn't have to act don't represent anybody--any workers or \nany firms--on this retaliation list. But for those industries that I \nhave already talked about, and there are a lot more, sanctions do \nmatter because they will not be able to export if they can't compete. \nFive percent right now, and for sure 17 percent a year from now, is \ngoing to make a big difference.\n  In regard to the lower value of the dollar against the euro, that \nsomehow merely restores the status quo of the 1990s for a lot of \nAmerican companies so they can export more. The recent decline in the \ndollar helped these companies regain lost market share in Europe, and \nwe have lobbyists saying they ought to be back in that position that \nthey were in just a year ago, not being able to sell because of the \nhigh cost of the dollar?\n  Why would Congress want to deprive these companies and their \nemployees, where these are good American jobs, of the opportunity to \nexport? That is beyond me. These are good jobs, because\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nstatistics show conclusively that jobs connected with exports pay 15 \npercent above the national average.\n\n  Besides, there is no guarantee that the value of the dollar will not \ngo up tomorrow because our official policy is a strong dollar policy. \nOur official policy is also to let the marketplace decide the value of \nthe dollar. But if it does go up, it is going to leave American \nexporters in even a worse situation than they are today with that 5 \npercent and next month 6 percent.\n  It is plain wrong for us in Congress, when we can do something about \nit--and this bill does something about it--to gamble the future of \nthese American working men and women on the volatile international \ncurrency market.\n  There is another fancy suggestion from these high-paid lobbyists, \nthat all we have to do is cut a Government check to these U.S. \nexporters that are hurt by the sanctions.\n  That suggestion is just as stupid as the previous one. First, it is \nlikely that the World Trade Organization would find such a scheme to be \na prohibited export subsidy anyway, just as they originally did. That \nwould continue the cycle of noncompliance and retaliation.\n  These birds don't believe in the rule of law on international trade. \nThey like the jungle of international trade. In fact, most lobbyists \nlike a jungle because they are the ones who think they are smart enough \nto sort it out. We are not going to allow that jungle to grow just so \nlobbyists can prosper.\n  But this scheme, as the original suggestions, is unworkable. It would \nprobably require a new government bureaucracy to administer. You know \nwhat. This JOBS bill is about creating manufacturing jobs, not jobs in \na government bureaucracy.\n  It has also been suggested that the U.S. Government could simply pay \ncompensation to some foreign government rather than comply with our \ninternational trade obligations. I suppose, in the era of foreign aid, \nyou might say that suggestion is theoretically possible. But it is not \nvery realistic.\n  Under the World Trade Organization dispute settlement system, there \nis only one way, just one way, a nation can bring itself into \ncompliance with an adverse ruling, conforming with the WTO-inconsistent \nmeasure, and that is with a report adopted by the dispute settlement \nbody. That would dictate that as long as FSC/ETI is not repealed, the \nUnited States remains in violation of these international trade \ncommitments. So paying compensation to some government, in my reading \nof the obligations under the trade commitments, is not going to bring \nthe United States into compliance.\n  Furthermore, it has to be remembered that compensation in lieu of \nretaliation is only a viable option if the prevailing parties agree.\n  I think that is something the European Union is not inclined to do.\n  Even if it were possible, I am not going to suggest on the Senate \nfloor that the United States taxpayers ought to be writing a check to \nthe country of France. I, for one, don't think Congress is going to buy \nthese arguments that we don't have to deal with this now and there are \nother ways around. These proposals are shell games expounded by \nWashington lobbyists trying to confuse Congress, confuse the public, \nand thus avoiding a real permanent solution to a longstanding FSC/ETI \ndispute with the European Union. This is not realistic. They will not \nstop the imposition of European sanctions.\n  People suggesting these alternatives ought to face facts. Gambling \nAmerica's exports on the volatile currency market won't work. Cutting \ngovernment checks to U.S. exporters won't work. Transferring taxpayers' \nmoney to foreign governments such as France won't work. These are shell \ngames. There is only one real solution for American workers. This is \nsomething that has been worked out in a bipartisan way for the Senate \nto consider by the Senator from Montana and this Senator. This is the \nJOBS Act that is before us, and the best solution is to pass the JOBS \nAct now. I hope my Senate colleagues and our counterparts in the House \nof Representatives will act on the Finance Committee's FSC/ETI \nlegislation. It is all of our responsibility--Democrat and Republican \nalike--to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  If we, as a body, fail to act, American workers will suffer with \nfewer jobs, and the United States will lose an opportunity to \nrejuvenate and remain globally competitive in the mainstay of its \neconomy--the manufacturing sector of our economy.\n  Our majority leader, Senator Frist, should be commended for bringing \nthis bill to the floor so that the Senate can act now to end sanctions \nbefore they seriously damage the economy and before they damage our \ntransatlantic relations. The bill needs to be passed so we can end the \nsanctions as soon as possible.\n  Repealing FSC/ETI raises around $55 billion over 10 years. Eighty-\nnine percent of it comes from jobs in the manufacturing industry. If \nthat money is not sent back to help the manufacturing sector to be \ncompetitive with Europe, FSC/ETI repeal will be a $50 billion tax \nincrease on manufacturing. The old rule of economics is if you tax \nsomething more, you get less of it. So there is going to be less jobs \nin manufacturing.\n  I think we can all agree that a $50 billion tax increase on \nmanufacturing will not stimulate job growth in that sector. That is why \nthe JOBS bill passed by the Finance Committee uses every penny from the \nFSC/ETI bill repeal. To give this 3-percentage tax rate cut on all \nincome derived from manufacturing--that is done in the United States--\nthere is no benefit to American companies manufacturing overseas. There \nwould be a benefit to international companies that come here to create \njobs in America in manufacturing. Our 3-point rate reduction is not \nexport contingent under the World Trade Organization rules. Unlike the \nFSC/ETI regime, this 3-point rate reduction applies to goods \nmanufactured in the United States and which are sold domestically in \nthe United States, or if they are exported for sale outside the United \nStates. If you make it here, we cut your taxes regardless of whether \nyou are a U.S. or foreign corporation--bringing those manufacturing \njobs, then, to the United States of America. The JOBS bill starts \nphasing in the 3-point percentage tax rate reduction immediately in \n2004.\n\n  If you look at this next chart behind me, you see on average, \nEuropean Union manufacturing income is taxed at 21 percent but U.S. \nmanufacturing income is taxed at 24 percent. As you can see, the 3-\npoint rate cut on manufacturing income in the JOBS bill keeps us even \nwith the European Union on manufacturing tax burdens.\n  We included in the JOBS bill several international tax reforms that \nare aimed specifically to help manufacturing. The whole JOBS bill is \nslanted towards manufacturing. Flaws in our international tax rules \nseriously undermine America's ability to compete in the global \nmarketplace. International tax reform, like doing something with FSC/\nETI, is long overdue.\n  Our current system is built upon a framework dating back to President \nKennedy in the early 1960s. We clean up problems that cause foreign \nearnings to be double taxed by the United States and the foreign \ncountries where those profits are earned. We reform subpart (f) to \nensure that active foreign businesses are taxed when the money is \nbrought home and not when the United States companies are locked in \nbattle with foreign companies that do not pay taxes.\n  You will hear a lot of noise in the upcoming debate about these \ninternational provisions. But let me tell you right now that the \ninternational provisions in our bipartisan JOBS bill are targeted to \nbenefit U.S. manufacturing companies. Members may be surprised to learn \nour international provisions can actually harm a company's expansion in \nthe United States of America where we want companies to expand so that \njobs are created here and so that those jobs are not exported. It is a \nsimple thing to do. Just fix our tax laws so that jobs are created in \nAmerica as opposed to overseas.\n  We will have plenty of opportunity to talk about that issue in the \nupcoming debate.\n  In an era of expanding global markets, in an era of falling trade \nbarriers, and in an era of technological innovations that melt away \ntraditional notions of national borders, it is critical that our \ninternational tax laws keep pace with these new business realities.\n  We also include a provision for manufacturing that is not making \nmoney\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nright now. We allow a 3-year net operating loss carryback. This will \nallow companies to reclaim prior taxes paid. This will give them cash \nliquidity to weather the current storm.\n  I understand there may be some effort to expand this 3-year carryback \nto a 5-year carryback.\n  The JOBS bill also includes the Homeland Reinvestment Act sponsored \nby Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Ensign of Nevada, and Senator Boxer \nof California. That is a bipartisan group to which anybody ought to be \ndrawn.\n  This subpart of our JOBS bill, which is sponsored by Senators Smith, \nEnsign, and Boxer, is intended to encourage companies to bring their \nforeign earnings back to the United States by temporarily providing the \nreduced rate of tax. This bill will tax foreign earnings at 5\\1/4\\ \npercentage points instead of the 35 percent that would normally apply.\n  Advocates of this Homeland Investment Act claim that those moneys \nwill be invested overseas instead of the United States, if we don't tax \nthem at a lower rate than the 35 percent.\n  These colleagues view this measure as I do, very much stimulative to \nthe economy and helping with our unemployment problem.\n  One last point I will make is that our bipartisan manufacturing tax \nbill is revenue neutral. I don't think it does harm to emphasize, \nsometimes we pass a tax bill and less money comes into the Federal \nTreasury and we might have a bigger deficit. This bill does not do \nthat. Not one dime is added to the current deficit.\n  Thank God, the President has been in the forefront of this, asking \nfor a bill that would be revenue neutral. We have delivered for our \ncolleagues who believe in revenue neutrality of tax bills. We have \ndelivered for the President.\n  The JOBS bill provides over $112 billion in business tax relief which \nis paid for by shutting down tax shelters and by closing abusive \nloopholes. Let me emphasize that because people are reading about this \nevery day in the newspaper, companies setting up shell corporations \noverseas, with nothing but a cabinet and maybe an address, a post \noffice box, for the sole purpose of avoiding taxation. They dash and \nstash the cash, whereas we have all these other patriotic companies \nstaying in America.\n  There are other schemes I will not go into, but we deal with those \nschemes in this legislation, bringing in additional revenue that can be \nused, then, to make our international taxing regime more fair and do it \nin a way that creates jobs in the United States of America, not \noverseas.\n  It is a fact of life with most bills that come to the Senate, there \nis never complete agreement on an approach. There is always 20 percent \non the right and 20 percent on the left that might disagree with \nsomething that comes to this Senate. What this Senate is all about is \nmoving things to the center, to get a consensus to get something \npassed. In the process, there is never complete agreement.\n  For instance, some Members did not favor including this Homeland \nReinvestment Act which Senators Smith, Ensign, and Boxer have written. \nWe have included it in this bill. So we may have votes on that.\n  Our bill contains a temporary haircut on the rate reduction some \nMembers would like to remove and others would like to retain. We will \nprobably have that divisive issue before the Senate. Some Members \nprefer a reduction in the top corporate rate in place of all these \ninternational tax reforms and manufacturing rate cut deductions. Now, \nthat is a more simple approach than we have, but this approach misses a \ncouple of factors.\n  First, the top level rate cut would only go to the biggest \ncorporations of America. It would not go to the local family-held S \ncorporation or partnership as our finance bill does. We think we ought \nto help small business in the process.\n  Second, FSC/ETI repeal will not create a large tax increase on the \nservice industry. That repeal will be a $50 billion tax increase on \nmanufacturing. If we redirect the FSC/ETI repeal money to an across-\nthe-board corporate cut, as a couple of my colleagues will offer an \namendment to do, then the manufacturing sector will be the revenue \noffset for the services sector of tax cuts. It is a fact that we have \na struggling manufacturing sector and I don't think a sector of our \neconomy that is slowly recovering ought to be hit with this sort of a \nrevenue offset for the benefit of the service industry. We have to face \nwhat is the current crisis in manufacturing.\n\n  Working families are living in financial fear. We owe a secure future \nto these hard-working men and women. For them, we have a secure future. \nTheir employers must be able to compete and thrive both at home and \nabroad. Then their future is secure. Their employers cannot thrive if \nthese companies are burdened with excessive tax rates at home and \ninternational tax barriers abroad.\n  Our bipartisan JOBS bill presents the best opportunity to end that \nburden and to make a downpayment on putting Americans back to work. \nLet's hope the Senate gets to work, puts American manufacturing back in \nthe game. That is why I am here, urging my colleagues to support a \nbipartisan JOBS Act and cooperate to get this bill on the President's \ndesk.\n  In closing, I have one message for the 39 Democrats who are not on \nthe Finance Committee and may not see this, other than just a piece of \nlegislation voted out of the Senate Finance Committee. I say to the 39 \nDemocrats who are not on the committee, they have an opportunity to \nhelp us very quickly move a bill to the other body, very quickly help \nus pass a bill to help manufacturing, help us pass a bill to create \njobs for American men and women in manufacturing, which is slow to \nrecover. They have an opportunity to help with bipartisanship in the \nother body because there are bills in the other body, but they are \nshort of the number of votes they need. Part of the reason is maybe the \nother body does not see the need to pass a bipartisan bill as we do in \nthe Senate. There are Republicans and Democrats in the other body who \nare working on a way to do this, a way that is not far removed from our \nlegislation.\n  If we have a real strong vote over here and we get this done quickly, \nwe might be able to help the House of Representatives pass some \nlegislation and to do it in a bipartisan way. Helping to pass \nlegislation in a bipartisan way is not a bad goal for Senators, since \nwe practice that.\n  Also, those 39 Democrats will have an opportunity to help the Senate \nFinance Committee do something we want to do because we can get it done \nin this bipartisan way and it is not exactly the way the White House \nwants us to get it done. Here again, we share governing \nresponsibilities with the President and with the House of \nRepresentatives, and so Democrats working with Senator Baucus and \nmyself, Democrats who are not on the committee, can help get a bill to \nthe President, help the President to see maybe the aspects about this \nbill they do not like, they ought to take a second look at to see the \ngood work, and help get a bipartisan bill through the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I don't say that in a defensive way because I don't know of any \nreason the other 39 Democrats do not want to help us accomplish what we \nwant to accomplish. What I have just said is not for that purpose, but \nonly said for the purpose of those Democrats who are not on this \ncommittee, there is a larger aspect than just the language of the \nlegislation that is before the Senate. It benefits them for a lot of \ngoals they want to accomplish that sometimes cannot be accomplished as \na minority part of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nthe JOBS bill before the Senate. With this bill, we join in the work of \nimproving the economic well-being of Americans.\n  This bill is about creating good jobs in America. This bill is about \nimproving the standard of living of all Americans.\n  Let me begin with the economic context for this bill. In a series of \nstatements over the coming week, I will address particular aspects of \nthe legislation. We begin with the dignity and importance of work. Our \njobs often define who we are. They are where we spend much of our \nwaking hours. As the preacher teaches in the book Ecclesiastes, ``A man \ncan do nothing better than to . . . find satisfaction in his work. This \n. . . I see, is from the hand of God. . . .''\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n  Job creation is fundamental to our ability to live a good life. It is \nthrough the creation of good jobs that Americans have come to enjoy \nremarkable advancements in income and comforts. The American job \ncreation machine makes our shores the shores to which immigrants swarm. \nWe don't see people heading for the door. Rather, people from around \nthe world want to live in America.\n  Ours is a dynamic economy. This economic growth is the key to our \nNation's success.\n  I point out this chart. I will raise it up so people can see it. This \nchart shows the picture I have just basically described. In 1900, in \nthe wake of the industrial revolution, America already stood at the \npinnacle of the world economy. Already in 1900, believe it or not, we \nhad the highest per capita income in the world, slightly more than \nBritain or Australia, and almost double that of France or Germany.\n  But even adjusted for inflation in today's dollars, not 1900 dollars, \nAmerica's per capita GDP--a rough measure of our average income--was \nonly about $5,000 a year in today's dollars. Measured by today's \nstandards, we lived in poverty: Walking and horseback was how one got \naround; electricity lit only 3 percent of homes in 1900; only one-third \nof Americans had running water; only 15 percent had flush toilets; life \nexpectancy was 47 years.\n  In 1900, America had one of the best educated populations in the \nworld. But 1 in 10 were illiterate. The typical adult had left school \nafter the eighth grade. There were only 382 Ph.Ds awarded in the entire \ncountry in 1900.\n  Even though in 1900 our economy was at the top of the world, \nAmericans had an average income then that the average person in Mexico \nhas today.\n  If our economy had not grown, our standard of living would be \nunacceptable by today's measures. Economic growth made a huge \ndifference.\n  Because of economic growth, inflation-adjusted, our per capita income \ntoday is roughly seven times now what it was 104 years ago.\n  With economic growth, electricity became available across the \ncountry, and automobiles made us a mobile nation and made much more of \nthe Nation within reach of work.\n  It is incredible to see how much we have grown in real per capita GDP \nsince 1900. You can see a dip on the chart in 1929. But we have grown \nat a rapid rate.\n  The next chart is very interesting as well. This is private sector \nemployment. American economic growth created 108 million new jobs, net, \nsince 1900. In 1900, the American economy employed 27 million people in \nits civilian labor force. By January 2004, 104 years later, the \nAmerican economy employed almost 140 million Americans.\n  Two-thirds of Americans participate in the labor force--substantially \nhigher rates than in Europe. That is up from 55.5 percent in 1900. \nAmericans are hard-working people. We work.\n  The American economy has, on average, created more than a million net \nnew jobs every year since 1900. Since 1935, we have done better; \nAmerica has created 1.5 million jobs every year. That is a net figure.\n  America's economic growth springs from our people, our freedom, our \nunity. The American people are smart and as hard working as any in the \nworld. Our free market has given this great people the freedom to \nachieve their best potential. Our unity has protected its huge internal \nmarket from robbers, foreign and domestic.\n  We are lucky to be Americans, very lucky. Our Nation is still a \nmagnet for immigrants. This country is still a beacon to countries \naround the world.\n  We can pride ourselves in our independent judiciary, which helped \nmake this country strong. We can be proud of our system of government--\nthis long-lived democracy. We have a dynamic, mobile society.\n  In a number of ways, America has it right. More times than not, \nAmericans have struck about the right balance between government \nprotections and private freedoms, to contribute to economic growth.\n  Our society provides an environment for success. Bill Gates, for \nexample, might be a pauper in Sri Lanka. But America provides the \nenvironment and infrastructure and, of course, the political system and \nmarkets where a Bill Gates can succeed. We should not take this lesson \nfor granted. This is not true in all countries. Our society, economy \nand, yes, the Government contributed to the successes of people such as \nBill Gates.\n  Government does have a role to play, for good or evil, either to \nfoster or to impede this economic growth.\n  Government can impede growth. By running large continuing budget \ndeficits, the Government can suck vital capital out of the economy, \nrobbing individuals and businesses of funds that can be used for \ninvestment.\n  Thus, the record budget deficits that the Government is now running \npose a threat to our Nation's economic growth. We have to recognize \nthat. These deficits decrease national savings, decrease private sector \ninvestment, and raise interest rates. The resulting slower economic \ngrowth and increased cost of borrowing harm businesses, large and \nsmall.\n  Foreign governments can impede our growth when they deny Americans \naccess to their markets, when they don't let us sell products in their \ncountry, when they artificially depress the value of their currency, \nflooding our lands with their imports and denying our exports a fair \nopportunity to compete.\n  Our Government can foster growth by investing in education, by \nopening markets at home and abroad, and by removing barriers to our \neconomic greatness. We can foster growth in America.\n  That is what this bill is about--removing barriers to economic growth \nand creating jobs.\n  It is no secret that in the past few years the engine of American job \ncreation has ground to low gear; manufacturing has been particularly \nhard hit.\n  This next chart shows the story of private sector job creation in the \nAmerican economy over the last decade. Beginning in March of 1993, here \nat the lower left, the American economy steadily created new jobs \nthroughout the rest of the decade. The economy grew. People had jobs \nand families had more money in their pockets. In fact, from January of \n1993 to January 2001, about 20 million--net jobs--were created in \nAmerica.\n  Private sector employment peaked at 111.6 million jobs in December of \n2000. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that since the end of the \nyear 2000, the private sector of the American economy lost 3 million \njobs. You can see that on the chart. Our peak was here in 2000 and we \nhave lost jobs--3 million. Three million jobs were lost in the American \neconomy since that peak in December of 2000. In January of this year--\nthe month for which we have the latest statistics--the American economy \nemployed 108 million private sector workers, which means 1 out of every \n40 private sector jobs have disappeared since the end of 2000.\n  The manufacturing sector has disproportionately borne the brunt of \nthese job losses.\n  This next chart shows the story. This is manufacturing jobs from 1993 \nto 2004. We can see the dramatic decline in roughly 2001, since July of \n2000.\n  Since July of 2000, the American economy has lost 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs. That is a net loss. The Bureau of Labor Statistics \nreports that in January, America employed 14.3 million workers in \nmanufacturing, and that is down from the 42nd straight month from the \nhigh of 17.3 million in July of 2000. That is a drop of 17.5 percent in \nmanufacturing employment. More than one in every six American \nmanufacturing jobs has disappeared since July of 2000. Again, one in \nevery six manufacturing jobs in America has disappeared since July of \n2000.\n  Manufacturing jobs have disappeared in all 21 industries that \nconstitute the manufacturing sector. It is in all sectors. We lost jobs \nin computer and electronics products. We lost jobs in transportation \nequipment. We lost jobs in machinery. We lost jobs in fabricated \nmetals. We lost jobs across the board.\n  My home State of Montana has suffered more than most. It has had a \n19-percent reduction in manufacturing jobs since January of 2000.\n  This next chart also shows job losses happening all across the \ncountry; not just across all manufacturing sectors but all across \nAmerica. Every State in the Nation but one has lost manufacturing jobs \nsince July 2000. The darker the shade, the greater the job loss; the \nlighter the shade--orange and yellow--there is less job loss. But every \nState in the Nation has lost jobs, except one.\n  The manufacturing jobs we are losing are good jobs. This next chart \nshows\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nmanufacturing jobs pay more than service jobs on the average. We all \nknow we are moving from a manufacturing society to a service job \nsociety. Regrettably, those new jobs, service jobs, pay quite a bit \nless than manufacturing jobs, and that has been true from 1994 all the \nway up through the current date.\n  This next chart shows manufacturing employment is now at its lowest \nabsolute level since July of 1950. Fewer Americans are employed in \nmanufacturing today than at any time in more than half a century. We \ncan see from the line from 1950 to today there is essentially the same \nnumber of jobs. Clearly, we are not doing very well.\n  Why do I mention all this? First, it is fact. Second, we have to deal \nwith it. We have to do something about it, and that brings us to the \nbill before us, the JOBS bill. We have targeted the provisions of this \nbill directly at manufacturing employment. Why? Because that has been \nthe greatest problem.\n  This bill will not be a complete solution. By no stretch of the \nimagination will this bill be a complete solution to job loss in \nAmerica. To help create and keep manufacturing jobs, we also need to do \nmany other things in addition to passing this bill. We need to open \nforeign markets to American goods much more aggressively than we have \ndone in the last couple of years. We need to improve education, to \npreserve the comparative advantage of American workers. Clearly, we \nhave to be the smartest--hopefully at least try to be the smartest--in \nthe world. To do that, we have to educate our kids and keep education \nat all levels, and to retrain workers.\n  We also need to make health care more affordable. Health care costs \nin the United States are too high. They place a big burden on \nemployment, on businesses. The cost of health insurance and the cost of \nhealth care is way too high and should be lowered. We also need to \nprovide assistance to displaced workers. They need to be retrained.\n\n  This bill will do two things that will make an important contribution \nto creating and keeping manufacturing jobs in America. This bill will \ncontribute to economic growth and increased demand. This bill will help \nreduce manufacturers' tax burdens. It will reduce the tax rate for \ndomestic manufacturers by 3 percentage points. Basically, it is a 9-\npercent reduction for domestic manufacturing income, which translates \nto about a 3-percentage point break for corporations. The JOBS Act will \nthus help all manufacturers who produce goods in the United States.\n  Cutting taxes for domestic manufacturers will help prevent layoffs. \nIt will help. It will not solve the entire problem, but it is going to \ncertainly help. It will help preserve jobs, and this bill is paid for. \nIt will not contribute to the deficit. It thus will not raise interest \nrates. It thus will not levy that hidden tax of higher borrowing costs \nfor business.\n  This is an important bill. It comes none too soon. American \nmanufacturing is calling out for help. This bill is part of the answer.\n  To ensure continued prosperity and well-being, the American economy \nneeds to start growing again, and this bill is part of that solution.\n  This bill is an important first step to address the economic \ncircumstances in which we find our country. Over the days to come, I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this bill. I particularly \nthank the chairman of the committee, Chairman Grassley, who has done a \nterrific job in putting this bill together in a way that focuses \ndirectly on the problem.\n  We know we are here in large respect because of the WTO ruling which \nsays we must repeal the so-called FSC/ETI regime because it is WTO \nillegal and replace it with a system that helps our domestic \nmanufacturers in a way that is legal under WTO. There are various ways \nto fashion a replacement bill, and the other body has a replacement \nbill which gives the break to American corporations, C corporations, \nbig corporations. We have a different bill. Our bill says if you are a \nC corporation, if you are an S corporation, sole proprietorship, \npartnership--whatever--if you manufacture products domestically in the \nUnited States of America, whether you export is irrelevant. You get the \nsame reduction in your tax rate. That is to help small business as well \nas big business. So business together across the board is helped, not \njust big business.\n  We all know that is important because most new jobs are created by \nsmall businesses. There are many more small business people in this \ncountry than there are big business. Small business tends to be more \ncreative in creating new jobs and expanding rather than big \ncorporations.\n  I will stop here. There is much more to say about this bill.\n  One final point. I mentioned it is paid for. It is paid for by \nmeasures which in themselves should be good public policy and we should \npass, anyway. What are they? They are corporate tax loophole closures. \nThey are shelters legislation. They are post-Enron provisions that have \nnot yet been enacted into law. There is something else called silos, to \nshut down another abusive international transaction.\n  Not only is this bill paid for, it is paid for in ways that will help \nrestore consumer and investment confidence in American business which, \nin and of itself, will help create and keep jobs in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have a few more comments I would like \nto make about this bill. I hope, though, we can get an agreement put \ntogether, a list of several amendments that would then be in order. I \nknow various Senators and leadership are now discussing that. It would \nbe my hope we could reach that agreement fairly soon so we can get on \nwith this bill.\n  Let me just discuss for a few minutes what this JOBS bill is really \nall about. It is a bill which the Finance Committee reported last \nNovember. It is something we simply must pass due to the WTO decision. \nI hope we can get it enacted into law as soon as possible.\n  I think this bill is important for three reasons. First of all, it \nwill cut taxes for domestic manufacturers. That is important. The bill \nwill also simplify taxes for American companies operating overseas. \nThat, too, is important. And it will bring us into compliance with an \nunfavorable ruling of the World Trade Organization--no small matter. \nThe JOBS bill, the bill before us, reduces the tax rate for domestic \nmanufacturers by 3 percentage points. So if you are in the top bracket, \nit is 3 percentage points. If you are a company or corporation in a \nlower bracket, it is still about the same. Actually, it is a 9-percent \ndeduction for the cost of producing or manufacturing products in the \nUnited States, which translates to about a 3-point reduction. Cutting \ntaxes for domestic manufacturers will help prevent layoffs. It will \nhelp preserve jobs. As we all know, this country has lost 3 million--\nthink of that, 3 million--manufacturing jobs since July of 2000. That \nis net loss. We have lost a lot more and gained some, but the net loss \nis 3 million manufacturing jobs lost since July of 2000.\n  When I talk to manufacturers in my home State, as I know the \nPresiding Officer does in her own State, they say the rising cost of \ndoing business is one of the biggest impediments to business. It is a \nbig problem business has. By cutting the cost of doing business, this \nbill will help alleviate the job loss.\n  This bill will help companies do their job. This bill helps small \nbusinesses as well as larger businesses. The Tax Code treats different \nkinds of businesses differently, as we all know. C corporations, as you \nwell know, are companies that exist as a separate entity from their \nowners, thus limiting the owners' liability. The corporations can be \nliable for various actions, but the stockholders themselves, the \nowners, are not. That is the reason why companies organize themselves, \nvery often, in that manner.\n  This chart shows about 26 percent of companies in the United States \nare organized as C corporations; that is, they limit their owners' \nliability, the shareholders themselves. The owners are not liable.\n  Sole proprietorships and partnerships are businesses where the owners \nof the\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nbusiness are fully liable for its debts. S corporations are smaller \nbusinesses that are incorporated for liability purposes but taxed as a \npartnership. The S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships \nare collectively known as passthrough entities. These are generally \nsmaller businesses, while C corporations are larger concerns.\n  Why do I mention all of that? I mention all that because, as I \nearlier stated, about a quarter of companies are organized as C \ncorporations, but about three-quarters of American companies are \norganized differently, either as sole proprietorships, as partnerships, \nor as S corporations. We want to make sure that not just standard, \ngarden-variety C corporations get the benefit of this bill but that all \ncompanies that manufacture domestically get the benefit of this bill, \nso we have changed the underlying bill.\n  Currently, today, under the FSC/ETI regime, which has been declared \nillegal by the WTO, the C corporations are the ones that get the \nbenefit of the tax break. It helps them export products overseas. But \nin the Finance Committee, we felt, not just big companies but all \ncompanies should get the benefit of reduced taxes.\n  Nearly three-fourths of the manufacturers in this country are S \ncorporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. About three-\nquarters of all new jobs that are created are by these small \nbusinesses. This chart shows that. About one-half of all employees in \nthis country are employed not by big C corporations, they are employed \nby the other passthrough entities I mentioned. About three-quarters of \nall the jobs created and held in the United States are not by the big \ncompanies but by all the other smaller companies.\n  That is why we have extended this bill to include so-called \npassthrough entities. Our smaller businesses are the backbone of my \nState's economy and certainly the backbone of the economy of the \nPresiding Officer's State. I think they deserve tax relief just as much \nas larger businesses do.\n  In addition, by including partnerships and sole proprietorships, more \nof our agricultural producers will become eligible for this tax relief.\n  The JOBS bill that is before us also includes long overdue \ninternational tax reform. We are not just talking about the domestic \nmanufacturing reduction rate; we are also talking about international \ntax simplification. That is for bigger American companies that do \noperate overseas. We want to make sure our American companies are \ncompeting on equal ground with rivals from other countries. One way to \ndo that is to limit double taxation. When our companies are taxed \ntwice, that makes them less competitive. We have included international \ntax simplification and reform provisions that will help American \ncompanies compete with foreign companies overseas.\n  A number of provisions will help companies better utilize their \nforeign tax credits. Foreign tax credits prevent income from being \ntaxed twice. There is a repatriation provision that encourages \ncompanies to bring back overseas profits for investments in the United \nStates. There is also a provision that will ease the tax compliance \nburden for small businesses looking to gain access to overseas markets. \nThese are worthwhile, and they are measures that will help restore \nfairness and integrity to our American tax system.\n  As I mentioned, the bill repeals the current FSC/ETI laws. Why? To \nbring us into compliance with WTO obligations. Our bill replaces a tax \nincentive that was dependent on exports with a tax incentive that is \nnot dependent on exports. A company can utilize this tax benefit in \nthis bill whether the product it manufacturers is exported. So long as \nit is manufactured in the United States, that company qualifies. We \nwill partially offset the loss of tax benefits to U.S. exporting \ncompanies, therefore, by the repeal of the current law, which I said is \ninconsistent with WTO, and will also provide benefits to all American \nmanufacturers, providing a needed boost to our economy.\n  Another point: This legislation is completely paid for. Repealing the \nold FSC/ETI regime will cover most of the cost for the new tax \nincentive. By repealing the current law, that almost pays for what we \nare doing here.\n  The international provisions are paid for; that is, the additional \nprovisions of the bill are paid for with offsets that curb abusive tax \nshelters. We have offsets in this bill. They will not just create \nrevenue, but they are also good provisions, good tax policy in and of \nthemselves--clamping down on shelters, the inversions provisions, post-\nEnron reforms, something else called SILOs, which is a gimmick, \nfrankly, that international American companies are using to shelter \ntheir income. All that is shut down, and that pays for the rest of the \nbill. Again, these shelter provisions are absolutely critical to be \nenacted.\n  Let me mention in a little bit more detail the three reasons for \nsupporting this bill. I mentioned it is fully offset and the revenue \ngoes to manufacturing. I think that is a principle we should maintain. \nWe should not put incentives in this bill or change this bill in a way \nthat deviates from that. We should also not change this bill in any way \nthat reduces or diminishes stopping the abuses of tax shelters. That is \na principle we should absolutely maintain.\n  I might say something about our budget deficit. Our current budget \ndeficit is projected at about $521 billion this year. We all know that \nis basically an understatement. It is going to be much worse. Why? \nBecause the administration's budget, as well as the budget resolution \npending in the Senate Budget Committee, does not include several \nfactors which more accurately reflect the true deficit our country is \nfacing. What are those? First, both the budgets of the administration \nand the Budget Committee, which will be coming before the floor on \nMonday, will not include the cost of the war in Iraq. It will not \ninclude war costs. In fact, defense spending is going to be cut a \nlittle bit. One might wonder why, when costs are going up. My guess is \nthe administration will come back with a supplemental next year with a \nbig increase in Iraq costs and war costs. This budget does not include \nthat and it should. That would be more honest.\n  Second, the budget does not include the cost of making expiring tax \ncuts permanent. That is the view of the administration, that they \nshould be permanent. The budget does not include that.\n  It doesn't include providing alternative minimum tax relief. We all \nknow this Congress is going to have to enact alternative minimum tax \nrelief soon, and it is very expensive. That also is not included, to \nsay nothing of the cost of paying for the baby boomers when they start \nto retire in the not too distant future.\n  Deficits are going to be a lot larger than contemplated in either the \nadministration budget or the budget resolution that will come to the \nfloor.\n  I say that because it is all the more reason why this bill must be \nbudget neutral. I say that also because there are other Members of \nCongress who have a different view about that. They would not like this \nto be budget neutral. They would like there to be further tax cuts but \nnot paid for. I think that is not wise. Frankly, psychologically, as \nwell as actually, the American people will appreciate us having a \nbudget-neutral bill and trying to work toward a balanced budget. That \nmeans people around the country are saying those guys and gals in \nWashington maybe have their heads screwed on straight. Maybe they are \ndoing something right back there. Maybe they are not frittering away \ntaxpayer money.\n\n  The more we do what is right, by keeping this budget neutral, not \nsuccumbing to the siren song of lowering taxes but not paying for them, \nthe better off we will be in so many respects.\n  Another point: We have a heck of a job ahead of us, a huge challenge. \nWhat is it? It is how to create more jobs in America, how to keep jobs \nin America, and how to help those who have lost jobs--no easy task. It \nis extremely difficult. We all know the statistics. Three million \nmanufacturing jobs lost in the last several years. We have to do \nsomething about that. The real question is, what do we do? What is the \nright thing to do? Some say it is OK. That is the way things are. That \nis international competition. That is globalization. It just happens. \nIn the long run we are all better off. Some say that.\n  Essentially that was a statement of Mr. Mankiw the other day that has \nbeen bandied about so much. He said that is the way it is. There will \nbe new\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\ntechnologies. Companies will be able to compete better. They have to \nlower their costs, and they can lower their costs if they can compete \nany place in the world. If that means jobs overseas, lowering costs, \nthat makes American companies more competitive.\n  I have a different view. I think we have to face up to the challenge \nof creating more jobs and retraining Americans so they can have jobs, \nand keeping those jobs in America. That is, we cannot be passive. We \nhave two choices: try or do nothing.\n  I say we try to create more jobs in America; we try to keep more jobs \nin America; we try to retrain people and help people who have lost \njobs. We have to do something about it.\n  The administration thus far has been passive. It has gone AWOL. It \ndoes not seem to really care. I do not see any affirmative programs to \ncreate jobs in America. We need them. It is a hugely complex problem in \nboth the short term and long term. In the long term, it is education--\nscience, math, engineering. Did you know we don't graduate nearly as \nmany engineers as does Japan, Europe? And China graduates about three \ntimes the number of engineers we do. Did you know that? How long can we \ncontinue that? In the long term, we cannot. It is unsustainable.\n  I must also say the amount of financial aid or the amount of support \nin basic research has dropped tremendously in America. The number of \nengineers who graduate in America is now about 30 percent less than it \nwas not too many years ago. The figure is worse than that. We are not \ngoing to be able to compete in the long run if we continue that. It \ncan't be done. There are lots of other long-term measures we have to \nundertake.\n  There are also in the midterm things we could be doing and we are \nnot. What are they? No. 1, we are not opening foreign markets. Look at \nIndia, look at other countries in the world that are closed to America, \nparticularly the country of India. We hear about all the call centers \ngoing to India. We don't hear about goods being exported to India for a \nvery good reason: India is by and large closed. They are closed to \nintellectual property rights, closed to so many markets, so many \nproducts. India is closed. What are we doing about that? Not much.\n  The same can be said for other countries--China. Remember the WTO? \nThey are a member of the WTO. We gave them PNTR. China has a lot more \nto do.\n  What are we doing in trade? Basically looking to countries--with no \ndisrespect--such as Bahrain and Morocco. These smaller countries don't \nhave huge commercial benefit to the United States. It is easier to \nreach trade agreements with those countries. It is much more difficult \nto go after where the real problem is. As I mentioned, this country is \nnot doing that, and it should do that. It should start working more \naggressively to open markets so we can sell products overseas. When we \nstart selling products overseas, that means more jobs in America. It is \npretty doggone simple, but it is not being done.\n  I might also add that there are other things we could be doing that \nwe are not doing. I mentioned education. We are cutting education in \nthis country. We are not fully financing No Child Left Behind. How are \nwe going to compete in the world if we don't give full due to \neducation? We have all gone overseas and visited high schools in \ncountries worldwide. I have. The graduates in Pusan, Korea, are bright \nas the dickens, and they are hungry.\n  We have great schools and great teachers. But there is so much more \nwe can do. In my State--and this may be true in other States--teachers \nare leaving because their salaries are so low. They cannot teach. A lot \nof schools in the country are cutting back on gifted children programs. \nThey don't have any money. Why are we cutting back on gifted kids? That \ncertainly helps all kids, including the underprivileged.\n  Madam President, I will yield the floor because I see our Democratic \nleader in the Chamber. He has a lot to tell us. Certainly, it will add \nimmensely to this discussion. I urge us to think critically about the \nreal problem. We cannot close our borders and put our heads in the \nsand. We have to meet this challenge head on. This is part of that \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Montana \nfor his words. I have not heard all of his remarks this morning, but I \ncould not agree more that this is a problem that has to be addressed \nhead on. As he noted, this legislation gives us an opportunity to do \nso. It may not be the ultimate solution, but it is a critical building \nblock in our effort to restore the economy and create new jobs.\n  I hope that very shortly we can get on with the debate. We had an \nagreement not to offer amendments, of course, until people have had a \nchance to make opening statements. I intend to make a short one. I hope \nin the not too distant future we can begin the real debate. We don't \nhave a lot of time. We have 3 days. Senator Frist is right that we have \na lot to do in a short period of time. If we are going to maximize the \nuse of these 3 days, it is time to get on with amendments. I know \nSenator Hatch is prepared to offer the first one. We hope that \ncertainly before the end of this noon hour, we will have offered the \nfirst amendment.\n   Mr. President, these are very difficult times for millions of \nAmerican families.\n   Nine million Americans can't find jobs. We have the highest long-\nterm unemployment rate in 20 years. And in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, our \neconomy has lost 2.9 million jobs; 2.8 million of those jobs were \nmanufacturing jobs.\n   These aren't abstract numbers. They have real world, dramatic \nimpacts in South Dakota and across our country. And the millions of \naffected families are looking to us for answers. They don't want hand-\nouts; they want jobs.\n   Unfortunately, American has lost manufacturing jobs every month \nsince this administration took office--every single month. This is \nunprecedented. It's also dangerous for our economy.\n   Manufacturing is more productive, it pays higher wages, and provides \nmore benefits than other sectors of the economy. Manufacturing jobs are \nthe kind of jobs you can raise a family on. They're the kind of jobs \nthat make it possible for middle-class families to put their kids \nthrough college, and put something away for retirement.\n   We have clear choices in facing this problem. We can let jobs move \noverseas--or we can fight to keep them here. We can try to create jobs \nhere, or we can do nothing in the face of globalization.\n   We can provide help for workers who are losing their jobs, or we can \nlook the other way. And we can strengthen worker protections, or we can \nstrip away overtime and other benefits that have been a hallmark of the \nAmerican workplace.\n   A couple of weeks ago, President Bush and his economic advisors \nweighted in on this issue and told Americans it was a good idea to ship \njobs overseas and we ought not worry about it. I don't see it that way, \nand I know people in South Dakota don't see it that way. And we need to \ndo something about it.\n  Today's legislation is the second step in this process. The first \nstep was the creation and the passage of a very important highway bill, \nwhich will create hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new jobs \nover the course of the next 6 years. This is the second step.\n  The foreign sales corporation regime was created to counterbalance \nprovisions in the Tax Code that create incentives to move operations \noverseas. It provided tax advantages for American companies that keep \ntheir jobs in America and ship their products overseas.\n  But the World Trade Organization has decided that these advantages \nwere an unfair subsidy and needed to be eliminated. And if they weren't \neliminated, international sanctions would follow. Those sanctions \nkicked in beginning March 1.\n  The question before us is what to replace the old export tax regime \nwith?\n  The Bush administration is completely focused on overseas activities \nand has proposed nothing to encourage manufacturing job creation at \nhome.\n  But thanks to Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, we have another \nsolution before us.\n  The centerpiece of their legislation is creating tax incentives for \nmanufacturers that will keep and create good jobs in America. Their \nproposal is one of the most important opportunities we\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\nwill have this year to begin addressing America's manufacturing crisis.\n  Just as importantly, this bill gives us an overdue opportunity to do \nmore.\n  We need to accelerate and increase domestic manufacturing tax \nincentives, and establish a strong job creation tax credit.\n  We need to prohibit tax deductions for outsourcing expenses, and \nrequire notice to employees about outsourcing plans. Every community \nhas a right to know how many employees are losing their jobs, why then \nare losing their jobs, and where those jobs are being sent.\n  We need to restrict outsourcing of government contracts.\n  We need to help workers who are hurt by outsourcing, and make sure \nthey have access to training and health care while they get back on \ntheir feet.\n  And we need to reverse some of the Bush administration's worst \npolicies--like eliminating overtime for 8 million workers, including \nveterans who have been given training in the military and are now \nineligible for overtime pay as a result of this regulation. We need to \ndo that. American workers have the same rights they have always had. \nThat fact needs to be reemphasized with the legislation we will offer \non this bill.\n  We can't wait until next year to make these improvements. Millions of \nAmerican families need them today. And I have seen firsthand, in South \nDakota, why this is so important.\n  I recently toured a manufacturing plant in Sioux Falls. Graco \nIncorporated is the world's leading manufacturer of fluid-handling \nsystems and equipment. They've been in business for 78 years. They \nemploy about 165 people.\n  The plant manager showed me two, nearly identical parts. The first \nwas made in Sioux Falls. The other--made overseas--wasn't quite as \nhigh-quality, but it cost a little less because the people who made it \nwere paid less, with no benefits.\n  The manager showed me those two parts. Then he introduced me to the \nworkers who would lose their jobs if Graco took the easy, offshoring \nroute. He said, ``I don't want to be the one to have to tell them they \ndon't have jobs anymore.''\n  The people at Graco are resisting the temptation to export their \nworkers' jobs. They're doing everything they can think of to be good, \nresponsible corporate citizens of my State. The last thing the Federal \nGovernment should do is make that job any harder.\n  Our responsibility is to make it easier for Graco and thousands of \nother companies to keep and create jobs here at home.\n  As I said, this bill is one step in a long process. By itself, it \nwill not completely reverse the unpredecented decline in American \nmanufacturing that has occurred since 2001. That will require a \ncomprehensive plan and sustained bipartisan cooperation over a period \nof time.\n  In the short term, we have to work together to restore fiscal sanity \nto the budget.\n  The Federal deficit this year will be half-a-trillion dollars--with \nno end in sight to the red ink. This debt could cripple our economy and \ndestroy our children's future.\n\n  In the longer term, our Government should assist people with \neducation and training so they can seize the opportunities that rapid \nchange creates. We need to help people who are displaced by change, and \nwe need to make sure America remains on the cutting edge of innovation.\n  The administration is not facing either of these challenges. We have \nthe largest budget deficits in all of American history, and the \nadministration is drastically underfunding training and education.\n  The President's budget recommends $9.3 billion less for the \nPresident's own educational reform plan than the new law calls for.\n  By choosing tax cuts for those at the top over assistance for States, \nthe President has forced drastic increases in tuition at public \ncolleges and universities.\n  The administration has fought Democratic efforts to help dislocated \nworkers upgrade their skills at community colleges.\n  At a time when other countries are feverishly trying to challenge \nAmerica's preeminence in critical technology, the administration, \nthrough neglect and politicization has weakened America's science and \ntechnology infrastructure and undercut America's scientific edge.\n  The decline in American manufacturing isn't just happening on \nPresident Bush's watch. It is happening in part because of President \nBush's policies.\n  Our choices are clear. We can follow the administration's path and \nmake it easier and cheaper for companies to ship American jobs \noverseas, or we can fight to keep good jobs in America. We can turn our \nback on millions of workers and families who cannot find jobs, or we \ncan help them get back on their feet and get back to work.\n  It is our hope that, in a bipartisan way, we can find ways to ensure \nthat these goals can be achieved, not only with this legislation but \ncertainly beginning with the amendments we will offer throughout the \ndebate on this bill and hopefully with final passage accorded this \nlegislation someday soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the distinguished Democratic leader \nleaves the floor, I would like, through you, to pose this to him: We \nhave been here now for approximately 2 hours on this very important \nlegislation. The Democratic leader has talked about how important it \nis, the distinguished chairman of the committee has talked about how \nimportant it is, our ranking member has talked about how important it \nis, and we are doing nothing. We have a gentleman's agreement that this \nwould be for debate only, but I think the Democratic leader would agree \nwith me, and I think everybody should be put on notice that this cannot \ngo on all day long, that this is ridiculous; would the Senator agree to \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I respond to the Senator from Nevada, \nthe distinguished assistant Democratic leader, that the schedule is \nclear. We have this afternoon, we have tomorrow, and, let's face it, \nhonestly, we only have Friday morning, and we will be under great \npressure, I am sure, not to have any amendments offered beyond \nmidmorning on Friday.\n  So for all intents and purposes, we have a little bit more than a day \nto debate this critical legislation prior to the time the majority \nleader has already indicated we are going to be moving to the budget, \nsetting aside this legislation.\n  We are going to be assessed $4 billion in tariffs beginning this week \nif we do not correct the current situation. So this legislation is \nurgent. It needs to be addressed.\n  I think we have some very critical amendments that ought to be \noffered in this very narrow window to accommodate concerns on both \nsides of the aisle. I hope we can do so. Frankly, as the Senator \nsuggests with his question, we need to do it soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is true also, is it not, that we have \nmade--and I would like to hear the Democratic leader respond to this--a \nfair response? The majority has an amendment they want to offer, \nsponsored by Senator Hatch, dealing with extension of some tax credits. \nWe then said we would like to offer an amendment to stop what--it is \nnot a crime but it is close to it in our country today with all the \noutsourcing of all these contracts, and we want to make sure the U.S. \nGovernment contracts are not outsourced unless there are certain \nlimitations placed upon them.\n  Then they would come back with another amendment sponsored by Senator \nBunning. Then we would come back with another amendment sponsored by \nSenator Harkin dealing with overtime, and this is no secret; this is an \nissue about which we have great concern as to what the administration \nis doing with American workers with overtime.\n  Is there anything in this agreement the Democratic leader sees that \nshould prevent us from moving forward on this critical legislation? We \nhave even agreed to time limits; is that not true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada is correct. We have agreed with \nour Republican colleagues to limit the amount of time devoted to each \nof these amendments.\n  I see the distinguished chair of the Finance Committee, and it looks \nas if\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nhe may be about to propound a unanimous consent request. Perhaps we can \nyield the floor to accommodate his interests in doing so. I think we \nall hope to achieve the same goal. Let's move this bill forward. Let's \nhave a good debate about amendments, up or down, and let's see if we \ncan complete our work on this legislation in a timely way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask the following unanimous consent \nrequest. We have perfecting amendments that have been cleared on both \nsides. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the first-degree and \nsecond-degree perfecting amendments that are at the desk be considered \nand agreed to en bloc and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; provided further that the committee substitute be agreed to \nand considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the next first-degree amendments in \norder be the following: a Senator Hatch and Senator Murray amendment on \nR, with a Bingaman second-degree amendment which is relevant to the \nfirst degree; then Senator Dodd dealing with outsourcing; then Senator \nBunning and Senator Stabenow dealing with accelerating manufacturers' \ntax cut; and then the fourth amendment will be Senator Daschle or his \ndesignee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right object, I wish to \nexpress my appreciation to the chairman of the committee. He, in the \nstatement he has made so far, along with the ranking member, \nunderscored the importance of moving this legislation, and this is \nmovement in that direction.\n  As we indicated in the dialog between Senator Daschle and this \nSenator, we will agree on time limits anytime the Senator wants to work \nsomething out in that regard. We will be happy to do that. This is a \nvery good first step, and we do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2646) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment (No. 2645), as amended, was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we now have an amendment that will be \noffered as soon as Senator Hatch arrives. Senator Byrd saw we were not \ndoing a lot on the floor, and he asks, through me, that he be able to \nspeak for up to 20 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I feel as if I owe that to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia because I already made arrangements for him to speak \nbefore we completed this agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I propound that in the form of a unanimous \nconsent request, with the understanding that the first amendment be \noffered as soon as he finishes. That will be good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip \nand I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for his \ncourtesy.\n\n\n          Independent Commissions on National Security Issues\n\n  Most of us are familiar with the Aesop's fables, having read some of \nthem at one or more times during our lives. Aesop once told the story \nof a jaybird that ventured into a yard where peacocks used to walk. \nThere the jay found a number of feathers fallen from the majestic birds \nwhen they had last molted. He tied them all to his tail and strutted \ntoward the peacocks. His cheat was quickly discovered, and the peacocks \nharassed the imposter until all his borrowed plumes had fallen away. \nWhen the jay could do no more than return to his own kind, having \nwatched him from afar, they were equally affronted by the jay's \nactions.\n  The moral of the story, said Aesop, is that it takes more than just \nfine feathers to make fine birds.\n  It is an age-old lesson that the Congress should hold in its mind as \nwe consider how best to investigate the distorted and misleading \nintelligence that the administration used to build its case for war in \nIraq.\n  On February 6, the President announced the creation of his own \ncommission to investigate our intelligence agencies to find out, in the \nwords of Dr. David Kay, why we were almost all wrong about the \nadministration's prewar claims of huge Iraqi stockpiles of weapons of \nmass destruction. If Congress is serious about getting to the bottom of \nthis apparent intelligence failure and the administration's rush to \nwar, we must realize that once stripped of its dazzling plumage, the \nWhite House proposal for its own so-called independent commission is a \nreal, honest to goodness turkey. It is not only fine feathers that make \nfine birds.\n  The President has described the panel that he created as being an \nindependent commission. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. \nThis commission is 100 percent under the thumb of the White House. Who \ncreated the panel's charter? The President. Who chooses the panel \nmembers? The President. To whom does the panel report? The President. \nWhom shall the panel advise and assist? The President. Who is in charge \nof determining what classified reports the panel may see? The \nPresident. Who gets to decide whether the Congress may see the panel's \nreport? The President.\n  To describe this commission as independent is to turn that word's \ndefinition on its head. In fact, the deeper one delves into the text of \nthe Executive order that creates the President's so-called independent \ncommission, the more one finds that the commission is ill-equipped to \ndiscover just what went wrong with the prewar intelligence on Iraq.\n  At first glance, the charter of the President's commission appears \nvery broad. It is to assess whether the intelligence community of the \nUnited States is sufficiently authorized, organized, equipped, trained, \nand resourced to tackle the threats of terrorism and weapons of mass \ndestruction. As part of that goal, the commission is to compare prewar \nintelligence on Iraq with what has so far been discovered.\n  That mission sounds like a mouthful, but it really misses the point \nof why the American people are calling for a commission to investigate \nin this matter.\n  The public has a right to know why our intelligence on Iraq was so \nwrong, how the administration may have misrepresented its intelligence, \nwho is going to be held accountable for misleading our country into \nwar, and what will be done to fix the problems with our intelligence. \nThose are exactly the questions an independent intelligence panel \nshould be investigating, and yet the President's commission only skirts \nthose key issues.\n  What is more, even though the President promised that his commission \nwill investigate current intelligence on North Korea, Iran, and \nPakistan, his Executive order, in fact, does not bother to direct the \ncommission to review intelligence on those countries. Instead, the \nPresident's Executive order directs the commission to focus its \nenergies on Libya and Afghanistan. Libya and Afghanistan are not \ncountries that the President has labeled as part of his axis of evil. A \nreal independent intelligence commission would shine new light on how \nwe assess the threats of North Korea and Iran, not be distracted by \nsideshows that will keep the commission busy until March 31, 2005.\n  The President has carefully drafted this Executive order to allow \nhimself to serve as the gatekeeper on what information the so-called \nindependent commission might have access to. While the President \ndirects Federal agencies to cooperate with this commission, he also has \ncreated a giant loophole that would prevent the most important \nintelligence products from being read by his commission.\n\n  The Executive order reads as follows: The President may at any time \nmodify the security rules or procedures of the commission to provide \nthe necessary protection to classified information.\n  I was born at night but not last night. All of America knows that the \nWhite House is in a dispute with the September 11 Commission over \nintelligence reports that were read by the President. The commission \nwants\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nthem. The White House will not give them. The Executive order drafted \nby the President to create an intelligence commission makes sure that \nhis own commission will never see documents that the President does not \nwant them to see.\n  At least the 9/11 Commission has the power to issue subpoenas for \ncritical information. The President's intelligence commission does not \neven have that power. The deck is being stacked against a full and open \ninquiry on the prewar intelligence on Iraq. Congress is not even \nassured of having access to the commission's report.\n  The President has required that the commission send its report to him \nin March 2005 and then within 90 days the President will consult with \nthe Congress concerning the commission's report and recommendations.\n  Why can the Congress not simply read the commission's report? Why \nshould the White House be given the opportunity to reword, reshape, \nredact, or even flat out censor the so-called independent commission's \nreport before Congress can get their hands on it?\n  It is quite possible that if this so-called independent commission is \nallowed to proceed as the President has directed, Congress will never \nhave the chance to review the commission's work.\n  Tucked away in the President's Executive order is a provision that \nintends to exempt this commission from judicial review. Let us not \nforget that the Office of the Vice President fought tooth and nail in \nFederal courts, and is still doing so, to keep the General Accounting \nOffice, an arm of the Congress, from learning about the meetings of the \nVice President's energy task force.\n  Could this provision be an attempt to hide the work of the \nPresident's intelligence commission from Congress? I would not put such \na scheme beyond the White House, which has already demonstrated its \nzeal for secrecy.\n  The administration's case for war in Iraq appears to have been built \nupon cherry-picked intelligence, produced and massaged to hype the \nAmerican people into going along with a war of choice. The President's \nso-called independent commission would allow the White House to do the \nexact same number on the commission's report as it did on prewar \nintelligence and analysis; namely, pick out only the parts that it \nwants the public to see and bury the rest.\n  It is bitter irony that a report on whether the administration \ncovered up evidence that contradicted a rush to war might itself be \ncovered up under the terms of the President's Executive order.\n  So what is next? An independent commission to investigate the \nPresident's own commission? Is that so? I wonder. Let us not make the \nmistake of ignoring the shortcomings of the White House's version of an \nintelligence commission on Iraq, only to be haunted by those problems \nlater.\n  The revelation by Dr. Kay that he does not believe any stockpiles of \nweapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq has dealt a blow to the \nPresident's case for war. It has shaken the American people's faith in \ntheir Government. We owe it to the American people to get to the bottom \nof what went wrong with our intelligence agencies and whether the \nadministration misused the intelligence that it was provided.\n  The President has simultaneously promised a commission to investigate \nthese matters and stacked the deck against the independence of his very \nown panel. That is not the right way to gain the confidence of the \nAmerican people in their Government. It is yet another in a string of \nattempts by this White House to mislead the American people on issues \nof national security.\n  Congress must step in and correct the grievous error that the \nPresident has made in creating a commission that is not equipped \nproperly to do its job. Congress should use the independent 9/11 \nCommission, a commission that has shown itself to be fair, independent, \nand bipartisan, as a starting point for how to create an independent \npanel to investigate the Iraq intelligence failures. If the \nadministration is serious about getting to the bottom of this debacle, \nthis new commission might even be created in just a matter of days.\n  The American people deserve answers on why the administration relied \non faulty intelligence to take this country to war without presence of \nan imminent threat. A commission that is designed to keep the inquiry \nunder the thumb of the same White House that misled Congress and the \npublic about the nature of the threat from Saddam Hussein will never be \nable to operate independently. So Congress should not allow the \nPresident to get away with posting a fox at the door to the hen house.\n  The structure of the 9/11 Commission is a solid foundation upon which \nto conduct an inquiry into the administration's prewar intelligence \nclaims. The 9/11 Commission has been doing yeoman's work in digging \ninto all of the events that led up to those catastrophic attacks on New \nYork and Washington. In fact, the only real problem that the 9/11 \nCommission has faced is the lack of cooperation from the White House.\n  After refusing to meet with the full membership of the 9/11 \nCommission, the President and Vice President have reluctantly proposed \nto meet only with the chairman and vice chairman of the panel. And for \nhow long? Just 1 hour.\n  The National Security Adviser has flatly refused to participate in \nany public discussions with the Commission. The White House position on \ndealing with the 9/11 Commission is so unreasonable that the \nadministration is drawing criticism from both sides of that panel. \nThere is even talk that former Senator Bob Kerrey, who once served as \nChairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, could resign because of \nthe administration's refusal to let the Commission do its work. What \ncould possibly be the reason for this stonewalling by the White House?\n  It is as if a whole swath of the Washington establishment has \ncompletely forgotten the horror of the terrorist attacks that killed \n3,000 innocent people. But the American people have not forgotten. The \nAmerican people have their priorities straight. They place getting at \nthe truth of how that tragedy was carried out above election year \npolitics.\n  Enough with the stonewalling. Enough with the foot dragging. Enough \nwith the election year politics. The Senate acted correctly a few days \nago to extend the life of the 9/11 Commission so that it can get its \nwork done, and the House should promptly follow suit. Now Congress \nshould act quickly to create an independent Iraq intelligence \ncommission. The confidence of the American people in their Government, \nthe people's government, hangs in the balance.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2647\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Smith, Mr. Bunning, and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 2647.\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is an \nimportant and appropriate one for any bill that has the word ``jobs'' \nin its title. It is a bill to extend and expand a tax provision that is \ncentral to creating and retaining U.S. jobs--the research credit. I am \njoined in this effort by Senators Murray, Baucus, Cantwell, Smith, \nBunning, and Grassley.\n   This bipartisan amendment will help to ensure that businesses \ncontinue to increase research activities--and to create new jobs--in \nthe United States. As many of our colleagues are aware, the current \nresearch credit expires in just a few weeks, on June 30, 2004.\n   I believe that if we fail to act to extend this credit, we surely \nwill see the negative effects manifest in lower economic growth, fewer \njobs, fewer innovative products, and opportunities lost as research is \ntaken from this country to other nations that offer more attractive \nincentives.\n   Our colleagues many times have expressed their resounding support \nfor the research credit and I hope they will again. This amendment not \nonly would extend the credit for 18 months, until December 31, 2005, \nbut also would allow businesses to choose a new way to calculate the \ncredit so that more research-intensive companies can lower their costs \nof U.S.-based research activities.\n  The American taxpayer relies on us to make the right policy choices \nfor the long-term health of our economy. We have faced and are still \nfacing major challenges both to our national security and to our \neconomic security. Time and again we have looked to the industries on \nthe cutting edge of new and improved technologies to help us meet those \nchallenges.\n   My home State of Utah is a good example of how State economies \nbenefit from the research tax credit. Utah is home to a large number of \nfirms that invest a high percentage of their revenue on research and \ndevelopment.\n   In Utah, 5 percent of the workers--51,000 people--work in the \nresearch-intensive high technology sector. That includes over 10,000 \npeople working just to design computer systems, and over 6,000 \nproducing medical equipment. And there is a lot of R taking place \noutside of Utah's high-tech sector.\n\n  Just to give one example, more than 7,000 people work in Utah's \nchemical industry, and workers in that industry benefit from research \nand development taking place in Utah and throughout the country. \nAerospace and the pharmaceutical industries are two more examples of \nbig Utah employer groups that reap the benefits of R\n  I want Utah companies to be able to buy better manufacturing \nequipment, more reliable electronics, and have access to more efficient \nquality control techniques. The workers who use new inventions will get \njust as many benefits as workers who create those new inventions. And \nthe evidence clearly shows, that the research credit will increase \ninnovation.\n  In short, there are tens of thousands of employees working in Utah's \nthousands of technology based companies, with tens of thousands more \nworking in other sectors that engage in R Beyond that, practically \nall of Utah's hundreds of thousands of workers benefit from higher \nproductivity coming from the innovations that researchers both inside \nand outside of Utah produce. Research and development is clearly the \nlifeblood of our economy throughout the Nation.\n  Since 1981, when the research credit was first enacted, the Federal \nGovernment has joined in partnership with businesses, large and small, \nin those industries to ensure that the research dollars were expended \nin the United States so that the jobs were created here. We as a nation \nhave reaped the benefits of that research.\n  It seems clear to me that if we want to keep our Nation and our \neconomy strong and growing, it is vital that we maintain and even \nenhance our position as the world leader in technological advances. Our \nNation simply must continue to invest in research and development, \nespecially in the private sector. And, the Federal Government must \naffirm its role as a partner in those private-sector endeavors.\n  I believe the best way to ensure that private-sector investment in \nR continues at the health rate needed to fuel further productivity \ngains is to extend the current-law research credit and make that credit \nmore widely available. Ideally, the credit should be made permanent.\n  I have long advocated a permanent credit and this body is \noverwhelmingly on record for a permanent research credit. During the \nSenate's debate on the 2001 tax cut bill, I offered an amendment to \nprovide for such a permanent credit that the Senate adopted. \nUnfortunately, that provision was dropped in conference and we lost a \ngreat opportunity.\n  Given our budget deficit situation, I do not believe it is possible \npolitically to make the research credit permanent on this bill. \nIronically, though, a permanent credit costs no more than one that is \nregularly extended. Because of the urgency and importance of this \nmatter, however, this amendment seeks only a temporary extension.\n  Let me point out a few key points for our colleagues so they can \nunderstand the importance of the research credit. These are according \nto the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The primary category of expenditures that qualify for the research \ncredit are wages paid to employees performing research in the Unites \nStates. In 2001, more than 15,000 taxpayers claimed the research tax \ncredit--42 percent of these businesses were engaged in manufacturing.\n  However, of the total $6.5 billion in research credits claimed in \n2001, 66 percent of those dollars were claimed by manufacturers. When \nyou look at the size of the companies claiming the credit in 2001, you \nsee that 68 percent of the firms claiming it had assets of $10 million \nor less.\n  The research credit translates into real jobs in the United States \nand, as the statistics show, it is our small- and medium-size domestic \nmanufacturers that most benefit from the research credit.\n  A great deal of the reason our economy grew so rapidly in the second \nhalf of the last decade was because of a strong surge in our \nproductivity rate. This surge is continuing into the present and has \nbeen a marvel to most economists.\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  This increase in productivity has allowed the economy to continue to \ngrow at a rapid pace without the increase in inflation that usually \naccompanies such growth. Moreover, increases in productivity growth are \nthe key to future economic security, particularly in light of the huge \nentitlement challenges we face in the coming years. A very large factor \nin that productivity growth is innovation, which of course, requires \nR\n  As I mentioned, this amendment would extend the current credit until \nDecember 31, 2005, giving businesses that utilize this important \nincentive some certainty in the short-term so that they can hire the \nneeded personnel to take research activities off the drawing board now.\n  Over the years, the research credit has proven to be a powerful \nincentive for companies to increase their research and development \nactivities. Unfortunately, it does not work perfectly. Part of the \nreason is that this is an incremental credit, designed to reward extra \nresearch efforts, not just what a company might do anyway. From a good \ntax policy point of view, I believe this is the best way to provide an \nincentive tax credit.\n\n  However, it is difficult to craft an incremental credit that works as \nit should in every case. While the regular credit works very well for \nmany companies, it does not help some other firms that still incur \nsignificant research expenditures. This is because the credit's base \nperiod of 1984 through 1988 is growing more distant and some firms' \nbusiness models have changed.\n  There is no good policy reason why research should be more expensive \nfor some industries than it is for others. To partially solve this \nproblem Congress enacted the alternative incremental research credit, \nAIRC, in 1996, and now we propose a way to address the rest of that \nproblem.\n  In addition to increasing the AIRC rates, this amendment allows \ntaxpayers to elect, in lieu of the regular credit or the AIRC, an \nalternative simplified credit that is based on a rolling average of the \nprior 3 years' qualified research expenses. This provides companies \nthat are increasing their R with another way to take advantage of the \ncredit when the 20-year-old base period proves to be irrelevant.\n  This is an important amendment. It is important to our economy, both \nnow and in the future. It is important to good, high paying jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  We need to continue to be the world's leader in innovation. We cannot \nafford to allow other countries to lure away the research that has \nalways been done in the United States. We cannot afford to have the \nlapses in the research pipeline that would result if we do not take \ncare of extending this credit before it expires on June 30. I urge all \nof my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the right thing to \ndo. We have done it before. We certainly should do it now. I wish it \nwere permanent. But under the circumstances, this is the best we can \ndo. I have every confidence my fellow Members of the Senate will vote \nfor this amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I rise today to join with Senator Hatch to strengthen \nand extend the research and development tax credit. We are all \nconcerned about our slow economy. Every day we learn of more American \njobs that are being shipped overseas. We worry about American companies \nlosing out in the global marketplace and the impact that has on our \nworkers and on our economy.\n  Today, we are offering a way to fight back and help our workers and \ncompanies continue to lead the world in innovation. Today, I am proud \nto offer an amendment that will support high-wage jobs for American \nworkers at home and make our products more competitive around the \nworld.\n  Anyone who wants to support good-paying American jobs, and anyone who \nwants to help American companies compete and win in the global \nmarketplace should vote for the Hatch-Murray amendment. We all know \nresearch and development is a critical part of any business's success, \nbut investing in R is not cheap. Our foreign trade competitors offer \nsubstantial tax and financial incentives to encourage American \ncompanies to make their research investments elsewhere. But we need \nthose jobs in the United States and this amendment gives us a chance to \nsupport American workers in the face of foreign competition.\n  That is why the R tax credit is so important. It provides a real \nincentive for companies to increase their investment in U.S.-based \nresearch and development. The credit helps stimulate innovation, wages, \nand exports which all contribute to a stronger economy and a higher \nstandard of living for American workers.\n  This is about investing in America. Because this tax credit is only \navailable for R performed in the United States, it provides a \ndiscount on qualifying expenditures, and it is a proven incentive for \nU.S. companies to increase their R investment in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, the existing research and development tax credit will \nexpire this June. Unless we take action, in just a few months we will \nbe throwing away one of the best incentives for spurring investments at \nhome. I have always supported making the R tax credit permanent, but \nbecause of budget constraints, we are not in a position to do that \ntoday. But we can do the next best thing and extend and strengthen this \nincentive.\n  The Hatch-Murray amendment does three things: First, it extends the \ntraditional credit for 18 months through December 31, 2005; second, it \nincreases the alternative incremental credit rate starting in January \nof 2005; and finally, again starting in January of 2005, it provides an \nalternative simplified credit to encourage even more research-intensive \nbusinesses to spend more on research in the United States.\n  The R tax credit is a great example of how we make the Tax Code \nwork for American workers and American families right here at home.\n  I have a letter from the R Tax Credit Coalition, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this letter is actually signed by over \n500 companies and associations and urges Congress to permanently extend \nthe R tax credit and make the modifications contained in S. 664.\n  I share with my colleagues a portion of the letter:\n\n       The technological innovations made possible by the R \n     Credit enable companies to bring more products and services \n     to market, increase employment, and raise the standard of \n     living for all Americans.\n       R helps manufacturers and services companies with U.S. \n     operations maintain a competitive edge over lower-cost \n     foreign competitors.\n       It allows a small, medium or large company to reduce its \n     financial risk in expensive, labor-intensive R investments.\n       Since the credit was created in 1981, investments in \n     technology and innovation have spurred economic growth and \n     contributed greatly to our country's high standard of living. \n     Continued R spending is a necessary element in our \n     country's ability to invest for our future.\n\n  This is not some abstract economic principle. It is a real incentive \nthat creates jobs and helps workers in America. I have seen it \nfirsthand at companies throughout Washington State. This year, \nMicrosoft plans to invest $6.8 billion on R Because this tax credit \nis targeted almost exclusively at wages, the credit will translate into \nadditional jobs in Washington State and in the United States. That will \nmean jobs not just at Microsoft but at many other local companies.\n  In fact, according to a February 25, 2003, article in the Seattle \nTimes, one study found that every job at Microsoft supports 3.4 other \njobs in the economy. It also found that from 1990 to 2001 Microsoft was \nresponsible for more than a fourth, 28.3 percent, of King County's \ngrowth. That is an example of how one company's investment in R is \nsupporting good family wage jobs throughout the region.\n  That is just one company. There are many other companies engaged in \nR in Washington State and in the United States. Their investment in \nR will help our workers and help our economy.\n  I want to share some other figures that show the importance of R \ninvestment, especially in Washington State.\n  In the year 2000, companies performed almost $200 billion in R \n$9.8\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nbillion of that research was performed in Washington State.\n  Let me shed some light on types of employers that are doing that \nwork. Thirty-three percent of the research done in Washington State was \nperformed by manufacturers. We have seen a terrible loss of \nmanufacturing jobs over the years, and this credit is one way to help \nthem stem the tide. Mr. President, 11.4 percent of the research done in \nWashington State was done in the professional, scientific, and \ntechnical service industries.\n  This is about moving our economy forward. Technological innovations \nhave accounted for more than one-third of our Nation's economic growth \nduring the last decade. We know innovation is critical to sustained \ngrowth in the future.\n  Extending and improving the R tax credit is one of the most \nimportant steps we can take right now to foster investment at home and \njob creation throughout the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to give American workers a fair shot in the \nglobal marketplace by voting for the Hatch-Murray amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         R Credit Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2004.\n     Hon. Bill Thomas,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Rangel,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n        Dear Chairmen Thomas and Grassley, and Ranking Members \n     Rangel and Baucus: We urge you to make the enactment of a \n     permanent research tax credit (R Credit) with the \n     modifications contained in companion bills H.R. 463/S. 664 an \n     early legislative priority in 2004.\n        As you know, the technological innovations made possible \n     by the R Credit enable companies to bring more products and \n     services to market, increase employment, and raise the \n     standard of living for all Americans. R helps manufacturers \n     and services companies with U.S. operations maintain a \n     competitive edge over lower-cost foreign competitors. It \n     allows a small, medium or large company to reduce its \n     financial risk in expensive, labor-intensive R investments.\n        Since the credit was created in 1981, investments in \n     technology and innovation have spurred economic growth and \n     contributed greatly to our country's high standard of living. \n     Continued R spending is a necessary element in our \n     country's ability to invest for our future.\n        The growth of our economy is inextricably tied to the \n     ability to companies to make a sustained commitment to long-\n     term research. Congress has consistently demonstrated support \n     for the R credit. This year, in order to provide stability \n     and to ensure that all companies performing intensive \n     research in the United States are able to benefit from the \n     credit, Congress should make the credit permanent, increase \n     the Alternative Incremental Credit (AIRC) rates, and provide \n     an alternative simplified credit calculation.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just a parliamentary inquiry: I understand \nwe are on the FSC bill, and we are on an amendment that has been laid \ndown; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  America is stuck in a jobless recovery and this jobless recovery is \nnot an accident. It is in large measure the result of failed economic \npolicies, policies that the administration stubbornly clings to despite \nthe loss of nearly 3 million private sector jobs over the last 3 years.\n  This administration has embraced outsourcing. It is against extending \nunemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed. It is adamant \nagainst raising the minimum wage. And it is determined--any day now--to \neliminate time-and-a-half overtime pay for millions of American \nworkers.\n  It is time for Congress to step in and chart a new course. It is time \nfor Washington to listen to ordinary working Americans. They are \ntelling us loudly and clearly that their No. 1 issue is economic \nsecurity. They are telling us that they fear losing their jobs, health \ncare, and retirement.\n  Now they also fear losing their right, which has been their right \nsince 1938, to time-and-a-half compensation for work over 40 hours a \nweek. They fear, with good reason, that under the Department of Labor's \nnew rules, they will be obligated to work a 50-, 55-, 60-hour week with \nzero additional compensation. For millions of working Americans and \ntheir families, this is unacceptable. It is, indeed, the last straw.\n  Accordingly, at the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment to \nthis bill that will stop the administration from implementing its \nproposed new rules to eliminate overtime pay protection for millions of \nAmerican workers.\n  This amendment will be very familiar to my colleagues. Late last year \na similar amendment I offered passed the Senate by a vote of 54 to 45. \nIt was endorsed in the House by a vote of 226 to 203. It also won the \noverwhelming support of the American public. Yet despite this clear \nexpression of the will of Congress and of the public, my overtime \namendment was stripped from the omnibus appropriations bill in \nconference.\n  Today this overtime amendment is back by popular demand. It amazes me \nthat wherever I travel, anywhere in the country, people come up to me \nto talk about this overtime issue. They know now what the \nadministration is trying to do. They are upset. Working families are \nangry and they want action. They want us to take action to stop the \nimplementation of these new rules that will take away their protection \nso that they can get time and a half when they work overtime.\n  Frankly, at this point the administration has zero credibility on \nthis issue. The Department of Labor claims that it simply wants to give \nemployers clear guidance as to who is eligible for overtime pay. But \nordinary Americans are not buying this happy talk. They know that the \nadministration is proposing a radical rewrite of the Nation's overtime \nrules. They know these new rules will strip millions of workers of \ntheir right to fair compensation.\n  The people are right. They are correct. Plain and simply, the new \novertime rules are a frontal attack on the 40-hour workweek, pushed \naggressively by the administration without a single public hearing. \nYes, that is correct. Last year these proposed rules came out, \ndrastically changing our overtime pay protections, the rules that had \nbeen implemented since 1938, without one public hearing anywhere in the \nUnited States.\n\n  These new proposed rules could effectively end overtime pay in dozens \nof occupations, including nursing, police officers, firefighters, \nclerical workers, air traffic controllers, social workers, journalists. \nIndeed, the new criteria for excluding employees from overtime are \ndeliberately vague and elastic so as to stretch across vast swaths of \nthe workforce.\n  Listen to Mary Schlichte, a nurse in Cedar Rapids, IA:\n\n       Many nurses just like me work long hours in a field with \n     very stressful working conditions and little compensation. . \n     . . Our patients rely on us. Our families depend on us. We \n     need overtime pay so we can stay in the profession we love \n     and still make our ends meet.\n\n  Ms. Schlichte told me about her Cedar Rapids nurse colleagues who \nalso rely on overtime pay. One nurse is married to a struggling farmer. \nShe relies on her overtime pay to cover their insurance premiums. They \nalready fear losing their farm, and now they fear losing their health \ncare coverage also.\n  Dixie Harms is a longtime trainer of nurses in Des Moines. Ms. Harms \ntold me:\n\n       If overtime is changed for hospital nurses, we will see a \n     mass exodus of registered nurses from the hospital setting \n     because they will get fed up and refuse to volunteer so many \n     hours to what they really love doing.\n\n  Two and a half years ago, after the terrible September 11 attacks, \nmany in this body spoke eloquently about the heroism of our \nfirefighters, police officers, public safety workers. Ever since, \nAmerica's first responders have worked long hours to protect us from \nterrorists threats. But now the administration apparently wants to deny \nthem time-\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nand-a-half compensation for those longer hours. Simply put, this is \nwrong.\n  Since passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, overtime \nrights and the 40-hour workweek have been sacrosanct, respected by \nPresidents of both parties. But nothing, it seems, is sacred to this \nadministration when it comes to workers' rights.\n  For 65 years, the 40-hour workweek has allowed workers to spend time \nwith their families instead of toiling past dark and on weekends. At a \ntime when the family dinner is becoming an oxymoron, this standard is \nmore important than ever.\n  These radical revisions are antiworker and antifamily. Given the fact \nwe are stuck in a jobless recovery, the timing of this attack on \novertime could not be worse. It is yet another instance of this \nadministration's economic malpractice.\n  Bear in mind that time-and-a-half pay accounts for some 25 percent of \nthe total income of Americans who work overtime. With average U.S. \nincomes declining, the proposed changes would slash the paychecks of \nmillions of American workers.\n  Moreover, the proposed new rules are all but guaranteed to hurt job \ncreation in the United States. This is basic logic. If employers can \nmore easily deny overtime pay, they will push their current employees \nto work longer hours without compensation.\n  With 9 million Americans currently out of work, these proposed \nregulations will give employers yet another disincentive to hire new \nworkers. Why hire a new worker if you can get your present workers to \nwork overtime and not have to pay them time and a half? That would be \ncheaper than hiring a new worker.\n  It is bad enough to deny 8 million workers their overtime rights, but \nwhat is really striking about these proposed rules is the mean-\nspiritedness of the language included in these proposed rules from the \nDepartment of Labor.\n  For example, the department is offering employers what amounts to \nkind of a cheat sheet--helpful hints on how to avoid paying overtime to \nthe lowest paid workers, the same workers who are supposedly helped by \nthe new rules.\n  Let me be clear about this. There is a part of the proposed changes \nthat we all support, and that is raising the minimum pay level by which \na worker would not be exempt from any overtime rules. For example, \nright now, if you make below about $7,000 a year, no matter what your \njob is, you cannot be exempted from overtime, from overtime rules--even \nif you are a professional or if you fall into one of the exempt \ncategories. If you make below about $6,900 or $7,000 a year, you have \nto be paid time and a half overtime, no matter what your job is. The \nadministration is proposing to raise that to about $21,900, close to \n$22,000 a year. It has not been raised for a long time, so that is all \nwell and good. But, in so doing, the administration has put out \ntechnical advice to employers on how they can get around paying the \nlowest paid workers time and a half.\n  For example, the department suggested in writing that an employer \nmight cut a worker's hourly wage so that any new overtime payments will \nnot result in a net gain to the employee. It also recommends if the \nworker's salary is close to the threshold, you might want to raise \ntheir salary slightly to meet that threshold and then their protection \nfor time and a half would end, and then they could be exempt.\n  This is kind of disgraceful. This would be like the IRS putting out \nadvice to would-be scofflaws, or people or entities that might want to \nget around paying their fair share of taxes, telling them how to avoid \npaying their taxes, saying here is how you can effectively cheat. What \nwould we say if the IRS started putting out advice to employers, saying \nhere is how to get around paying your fair share of taxes?\n  That is what they are doing on overtime. They are putting out advice \nto employers, saying here is how you get around it. It is disgraceful. \nThere is one part of this new proposed rule that I find probably more \ndisgraceful than just about anything. I know that when I say this, \npeople are going to say: Harkin, this cannot be right, this cannot \nhappen.\n  The more I dig into the nuts and bolts and fine print of this \nproposed rule for changing overtime, the more astounded I am at what we \nare finding, in terms of who is now being exempted, or trying to be \nexempted from overtime pay.\n  Would you believe it if I told you that the administration, for the \nfirst time since 1938, is changing the rules to make it harder for \nveterans to get overtime pay than their counterparts who did not serve \nin the military? Let me repeat that. Mr. President, generally, people \nwould not believe me if I told them this administration, in their \nproposed rules, is making it harder for a veteran to qualify for \novertime than someone who didn't serve in the military. People say: \nHarkin, that cannot be right.\n  Read the proposed regulation. I have the old one. Here is the old \nrule that covers overtime pay. There is a section called ``Learned \nProfessions,'' and it is talking about who basically would be not \nbarred from exemption. It talks about members of the professions, such \nas graduates of law school and different things like that. It says here \nthe word ``customarily'' implies that in the vast majority of cases a \nspecific academic training is a prerequisite for entrance into the \nprofession. It makes the exemption available to the lawyer, the \nchemist, and things like that. But it does not in any way mention \nveterans in the old rule. There is no mention of veterans.\n\n  Here is the new rule. I have it blown up on the chart. It says:\n\n       However, the word ``customarily'' means that the exemption \n     is also available to employees in such professions who have \n     substantially the same knowledge level as the degreed \n     employees, but who attained such knowledge through a \n     combination of work experience, training in the Armed Forces, \n     attending a technical school.\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera. These words, ``training in the Armed Forces'' \nhave never been in the rules before. In other words, since 1938, we \nhave gone through World War II, the Korean war, cold war, Vietnam war, \nthe gulf war, Dominican Republic war, Grenada, and a whole bunch of \nother things. And our veterans--people who have served in the military, \nwho went in there, who the Army asks to ``be all that you can be in the \nU.S. Army.'' How many ads do we see enticing young people to come into \nthe military because they can get training which will increase their \nability to earn more money later on in life, after they get out of the \nmilitary--specialized training that will make them more desirable in \nthe workforce?\n  Well, guess what. They are running those same ads to be all you can \nbe, learn a specialized training, and be more valuable in the \nworkforce, and at the same time the administration is promulgating a \nrule saying: Wait a minute, if you get training in the Armed Forces, \nguess what. You are now covered under this new rule that says you can \nbe exempted from the overtime pay protection because now you fall into \nthe same kind of category as lawyers and architects and people who went \nto school for a long time to receive specialized training.\n  Again, don't take my word for it. Read it. ``Training in the Armed \nForces''--those five words have never been in the rules before, never. \nWe said before if you get training in the Armed Forces, you can now be \nexempt from overtime pay. That is what is coming down the pike. That is \nwhat is in these rules. That is why so many of us feel so strongly that \nthis proposed overtime rule should not be adopted.\n  According to the proposed rules, employers can consider specialized \ntraining and knowledge gained in the military as equivalent to what is \nlearned in professional schools. This will allow employers to \nreclassify veterans as ineligible for overtime. I started looking at \nsome of the comments made regarding this. I wondered where it is coming \nfrom. Here are comments on behalf of the Boeing company:\n\n       Boeing observes that many of its most skilled technical \n     workers received a significant portion of their knowledge and \n     training outside the university classroom, typically in a \n     branch of the military service, where through a combination \n     of classroom training and field experience they become \n     ``learned experts'' on very sophisticated aerospace products \n     or services. Oftentimes, such experts are actually more \n     knowledgeable than colleagues with advanced degrees--\n\n      Master's degrees and Ph.D.s.\n\n     and are viewed by the customers as the company's experts on \n     the product. Boeing thus supports the Department's--\n\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\n\n  That is the Department of Labor--\n\n     focus on the knowledge used by the employee in performing her \n     job, rather than the source of the knowledge or skill.\n\n  What Boeing is saying is we have a lot of people who work for us who \ngot their training in the military. They have become skilled in their \nprofession. But because they did not go to graduate school, because \nthey got their training in the military, we still have to pay these \npeople overtime. We have to pay them time and a half, and we do not \nwant to pay them time and a half. We want to treat them just like \nPh.D.s and all those other people. So, therefore, they support the \nproposed rule change that would allow them, Boeing, to reclassify these \nformer veterans as being exempt from overtime pay protections.\n  This is a letter from Thomas Corey, the national president of the \nVietnam Veterans of America:\n\n       Therefore, we would like to make you aware that the \n     proposed modification of the rules would give employers the \n     ability to prohibit veterans from receiving overtime pay \n     based on the training they received in the military. . . . \n     The proposed rule changes will make these veterans and their \n     families unfairly economically vulnerable in comparison with \n     their non-veteran peers.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       The proposed rule changes will make these veterans and \n     their families unfairly economically vulnerable in comparison \n     with their non-veteran peers. We hope you will agree that the \n     men and women who have served our Nation so well in military \n     service should not be penalized for having served.\n\n  That is Thomas Corey, national president, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica. I think that is the crux of it. You could have two people, \nboth skilled in a certain area, let's say aerospace or whatever it \nmight be. One got his training in the military and one got his training \nin some other way outside the military. So the person outside the \nmilitary would be covered under overtime. The person who served in the \nmilitary would not be covered by overtime.\n  I wish someone would make some sense out of that. It is just a slap \nin the face to the men and women who served in the military and were \ntold: Be all you can be, get specialized training in the military, but \nwhat they are not telling them is once you do that, they are going to \ntake away your right to overtime pay once you get out of the military.\n  This is outrageous--outrageous not just to our veterans but to most \nAmericans. Veterans organizations are deeply disturbed by this, not \njust the Vietnam veterans but all veterans organizations.\n  Picture this: The Commander in Chief has mobilized thousand of \nreservists and National Guard troops from Iowa and from across America. \nThey left their regular jobs as police officers, firefighters, nurses, \nclerical workers, on and on, and are deployed in Iraq for a year or \nmore. But if the administration has its way, when these troops come \nback home from Iraq or wherever to resume their civilian jobs, they are \ngoing to find that if they received specialized training in the \nmilitary, they have been stripped of their right to time-and-a-half \novertime pay.\n\n  It is punishing veterans precisely because they were dedicated \nsoldiers who pursued specialized instruction and training while in the \nmilitary. The Department of Labor is preparing quite a welcome home \npresent for many of the guardsmen and reservists returning from Iraq. \nIt might read this way:\n\n       Dear Returning Veteran: While you were away we reclassified \n     your job so that you no longer qualify for time-and-a-half \n     overtime pay. Thank you for serving our country.\n\n  There is another group I talked about last year--and it is still true \nthis year--who are disproportionately harmed by the proposed new \novertime rules--women.\n  The fact is, women tend to dominate in retail services and sales \npositions which would be particularly affected by the new rules. \nMarried women in America increased their working hours by nearly 40 \npercent from 1979 to 2000. As women have increased their time in the \npaid labor market, their contribution to family income has also risen. \nThese contributions are especially important to lower and middle-income \nfamilies--important for housing, health care, heating bills and, of \ncourse, for sending kids to school.\n  Yet now the administration's new rules would take away overtime \nprotections from millions of American women. Women in the paid \nworkforce would be forced to work longer hours for less pay and, of \ncourse, this means more time away from families, more childcare \nexpenses with no additional compensation. Not surprising, prominent \nwomen's groups are adamantly opposed to the new overtime rules.\n  The American Association of University Women, the National \nOrganization of Women, the National Partnership for Women and Families, \nthe YWCA, and Nine to Five, and the National Association of Working \nWomen are all strongly supporting my amendment to stop the \nadministration from implementing these new overtime rules.\n  There is a broader context to this discussion of overtime. There is a \nbigger picture. As I said, the No. 1 issue for Americans today is \neconomic security, and with good reason, because it is abundantly clear \nthat America is stuck in a jobless recovery.\n  Since this administration took office, nearly 3 million private \nsector jobs have been lost, including one in every seven jobs in \nmanufacturing. George W. Bush has presided over the largest job loss of \nany President since Herbert Hoover. Yet the President remains wedded to \npolicies that are making the problem worse. He remains wedded to \npolicies that are destroying jobs, driving down wages, and threatening \nthe economic security of the American people.\n  A couple of weeks ago, the White House issued its annual economic \nreport signed by the President explaining why we should welcome the \n``offshoring'' of U.S. jobs. The President's top economic adviser \nassured us that the outsourcing of high-end, white-collar jobs to Asia \nis ``a plus for the economy in the long run.''\n  The President's economic report praises the virtues of a ``level \nplaying field for goods and services,'' arguing that when a good or \nservice is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import \nit than to make or provide it domestically. That is from the \nPresident's report.\n  We have a very serious question to ask ourselves: Do we really want \nAmerican workers competing on a ``level playing field,'' head to head \nwith factory workers in China working for 20 cents an hour, with \nsoftware engineers in India working for $10,000 a year, going head to \nhead with countries that employ abusive child labor to make products?\n  In reality, is this not a race to the bottom, with nations competing \nto slash salaries and benefits in order to win more jobs? Outsourcing \nis not the only thing hurting job creation and suppressing wages. These \nnew overtime rules will have the same effect. Eight million workers \nwill be stripped of their right and their protection to overtime pay.\n  Of course, the employers can deny overtime pay. As I said, they \nsimply push their current employees to work longer hours without \ncompensation. This is a powerful disincentive to hire new workers. So \nas with outsourcing, the idea of sending so many of these jobs \noverseas, where they are paying 20 cents an hour, no health benefits, \nno retirement benefits, no Social Security, no environmental \nprotections, killing overtime pay is the same thing. Just keep in mind \nif an employer can work an employee more than 40 hours and not pay time \nand a half, we can see that an employer would then say, well, why \nshould I hire new workers? I will just work my present workers longer. \nIf I can get 4 or 5 more hours a week out of each employee and not pay \ntime and a half overtime, that is better than hiring somebody else.\n  That is exactly what this proposed overtime rule is all about. It is \nterrible for job creation. I do not know why this administration does \nnot see that. Yet in the face of facts, in the face of all of the \nreports we have gotten, in the face of what Americans are saying, which \nis that they want their overtime protected, the administration is \nsurging ahead. They are going to strip people in this country of their \nright to overtime pay.\n  Since we have had no public hearings on it, we are not certain why \nthe administration is doing this. Why are they moving ahead with the \nmost profound change in our overtime laws since 1938? Now, I use my \nwords carefully. I said the ``most profound change.'' There have been \nchanges in overtime rules and laws since 1938,\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nsince the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, of course. Many \noccupations that existed then no longer exist, and they were taken off. \nI understand.\n  New occupations came in like computer software writers, computer \nengineers, which were not around in the late 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, or \n1960s. So there have been changes.\n  Every time we have made a change in the overtime rules, we have done \nit through open hearings, through open collaboration between the \nadministration and Congress and labor, all working together to do what \nis right for our people and our country.\n  So, yes, we have made a number of changes since 1938, but as far as \nmy research shows, this is the first time since 1938 that an \nadministration has made this profound a change, and it is the first \ntime since 1938 that the administration has proposed these changes \nwithout having one public hearing. It is the first time since 1938 that \nany administration, Republican or Democrat, has proposed changes such \nas this in the overtime rules without consultation and working closely \nwith Congress to develop a consensus as to what has to be done.\n  I am left with, perhaps, some conclusions: The administration really \ndoes not want to create a lot of new jobs; that by driving down labor \ncosts, perhaps we can increase corporate profitability. It allows \ncorporations to export cheap labor overseas with outsourcing. The \nadministration puts pressure on U.S. workers to accept lower wages, \nless generous benefits, longer working hours. This is true of \noutsourcing, and it is true of eliminating overtime.\n  Right now, American workers work longer than any workers in any \nindustrialized country in the world. We now work longer than workers in \nJapan, Germany, Great Britain, and our neighbor to the north, Canada. \nGuess what we are being told. Guess what our workers are being told by \nthis administration. That they are going to work even longer, and they \nwill not have any right to overtime pay.\n\n  There is more. The President refuses to extend benefits for the long-\ntime unemployed, and opposes any increase in the minimum wage. It has \nbeen frozen at $5.15 an hour for years. This is not a living wage; it \nis a poverty wage. It keeps downward pressure on wages all across the \nspectrum.\n  All this means, again, is fewer jobs for U.S. citizens. It means \ndownward pressure on wages for all of our workers.\n  Something is missing. What is missing is ordinary, hard-working \nAmericans are not participating in this so-called economic recovery. \nMore and more Americans live in fear of losing their jobs, their health \nbenefits, and losing their retirement. The truth is, we cannot build a \nsustainable recovery by exporting jobs, by driving down wages, and by \nmaking Americans work longer hours without compensation.\n  Moreover, such a recovery, if it even could take place, is not \ndesirable. As one individual said, my time with my family in the \nevenings and on the weekends is premium time. Yes, I work during the \nweek to make a living, but the time with my family is premium time. If \nI am going to be asked to give up my premium time with my family, do I \nnot deserve to have premium pay, time and a half, something out of the \nordinary?\n  As this person said to me, I get my wages, which are ordinary, for my \nordinary working hours that I have agreed to work, but I should not get \nordinary pay for my premium time, which is the time I spend with my \nfamily. That is why I say a recovery that means that our American \nworkers are going to work longer, spend more time away from their \nfamilies, and not get paid any more for it is not a desirable recovery.\n  A true recovery must include all working Americans. It can only be \nbuilt on a foundation of good jobs with good wages in America, not \noverseas. It can only be built on a foundation that includes a minimum \nwage that is a living wage, not a poverty wage. It can only be built on \na foundation that preserves American workers' rights to time and a half \novertime pay.\n  Shortly, I will be offering this amendment. Obviously, this FSC bill \nis touted as a JOBS bill. That is all well and good. Let us have an \nopen and good discussion about that. We have some amendments to offer \nthat a number of us believe will help increase jobs in this country. \nThe one I will be offering will be protecting the overtime rights of \nAmerican workers. So I am hopeful we can move on to that.\n  On this issue, the administration ignores the pleas of the public. It \nhas brushed aside the clear wishes of both Houses of Congress. Last \nyear, we passed the amendment in the Senate to disallow the Bush \nregulations on taking away overtime pay protections. The House \nemphatically approved of that. Yet it was stripped out in \nconference. Again, this is not acceptable. I hope we can have a strong \nbipartisan vote in support of my amendment that would disallow taking \naway overtime pay protection for American workers. We can save the \nadministration from making a terrible mistake. We can protect American \nworkers' time-honored right to overtime compensation, and we can \nsupport an economic recovery that includes all Americans, a recovery \nthat respects and preserves the American way.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch and \nSenator Murray, for their leadership on extending and strengthening the \nresearch and development, R tax credit. The ability of our Nation to \nremain a world leader in technology and innovation is directly related \nto the investment we make in research and development. The R tax \ncredit is an important component of this strategy as it creates an \nincentive for private companies to invest in research they might not \notherwise have invested in but for that tax credit. This is an \nefficient way to accomplish a goal in our society that is increasing \nfunding for research.\n  Senator Domenici and I have been working here for the last several \nyears to make some changes in the R tax credit law. The amendment I \nhave sent to the desk incorporates those changes we have worked on. The \namendment is based on legislation we filed in each of the last several \nCongresses, most recently S. 515 in the 107th Congress. This amendment \naddresses two weaknesses in the current R tax credit.\n  The first part of the amendment provides participants in a research \nconsortium with a flat 20-percent research credit. A consortium is \ndefined as a group of five or more unrelated companies which are \nworking together on a specific type of mutually beneficial research. \nUnder current law, these companies are unable to take advantage of the \nfull R tax credit. That does not make good sense. We should be \nencouraging companies to work together to share the costs of research \ninstead of requiring that each of them bear the full capital \nexpenditure to which they would be entitled in order to get the \nresearch tax credit. The amendment I have sent to the desk which \nSenator Domenici and I have been working on would correct this and \nwould encourage this type of private research teaming.\n  The second part of the amendment would be to get rid of a restriction \nthat allows companies to only consider 65 percent of their research \nexpenses for purposes of calculating their tax credit when the funds \nare paid to an outside party such as a Federal laboratory or university \nor a small business.\n  Again, as with consortiums, this provision makes no sense as it \nexists in current law. In many if not most cases it is far more \nefficient and economical for a company to have their research done at a \nfacility that is already equipped to do this type of experimentation \nand development. We ought to be encouraging businesses to utilize these \nresources instead of discouraging that use. For this reason, the \namendment would allow a company to consider 100 percent of all of their \nexpenses when contracting with a lab or university or small business to \nhandle their research projects.\n  The amendment would come into effect at the end of the year. It would \ncontinue for as long as the R provisions are in effect which, under \nthe Hatch-Murray amendment which is what this proposal would amend, is \nthe end of 2005.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, Senators Hatch and \nMurray, on their R amendment. I very much appreciate their support \nfor these small changes Senator Domenici and I would like to see made \nin this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent the time until 3:30 be equally \ndivided in the usual form and that if the Bingaman amendment has not \nbeen previously disposed of, the Senate would then vote in relation to \nthe Bingaman second-degree, to be followed immediately by a vote in \nrelation to the Hatch first-degree, as amended if amended, provided \nfurther no additional second degrees be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Tennessee is \ngoing to seek recognition. I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Tennessee, I be recognized to speak on the R amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have no problem with that \nexcept we now have an hour and 10 minutes. We don't want those two \nSenators to use the entire 70 minutes so we should have some idea how \nlong they are going to speak.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. For myself, I would only need 5 minutes.\n  Senator Alexander?\n  Mr. REID. I think it would be appropriate if my friends agree the \ntime be equally divided between now and 3:30 between the proponents and \nopponents of the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the time is equally divided.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask to be recognized after Senator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield to Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, my intention was to ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business for 7 or 8 minutes, which may \nnot be appropriate at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under controlled time that is the Senator's \nright. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to speak on the R tax credit that \nis in this bill--the proposal to extend that tax credit which is \nscheduled to expire. I want to talk about some of the benefits.\n  This is a tax credit that has been supported by both sides of the \naisle and by both bodies. There are many benefits to keeping this R \ntax credit as part of our Tax Code; first of all, the industries that \nbenefit from this tax credit. I am the chairman of the Republican High-\nTech Task Force in the Senate, and I hear about this issue all the time \nfrom very important parts of our economy and how important it is to the \ncreation of jobs.\n  The industries that benefit from this include--it is not limited to \nthe aerospace industry--the agriculture industry, biotechnology, \nchemical industry, electronic, energy, information technology, \nmanufacturing, medical technology, pharmaceuticals, software and \ntelecommunications, as well as others.\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n  It is not just big business that benefits from this R tax credit; \nit is also many small businesses. The companies that perform \nsignificant amounts of R perform that research and development in the \nUnited States. They pay very good wages to the people who do the \nresearch and development.\n  This tax credit should be made permanent in the long run. That is my \ngoal--to someday make this tax credit permanent. We keep extending it. \nI think it has been extended 10 different times over the years. It was \nallowed to actually lapse once, but it has never been made permanent. I \nbelieve it should be made permanent. Unfortunately, we can't do that in \nthe context of what we are doing today. But we should at least make \nsure that R tax credit is extended for the 18 months the bill calls \nfor.\n  Why is it important? New vaccines, faster Internet, and other \ncommunications capabilities, safer transportation, enhanced energy-\nefficient appliances, higher quality entertainment, better homes, \nimproved national security. The list of societal benefits as a result \nof R is endless.\n  R is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. We really should encourage \nnot only adoption of the extension but also eventually making permanent \nthis tax credit.\n  The revenue analysis, according to the economic benefit of the R \ntax credit prepared by Coopers & Lybrand in 1998 says:\n\n       In the long run, $1.75 of additional tax revenue would be \n     generated for each dollar the Federal Government spends on \n     the credit, creating a win-win situation for both the \n     taxpayers and the government.\n\n  I will conclude with this: We should do the right thing for the \neconomy and allow companies some level of predictability. We keep \ntelling them we are going to extend it, we are going to extend it. But, \nfrankly, it is hard when research and development is usually planned \nlong term. It is hard to do that when we keep coming up to the deadline \nand then finally extending the tax credit.\n  I encourage us to do what we are doing today--extending it for 18 \nmonths but also be looking for ways to make this R tax credit \npermanent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Wyoming how much time \nhe has. It is my understanding that there was an agreement before I \ncame to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 3:30 \nis equally divided between the majority and minority leader.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I am very happy to be supporting the pending amendment. This is an \namendment that the author of the amendment, Senator Hatch, and I have \nintroduced many times over many years. I have been a cosponsor of this \namendment for years. Senator Hatch has been a cosponsor of this \namendment for years. It is critically important that we finally get a \nmajor research and development tax stimulus enacted into law. This \nprovision has been in law for various years, but it has always been \nextended--on and off again. It has been a yo-yo tax provision--a yo-yo \nincentive. Sometimes companies get it, sometimes they don't. Sometimes \nwe enact it--all the way back to the expiration previous times--\nsometimes we don't. It is very irresponsible, in my judgment, for this \nCongress not to give permanent research and development tax credit to \nAmerican companies. Other countries do. The Government of Canada, for \nexample, has a R tax credit which is much more generous than the one \nwe give to American companies.\n  There are other countries that also have stimulus incentives to \nresearch and development--more generous than we have in our country.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I also agree with my good friend from Nevada. This provision should \nbe permanently extended. It makes no sense not to be permanently \nextended. It should be a permanent fixture in the law.\n  I say that because the stakes are getting so high. We are losing jobs \nto overseas companies in lots of ways.\n  One way to create jobs in America is to have a very aggressive \nresearch and development tax credit for research and development in \nAmerica. It is clear that jobs tend to be where the research is. The \nmore research we have in America, the more likely it is we will have \nmore jobs in America. It will also help to maintain jobs.\n  We do not want jobs to go overseas. This will help us maintain jobs \nin America. We should not erect barriers to our companies going \noverseas. We should not stick our heads in the sand. That does not \nwork. We are facing an immense challenge, and one good way is to pass \nthis amendment.\n  In addition to passing the underlying bill, this JOBS bill before the \nSenate is not going to be the silver bullet many would like but it will \nhelp significantly.\n  With respect to the R credit, 62 percent of total industry research \nand development is performed in manufacturing industries. That includes \ncomputer and electronic products, transportation, equipment, and \nchemicals. It is disproportionately helpful to manufacturing jobs. We \nclearly want more manufacturing jobs in this country. Manufacturing \njobs are important to the entire economy.\n  The multiplier effect in manufacturing jobs is extremely high. For \nevery 16 million manufacturing jobs in this country, another 9 million \nare created in retail, wholesale, finance, and other sectors. That is \nnot as true in other sectors. Most of the R effect is manufacturing, \nand manufacturing has a very high multiplier effect, which is all the \nmore reason to get this passed.\n  Workers employed in manufacturing plants with more technologies also \nearn 63 percent more than workers in plants using lower level \ntechnologies. It is a question not only of the number of jobs but the \nwages the jobs pay, the amount of income those workers will receive.\n  I can go on at great length as to why this is so important. I am not \ngoing to expand anymore on it because I think Senators realize how \nimportant it is. I expect this to pass by a very large margin, and well \nit should.\n  Once we pass this amendment, it is incumbent upon us to start looking \nfor other ways we can help give stimulus and help American companies \nkeep jobs in America. I am certainly going to be a part of this. It is \nsomething we desperately have to do.\n  What is the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 27 minutes remaining and the \nminority has 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I will talk about an amendment that has not been laid down. \nThere were comments about overtime a while ago, and I want people to \nknow the rest of the story.\n  The bill we are on has the catchy name of FSC/ETI. What we are trying \nto do is comply with some World Trade Organization requirements that \nallow penalties to be put on our exports overseas and agricultural \nproducts are a big one. They always get targeted when this sort of \nthing happens. We need to correct our law so we are not being \npenalized, so we do not eliminate business that the United States can \nhave.\n  Penalties went into effect on March 1 and go up 1 percent per month \non U.S. businesses if we do not change the law. We are trying to change \nthe law. It needs to be done quickly. It should be done pretty cleanly. \nIt obviously is not going to be.\n  We keep talking about jobs, but our actions do not match our words. I \npoint out one very important jobs program we have that affects \nAmericans who want to improve their skills and get a better job. We \nhave the Workforce Investment Act, and that has the potential each and \nevery year to retrain 900,000 people so they have the skills and \ntalents to handle the jobs available, the well-paying jobs available in \nthis country that we are having to fill from overseas.\n  Do you know what has happened to that bill? Let me give Members a \nbrief history. We passed it out of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee unanimously. How often do you think that happens in \nthat committee? It can be a very contentious committee. It passed out \nof the committee unanimously. What happened in the Senate? We passed it \nin the Senate by\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nunanimous consent. That means not one person in the Senate wanted to \namend the bill; not one person in the Senate wanted to vote against the \nbill. It was unanimous. That is as bipartisan as we can possibly get.\n  Where is that bill now? We cannot appoint a conference committee. \nThat is the committee made up of Republicans and Democrats who would \nmeet with Republicans and Democrats from the House to work out \ndifferences between what they passed and what we passed. We cannot have \na conference committee to do that.\n  That is 900,000 jobs in this country that are being stalled out; \n900,000 opportunities we are not going to give to Americans. Instead, \nwe are going to talk about a whole bunch of amendments to this bill \nthat are going to slow down this bill and increase penalties on \nAmerican businesses trying to ship goods overseas. In fact, all \nAmerican businesses.\n  Keep that in mind. If we want to take care of jobs in this country \nand make sure jobs stay in this country, we would get a conference \ncommittee appointed on the Workforce Investment Act and get that thing \nresolved and get people trained and to work.\n  One of the examples of what will happen on this is the overtime \namendment that we have been promised. I could wait until it actually \ncame up, but there were some comments made and there is a need to \nrespond on the 40 minutes we have already heard about the overtime \namendment.\n  It is time to strip the rhetoric from the reality and consider who is \nreally helped and hurt by this amendment which prohibits the Department \nof Labor from updating the rules exempting white-collar employees from \novertime pay. It is not all that simple.\n\n  When I am back in Wyoming, I like to hold town meetings to find out \nwhat is on the minds of my constituents. At each town meeting, there is \nusually someone in attendance who is quite concerned about government \nregulations. I am often told to rein big government in, keep the rules \nand regulations simple, keep them current and responsive, and make sure \nthey make sense in today's ever changing workplace.\n  Most of the people I talk to are small businessmen, but that is most \nof business in this country. They are being killed by the rules and \nregulations, and, in some cases, by trial attorneys.\n  Today we are reviewing an amendment that takes the opposite approach. \nInstead of keeping it simple and current, it will prohibit the \nSecretary of Labor from updating the rules exempting white-collar \nemployees from the Fair Labor Standards Act and overtime requirement in \nsome cases, an attempt to reject the new, turn back the clock, and look \nto yesterday for the answer to tomorrow's problems. It is an approach \nthat is doomed to failure before it is even applied. I am opposed to \nthe amendment.\n  There is no question that the workplace has dramatically changed \nduring the last half century. The regulations governing white-collar \nexemptions remain substantially the same as they were 50 years ago. The \nexisting rules take us back to the time when workers held titles such \nas straw boss, keypunch operator, legman, and other occupations that no \nlonger exist today.\n  Our economy has evolved. New occupations have emerged that were not \neven contemplated when the regulations were written. A 1999 study by \nthe General Accounting Office recommended that the Department of Labor: \nComprehensively review current regulations and restructure white-collar \nexemptions to better accommodate today's workplace and to anticipate \nfuture workplace trends. That is precisely what the Department of \nLabor's proposal to update and clarify the white-collar regulations \nwill do.\n  While the Department's proposal will update and clarify, this \namendment will do neither. Instead, it will set the clock back to 1954 \nand try to force the square peg of the 21st century jobs into the round \nhole of the workplace of 50 years ago.\n  I am a former shoe salesman and I know how to tell when something \nwill not fit. This just will not fit. It is like trying to force a size \n10 foot into a size 6 shoe. It will not fit no matter how hard you try.\n  Through the course of the debate on overtime over the next several \ndays, we will hear a lot of numbers. Some of them are statistics and we \nknow how statistics work. I am an accountant so I will try to give some \ngood numbers and hope you will put up with me with the numbers, but \nthere are numbers you need to know.\n  Let us be clear about what this amendment will do. The amendment will \nundermine the Department of Labor's efforts to extend overtime \nprotection to 1.3 million low-wage workers. Under the current rules, \nonly those rare workers earning less than $8,060 a year are protected \nfor overtime pay. That is how old this rule is. You are protected if \nyou are making less than $8,060 a year. Now the administration's \nproposed rule will raise that threshold to $22,100 a year.\n\n  Doesn't that sound more common sense in today's market? Doesn't that \nsound like a number that covers more people? If the old rule covered \nthose making less than $8,060, a new rule, covering those making less \nthan $22,100, would cover more people.\n  As a result, 20 percent of the lowest paid workers would be \nguaranteed overtime pay. The overtime provisions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act were originally intended to protect lower income workers. \nThe proposed rules will provide lower income workers with the \nprotection they deserve.\n  That also makes it easier for businesses to know when they are \ncomplying with the law. And that is important, particularly for small \nbusinesses. They need to know. They should not have a bunch of \ndifferent criteria that they need a special accountant or attorney to \ninterpret for them so they can tell whether they are violating the law.\n  This rule, the one proposed--proposed; it is not finalized yet--by \nthe Department of Labor will make it easier for businesses to know when \nthey are complying.\n  By undermining the administration's efforts to better protect lower \nincome workers, who will this amendment protect? The supporters of the \namendment--the amendment that is going to be laid down, I guess--claim \nthat an estimated 8 million workers will become ineligible for overtime \nunder the proposed rules. However, this estimate is based on a study by \nthe Economic Policy Institute, and it is riddled with errors. For \nexample, the study includes in its calculations at least 18 percent of \nthe workforce who work 35 hours or less a week. These part-time workers \ndo not work more than 40 hours a week and, therefore, they do not \nreceive overtime in the first place.\n  The study also claims the proposed rule will deny overtime pay to \nwhite-collar employees earning more than $65,000 a year. However, not \nall the employees earning over $65,000 are exempt under the proposed \nrules--only those performing office or nonmanual work and one or more \nexempt duties. This means workers, such as police officers, \nfirefighters, plumbers, Teamsters, carpenters, and electricians will \nnot--will not--lose their overtime pay. The Department of Labor \nacknowledges the possibility that 644,000 highly educated workers \nmaking over $65,000 a year might lose their overtime. Mr. President, \n1.3 million get picked up on the bottom end; 644,000 drop out on the \ntop.\n  Supporters of this amendment claim that the proposed rules will strip \novertime pay for first responders and nurses. If we look behind the \nrhetoric, we find there will be virtually no change in status for first \nresponders and nurses under the Department of Labor proposal. Under \nboth the current and proposed regulations, only registered nurses are \nexempt from overtime pay.\n  Supporters of this amendment claim that military personnel and \nveterans will lose their overtime pay under the proposed rules. \nHowever, military personnel and veterans are not affected by the \nproposed rules by virtue of their military status or training. Nothing \nin the current or proposed regulation makes any mention of veteran \nstatus.\n  Who will this amendment protect, if not low-income workers, first \nresponders, nurses, veterans, or millions of other working Americans? \nThe antiquated and confusing white-collar exemptions have created a \nwindfall--a windfall--for trial lawyers. Ambiguities and outdated terms \nhave generated significant confusion regarding which employees are \nexempt from the overtime requirements. The confusion\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\nhas generated significant litigation and overtime pay awards for highly \npaid, white-collar employees. Wage and hour cases now exceed \ndiscrimination suits as the leading type of employment law class \naction. Let me repeat that again. Wage and hour cases now exceed \ndiscrimination suits as the leading type of employment law class \naction.\n\n  This amendment--the amendment that Senator Harkin is going to put \nin--will not preserve overtime for millions of working Americans. The \namendment will not help employers and employees clearly and fairly \ndetermine who is entitled to overtime. The only clear winners from this \namendment will be the trial lawyers who will continue to benefit from \nthe current state of confusion. We are spending taxpayers' dollars \nsorting through what could be solved with clarity.\n  I stress that these are proposed rules--proposed rules. The \nDepartment of Labor has received, and is currently reviewing, around \n80,000 comments to their proposed regulations. We should allow the \nregulatory process to continue and give the Department a chance to \ncomplete its review of the proposed rules. Once the review is \ncompleted, the Department will align the white-collar regulations with \nthe realities of the 21st century workplace, the intent of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, and--this is most important--what they have \nlearned from the comments.\n  They have 80,000 comments. I expect them to read those. I expect them \nto react to those, and make sure that it becomes a part of the rule.\n  Now, supporters of this amendment are, in effect, denying the public \na voice in the regulatory process. This amendment will deny the \nDepartment of Labor an opportunity to respond to public comments. I \nhappen to believe that public comments play a critical role in the \nregulatory process.\n  I will tell you, I go back to Wyoming most weekends. I go out on \nFriday, travel to a different part of the State, and come back on \nSunday. It is the most valuable thing I do around here, and that is \nbecause I get to talk to the person who has the problem firsthand. Do \nyou know what? They are working on that all day, every day. And the \nadvantage is they have usually thought of some kind of a solution. Now, \nwhen I bring it back, quite often, the comment is: It is too simple. It \nwill never work. Where did you come up with a crazy idea like that? And \nI have to explain: From the guy with the problem who works on this \nevery day and knows the commonsense approach to solving that problem.\n  Those are the people writing in with comments. Those are the people \nwho are saying: This is where it is right. This is where it is wrong. \nFix it where it is wrong. Leave it in the new context where it is \nright. That is how the process is supposed to work.\n  We want the Department of Labor to look at those comments and \nrespond--respond by changing the rule, or respond by letting the people \nknow how that will not work or how it is covered a different way. We \nhave to have that process work.\n  Now, I hope if there are substantial changes it gets put out one more \ntime for comments. There is not anything around that says they cannot \nreissue them for comment. The public comments are what help us get it \nright. We do not do these jobs, so we do not know all the right \nanswers. But the people out there working on them do. The answers can \nbe made right.\n  Now, if the final rule has gone astray, after all of this process, we \ncan use the Congressional Review Act to reverse it. And we have done \nthat before. That is where we say: You did not pay attention to the \nprocess. You did not pay attention to the comments. We are going to \njerk you back to reality. But now is not the time or the vehicle for \nmaking that determination.\n  I hope my colleague will not put down the amendment, but if he does, \nI hope my other colleagues will support me in allowing the Department \nto move forward with the review and response that they need to be \ndoing. They do need to be paying attention to all of this debate. But \nwe do need to bring that rule into the current century and make sure \npeople are working at jobs and the rules are understandable, \nparticularly with small businesses that are trying to provide a \nservice, not figure out Government regulations.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield myself such \ntime as I may consume from the time under the control of the Democratic \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to those who may be listening in the offices of \nMembers who want to come over and wish to be heard on this matter, I \nwill be prepared to yield some time. I am here to discuss an amendment \nthat will come up after 3:30. I thought I would move things along while \nwe have this dead time, while we are waiting for this vote to occur, to \ndiscuss upcoming amendments and encourage those who may want to \nparticipate in some of those debates to come to the floor and share \nsome of their thoughts.\n  I will be offering at the appropriate time, sometime after 3:30, an \namendment that deals with the outsourcing of jobs. I note the presence \nof the Presiding Officer who comes from the same region of the country \nI do. We have all been feeling it in our States, not just in the \nNortheast, but across the country, the tremendous pinch that is \noccurring as a result of job loss and the growing number of jobs that \nare being outsourced. I am told by those who cover these issues that \nthe coalition opposed to any legislative efforts to stop outsourcing is \ncoming up with some new language. They don't like the word, \n``outsourcing,'' so they are calling it worldwide sourcing, to take \nsome of the sting out of the language. They may succeed in taking the \nsting out of the language by changing the vocabulary, but you cannot \ntake the sting out of finding out that your job has been lost and that \nothers offshore are taking those jobs because it enhances the bottom \nline in a quarterly report someplace. We need to address that.\n\n  I fully understand that outsourcing to some degree is going to go on. \nI expect that to be the case. But I don't think the Federal Government \nought to be subsidizing that effort. I am one who has believed in and \nsupported free and fair trade agreements over the years. I take great \npride in that. In a global economy, you have to do that. But I also \nunderstand if we don't have the services or provide the manufactured \ngoods with which to trade globally because we have given up a \nsignificant part of our manufacturing base or given up a critical area \nof technology in the service areas, for instance, we are necessarily \ngoing to be great competitors in a global marketplace in the 21st \ncentury.\n  You may say we are nowhere near that yet. The rest of the world \ndoesn't even come close to producing the quality and high value goods \nwe do in the United States. They can't come close to providing the high \ntechnology we do.\n  I think we have all learned over the last number of years that \ntechnology and productivity is highly portable, and it is moving at \nwarp speed. What was true a year ago, 5 years ago, certainly 10 years \nago, is no longer the case. I suspect this rate of speed of change is \ngoing to continue to grow.\n  At this particular juncture, I think it is important that we speak to \nthis issue and that we try to find some balance on how we maintain our \nglobal leadership role, continue to provide opportunities for American \nworkers, while simultaneously not allowing the exportation of jobs \noverseas.\n  I was terribly disheartened to read a report, the Economic Report of \nthe President, February 2004, just last month, this publication that \ncomes out. It is designed to give an overall economic report of the \nNation, with various suggestions and ideas. I am not making up these \nquotes from some news article or some demagogue or pundit out there \nwhen talking about these issues. These are actual conclusions reached \nby the top economic advisers to the President of the United States when \nit comes to the issue of manufacturing and outsourcing.\n  First on outsourcing, chapter 12, on page 229 of this economic report \nof President Bush and his economic team, it says:\n\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\n\n       When a good or a service is produced more cheaply abroad, \n     it makes more sense to import it than to make or provide it \n     domestically.\n\n  I would suggest that is a conclusion with which some economists may \nagree. Some have drawn the conclusion that that is inherently a far \nbetter idea, just thinking in terms of quarters or yearly reports, I \nsuppose, and the bottom line. That may be OK. But if you are worried \nabout generational change, if you are worried about trying to establish \na bedrock of job opportunities, stability, and security in the 21st \ncentury, then it absolutely makes no sense to export that job rather \nthan to provide it domestically.\n  I note in this morning's Wall Street Journal--so you don't think \nthese ideas are merely being spouted by a Democrat in disagreement with \nthe President's economic report--a March 3, 2004, article, ``Lesson in \nIndia.'' I ask unanimous consent to print the full article in the \nRecord.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 3, 2004]\n\n           Lesson in India: Not Every Job Translates Overseas\n\n                            (By Scott Thurm)\n\n        When sales of their security software slowed in 2001, \n     executives at ValiCert Inc. began laying off engineer in \n     Silicon Valley to hire replacements in India for $7,000 a \n     year.\n        ValiCert expected to save millions annually while cranking \n     out new software for banks, insurers and government agencies. \n     Senior Vice President David Jevans recalls optimistic \n     predictions that the company would ``cut the budget by half \n     here and hire twice as many people there.'' Colleagues would \n     swap work across the globe every 12 hours, helping ValiCert \n     ``put more people on it and get it done sooner,'' he says.\n       The reality was different. The Indian engineers, who knew \n     little about ValiCert's software or how it was used, omitted \n     features Americans considered intuitive. U.S. programmers, \n     accustomed to quick chats over cubicle walls, spent months \n     writing detailed instructions for overseas assignments, \n     delaying new products. Fear and distrust thrived as \n     ValiCert's finances deteriorated, and co-workers, 14 time \n     zones apart, traded curt e-mails. In the fall of 2002, \n     executives brought back to the U.S. a key project that had \n     been assigned to India, irritating some Indian employees.\n        ``At times, we were thinking, `What have we done here?' '' \n     recalls John Vigouroux, who joined ValiCert in July 2002 and \n     became chief executive three months later.\n        Shifting work to India eventually did help cut ValiCert's \n     engineering costs by two-thirds, keeping the company and its \n     major products alive--and saving 65 positions which remained \n     in the U.S. But not before ValiCert experienced a harrowing \n     period of instability and doubt, and only after its \n     executives significantly refined the company's global \n     division of labor.\n       The successful formula that emerged was to assign the India \n     team bigger projects, rather than tasks requiring continual \n     interaction with U.S. counterparts. The crucial jobs of \n     crafting new products and features stayed in Silicon Valley. \n     In the end, exporting some jobs ultimately led to adding a \n     small but important number of new, higher-level positions in \n     the U.S.\n       In F2003, ValiCert agreed to be acquired by Tumbleweed \n     Communications Corp., a maker of antispam software with its \n     own offshore operation in Bulgaria. Today, the combined \n     Tumbleweed is growing, and again hiring software architects \n     in Silicon Valley with six-figure salaries, as well as \n     engineers overseas. Without India, Mr. Vigouroux says, ``I \n     don't know if we'd be around today.''\n       ValiCert's experience offers important insights into the \n     debate over the movement of service jobs to lower-cost \n     countries, such as India. Such shifts can save companies \n     money and hurt U.S. workers. But the process is difficult, \n     and the savings typically aren't as great as a simple wage \n     comparison suggests. Some jobs cannot easily or profitable be \n     exported, and trying to do so can risk a customer backlash: \n     In recent months, Dell Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings \n     Inc., for example, moved several dozen call-center and help-\n     desk jobs back to the U.S., after employee and customer \n     complaints.\n       Founded in 1996, ValiCert specializes in software to \n     securely exchange information over the Internet. Banks use \n     ValiCert's software to safeguard electronic funds transfers, \n     health insurers to protect patient medical records. Although \n     still unprofitable, ValiCert conducted an initial public \n     offering in July 2000, in the dying embers of the dot-com \n     boom. In two months, the stock doubled to $25.25.\n       In 2001, however, sales growth slowed, as corporate \n     customers reduced technology purchases. ValiCert had \n     projected that it would break even with quarterly revenue of \n     $18 million, according to Srinivasan ``Chini'' Krishnan, \n     founder and then-chairman. Quarterly expenses had grown to \n     $14 million, but revenue was stalled at less than half that \n     figure. Executives began considering shifting work to India. \n     The ``motivation was pure survival,'' says Mr. Krishnan, who \n     left the company after the Tumbleweed merger.\n       India was a natural choice because of its large pool of \n     software engineers. Moreover, both Mr. Krishnan and \n     ValiCert's then-head of engineering grew up in India and were \n     familiar with large tech-outsourcing firms.\n       Some, including Mr. Jevans, harbored doubts. The Apple \n     Computer Inc. veteran says he preferred ``small teams of \n     awesome people'' working closely together. Nonetheless, that \n     summer, ValiCert hired Infosys Technologies Ltd., an Indian \n     specialist in contract software-programming, to supply about \n     15 people in India to review software for bugs, and to update \n     two older products.\n       With no manager in India, ValiCert employees in the U.S. \n     managed the Infosys workers directly, often late at night or \n     early in the morning because of the time difference. ValiCert \n     also frequently changed the tasks assigned to Infosys, \n     prompting Infosys to shuffle the employees and frustrating \n     ValiCert's efforts to build a team there.\n       Within a few months, ValiCert abandoned Infosys and created \n     its own Indian subsidiary, with as many as 60 employees. Most \n     employees would be paid less than $10,000 a year. Even after \n     accounting for benefits, office operating costs and \n     communications links back to the U.S., ValiCert estimated the \n     annual cost of an Indian worker at roughly $30,000. That's \n     about half what ValiCert was paying Infosys per worker, and \n     less than one-sixth of the $200,000 comparable annual cost in \n     Silicon Valley.\n       To run the new office in India, ValiCert hired Sridhar \n     Vutukuri, an outspoken 38-year-old engineer who had headed a \n     similar operation for another Silicon Valley start-up. He set \n     up shop in January 2002 in a ground-floor office in bustling \n     Bangalore, the tech hub of southern India. The office looked \n     much like ValiCert's California home, except for the smaller \n     cubicles and Indian designs on the partitions. There were no \n     savings on the rent. At $1 a square foot, it matched what \n     ValiCert paid for its Mountain View, Calif., home offices, \n     amid a Silicon Valley office glut.\n       Misunderstandings started right away. U.S. executives \n     wanted programmers with eight to 10 years of experience, \n     typical of ValiCert's U.S. employees. But such ``career \n     programmers'' are rare in India, where the average age of \n     engineers is 26. Most seek management jobs after four or five \n     years. Expertise is security technology, key to ValiCert's \n     products, was even rarer.\n       By contrast, Mr. Vutukuri quickly assembled a group to test \n     ValiCert's software for bugs, tapping a large pool of Indian \n     engineers that had long performed this mundane work.\n       But the Indian manager heading that group ran into \n     resistance. It was ValiCert's first use of code-checkers who \n     didn't report to the same managers who wrote the programs. \n     Those U.S. managers fumed when the team in India recommended \n     in June 2002 delaying a new product's release because it had \n     too many bugs.\n       By midsummer, when Mr. Vutukuri had enough programmers for \n     ValiCert to begin sending bigger assignments to India, U.S. \n     managers quickly overwhelmed the India team by sending a \n     half-dozen projects at once.\n       Accustomed to working closely with veteran engineers \n     familiar with ValiCert's products, the U.S. managers offered \n     only vague outlines for each assignment. The less-experienced \n     Indian engineers didn't include elements in the programs that \n     were considered standard among U.S. customers. U.S. \n     programmers rewrote the software, delaying its release by \n     months.\n       In India, engineer grew frustrated with long silences, \n     punctuated by rejection. Suresh Marur, the head of one \n     programming team, worked on five projects during 2002. All \n     were either cancelled for delayed. Programmers who had worked \n     around the clock for days on one project quit for new jobs in \n     Bangalore's vibrant market. Of nine people on Mr. Marur's \n     team in mid-2002, only three still work for ValiCert. ``The \n     first time people understand,'' he says. ``The second time \n     people understand. The third time it gets to be more of a \n     problem.''\n       In the U.S., executives lurched from crisis to crisis, as \n     ValiCert's revenue dipped further. Each quarter brought more \n     layoffs. By year end, the California office, which once \n     employed 75 engineers, was reduced to 17; the India office, \n     meanwhile, swelled to 45. Engineers ``felt the sword of \n     Damocles was swinging above their cube,'' recalls John \n     Thielens, a product manager.\n       Executives knew they could save more money by exporting \n     more jobs. But they were developing a keener sense of how \n     critical it was to keep core managers in the U.S. who knew \n     ValiCert, its products, and how they were used by customers. \n     ``Even if you could find someone'' with the right skills in \n     India, says Mr. Krishnan, the ValiCert founder, ``it wouldn't \n     make business sense to move the job.''\n       Frustrations came to a head in September 2002, when a \n     prospective customer discovered problems with the log-on \n     feature of a ValiCert program. The anticipated purchase was \n     delayed, causing ValiCert to miss third-quarter financial \n     targets. The India team had recently modified the program, \n     and the glitch prompted U.S. managers to question ValiCert's \n     entire offshore strategy.\n       Relations had long been strained between the U.S. and \n     Indian product teams. John Hines, the Netscape Communications \n     Corp. veteran who headed the tight-knit U.S. product team, \n     thrives on quick responses to customer requests. As his team \n     shrank to six\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\n     engineers from 20, Mr. Hines was assigned three engineers in \n     India. But he viewed the Indians' inexperience and the \n     communication delays, as more a hindrance than a help. \n     ``Things we could do in two days would take a week,'' he \n     says.\n       Mr. Vigouroux, who became CEO in October 2002, admits to a \n     touch of ``panic'' at this point. ValiCert's cash was running \n     low. ``We didn't have a lot of time,'' he says. He conferred \n     with Mr. Hines, who said he wanted to be rid of India, even \n     if it meant a smaller team. Mr. Vigouroux agreed to hire one \n     engineer in California. When he learned of the decision, Mr. \n     Vutukuri says he felt as if he had failed.\n       By contrast, Matt Lourie, who heads ValiCert's other big \n     programming group, welcomed additional help in India. He was \n     struggling to keep pace with customer demands for new \n     features on his product and new versions for different types \n     of computers.\n       At the same time, ValiCert executives were streamlining \n     operations and changing how they divided work between \n     California and India. They gave the India team entire \n     projects--such as creating a PC version of a program \n     initially built for bigger workstations--rather than small \n     pieces of larger projects. U.S. managers began writing more \n     detailed specifications for each assignment to India.\n       ValiCert also killed its three smallest-selling products to \n     focus resources on the remaining two. To improve morale in \n     the U.S., Mr. Vigouroux crowded the remaining employees into \n     one corner of the half-vacant office and installed a ship's \n     bell that he rang each time ValiCert recorded $10,000 in \n     revenue. He made sure the India employees received company-\n     wide e-mails, and conducted multiple sessions of monthly \n     employee meetings so the India group could listen at a \n     convenient hour. Engineering-team leaders began conferring \n     twice a week by telephone, shifting the time of the calls \n     every six months so that it's early morning in one office and \n     early evening in the other.\n       Toward the end of 2002, Mr. Vigouroux began to ring the \n     bell daily, as customers such as Washington Mutual Inc. and \n     MasterCard International Inc. purchased ValiCert's software.\n       By early the next year, ValiCert executives believed the \n     company had stabilized. Revenue increased to $3 million in \n     the fourth quarter of 2002, up 27% from the previous quarter. \n     Expenses declined, and the company neared profitability. \n     Investors detected a pulse, and the stock rose to 46 cents on \n     the Nasdaq Stock Market at the end of January, from a low of \n     20 cents in August 2002.\n       But with just $3 million in cash, ValiCert remained \n     precarious. Mr. Vigouroux started meeting with potential new \n     investors and began talks with Tumbleweed CEO Jeffrey C. \n     Smith.\n       Tumbleweed also had been through significant layoffs and \n     retrenchment, and in February 2003, the companies agreed to \n     merge. The combined Redwood City, Calif., company's 150 \n     engineers today are almost evenly divided among California, \n     the Tumbleweed operation in Bulgaria, and the India office \n     started by ValiCert. In Bulgaria, engineers write and test \n     software, and scan millions of e-mails daily for traces of \n     spam. In India, engineers test software, fix bugs and create \n     new versions of one product. Last September, Tumbleweed \n     released its first product developed entirely in India, a \n     program that lets two computers communicate automatically and \n     securely. Mr. Marur's team had worked on it for over 18 \n     months.\n       Core development for new products remains in California, \n     where engineers are closer to marketing teams and \n     Tumbleweed's customers. Since July, Mr. Lourie's U.S. team \n     has grown to nine engineers, from six.\n       Tumbleweed's fourth-quarter revenue grew 69% from a year \n     earlier, as its net loss shrank to $700,000, and cash \n     increased by $2.4 million. Shares have risen five-fold in the \n     past year.\n       Brent Haines, 36, is a new hire. He joined in October as a \n     $120,000-a-year software architect, charged largely with \n     coordinating the work of the U.S. and India teams. That often \n     means exchanging e-mail from home with engineers in India \n     between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. California time, as Mr. Haines \n     reviews programming code and suggests changes. Such \n     collaboration requires extensive planning, he says, \n     ``something very unnatural to people in software.''\n       ``Nine months ago, people would have said [moving offshore] \n     was the biggest . . . disaster,'' says Mr. Thielens, the \n     product manager. ``Now we're starting to understand how we \n     can benefit.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. This is a story written by Scott Thurm. It is about a \ncompany, ValiCert, that learned key roles must remain in the U.S. for \noutsourcing to work. And the thrust of the article is this company \nrushed, like everybody else. Forty percent of the top 1,000 companies \nin America are now outsourcing their jobs, sort of like chasing into \nMexico back in the 1980s when the financial service sector thought that \nwas the place to be, without much thought. Once these trends begin, \nthey are sort of like sheep following one after another without much \nthought involved.\n  This company ValiCert went racing off to outsource its jobs, reduced \nits employment, saved a lot of money, according to the article, \nexpected to save millions annually while cranking out new software for \nbanks.\n  I am quoting from the article now:\n\n       When sales of their securities software slowed in 2001, \n     executives at ValiCert began laying off engineers in Silicon \n     Valley to hire replacements in India for $7,000 a year.\n       ValiCert expected to save millions while cranking out new \n     software for banks and insurers and government agencies. \n     Senior Vice President David Jevans recalls optimistic \n     predictions that the company would ``cut the budget by half \n     here and hire twice as many people there [in India].'' \n     Colleagues would swap work across the globe every 12 hours, \n     helping ValiCert ``put more people on it and get it done \n     sooner,'' he says.\n       The reality was different. The Indian engineers, who knew \n     little about ValiCert's software or how it was used, omitted \n     features Americans considered intuitive. U.S. programmers, \n     accustomed to quick chats over cubicle walls, spent months \n     writing detailed instructions for overseas assignments, \n     delaying new products. Fear and distrust thrived, and \n     ValiCert's finances deteriorated and co-workers, 14 time \n     zones apart, traded curt e-mails. In the fall of 2002, \n     executives brought back to the U.S. a key project that had \n     been assigned to India, irritating some Indian employees.\n       ``At times we were thinking, what have we done here?'' . . \n     .\n\n  The article goes on; I won't read all of it; the point being sort of \nbuyer beware. This notion that you might be hiring people for a \nfraction of what it would cost to hire someone in the Silicon Valley \nand it is going to allow you to make millions because of laid-off \nAmerican workers and you hire someone 8 or 10 time zones away, has \nbeen, certainly in the case of this particular company, proven to be \nuntrue.\n  So to the point that when a good or service is produced more cheaply \nabroad, it makes more sense to import it than to provide it \ndomestically, I would suggest that the people who wrote the economic \nreport for the President may want to talk to the people at ValiCert. I \ndon't suspect that is one company. I suspect that is true of many \ncompanies. So it is not Biblical.\n  I agree that in certain cases you will make a lot more money by \nfiring people in the United States and getting rid of them. Why should \nyou worry about that? Your job is to provide a bottom line. That is \nyour job.\n  My job is a little different than your job. My job, as a Senator, is \nto not only watch out for you and your company, to make sure you live \nin an environment where you can make a profit, I have an obligation to \nthose people who work for you as well. I didn't get elected to the \nSenate just to guarantee you a bottom line. My job is setting public \npolicy, not quarter by quarter, not just bottom line and yearly report \nto yearly report, but longer than that. That is what we are supposed to \ndo in a Chamber such as this, to think a little longer, to worry about \nthis country, those who are the children of the 21st century and what \nkind of a Nation are they going to inherit after you and I have left. \nThey are going to ask us about what we did at the beginning of the 21st \ncentury when we saw the trend lines reaching out to cause literally \nmillions of people to lose their jobs.\n  One report indicates that in the next 10 years or so we may lose as \nmany as 4 million jobs, a loss of $140 billion in wages, just by \noutsourcing alone.\n  That number may be low, according to those who have done this. I will \nget to the charts in a minute and identify the source of that. I will \nget to the amendment at an appropriate time and talk about the \nspecifics of it. I know I am going to hear that your amendment goes too \nfar, it is too heavyhanded, because I am going to suggest that maybe \nthe use of Federal tax dollars--we ought to have second thoughts about \nsubsidizing this rushing to go overseas to outsource. I cannot stop a \nprivate company with its own dollars deciding to do that. You can make \nit less of an attractive thing through the Tax Code or more attractive \nfor people to stay here, but I certainly cannot stop you from doing it.\n  But I ought to be able to say something about how American taxpayer \nmoney is being used. If their money is being used to cause somebody to \nlose their job and to hire someone for the attraction of the salary \nsomeplace else, maybe taxpayers have a right to be heard on this issue. \nThis amendment says Federal tax, for the purpose of outsourcing--with \nthe exceptions of national security and other provisional\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nwaivers, which I will explain--ought not to be something we are \nsupporting. If you want to do it as a private company, that is your \nbusiness. I don't think you ought to necessarily have a right to Uncle \nSam's taxpayer money to do that at the expense of critical jobs that \nare important for this Nation's future.\n  I will go on in this economic report because I may not have time, \nwhen we get to the amendment, to talk about it. I cited chapter 12, \npage 229, where you have this emphatic statement that it automatically, \nin every case, as I read this, makes more sense to import. They don't \ntalk about outsourcing. They act as if it were a good or a service. I \nknow economists like to suggest that is all it is. But I think people \nin Ohio, Connecticut, or Pennsylvania are more than a good or a \nservice. They may have a family, a home mortgage they are trying to \npay, and they may have other obligations; and they worry about their \nfuture retirement and health care. So to have the cold eye of an \neconomist saying a person out there who has a job in America may find \nit gone because the quarterly report would look a lot better if we can \nhire that person for $7,000 a year rather than paying you $40,000, \n$50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 a year, and you are really nothing more \nthan a good or a service--I think many of us here believe otherwise.\n  These are not just goods or services; these are human beings who help \nto strengthen this country, provide us the kinds of liberties and \nopportunities we enjoy as Americans. I think it is about time we stood \nup for them and what their interests may be--not at the expense of \nothers, but to merely strike a balance. This is not about being against \ntrade, being an isolationist at all. It is merely saying strike some \nbalance before this sort of giddy trend, where company after company is \nsort of playing follow the leader and runs amuck as they send these \njobs willy-nilly offshore; we ought to say let's look at what we are \ndoing and at what ultimate price we may pay.\n  The second point I want to make out of this economic report is a \nreference with regard to what is manufacturing. I don't have the page \nnumber, unfortunately, on this, but I will get it before I finish my \nremarks. It is a highlighted box, and the title of the box that is \nframed out here is ``What Is Manufacturing?'' This economic report says \nthe definition of a manufactured product, however, is not \nstraightforward. When a fast food restaurant sells a hamburger, for \nexample, is it providing a service or manufacturing a product? You may \nsay that is only a question. You know, if this is your question and the \nexample you would cite in your question, what are you thinking of? Do \nyou think it is a debatable item as to whether or not producing a \nhamburger or a hot dog involves manufacturing? This is not some op-ed \npiece; this is the official economic report of this administration's \neconomic policy. In bold print in this economic report they suggest \nthere is a legitimate question over whether or not working at \nMcDonald's or Burger King flipping hamburgers ought to be classified as \na manufacturing job. If you don't think we are in trouble on these \nissues, just read that.\n\n  That is an example of the kind of terribly naive at best, at worst \nrather callous, thinking when it comes to talking about the importance \nof manufacturing. I don't belittle a job somebody holds down working in \na fast food restaurant. For many people out there, that is the only job \nthey can get to provide for themselves and their families. They would \nbe the first to tell you that they hardly think of themselves as being \nin the manufacturing business. Yet, in the administration's official \nreport, it raises the question of whether or not it is a manufacturing \njob. At least this Member gets a sense they are lost on this issue, \nwhen they raise questions as foolish as that.\n  Let me go to some of these charts, if I may. Let me just give you a \nsuggestion of what is happening on the issue of manufacturing. The \nfirst chart I raise here points to the fact that in the last 36 months, \nwe have now lost in the United States of America 2.8 million \nmanufacturing jobs--since January 2001, up until now, the winter of \n2004. That is 2.8 million manufacturing jobs that have gone in this \ncountry. I believe that is the single largest loss of manufacturing \njobs that has occurred since the Great Depression. I understand \ntransitions in the economy. Things happen and move in different \ndirections. But I don't think you can wash your hands of this and say I \nam sorry, but that is the trend line and that is the way life is--sort \nof a laissez-faire approach.\n  We ought to analyze why things are happening, where are the jobs \ngoing, and what are the implications for our country. I understand \nwhere the CEO of a company is coming from, and the board of directors \nor the administration of a company. Their concern is the bottom line \nand whether you have a profit to show the next quarter. I think Members \nof Congress ought to have a different set of questions from whether the \nquarterly report is all right--whether this trend line is going to \ncontinue, and what it means to our country. If this trend line \ncontinues and we end up losing a manufacturing sector, we will deeply \nregret it.\n  I come from a State where I have 5,400 small manufacturers--or I \ndid--in Connecticut. Most of them are small operators, with 5, 10, 15 \npeople, third and fourth generation, producing not just flowers or some \nother item but, rather, significant products, many of which are used in \nthe aircraft engine industry of my State, the manufacture of the \nsophisticated submarines we produce in Connecticut, or other high value \nproducts. These manufacturers employ highly skilled people, producing \nvery valuable pieces of equipment used in some of our most \nsophisticated defense and nondefense products. So when I see these jobs \nand these businesses going, I have to be reminded that we are not going \nto create this overnight. You don't reconstitute the manufacturing base \novernight. Again, I accept we have to make changes and you cannot say \nwe are going to stop this altogether. But I think we have an obligation \nto express our concerns and worries about where we are headed, if we \ndon't speak up and begin to address what this may mean for our country.\n  I am very worried about where these trend lines are going and what it \nmay mean. If we end up continuing to lose jobs and manufacturers, I am \nconcerned about what it may mean for our country if we end up having to \nimport not only the jobs but the products themselves. That is another \nsubject matter we can discuss later. We ought to worry about it as a \ncountry. If we don't do something soon in this area, that is going to \nbe a continuing problem.\n  Let me point out further, to give some idea of where this is all \nhappening, because it is not, as I mentioned, just my State of \nConnecticut. I mentioned my friend and colleague, the Presiding \nOfficer, comes from New Hampshire up in our area. Just to highlight, \nhis small New England State as well had some 22,300 jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector lost in New Hampshire. In my State of Connecticut, \nit is about 32,800, about 10,000 more. That is in the last 36 months.\n  The trend lines are: Pennsylvania, 132,000; Ohio, 153,000 jobs have \nbeen lost; California, 272,000 manufacturing jobs lost; the State of \nWashington, 59,000; Oregon, 21,000; Texas, 149,000; Florida, 52,000; \nGeorgia, 67,000; 142,000 jobs lost in the small State of North \nCarolina. This is all in the last 36 months.\n  I won't go through State after State, but you get some sense of this. \nIt is not isolated to our corner in Connecticut, our small State, or \nthe area of New England: New York State, 115,000 jobs; Michigan, \n121,000; Wisconsin, 168,000; Illinois, 115,000 jobs. It is a worrisome \ntrend. It is going on all across the country.\n  Again, we cannot say this is transitional, I am sorry, America, you \nare going to have to live with this. We ought to respond in a way that \nacknowledges this trend and tries to offer some ideas on how we might \nturn this trend around.\n  I will be glad to share with my colleagues, if they are curious about \ntheir States--I will not go through all 50 States, but there is not a \nState in the country that has not lost manufacturing jobs. Some have \nlost very few. The State of Wyoming lost 700 jobs; North Dakota, 500. \nThat may be the lowest. Arizona, 34,000; New Mexico, 5,000; Colorado, \n37,000; Kansas, 19,000; Arkansas, 29,000; Missouri, 38,000. These job \nlosses have been very painful.\n  We talk about these jobs, and I think the tendency is to talk about \nthem in\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\nand of themselves, the job loss in any manufacturing sector in any \ngiven State. Each manufacturing job supports three other U.S. jobs. \nWhen we end up losing these jobs in the manufacturing sector, there is \na ripple effect.\n  I won't dwell on this, but I think most of my colleagues are aware of \nthis already. When someone loses their source of income in the area of \nmanufacturing, the effects are felt in retail trade, personal/business \nservices, and other manufacturing sectors with the inability of people \nto purchase goods. It is not as if these jobs exist or, when they are \nlost, the only people paying that price are the people who lost the \njob. In effect, it is being felt across the economy as well.\n  Mr. President, 14 million additional jobs are in danger.\n  Now we get into the question of jobs going offshore. I want to give \nsome indication of what is happening. Let's get back to the outsourcing \nquestion. I mentioned manufacturing because a lot of these jobs are \nmoving in that area.\n  We are told--and this is from Time magazine in their February 22 \nissue--that by the year 2015, more than 3 million American jobs are \nprojected to be shipped overseas. We begin to see these trend lines. In \n2005, it moves up to 588,000 which will be outsourced overseas. A few \nyears later that number of jobs goes to 1.6 million, and projections \nare, with no effort being made to change this direction, the number \ngets up to 3 million. We are worried that if we do not speak up now and \ndo something about this trend, we are going to find a continued erosion \nand continued loss of these jobs overseas.\n\n  Let me point out where they are coming from because this may be \nhelpful as well to those interested in this subject matter. There are \n14 million additional jobs in danger of being shipped overseas, as I \nmentioned. Where are they coming from? Office support areas, some 8 \nmillion jobs; business and financial support, 2 million; in the area of \ncomputer and math professionals, close to 3 million; in the area of \nparalegal, legal assistance, diagnostic support, medical transcriptions \nand the like, the numbers are in the thousands, to give some idea where \nwe are going with all of this.\n  It isn't just these low-wage jobs that are going. They are also going \nin the more sophisticated areas as well. I mentioned earlier the story \nin the Wall Street Journal talking about ValiCert. They were talking \nabout jobs in Silicon Valley. I guarantee you we are not talking about \nlow-wage jobs at all. Those are jobs that are fairly well paid, and \nthey are being lost. The trend lines are not good in just raw numbers, \nbut also in sectors of the economy where these jobs are being lost.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer a very specific amendment to \naddress the issue. Very briefly, the amendment would do the following: \nIt will restrict anyone from using Federal tax dollars to ship jobs \noffshore in three different ways. First, the Federal Government may not \nuse Federal taxpayer dollars to procure goods or services to fulfill \ncontracts that use overseas workers at the expense of American jobs.\n  Second, we tell State and local governments that any Federal dollars \nthey receive in the form of a grant or in the form of an appropriation \nby formula or in any other way are not to be used to promote the loss \nof American jobs.\n  I point out that today 40 States outsource jobs. I am told that in \nthe State of Minnesota, if you lose your job and you call up the \nunemployment office, you are going to talk to someone in India about \nwhat your rights and benefits are. I do not need to tell you the \nreaction of those people in that State who lost their job and they are \ntalking to someone offshore to tell them what their benefits are.\n  The third way is, any agency seeking to privatize a government \ncontract being paid with U.S. taxpayer dollars may not enter that \ncontract if it again displaces American workers in favor of offshore \nworkers.\n  In all these cases, we have exceptions on the grounds of national \nsecurity and we allow the Governor or a Federal agency head to, in \neffect, waive these provisions if there is bona fide lack of goods and \nservices in the United States. There is an escape clause here.\n  The obvious question arises, one, on national security, or, two, if \nno one is producing these goods and services here, what are we supposed \nto do? Rather than have the President have to waive the provision, we \nallow a Governor or head of an agency who would be in charge of this \nparticular area to do so.\n  Let me take a few minutes to explain why this is a timely amendment \nand why it is deserving of our support. A gentleman by the name of John \nBowman dedicated 25 years of his life to becoming an information \ntechnology professional, and he was very good at it, I might add. He, \nlike hundreds of thousands of Americans, lost his job because of \noutsourcing. John looked around and realized what happened to him was \nnot an isolated incident. It was part of a massive trend, and he \ndecided to do something about it.\n\n  John will tell you he would be the last person in the world leading a \ngrassroots organization that has practically become a grassroots \nmovement in this country, not just in my State but all across the \nNation. These are white-collar professional people, highly trained, who \nare watching their jobs lost day after day, flying offshore, being \noutsourced.\n  Fortunately, John is now being joined in this fight from people of \nall walks of life--labor unions, small business owners, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. I had a meeting in my State a few days ago on this \nissue. I had people in the same room that I could not put in the same \ntown in Connecticut a year ago--people from the manufacturing sector, \nfrom labor unions, and the private sector coming together. They differ \non a lot of issues, but on this one they are joined in common cause. \nThey recognize what we are experiencing is different from what we \nexperienced before.\n  Today, advances in technology and fewer trade restrictions have made \nit far easier to move goods, information, and jobs around the globe. \nForeign countries are aggressively enticing American businesses with \npromises of lower wages, lax worker protections, and weak environmental \nlaws. Countries such as India and China have figured out if you want to \ncompete in the global marketplace in the best jobs, you need to invest \nin the best education and training of your workers. Rather than trying \nto find a meaningful way to address these new circumstances, this \nadministration would rather pretend the world is still functioning as \nit always did and actually that our economy is on a path to recovery. \nAs a matter of fact, our country is hemorrhaging jobs at an alarming \nrate. As I mentioned already, according to one estimate, by the year \n2015, 3.3 million, close to 4 million jobs and $136 billion in annual \nwages will have moved offshore if we do not do something about it. Four \nhundred of the largest 1,000 companies are already sending jobs \noffshore, with more planning to do so every single day.\n  In a short time I will get a chance to go into this in more detail as \nto why I think this is an important amendment and why I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  I realize it is a loud shout at this moment, and I know others will \nargue that maybe it is louder than it need be, but I do not know any \nother way to express my deep concern about what is happening in my \nState and all across this country if we do not begin to say that at \nleast with taxpayer money you are going to have to act differently. You \nmay decide to do it on your own dime, but you are not going to do it on \nthe dimes of my taxpayers, to send jobs overseas when they are not \nnecessary. You do not need to do that in order to survive.\n  I see my colleague from Montana in the Chamber. I yield the floor and \nat an appropriate time I will come back to this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time for the \nminority has expired. The majority controls an additional 9 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and that it come off \nof our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2647\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there are several aspects of U.S. job \ncreation and retention on which many of us may disagree. I do not \nbelieve, however, that the need for an effective research credit is one \nof them. It will do more for workers, more for jobs, more for high \ntechnology, more for opportunities, and more for the economy than most \nanything else we could pass. In this jobs bill it seems very \nappropriate for us to add this particular amendment to it.\n  This amendment has strong support from both sides of the aisle. It \nhas the unified support of the whole business community. It is the \nright thing to do for U.S. workers, for the U.S. economy, and for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. This amendment will open a door for \nsmall businesses, where most of the jobs are created anyway, to create \nmore jobs, more opportunities, more good products, more high \ntechnology, more ways of keeping the United States at the forefront, \neconomically, in this world than almost anything else we could do.\n  This jobs bill, which itself is an excellent bill that will do a lot \nfor jobs, will be much better for having this amendment added to it. I \nhope my colleagues will all vote for it. It is a worthwhile thing to \ndo. It is something that every one of us ought to vote for.\n  I thank those who have cosponsored this with me, those who have \namended it with their excellent suggestions and the members of the \nSenate Finance Committee who have been champions of this for many \nyears. I believe over the long run this type of amendment is going to \npay off in great dividends.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2651\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:30 \nhaving arrived, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2651.\n  The amendment (No. 2651) was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2647\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2647, as amended.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire what is the business before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill, as amended, is currently pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2660\n\n  Mr. DODD. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2660.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (Data not supplied.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Coleman of Minnesota, Senator Kennedy, Senator Corzine, Senator \nMikulski, and others.\n  Let me say to the floor managers, if I may, I know they are \ninterested in the time. I am prepared to agree to a 1-hour time \nagreement. I do not necessarily expect to take the hour. I know there \nare others who may want to be heard. I know you want to move things \nalong, so I am prepared to have a time agreement and move on my \namendment, give my remarks, and then others can speak, and then vote on \nit, if you would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with this amendment, we are moving along \non this bill. I very much appreciate the Senator's generosity in \nsuggesting a time agreement. At this point, apparently, that is not \nadvisable. But I thank the Senator for making his generous offer and \nfor proceeding nevertheless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will move forward. If, at any moment you \nwould like to have a time agreement, let me know and I will try to \naccommodate you so you can move on to other matters.\n  I have already spoken about the amendment during the time between \n2:30 and around 3:30, describing, in a sense, what the amendment would \ndo and the rationale for the amendment. I will be glad to go back over \nthis amendment again for my colleagues and then engage in any debate or \ndiscussion about it.\n  In a sense, I am preaching to the choir when I talk about this issue \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle because we all painfully \nknow what has happened in the last 36 months in our country. We have \nlost around 2.8 million manufacturing jobs in the United States. I have \nlaid out on this chart I have in the Chamber how that breaks down State \nby State across the country.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, we have lost some 32,000 jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector; California, 272,000; Ohio has lost around 153,000 \njobs; in Illinois, 115,000; Texas--the Presiding Officer's State--\n150,000 jobs.\n  So certainly we all appreciate the fact there has been a tremendous \nerosion in a very critical area in our economy.\n  We also know there is another phenomena occurring, and at an \naccelerated pace; that is, the outsourcing of many jobs, including some \nmanufacturing jobs, around the globe, and it is accelerating at warp \nspeed.\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\n  We now know there are literally 400 of the top 1,000 companies in the \nUnited States outsourcing their jobs to India or China or other nations \naround the globe. Mr. President, 40 of the 50 States now outsource \njobs.\n  My amendment simply says--and there are waivers in here and the like. \nI understand, although I do not like it, if a company decides on its \nown dime it is going to outsource a job. I disagree with that. I think \nthey are wrong to do it, but it certainly is their right to do it. We \ncan offer tax incentives to encourage people to stay here, tax \ndisincentives so they do not go offshore, but ultimately a company can \ndecide for itself.\n  It is another matter with taxpayer money, with the money that \nAmerican taxpayers send to Washington. The idea that we would use their \ndollars to outsource an American job is something on which I think we \nought to speak loudly and clearly. We ought to say: Look, we disagree \nwith that. We don't think you ought to be able to do that.\n\n  So this amendment, in three different areas, very simply says: First, \nthe Federal Government may not use Federal taxpayer money to procure \ngoods and services to fulfill contracts that use overseas workers at \nthe expense of American jobs. Second, we tell State and local \ngovernments that any Federal dollars they receive in the form of a \ngrant, in the form of an appropriation, or any other way, that they are \nnot to use those Federal dollars to promote the loss of American jobs \nfor the creation of offshore jobs. And, third, we say any agency \nseeking to privatize a Government contract being paid with U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars may not enter into that contract if it, again, \ndisplaces American workers in favor of offshore workers.\n  Now, very quickly, in anticipation of some of the arguments we may \nhear, we provide waivers and exceptions on grounds of national \nsecurity, and we also allow Governors or Federal agency heads to waive \nthese provisions if there is a bona fide lack of comparable goods or \nservices in the United States.\n  In this legislation, we also, of course, make it clear that the \nGovernment procurement agreements between the United States and some 27 \nother nations, that are predominantly Western Europe countries, are not \naffected by the prohibitions contained in this bill. Those 27 nations \ndo not include, I would point out, India or the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  So the major sources of outsourcing are not affected by those \nprovisions. Thus, we are in complete compliance with the WTO and every \nother formal agreement we have. We are not in violation of any of those \nagreements as a result of this amendment.\n  Now, I had a meeting in my State--and I assume my colleagues may have \nhad similar kinds of gatherings--where people came together who you \ncould not have put in the same county a year ago on this issue. I am \ntalking about my chambers of commerce, my manufacturing associations, \nand my labor unions--all coming together saying: When is Washington \ngoing to say something about this outsourcing that is going on?\n  If we continue to allow these jobs to flow out of our country, then I \nthink we run the risk, at critical junctures, of having the human \ntalent necessary for us to provide those services and to produce those \ngoods which will allow us to compete effectively in the 21st century. \nOnce you lose jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector, or some \nof the high-skilled areas, it is very difficult to go back and re-\ncreate those jobs, to re-create those manufacturing centers.\n  Let me point out an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal \nthis morning. In fact, I have already included it in the Record. But \nthe ValiCert company--and I think this is a front-page story or nearly \na front-page story in the Wall Street Journal--discovered that \noutsourcing was no great success for them. They did it and discovered \nthat the value they were getting for the jobs and products being \nproduced did not equal that produced here in the United States. They \nhave reversed that decision.\n  So when you read in this economic report, prepared for the President \nof the United States, last month, in February-- and I will quote the \nreport for my colleagues where they state, in absolute terms, on page \n229 of this report:\n\n       When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it \n     makes more sense to import it than to make or provide it \n     domestically.\n\n  Well, tell that to the ValiCert company. They did not discover that. \nCertainly, while that may be true of a bottom line of a company, if you \nare trying to preserve jobs in this country, which is a responsibility \nwe bear in this body, and not just to those companies but to the people \nwho work for them--an American job is not just a good or a service. An \nAmerican job has implications that go beyond just the dollar amount \nlost of income in wages or salaries. It means also that a family may \nnot pay their home mortgage and may not be able to provide the goods \nand services that allow our economy to grow and expand. It means \nfamilies are under more strain and stress because they have lost the \nsource of income to provide for themselves.\n  So this ought not be a partisan issue. This ought to be something on \nwhich we stand united. This is not being an isolationist. I am a free \ntrader. I have been so in the years I have been here. I have supported \nmany, many free trade agreements, and I opposed some as well, but I \nhonestly believe if you are going to be an effective trader, a free and \nfair trader in the 21st century, then you ought not squander and give \nup the very jobs that make it possible for you to compete in this \nglobal economy.\n  So I am deeply concerned that if we do not say something, \nparticularly with U.S. taxpayer money that is being used to subsidize \nthis outsourcing of jobs, then we are failing to understand what is \ngoing on across this country. In State after State after State, the \ntrend lines are there in manufacturing. It is also occurring in other \nsectors in the economy.\n  Let me share with my colleagues, as shown on this chart, indication \nof where the outsourcing of these jobs is occurring. Presently, it is \noccurring in areas such as office support. The estimate is 14 million \nadditional jobs, by the way, will be lost and shipped overseas over the \nnext several years. The estimates are about 8 million will occur in \noffice support areas; in computer and math professionals, close to 3 \nmillion jobs lost in that area; business and financial services, over 2 \nmillion jobs; paralegals, diagnostic support services, medical \ntranscriptions, over 94,000.\n  So it is not just low-wage, low-salary jobs that are going but very \nsophisticated, high-technology jobs that could be leaving our country \nas well. That makes us weaker. It is not in the national security \ninterests of the United States to be losing these critical jobs at a \ntime when we need them most in order to provide for the economic growth \nof our own Nation.\n  So while I understand, from a business perspective, your job is to \nlook at quarterly reports, to try to improve the bottom line, our job \nin the Senate and the Congress of the United States goes beyond looking \nat quarterly reports.\n  We should look generationally. I don't want my generation to be the \nfirst generation of Americans which leaves the coming generation less \nwell off than every other succeeding generation has left their children \nand their grandchildren. We are at risk of doing that if we don't step \nup at this juncture and say we need to stop or at least discourage this \noutsourcing of jobs that is occurring at a rapid pace every single day.\n  It is hard not to pick up a U.S. newspaper in any city and read where \none corporation, one business after another, is making the decision to \noutsource more jobs. I think we ought to say, let's slow down. Let's \nhave some balance. Let's not use taxpayer money to allow these jobs to \nbe lost. That is the thrust of the amendment.\n  I hope we will have overwhelming support for this idea. This bill is \nan appropriate place to be debating it. It is something that could make \na huge difference for those who are worrying whether we are paying \nattention at all. We have just debated over the last 5 weeks medical \nmalpractice, providing immunization for gun manufacturers. We have had \na bill on pensions. But we have not spent 5 minutes debating the issue \nof what is happening to America's jobs. That is the big issue.\n  Look at any survey right now. Ask the American people what they worry\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nabout the most. It is the loss of jobs. They are outraged we have \nnothing to say when it comes to outsourcing of jobs to other nations, \nand we are not standing up and defending our own workforce.\n  In this same economic report I cited earlier, to give you some idea \nof why people get discouraged, I mentioned earlier the quote suggesting \nit was an automatic thing that outsourcing of jobs was good or, as they \ncall it, importing of jobs. That is the way they describe it. I \nmentioned already a company identified in a Wall Street Journal article \nthis morning, ``Lesson in India, Not Every Job Translates Overseas.'' I \nencourage my colleagues to look at that article as one example of a \ncompany that discovered outsourcing was bad for business, not good.\n  In this same economic report prepared by the President's top economic \nadvisors, they raised the following question:\n\n       The definition of a manufactured product, however, is not \n     straightforward. When a fast food restaurant sells a \n     hamburger, for example, is it providing a service or inputs \n     for manufacturing a product?\n\n  If this was some sort of cartoon in the paper, I might have laughed \nat it, but it is part of an official document, an economic report \nprepared by the President's top economic advisers which suggests \nthrough the question that flipping a hamburger or cooking a hot dog is \na manufacturing job. You get some idea and sense of where the outrage \nof the American public is coming on why we are unable to speak to this \nissue.\n  Again, I don't care if you are a Democrat or Republican, what your \npolitics or ideology is. We have to stand up and defend our country in \na moment like this. I worry about losing these jobs.\n  I mentioned earlier I had some 5,400 manufacturers in my State \nemploying well over 240,000 people. We have lost about 35,000 jobs in \nthe last 36 months. My manufacturers produce critical components for \nsome of the most sophisticated defense technologies in the Nation. If \nyou lose that manufacturing base, it is not just the loss of a \nmanufacturing job or the loss of a good little company, it is also a \ncritical issue when it comes to national security needs. Many of these \nsmall manufacturers produce critical components and parts for some of \nthe most sophisticated defense technologies in our Nation.\n\n  I mentioned earlier my friend and colleague from Texas. The number of \njobs there, 150,000. I know this Senator has many of these small \ncompanies that are producing those parts for defense companies, defense \ntechnologies. There is a ripple effect. We know as well, beyond the \nimplications for our national security, for every one of these jobs \nthat are lost in the manufacturing sector, there are jobs lost in other \nsectors. It is not just that job that is lost or that family that is \naffected. Each manufacturing job supports three other U.S. jobs. So \nwhen we lose these jobs, we also feel it in the retail trade, in the \nprofessional services, and in manufacturing as well.\n  I apologize if I get heated about this subject, but it is painful to \nread some of this cold-eyed analysis that suggests somehow you just \nhave to stomach this or weather this, that this is just one of these \ncyclical or structural occurrences in the national economy, and these \nstatistics, as troublesome as they are, are nothing more than that, \nstatistics.\n  Behind every one of those statistics, behind every one of those \nnumbers I cite, is usually a head of household or people trying to keep \ntheir families together. They are not just statistics. These are \nAmerican citizens. These are human beings who are doing everything they \ncan to live by the rules and provide for their families. They want to \nknow whether their Congress--they don't identify themselves when they \nget up in the morning as a Democrat or Republican; they get up in the \nmorning and worry about their families and their future--gets it, if we \nunderstand it, and whether we are willing to do anything about it.\n  This is an attempt by myself and my colleague from Minnesota and \nothers to say at least when it comes to your tax dollar, we are going \nto say to the States, localities, and other businesses with waiver \nprovisions here, you are not going to use those dollars to outsource an \nAmerican job, not on our watch. You may decide to do it with your own \nmoney, but you will not do it with American taxpayer money. That is why \nwe offer this amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota for any comments he \nwould like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Connecticut. I am proud of working with \nthe President to grow jobs. I firmly believe, from my days as a mayor, \nwhen you cut taxes, you shape an environment in which folks invest. And \nwhen they invest, mom and dad have a job. The best welfare program is a \njob. The best housing program is a job. Access to health care comes \nwith a job, most often. So we have to do what is necessary to grow \njobs. We are moving in that direction. Clearly, more needs to be done.\n  Changing the economy at times reminds me of turning around one of \nthose oar boats in Lake Superior: You have to get it moving in the \nright direction. I believe we are moving in the right direction, but \nmore has to be done.\n  We have an opportunity with the Dodd amendment to do more, to make \nsure we use taxpayer dollars wisely, in a way that prevents the \noutsourcing of American jobs and grows jobs here.\n  The underlying bill we are dealing with, the Jumpstart JOBS Act, is \nmoving us in that direction. We have to do more. We are doing it right \nhere.\n  I am one who has supported and supports expanding markets. I \nunderstand the importance of trade in terms of growing jobs. This \ninitiative is not designed to step in the way of our efforts to expand \nand broaden our capacity to find new markets for our products. On the \ncontrary, what it does is ensures those firms which have exemplary \ngoods and services to sell have a fair shake at contracts involving \nFederal dollars.\n  This issue has come up in Minnesota. From conversations with my \nGovernor, it is clear--and I understood this when I was a former \nmayor--we have an obligation to get the best possible value for \ntaxpayers. We have to look at the bottom line. But at the same time we \nhave to be concerned about the impact on our State and national economy \nof foreign offshoring when other options are available, when the work \ncan be done here.\n  I call this commonsense legislation. Again, I support trade as a way \nto create wealth and jobs. But for a government at any level to \ncontract out with foreign entities for delivery of federally funded \nU.S. programs is tantamount to Detroit, MI buying a fleet of foreign-\nmade squad cars. It doesn't make any sense. It flies in the face of \ncommon sense.\n  Recent news reports noted that under a $16.8 million contract with an \nArizona firm, calls to a Minnesota toll-free number for help with lost \nand stolen food stamp cards are being routed to Bombay, India. Under a \n$13.3 million contract, software programs in India are helping build a \nWeb-based system to automate eligibility for Medicaid and other health \ncare benefits to low-income Minnesotans.\n  The administration of U.S. Government programs ought to be done here \nat home in the U.S. Even if some of the work is outsourced to private \nvendors, the thought of our Medicaid or food stamp programs being run \nout of someplace in India would offend most Minnesotans' sensibilities, \nand it offends mine.\n  We have an opportunity to talk about what we do with taxpayer \ndollars. Would you use those taxpayer dollars in a way that fosters the \ngrowth and development of American jobs or do we send them overseas? I \nthink common sense says we use them here.\n\n  My colleague and I may disagree at times on tax policy or on a range \nof issues. But this is an issue that should cut across partisan lines. \nWe have an interest in growing jobs in this country and this is a way \nto make commonsense use of taxpayer dollars. I am proud to stand in \nsupport of my colleague's amendment to this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I also rise to support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Connecticut. It is very hard for people in my State \nand across this country to read the President's\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\neconomic report and hear economic theory that is pronounced in \neconomics 101, that somehow or another 19th century comparative \nadvantage is the basis on which we ought to be working jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Folks are very concerned when they don't have work. That is a very \nsimple principle of economics. We are seeing so many of our \nmanufacturing jobs go, and now 40 out of 50 of our States are taking \njobs that are government jobs and shipping them overseas and \nundermining our economy here. That is not highfalutin economics. That \nis taking money out of the pockets of people who drive our economy and \nmake a difference in our communities. It has all those multiplier \neffects other economists might talk about. Then you don't collect tax \nrevenues, you don't have people spending money back into the economy \nand driving it. A Senator talked about manufacturing jobs, but there is \na leverage or multiplier effect on government jobs as well.\n  This is really out of touch with the American people, when we believe \nour policy ought to be to encourage outsourcing. Here, with taxpayer \ndollars, in the Federal Government, we have an opportunity to say, no, \nthis is not the direction we ought to take. We should not be moving \njobs overseas that would be very properly done here at home. We see it \nin the manufacturing sector. I am not sure I totally agree we ought to \nlet everybody look at their quarterly bottom line and move. I think we \nneed to understand there are national security interests at stake on \njobs we have right here at home. We need to make sure we have a \nmanufacturing sector that can actually produce steel, manufacture the \nweapons that protect our men and women when they go to war. We need to \nhave that strength and it needs to be substantial.\n\n  We need to work to make sure our technology is under our control, the \nprivacy of the information that flows in. I think we ought to push back \nagainst all this outsourcing for a lot of reasons that don't just deal \nwith economics. But it is absolutely unfathomable that we would take \nState and local folks, Federal Government people, and ship their jobs \noverseas at the cost of not being able to have the overall economic \nimpact of this. I think, particularly with the waivers the Senator from \nConnecticut has built into these programs, we have a program that will \nmake a difference.\n  It is not enough to talk about translating hamburger-flipping jobs \ninto reclassifying manufacturing as a means to solve an outsourcing \nproblem. It is incredible, absolutely incredible, the illogic we see \nrunning through this economic report.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut has put together a response that \nmakes sense. We are going to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to make sure \nwhen we have Government jobs, they stay here. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. I think it is absolutely essential the American people know \nwe are fighting for their best interests at home on the floor of the \nSenate. This is the most direct, clear method of pushing back against \nwhat is a very wrongheaded approach to creating jobs in America.\n  Again, I am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I thank my colleague from New \nJersey for his support, and my colleague from Minnesota as well.\n  My colleague from New Jersey is no stranger to these issues. I made \nnote before of what is happening in Minnesota and other States. In \nConnecticut, we have lost 32,000 manufacturing jobs. New Jersey has \nlost over 55,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator will yield for a quick statement, on \nFriday, we closed the last Ford production facility in New Jersey, and \nwe are on track to have complete closure of the auto industry in New \nJersey, which used to be one of the heartlands of auto production, \noutside of Michigan. It is very much reflected in the kinds of numbers \nthe Senator is talking about.\n  We were supposed to be replacing those jobs with technology, \ninformation systems and telecommunications equipment, and now we see \nthose jobs moving offshore just as much, and some are reflected in \nthose numbers. That is why it is so important to stanch some of that \nmovement by the kind of action that would be taken in reflection of the \namendment of the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I mentioned earlier there was an article in this morning's \nWall Street Journal entitled ``Lesson in India: Not Every Job \nTranslates Overseas.'' I want to ask my colleague a question. Because \nof his background in business, he understands those issues better than \nmost of us. This reads:\n\n       When sales of their security software slowed in 2001, \n     executives at ValiCert Inc. began laying off engineers in \n     Silicon Valley to hire replacements in India for $7,000 a \n     year.\n\n  It says:\n\n       The reality was different. The Indian engineers, who knew \n     little about ValiCert's software or how it was used, omitted \n     features Americans considered intuitive. U.S. programmers, \n     accustomed to quick chats over cubicle walls, spent months \n     writing detailed instructions for overseas assignments, \n     delaying new products. Fear and distrust thrived as \n     ValiCert's finances deteriorated, and co-workers, 14 time \n     zones apart, traded curt e-mails. In the fall 2002, \n     executives brought back to the U.S. a key project that had \n     been assigned to India, irritating many Indian employees.\n       ``At times, we are thinking, `What have we done here?' '' \n     recalls John Vigouroux, who joined ValiCert in July 2002 and \n     became chief executive three months later.\n\n  Tell me a bit about this. I think the assumption is made \nautomatically, and certainly in this economic report prepared for the \nPresident by his administration, it makes a categorical statement that \noutsourcing of jobs is always a good thing because it improves the \nbottom line. Here is an example of a company which had a very different \nexample. Aside from the obvious reduction in payroll by hiring people \nin another country to do the job, and firing Americans, are there also \nexamples where this kind of activity has actually been bad for business \nand not necessarily automatically good for business, as suggested by \nthis report?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Well, the Senator from Connecticut raises a good point \nbecause I think when business decides it wants to outsource 14 time \nzones away or 12 time zones away, there are enormous synergies in \nbusiness that are lost--the ability for people to work in similar \nspace, to get the economies of the consolidation of ideas, working with \npeople. It doesn't work nearly as well. As a matter of fact, a lot of \nbusinesses are consolidating so they can make a lot of their operations \nmuch more sympathetic with each other. These are business principles a \nlot of folks follow.\n  I don't think it is as obvious as is commented in the economic report \nof the President, but I guarantee sometimes the short-term benefits \nthat somebody might see on a quarterly report, because they have \nlowered their loss, are grossly offset by long-term costs because they \nlose the technological innovation of having people work together. They \nlose the economies of scale, and the potential long-term costs, aside \nfrom the social costs the Senators from Connecticut, Minnesota, and New \nJersey have been talking about, are huge.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for those comments. They are very \nenlightening. It is further indication that these trend lines are \nmoving forward.\n  There has been a report in Time magazine that indicates we are \nlooking at, some indicate over the coming years as many as 14 million, \n15 million jobs to be outsourced if we do not begin to do something \nabout it. In the near term, I think the number is between 3 and 4 \nmillion with a loss, by the way, just looking at revenue loss, of wages \nlost--forget everything else, forget what happens when a person loses \ntheir job and the ripple effects that occur--just in lost wages it is \nabout $140 billion.\n  We know what kind of budget deficit we are in already. I don't think \nthis figure has been projected onto those numbers at all. We look at \nrevenues coming in, and we look at what expenditures for which we have \nto account, and a loss of $136 billion to $140 billion in wages, lost \nbecause of outsourcing over the next decade or less, ought to be a \nmatter of deep concern, even if you are not affected or moved by what \nhappens to families or heads of households who are trying to provide \nfor the needs of their families.\n  The fact that we lose that much salary and wages going out ought to \nbe of great concern. I mention that as an additional implication of \nwhat is caused by outsourcing.\n  Again, I said earlier, we can offer incentives for people to stay, we \ncan offer\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\ndisincentives in the Tax Code for them not to go, but I don't know, for \nthe life of me, why we ought to be taking American taxpayers' money--we \ninsult the taxpayer to say, I am going to use your money to fire \nsomeone in this company and hire someone someplace else to do the job \nat a fraction of the cost because it is going to improve your bottom \nline.\n  I don't know how the Senator feels, but the societal implications are \nprofound. Our job is not only to make sure there is wealth creation in \nthe country, but also we bear a responsibility beyond quarterly reports \nto see to it, from a generational standpoint, that we are going to \nleave this country at least as in good a shape as we inherited from our \nparents.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The $140 billion the Senator from Connecticut spoke \nabout with regard to salaries on the chart the Senator previously \nshowed, there is a multiplier effect. It is almost three times that \nvalue to the economy. The Senator had the chart which showed the full \nimplications. It is remarkable what is given up when our Nation loses \nthese jobs overseas. It is not just those salaries. When you take the \nfull implication, because you also have to look at the tax revenues \nthat come back into the coffers of State, local, and Federal \ngovernments, these numbers could be even larger. This is just showing \nthe impact of what the multiplier effect is for the economy.\n\n  These numbers are huge. So the undermining of the well-being of our \neconomy by this outsourcing element is just way more profound than I \nthink is being discussed and is an extraordinary misrepresentation and \na mistake for the administration to believe that this is something we \nought to be embracing and encouraging.\n  There is another element that needs to be thought about. Every time \nthose outsourcing jobs cost an American job, then that individual has \nto compete for another job. Right now, for all but the top 20 percent \nof our economy, we are seeing declining real wages.\n  The fact is, people are competing for lesser quality jobs that pay \nless than the jobs that are leaving. I think we have seen estimates \nthat it is about 20 percent less that an individual makes in the next \njob they take after they have been laid off. It is profoundly wrong for \nthe administration to embrace such a dangerous idea both for the \neconomic power and also the real hurt that I think it brings to the \nindividual loss.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. It is worthwhile to make the point \nthat actually watching the buying power, the wealth of individuals \nbeing reduced, overall our country suffers from that--obviously the \nfamilies do--but when you reduce that buying power, that wealth, \nimplications are being felt throughout our economy.\n  These happen from a structural standpoint. But when you allow it to \ngo on with Federal money being used--again, as I say, I would not be \nparty, as much as I may object, to companies that want to do this. I \nthink they are wrong to do it. They are making a mistake. It is harmful \nto our country. On their dime, I guess they have a right to do it. But \non our dime, they ought not have the right to do it, and this is the \nAmerican taxpayers' dime.\n  I don't think we ought to be saying to them, You can take your \nFederal taxpayer money and pay somebody offshore to do it, losing an \nAmerican job that could be done here. I don't think that is right, and \nthat is the purpose of this amendment. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. My good friend from New Jersey has to leave the floor. I \ncompliment the Senator for what he is trying to do. This clearly is the \nissue, the problem that faces our country as it will certainly for the \nrest of the year and probably for the indefinite future.\n  I am wondering, in addition to the approach suggested today--and \nthere probably are additional proposals, too. This is a complex problem \nand requires a complex solution. It reminds me of a quote I am fond of \nmaking. H.L. Mencken once said: For every complicated problem there is \na simple solution, and it is usually wrong.\n  In my judgment, this administration not only is sort of laissez-faire \nbut kind of going AWOL on this issue. I don't see a plan. I don't see a \nway to deal with job loss that passes the smell test. In addition, \nwouldn't it help to be much more aggressive in enforcing our trade \nlaws?\n  One thing that bothers me, frankly, is that we are going about \ngetting trade agreements with minuscule economies. The big bang for the \nbuck is enforcing our trade laws, say, with respect to India or China \nor maybe the European Union. There are lots of examples.\n  We hear about all the call centers in India. We don't hear much about \nmany products by American companies being sold in India, and the \nIndians are very much violating the intellectual property agreements. \nBillions of dollars are being lost to American companies that could be \nspent in America because other countries are not living up to their \ninternational obligations.\n\n  I was wondering if the Senators agree that is one of the additional \nways we can take to keep more jobs in America? Let's open up markets in \nother countries so we can export more.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Montana is exactly right, some of the \nregulatory restrictions or ability to actually penetrate some of these \nmarkets, while they may meet the letter of the law with regard to trade \nagreements, are virtually impossible, particularly in the services \nwhere we supposedly have the comparative advantage.\n  I think unless we are prepared to deal on all fronts--enforcing our \ntrade agreements, particularly with large economies--we are not going \nto see even the theoretical benefits coming back of open trade markets. \nThe situation is very true in the old industry that I worked in, \nfinancial services. It is very hard to penetrate these large economies \nabout which the Senator has talked.\n  So we give up the jobs in outsourcing, but we are not getting the \nability to actually provide the services that would make up for some of \nthose jobs back here at home.\n  It goes back to a miscast presentation of a concept that is fine in \nEconomics 101 books on comparative advantage but makes no sense in the \neveryday lives of working men and women in America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The point I am trying to make is, we Americans pride \nourselves on being fair and open, but I don't know that other countries \nare as fair and open when it comes to trade.\n  We are not pure. We do not wear a white hat. Other countries are not \nnecessarily Darth Vaders and wear black hats. But I think it is also \ntrue the shade of gray of our hat is a lot lighter shade of gray than \nthe shade of gray of their hats. They do not agree to fair trade in the \nmain. I am talking about the bigger countries. India is the best \nexample, the most blatant example.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Montana, as well, for his \ncomments. I think they are poignant. While we do not specifically \naddress those issues, he is absolutely correct. It is another piece of \nthis puzzle on which we need to do a far better job. I have had some \nrecent discussions with ambassadors from some of the Latin American \ncountries and have suggested to them they ought to start talking to us \nabout having labor standards and environmental standards from their \nperspective.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DODD. If free and fair trade is to work well, it ought to be \nraising the quality of life and the level of wealth accumulation by \npeople in these countries with whom we are about to enter into trading \nagreements. That is good for us, and it is good for them. Instead of us \nhaving to fight for it here, they ought to be fighting for it and \ninsisting upon it on behalf of their own constituents.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me ask the Senator a question on that same point. \nWould the Senator agree that in the main, most of the countries we are \ntalking about--we are talking about environmental standards and labor \nstandards in these countries--generally do not most of those countries \nwant to sign free trade agreements with the United States because it \nadds to their prestige; it helps them market their products and helps \nthem gain standing in the world? Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my friend from Montana, it is as obvious as \nanything. These are the shelves--this is the marketplace you want to \nbe. If you are any\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\nother country in the world, you want to be able to access the greatest \nconsumer market in the history of mankind, which is the United States \nof America. This is the most inviolable place to which you can sale \nyour services and your goods.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Would the Senator also agree that it is the case that \nmost of these countries probably want to enjoy the status or the \nprestige of having a free trade agreement with the United States? \nCertainly we are not going to negotiate an agreement that gives away \nthe store. This is a bargain for an exchange. Is it not also true that \nit therefore is a mistake for the United States to in effect be \nnegotiating against itself; that is, for some in the administration to \nsay, no, we do not want those labor standards, we do not want those \nenvironmental standards, whereas in truth those countries, frankly, are \nthe ones we should be talking with because they themselves want these \nagreements and would be much more willing to agree to them?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely. The whole point of these trading agreements, \nbecause we are a high value country, obviously, and we do not want to \ndumb down our system, we want to see improving quality products, you \nneed to sell them to somebody. If the countries with whom you are \nentering trading agreements do not have a population that can afford to \nbuy your higher value goods and services, then the trading arrangement \nis going to be all one way and not the other. So it is very much in our \nown interest, from a larger perspective, to be able to have it.\n\n  Too often it is U.S. interests that are insisting that labor and \nenvironmental agreements not be included because they want to be able \nto enter those markets and hire people at those depressed wages and be \nable to operate plants that do not face environmental regulations. So \nthey see it as advantageous for them. They then turn around and sell \nthose goods back here.\n  They are not thinking about an American corporation that wants to \nsell its quality product there. It is very shortsighted and, of course, \nit only leads to further encourage the outsourcing of jobs, which is \nexactly what is going on.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The point being that the other countries themselves are \nmuch less concerned about this.\n  Mr. DODD. And they should be more concerned about it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Exactly.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague would be interested to know, in my \nconversations, very informally at this point, but I am finding a great \ndeal of receptivity to the point the Senator from Montana is making; \nthat, in fact, they should be insisting upon these points. The politics \nof their own countries are changing and they are insisting if you are \ngoing to enter these agreements, that this be a part of it as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DODD. We may be looking at a new era where it is not going to be \njust people in this Chamber calling for these kinds of things, but, in \nfact, people in these other countries are going to be insisting upon it \nas well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not know how much time the Senator has, but I might \nask, if the Senator does not mind, to address another subject with \nrespect to jobs. Would the Senator agree, as we try to find a solution \nto this problem, that one of the issues we have to face and have to \nfocus on is high health care costs that American companies pay and \nface? It is a very complex problem, clearly, but a lot of companies \nunfortunately are lowering their employee health benefits or their \nretiree health benefits because they say it is necessary in order to do \nbusiness; the world is just so competitive.\n  The first casualty is those who lose their health benefits. They are \nscared to death, frankly, about lowered health benefits or no health \nbenefits. On top of that, it is partly, it seems to me, because we do \nhave high health care costs in America.\n  In fact, the last study I saw is that we pay twice as much per capita \non health than does the next highest country. I do not know if we are \ntwice as healthy as people in other countries, but we pay a lot, and \nthat has to be the cost of doing business.\n  What I am getting at, is part of the solution of this some way to \naddress efficiencies in health care and quality of health care, \nrecognizing that employees of companies in other countries have their \nhealth covered by the government, where that is not true in our \ncountry; that that, too, is a part of the problem here? If we are \nhonest with ourselves, we are going to have to figure out some way to \nget our hand on that one, too.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Montana. He \nis absolutely correct. I did not even get into the issue of what \nhappens here. Obviously, when you fire someone, lay someone off, you \nhire someone offshore to do the job, there is absolutely no requirement \nthat the fired or laid-off worker is necessarily going to be able to \nget any kind of health care coverage from the former employer. Even \nwhen you have retired with full benefits there is no guarantee, as we \nlearned through the discussion of the Medicare bill that was before us \nonly a few months ago.\n\n  So in addition to the lost jobs and wages--that is all I have been \ntalking about today--there are benefits that are incredible, and when \npeople lose those benefits it adds to the roles of the 44 million \npeople in this country who have no health insurance.\n  They get health care. It might be showing up in an emergency room, \nwhich increases the costs of everyone else who has health care, as we \nall know. Fortunately, in this country if people get sick they can show \nup someplace and get some kind of coverage.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Usually that is true.\n  Mr. DODD. It is not free, and it adds tremendously to the cost of \nothers as well. So the implications, in addition to laying someone \noff--as we see now the thousands of jobs that have gone--the Senator \nfrom Montana is very accurate in pointing this out when looking at this \nissue.\n  Here we are taking Federal taxpayer money. That is what my amendment \naddresses. It says: With Federal taxpayer money you can lay someone off \nand hire someone else and pay them basically with Federal dollars. So \nwe are, in a sense, not only causing that person to lose their job in \nthis country but also their health care benefits and other benefits \nthey may have, not to mention what it does to a family.\n  Talk about keeping families together, the single largest reason why \nfamilies break up is economics. Every study in the world that has been \ndone on that institution says it is economics.\n  As a matter of Federal policy, in effect we are saying we are going \nto outsource these jobs, causing a great disruption in America and \nfamilies' lives. The Senator from Montana is so right to point out that \nthe health care implications, because we have not yet sorted this out, \nare huge.\n  Again, I come back to the point, I do not accept it, I do not like \nit, but if someone on their dime wants to lay someone off and hire \nsomeone else, I do not like it and I wish I could do something about it \nand I certainly want to support measures that I know of the Senator \nfrom Montana and the Senator from California, such as giving tax \nincentives to encourage people to stay here, but when someone does it \nwith Uncle Sam's nickel, with the taxpayers' money, then I say, no. I \nhave some control over that.\n  I am offering an amendment today that says when it comes to U.S. \ntaxpayer money, you are not going to lay somebody off and hire somebody \nelse 12 time zones away to do the job. You may do it on your dime but \nnot on their dime.\n  I will mention one other subject matter that I know my colleague from \nMontana and my colleague from California care about, and that is \nprivacy. That is one of the things we have not talked about at all on \nthis issue.\n  I pointed out earlier--I apologize to my colleague from California \nbecause she cannot see this chart, but I was talking earlier about \nwhere these jobs are going, from what sectors of our economy they are \ncoming from, the 14 million additional jobs in danger of being shipped \noverseas. One of the areas we are talking about is in the area of \nmedical, diagnostic and medical services. This covers a little more \nthan almost 300,000 jobs in that area.\n  We all know what is happening. Today, with information technology, x-\nrays can be transmitted at the speed of light or faster.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are going to give you a Nobel Prize for that.\n  Mr. DODD. All sorts of medical information.\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\n  We have provisions of law in this country that say you cannot share \ncertain private medical information with insurance companies or \nemployers without consent. Medical information is now being processed \nby someone who has been hired 12 time zones away--all of a sudden that \ninformation is no longer well-protected. So as we see the increase in \nthese diagnostic support services and medical transcriptions going \noffshore, then the very protections we ought to have as Americans are \nalso being lost. I don't cover that in my amendment here, but we may \noffer some language on this bill at some point that would say you have \nto give people at least the opportunity to say I don't want my medical \nrecords being processed or handled by someone offshore. I want it kept \nin the United States because I don't want someone to be able to go in \nand find out highly sensitive information about me and my family that \ncould be used against me.\n  Today the laws of the United States do not adequately protect you \nwhen this information is being processed and handled offshore. That is \none of the major areas we are seeing these jobs moving.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First let me say how happy I am to hear you and our \nranking member have this conversation. This is so important. In a way \nit is kind of a problem that snuck up on us. I took a look at the loss \nof manufacturing jobs in California and my heart sank.\n  Mr. DODD. There were 272,000 jobs lost.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Think about it, 272,000 jobs.\n  There is one area covered in your amendment. Since no one has \nmentioned it, I want to read into the record a letter and then answer \nthe comment, and then I am done with my role here today other than to \nsay thank you again for your leadership.\n  This is an interesting issue. It is covered. Your amendment is not \nreflected on the charts because it deals with agriculture, something in \nyour State you don't have as much of as I have.\n  I want to read a letter I just wrote to Ann Veneman. I believe this \nwill get you a lot of votes from agriculture country.\n\n       Dear Madam Secretary: I was shocked to learn that the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture purchased 70,000 metric tons of \n     rice for the Iraqi people from abroad rather than purchasing \n     this product from U.S. sources. At a time when U.S. farmers \n     are facing increased economic pressures and food surpluses, \n     our taxpayer money should be spent on U.S. commodities, not \n     the commodities of other nations.\n       California, like many other States across our nation, is \n     experiencing a surplus of commodities such as rice that could \n     provide valuable nutrition to the Iraqi people while \n     alleviating potential crop losses for our nation's farmers.\n\n  Then I talk about California's high quality of rice.\n\n       As we work to alleviate food shortages experienced by the \n     Iraqi people, we have a unique opportunity to assist our own \n     farmers. I request USDA reconsider this decision and instead \n     purchase the needed quantity of rice from U.S. farmers. In \n     the future, USDA should use taxpayer dollars to purchase U.S. \n     rice before it spends taxpayer dollars on foreign \n     commodities.\n\n  I wrote this letter on February 24. I am so pleased. I discussed this \nwith your staff. Your amendment would cover this.\n  Here we have the sons and daughters of America's working people, \nincluding people on the farms for sure, going off to Iraq and putting \ntheir lives on the line. Now their families either see their jobs going \nabroad or in this case they are ready and willing to feed the Iraqi \npeople. They are excited about it, they have great products, they have \nsurpluses, and our administration, the Bush administration, goes \noutside.\n  I wanted to first of all ask if you were aware of this issue, and, \nsecond, say to you whether you were or you were not, I thank you on \nbehalf of the people who make a living from agriculture, because we \nhave our serious problems. We have the best products in the world and \nwe have farmers who are ready to feed the hungry.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague I was not aware of it. I \napologize for not being aware of it.\n  I know agriculture is a huge industry in the State of California, \nparticularly in the area of rice. It is significant. So I am pleased to \nknow we are covering this kind of activity as well.\n  Again, this is not being isolationist.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No.\n  Mr. DODD. Every time you try to stand up for an American job you are \ncalled an isolationist. There is a new coalition. They want to change \nthe language, by the way. There was an article this morning that says, \n``Business coalition rewrites lexicon for jobs outsourcing.'' They \npoint out, they say the coalition is now rallying around ``worldwide \nsourcing'' as a less provocative term.\n  I apologize for sounding provocative, but we didn't make this up. \nWhat ought to be provocative is the fact that people like my colleague \nfrom California have constituents who are losing their jobs because we \nare not doing enough to protect these jobs--not from a protectionist \nstandpoint, but protect them when in fact there is no loss to be \nincurred as a result of standing up and saying we ought to be doing \nwhat we can to protect these positions in our country. I commend her \nfor it.\n  I thank you for raising it. It is an important point and I am glad \nour amendment covers it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will talk to those from agriculture states because they \nmay not be aware this administration is taking the dollars this body \nvoted on--I had problems with voting on it, but most people voted for \nit--they are taking that taxpayer money and taking it right out of this \ncountry. It is outrageous.\n  I thank you again for your leadership.\n  Mr. DODD. My staff gave me some other information. I have mentioned \nothers. Tax experts now say Indian-chartered accountants, the \nsubcontinent version of certified professional accountants, will \nprepare somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 tax returns this year. \nThat is up from 20,000 last year.\n  I am not making up these numbers. The trend lines are moving at a \nvery rapid pace. In this case here I am not suggesting these are \nnecessarily being paid for with Federal tax dollars. I don't know that. \nIf it is not, obviously we are not covering the situation and these \nfirms that want to continue doing it unfortunately will be able to \ncontinue. But if they were doing it with Federal tax money, I say no, \njust as my colleague from California says no.\n\n  If someone with their own dime wants to decide they are going to ship \nrice or whatever products and use someone else offshore, that is one \nthing. But when they are using taxpayer money to do that, that is when \nwe have an obligation to stand up and say no.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate her very much for raising that issue.\n  Let me say I see my colleague from Iowa on the floor, and others. \nThis Senator is prepared to vote. I talked about this. I have had \ncolleagues come over and share some thoughts on it. I know there are \nother matters. I know Senators want to move on. I am certainly not \nengaged in any filibuster. I am prepared to ask for the yeas and nays \nand vote on this amendment and move on to other questions. Is there \nsome opportunity? I don't want to go into a quorum call if other \nMembers want to come over and discuss other matters, but if we want to \nvote on it, I would like to do it. What chance do we have, I ask my \nfriend from Iowa?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will be glad to respond to that. Some Members on our \nside have not studied the amendment as much as they felt they should \nand have some questions about it. I would say there are two things. One \nis understanding completely the impact of your amendment, which \nobviously is a legitimate concern. The other is that kind of makes a \ndetermination whether some Members on our side would want to take some \naction, maybe with an amendment to the amendment. That decision has not \nbeen made. My guess is that decision is not going to be made today. \nThat decision will be made tomorrow.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Maybe I am being more candid than a Republican ought to \nbe, but that is the way it looks to me. You have always been \ntransparent with me. I think I ought to be transparent with you.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and the manager of this bill for his \ncandor\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\non the subject matter. He will certainly understand if I share with \nhim--I know these were not his views, he is expressing the views of \nothers who didn't understand the impact of this amendment. Let me say \nto him, my good friend--and he is a good friend. We have been in \nCongress together for many years--the impact of not doing something \nhere is huge, on workers losing their jobs. I know my colleague knows \nthat and shares my concern about it as well.\n  It is not terribly complicated what I am suggesting here. It is \nstraightforward. It says when it comes to taxpayer money, it can't be \nused to subsidize someone offshore at the cost of an American job.\n  I know the coalition of the Chamber of Commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers and some other groups out there don't \nparticularly like this amendment because 400 of the top 1,000 \ncorporations are now outsourcing jobs, and I am sorry if they are \ndisappointed by this amendment, but there are an awful lot of people \nlosing their jobs.\n  That is the only reason I raise it. I have to wait until tomorrow. We \nwill have to wait, obviously. I am disappointed because I thought it \nwas pretty straight forward. Nonetheless, I appreciate my friend's \ncandor.\n  I see my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wanted to ask a question of my friend. I \nwould be happy to defer.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think maybe I answered too casually \nwhen I answered the Senator's question--that maybe I have a feeling \nthere were not legitimate concerns by people on my side. There are a \ncouple legitimate concerns. No. 1, the Senator's amendment does have \nsome mandate on States. That creates a lot of concern--I will bet not \nonly on my side but on his side as well. That is a very philosophical \npoint of view of the impact which we make in the Senate on 50 States, \nand how many subdivisions I don't know. The other one is the extent to \nwhich this might lead to legitimate legal retaliation as a result of \nthe Senator's amendment. That seems to me to be a reasonable, free, and \nfair trade consideration in any action this body takes.\n  I want to make clear that it is not strictly political. There are \nsome concerns about his amendment. I enunciated at least two.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a question of my friend, Senator Grassley.\n  While the Senator was out, I was telling the Senate that I had \nwritten to Ann Veneman because with taxpayer dollars the USDA went out \nand bought rice from a foreign country instead of from my rice farmers. \nI think that is wrong.\n  I ask this question of my friend: If there are legitimate concerns, I \nam sure my friend will sit down and work them out with somebody because \nyou have been here a long time. There is no one who is more patient and \nmore willing to sit down and figure things out. But I have a feeling it \nis deeper than that. I have a feeling you have touched a nerve today \nwhich is a very important nerve to be touched. I think it is being \ntouched in the Presidential campaign. I think it is being touched in \nthe campaigns across our country, and it is being touched here today.\n  If we don't stand up and do something about this, as my friend \npointed out in his very chilling chart--and say there is some \ncomplication, there is a message being sent, it may be too late.\n  I say to my friend, if he is willing and if there is some concerns \naround the edges which can be worked out, I just hope he won't back off \nthis amendment in a substantial way. If there is a difference between \nthe parties, bring it on, I say. This is what people care about in my \nState, and I know also in my friend's State. Can he give me a sense of \nthe thinking on how he is going to proceed since the majority will not \nallow a vote today?\n  Mr. DODD. I will make two points.\n  I appreciate my friend from Iowa telling me what the substantive \nconcerns are about the amendment, one which I think we have addressed.\n  On the second question he raised, we included language which very \nspecifically makes clear that the government procurement agreements \nbetween the United States and 27 other predominantly western European \ncountries would not be affected by this legislation. India and China \nare not part of that problem. The major culprit in all of this is \noutsourcing of jobs. But my colleague from Montana raised the question \nthat we could be found in violation of World Trade Organization \npolicies, if we didn't include this language. So I think we addressed \nthe concerns about whether or not we are going to run afoul of some \ninternational agreements to which we are a signatory.\n\n  The second part about mandating States, if you are going to use \nFederal money to lay off workers in your State and hire someone 12 time \nzones away to do the job, I don't consider that a mandate. That is \nFederal money. If you want to do it with State money, I can't keep you \nfrom doing that. That is your choice. If you are going to do it with \nFederal money that comes from grants and so forth, I think the American \ntaxpayer would like to know that Federal dollars are being used to lay \noff one person in your State and hire someone 12 time zones away. You \ncan call that a mandate, but I call it common sense at this particular \njuncture.\n  I think we have gone as far as we can go on this issue. We have \ncovered the ground.\n  I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, for joining me in \na bipartisan fashion on this amendment.\n  Today, 40 States outsource jobs. That is pretty alarming.\n  If you are unemployed in a State and you call up your unemployment \noffice to find out about your rights, and you are talking to someone 14 \ntime zones away to find out your rights, that is offensive to people in \nthis country. They want to know what we are going to do about it. Do we \nunderstand what they are going through?\n  This is the first opportunity we have had since we have been back \nover the last 5 or 6 weeks to raise the one issue here. Night after \nnight, Lou Dobbs on CNN, to his great credit, is talking about this \nissue. He is not talking about it and speaking to an audience that is \nnot interested. The audience across this country is deeply interested \nin this subject matter. They want to know whether or not anybody is \ndoing anything about it. I can't stop a private company from \noutsourcing with their own money. But I can stop you from using Federal \ntaxpayer money to fire somebody here and hire somebody 14 time zones \naway. That I can try. I may not win, but I can try to do it. And that \nis what we are trying to do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am really relieved to hear my friend's response to the \nSenator from Iowa. As I understand his amendment, he has already gone a \nvery long way in answering the concerns that were raised. I hope we \nwill stick with it. I think the people in this country are watching. \nThey are not only watching CNN, but they want to know what we are \ndoing. It is an amendment that I have been looking forward to for a \nlong time. We have to make a stand, and I think what my friend is doing \nis not overreaching.\n  I rise to say thank you to the Senator for sticking with it, and I \nwill do all I can to help him get it passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, the Senator from \nConnecticut has been right in the sense that we have raised some \nconcerns, and we are working with him. He has made some modifications. \nWe are still hearing about some more concerns. I have expressed two of \nthose already. I would like to express another concern that I have \nheard.\n  Yes, it preserves jobs in America if there is not outsourcing of \nservice jobs that are involved. But this is a legitimate concern on our \nside: The extent to which there might be retaliation by countries that \noutsource some things to the United States. That goes on as well. We \nwant to make sure if we are losing jobs, we don't have a greater loss \nof jobs in retaliation for Americans who are already employed by a \ncompany outside the United States which is using the services of \nAmerican people in America.\n  These are concerns that need to be addressed. These are things that \nwill be brought out in debate, and it may be possible to work on \ncontinuing modifications of the Dodd amendment so that hopefully we can \nget it passed without a great deal of opposition.\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\n  At this point, we are not prepared to vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I don't believe I yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Nevada is in the Chamber. I didn't know \nif he wanted to speak.\n  Mr. REID. If I could make a brief statement without the Senator \nlosing the floor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. For the minority, the majority leader has indicated there \nwill be no votes tonight. Everyone should know that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is what my Blackberry said 5 minutes ago.\n  Mr. DODD. For the purposes of those who don't know what a Blackberry \nis, we will explain that.\n  I do not know whether my colleague from Texas has a question of me or \nnot. I know he would like to speak on the issue. Does he have a \nquestion for this Senator on the subject matter?\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield, I will have a brief response \nbut not so much a question at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. I will wrap up myself. I would like to come back, if I \ncould.\n  Again, maybe I am wrong. But every survey I have seen over the last \nnumber of weeks has indicated that people--even people who have jobs--\nare worried about this issue.\n  To give you some indication of the disconnect that occurs when it \ncomes to this issue, I quote from the Los Angeles Times story, which \nappeared elsewhere, but talking about this question, it says:\n\n       ``The movement of American factory jobs and other white \n     collar work to other countries is part of a positive \n     transformation that will enrich the United States economy \n     over time even if it causes short term pain and \n     dislocation,'' the Bush administration said the other day.\n\n  It goes down and says from the economic report:\n\n       ``Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international \n     trade,'' said Gregory Mankiw, Chairman of the President's \n     Council of Economic Advisers.\n\n  They prepared the report.\n\n       More things are tradable than were tradable in the past, \n     and that is a good thing.\n\n  The article goes on.\n  I remember the statement being made; Mr. Mankiw apologizing. He said \nit was a bad choice of words, and we certainly accept his apology. The \nproblem is, it was not the words. It is not a bad choice of words; it \nis a bad idea.\n\n  The idea of saying I am sorry I said only indicated to me they were \nsorry they said it out loud. They did not change their mind about the \nsubject matter but merely said we got caught at something we should not \nhave said because it was bad politics to say it. I misspoke politically \nbut not substantively, and there is a fundamental disagreement on this \npoint that outsourcing is a good thing.\n  These are not just goods and services to be tradable in the open \nmarketplace. These are critical jobs which mean a huge difference to \nthe families affected. We bear no greater responsibility in this \nChamber than to do what we can to protect American families. When they \nare being threatened by unnecessarily shipping their job overseas, it \nis our obligation to speak out and try to do something about it that is \nresponsible.\n  I made the point over and over again, and I will make it again, I \nhave supported far more free trade agreements over my course of service \nhere than not because I believe that is where you have to be in the \n21st century. But they have to be fair agreements. We have to negotiate \nthem far better.\n  The Senator from Montana and I have talked about how we might achieve \nthose desired results. I don't subscribe to the notion that it is \nisolationist or protectionist to stand in the Senate and say I think it \nis wrong to use Federal taxpayer money to cause someone in this country \nto lose their job and hire someone 14 time zones away. I don't think \nthat is a good idea. Others may say that is their right, but we will \nhave a vote on whether you think it is right.\n  Examine it until you are blue in the face and try every cockamamie \nidea to undermine what we are doing, but it is a bad idea to federally \nsubsidize the exportation of jobs that ought to be kept here, not for \nprotectionist reasons but if we provide services and jobs in the global \nmarketplace in the 21st century, you better have the people here who \ncan do it.\n  If we give up that kind of human capital that is so critical to our \nlong-term success of people, we are putting our Nation in jeopardy. It \nis not a great quarterly answer. For that company which wants to make \nmore money next quarter, this is a dreadful idea. But if you are \nthinking more than quarters, if you are thinking down the road about \nwhat kind of a Nation we will be leaving the next generation who will \ninhabit these seats we hold today as Members--we have an obligation to \nthem, as well. We owe an obligation, just as others who sat in these \nseats bore an obligation to us and left us a pretty decent country--not \na perfect one, but a good one. We should see to it that coming \ngenerations have the equal opportunity to bear the fruits we have \nprovided for two centuries.\n  We do not do it by remaining silent or giving phony reasons about why \njobs are being outsourced unnecessarily around the globe. That is why I \nbring it up and that is why I hope we can have a vote and move on it. \nIt is not that difficult to understand.\n  I yield the floor, as I know my friend from Texas wants to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut has spoken passionately and eloquently about our concern \nabout job loss in this country and certainly it is something we are all \nconcerned and want to do something about. But I am sure none of us \nwould want to endorse a cure which is worse than the disease or cause \nother problems that perhaps we have not thought through or that are not \nintended.\n  I do detect a whiff of politics. I notice the chart says \nmanufacturing jobs lost under President Bush. Perhaps since the time \nwhen we had primarily an agrarian economy, we have seen tremendous \nshifts in our economy because of the efficiency of a flow market system \nthat is far more efficient than the command-and-control economy that is \nused in other parts of the world that is inefficient and stifles \ncompetition and innovation and the productivity that we have in this \ncountry.\n  I certainly would not want to see us do anything that would harm the \ngood things we had going on in the economy in the effort to address a \nreal problem but perhaps with the wrong solution.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Wyoming mentioning this is something I \nand no doubt other Members would like to study a little further to see \nexactly what the details may be before we were asked to vote on it.\n  I am not an economist. I do understand why companies outsource, to \nfind a cheaper way of producing their product. Even though the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut says it is a bad idea, I am not \nsure what you can do or what we could do, short of erecting a wall \naround this country and saying we are no longer interested in \ninternational trade. I don't know what we can do to avoid companies who \nare seeking to produce a cheaper product in a more competitive \nenvironment from outsourcing some of those jobs. I do think there is an \nanswer, but I am not sure the answer is what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut is proposing.\n  In fact, by prohibiting the outsourcing of jobs we are basically \nsaying the American taxpayer has to pay a higher price than they would \notherwise have to pay. Certainly, that is something we need to explore, \nwhether the higher price is worth the proposed cure.\n  Also, the Senator from Iowa mentioned we are a country that has a \npolicy of free and fair trade. Of course, there is a question of \nretaliation. But the truth is, we have seen a loss of manufacturing \njobs in this country for a lot of reasons other than outsourcing or \ncompetition with China, India--now with the movement of white-collar \njobs particularly in the service sector to that country--and that is \nsimply because we have increased productivity. Technology has made it \npossible to do the same or, indeed, more work using less people. That \nis just a fact of life. I don't think anyone would want to go back to \nthe last century and say we are\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\nnot going to seek further improvements in technology or innovation \nbecause we do not want to put people out of work.\n  The truth is, the solution is, we need to make sure we continue to \neducate our workforce and not for minimum-wage jobs but for good high-\npaying jobs. Members may recall the President addressed this issue in \nhis State of the Union speech and talked about the importance of \nAmericans competing in a global economy by educating and perhaps \nretraining our workforce for new and better-paying jobs.\n  He mentioned his initiative, working with community colleges. I took \nthe President's words to heart because I am concerned--as no doubt all \n100 Members of this body are--about job loss in this country. I went to \nthe community colleges in my State. I said, Tell me what you are doing \nto train the American worker or perhaps to retrain the American worker \nfor good, high-paying jobs. I went to Amarillo in the Panhandle where I \nfound that Bell Helicopter and the Amarillo College helped create a \ncurriculum to train people to work on the V-22 Osprey which is produced \nin that plant.\n  I remember a young woman, a single mom, Hispanic woman, with two \nchildren, formerly working as a prison guard making about $9 an hour. \nAs a result of this program with Amarillo College and Bell Helicopter--\nthis is just one example--she is now working on a production line, \ncontributing to the transformation of our military and also improving \nher standard of living, making about $16 an hour in a good job.\n  I have done the same thing in Austin where I went to the Austin \nCommunity College and learned about partnerships they had entered into \nto train nurses, surgical techs, dental hygienists. At the San Jacinto \nCommunity College near Houston they have partnerships with Boeing and \nNASA and others to train people for good, high-paying jobs.\n  Now, I realize we are in the political season, and I understand that \nperhaps nothing said in this body or anywhere else in Washington is \nperhaps totally devoid of politics, but the truth is, Americans can and \nwill always be willing to compete and win in the global competition in \nthis new economy.\n  Now is not the time for us to wring our hands and say: Oh, woe is us. \nWe just can't quite do it. We have to erect protectionist walls. We \nhave to come up with solutions which, perhaps maybe actually increase \nprices to the American consumer while not actually solving the problem \nthat we are all concerned about; that is, job loss.\n  So I say as part of this debate--and, again, I know the Senator from \nConnecticut has the best of intentions, and we share the same concern--\nnow is not the time for the American worker or for the Members of the \nCongress to lose faith in free markets and the capitalist economy which \nhas made this Nation the envy of the world.\n  We are talking now again, thankfully, about addressing our \nimmigration issues in this country. I will note that there are not \npeople trying to get out of the United States of America because things \nare so bad. To the contrary, people are risking life itself to come \nhere because we are still a beacon in terms of the opportunities \nprovided, in terms of the freedom, in terms of the ability of people, \nworking hard in this country, to have a good standard of living and a \nbetter quality of life.\n  I hope the election year does not consume us so much that we look at \nthe glass always as half empty rather than half full, or look at \nsomething as a lemon rather than an opportunity to make lemonade.\n  I think the President is exactly on the right track. I think if we \ncommit resources to train the American worker to be part of the \ninnovation that has always characterized and been the hallmark of the \nAmerican economy and the business providers in this country, to make \nsure those workers are trained in this constantly evolving economy, \nwhich is very efficient, and sometimes brutal, but to make sure we are \nthere and are working with local and State and Federal governments to \ndo everything we can to assist business partners and the education \ncommunity to train the American worker for good, high-paying jobs, I \nthink we have nothing to fear.\n  Finally, where I was raised we were taught that we would get our \nformal education and then we would go to work and maybe even stay in \nthe same job for the rest of our adult life. But the truth is, today \nthat is just not possible. We need to change our frame of mind so that \nwe teach our younger people, look, learning is a lifetime endeavor, and \nit may be that you will change jobs at different times during your \nadult life because you want to improve your circumstances, you want to \nget a better paying job to better provide for your family, and you can \ndo it in a free country where there is an opportunity to retrain, to \nget an education throughout the course of your life.\n  I firmly believe now is not the time for the American people to lose \nfaith in the good thing we have going in this country, and that, as I \nsaid a moment ago, is the envy of the entire world. I believe our focus \nought to be on that education, lifetime job training, and not on \nerecting barriers around this country or perhaps other solutions, \nalthough well intended, which will have a detrimental impact.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I think the American people need to look \nat what has transpired in recent weeks with this administration. \nSenator Dodd has brought to the Senate's attention one issue; that is, \na high-ranking member of this administration has said that outsourcing \njobs--what does it mean? Shipping jobs overseas--is good for our \neconomy. That is what he said. Well, if that were the end of it, you \ncould well say, maybe that was just somebody who made a mistake.\n  Then we have today Tommy Thompson who says: We should not have \nAmericans be concerned about all the money we are giving to Iraq to \nestablish a health care system because we really have, in the United \nStates, a universal health care system because those people who have no \ninsurance get taken care of. That is what a Cabinet officer of this \nPresident said.\n  Now, should we stop there? Let's go on and talk about what another \nCabinet officer said 2 weeks ago, the Secretary of Education. The \nSecretary of Education said, to a group of assembled Governors, that \nthe National Education Association were terrorists. He did not say it \nonce to the Governors but twice. I have talked to Governors who were \nthere: The National Education Association are terrorists; the largest \nteacher organization in the world, based in the United States, are \nterrorists.\n  I think that is something I cannot comprehend: How the Secretary of \nEducation can say this about teachers.\n  Someone I went to high school with--we played baseball together; we \nwere on the first State championship baseball team in the history of \nthe State of Nevada; He was a pitcher; I was a catcher--Reynaldo \nMartinez and I have been friends for these many years. He was my chief \nof staff in the Senate. He retired a few years ago. He was a longtime \norganizer for the National Education Association. To call Rey Martinez \na terrorist because he was a member of that organization is difficult \nfor me to comprehend.\n  For me personally, what is transpiring in Congress, because of the \nposition the administration has taken regarding highway \ntransportation--the former chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the former chairman of the Finance Committee, now the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, has worked, as I have worked, \non a number of highway bills. There is no bill we do in the Senate, in \nthe Congress, that is more important than a highway bill. It creates \nmillions of jobs over a 6-year bill. We produced a bill based on the \nbudget we passed a year ago. We have there, in the bill that we were \nable to report out of committee, in keeping with the budget, and as \npassed the Senate of the United States, a bill that is a very good \nbill, that does not raise one penny of taxes, that takes care of \ntransit and highways. The President says he is going to veto the bill.\n  Outsourcing is good; 44 million Americans, don't worry, you have \nuniversal\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\ncoverage because if you get sick, you can go to an emergency room, if \nyou are lucky, if there is one there; the National Education \nAssociation personnel are terrorists; and he is going to veto the \ntransportation bill. Is there somebody in the bowels of the White House \ntrying to destroy the President? I cannot imagine the President would \ncome up with these ideas himself. I certainly hope not.\n  I commend and applaud my friend from Connecticut, the senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut. He has brought to the attention of the Senate the \nimportance of focusing on the disastrous loss of manufacturing jobs. \nSince this President has been in office, our Nation has lost a total of \n2.8 million jobs. Every single month, with no exception, manufacturing \njobs are lost.\n\n  I guess I should be leading the cheers here because out of the 50 \nStates, the great State of Nevada is the only one in white on this \nchart. We hold the record. We created 200 new jobs in the last 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. That is certainly better than losing 200, and it is certainly \nbetter than the State of Texas, which has lost 150,000 jobs, or the \nState of New York, 115,000 jobs. Even a small State such as Wyoming \nlost 700 jobs. California has lost 273,000 jobs. So 200 may not look \nlike much, but for us in Nevada, we will take it.\n  Two hundred manufacturing jobs in 3\\1/2\\ years were created in the \nState of Nevada--not much, until you compare it to the rest of the \ncountry. Then we are doing pretty well. We are the only State in the \nUnion that had a net gain of manufacturing jobs during this Presidency.\n  Where have these jobs gone? Some are gone forever, but lots of them \nhave gone overseas. Our country cannot remain strong if we can't \nmanufacture steel, automobiles, airplanes, and appliances. I am very \nhappy that we do wonderfully well with our service industry. No place \nrepresents that better than the State of Nevada, especially Las Vegas. \nBut we cannot remain the superpower of the world by flipping \nhamburgers, which is something I forgot to mention.\n  Somebody in the administration suggested 2 weeks ago that we should \ncreate a new manufacturing category; that is, people who work in fast \nfood restaurants. I am not making that up. They want to turn people who \nwork in McDonald's preparing meat patties, putting the sandwiches \ntogether, into manufacturers.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, in chapter 2, page 73 of the \nEconomic Report of the President--this was prepared by the President's \neconomic advisors--they raise the issue here as if it were a legitimate \nquestion. They say: The definition of a manufactured product, however, \nis not straightforward. When a fast food restaurant sells a hamburger, \nfor example, is it providing a service or is it manufacturing a \nproduct? They think that is a legitimate question, that manufacturing a \nhamburger might actually be a manufacturing job. My colleague from \nNevada is absolutely right to raise this point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have only talked about what has happened \nin the last few weeks: Outsourcing is good, teachers are terrorists, \nveto the transportation bill. We have universal coverage in America \nbecause if you are one of the 44 million, you get taken care of some \nday somewhere. That is universal coverage. That was the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services who said that. And now they are trying to \ndevelop a new category of manufacturing.\n  This reminds me of my friend Greg Maddux. In Las Vegas we are so \nproud of him. He has won the Cy Young Award 4 years. He is slightly \nbuilt and my size. He is one of the greatest pitchers of all size. His \nhands are smaller than mine. He is now going to Chicago. He needs to \nwin 11 more games to become a 300-game winner, which is a big deal in \nbaseball. Just a handful of people have done that. So he needs 11 more \ngames. Based on the President's assumption of how we can create \nmanufacturing jobs, maybe we can get him to 11 more quickly. What I \nsuggest is having four strikes instead of three. With four strikes--he \nhas great control--I guarantee you, even though he will be 37 years old \nnext month, I think he could win his 11 games much more quickly.\n\n  That is what is going on with this administration. If you don't like \nwhat goes on, change the rules.\n  I have said before, I have two brothers older than I. One of them was \nworking in a Standard station in a place called Ashfork, AZ. He wanted \nto take his little brother away from Searchlight. So we went to what I \nthought was the big town of Ashfork, AZ. Frankly, it was not a lot of \nfun for me because my brother had a girlfriend, and he didn't spend a \nlot of time with me. So I was pushed off on his girlfriend's brother. I \ncould not beat him at anything. It didn't matter what it was. I never \nbeat him at anything because he always changed the rules in the middle \nof the game. That is what is going on here with the administration. We \nare going to change the definition of manufacturing.\n  The loss of jobs in our country is very bad. If it were only \nmanufacturing jobs that were going overseas, I would not like it, I \nwould complain about it. But this has been compounded because the loss \nof manufacturing jobs is not the only problem. The Senator from \nConnecticut and I were looking earlier today at a chart. I am sure he \nhas shown it. This chart talked about some of the diagnostic procedures \nthat were going overseas. Look at some of these things: 14 million jobs \nin danger of being shipped overseas.\n  Mr. DODD. These charts belong to Senator Kennedy. He feels very \nstrongly about these charts. I wanted to make sure the record reflects \nwe are borrowing Senator Kennedy's charts. They are very good charts.\n  Mr. REID. As I was saying, Senator Dodd and I were looking at this \nearlier today. We don't need to go through all of this, about the 14 \nmillion jobs, some of which have already been shipped overseas and some \ngoing overseas. Diagnostic support services, we already know what these \nare. They are actually shipping medical records to other countries and \nhaving them catalogued. But they are also having some of these medical \nrecords reviewed. Take, for example, a CAT scan. Ship it overseas. They \ncan have somebody there review it very quickly. Take, for example, an \nX-ray, a simple X-ray, ship it overseas. They can do it quickly. You \nwill get the results back soon. I don't feel very good about that. I go \nto my doctor in Las Vegas or Reno, Boulder City, Elko in Nevada. They \nare shipping the X-rays they take of my body to India or some foreign \ncountry to have somebody over there call my doctor or the hospital \nstaff and tell them what is wrong with me? I don't think so.\n  The additional problem with that, just from a basic fairness \nstandpoint, I won't disclose the Senator's name, but a Senator told me \nshe had two complaints from constituents in that State that privacy was \nbeing violated, people had information that came from overseas about \nher health condition. I hope the people making these decisions for our \nPresident were not trained during the Reagan years.\n  Reagan, for whom I have the highest respect, didn't continue this. He \nlearned early on it was not a good idea when someone in his \nadministration said, let's have ketchup considered a vegetable for the \nschool lunch programs. Maybe that person is still around here someplace \nand giving these great recommendations to this administration. I hope \nnot. Or if it is true that that person is around, maybe they should put \na stop to it. We do not want people who are being X-rayed, medical \nrecords, lawyers who research cases and write briefs, technological \nspecialists to keep virtually every company running--all these jobs are \nfleeing America in a mad global case for cheap labor.\n  Every time a job goes overseas, it hurts an American family.\n  It used to be that if you lost a job, you would find one pretty \nquickly. Now the average time for getting a new job after losing a job \nin America is almost 1 year. Losing the job is bad enough because you \nlose self-esteem, you lose a sense of pride, you believe you have not \nbeen appreciated, even though you were doing the best job you could, \nbut also that family probably loses their health insurance because they \ncannot pay for the COBRA; they don't have money to do so.\n  My son left to go to Vegas, and he needed coverage of insurance for 2 \nweeks. It cost him $2,200. He is married, has two little girls, his \nwife was pregnant. He had no choice. He had the money to pay for it. If \nhe had not had it, I would have helped him. That is not\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\nthe way it is with everybody. Many people are not able to buy insurance \nfor periods of time when they don't have it. Maybe they are buying a \nhome or were going to buy one and they lose the sense of a dream of \nowning a home.\n  What about college? College is so expensive. It used to be that when \nI was growing up, I could work in the summers and during the school \nyear to pay for my education. My parents were not in a position to help \nme, and I basically educated myself with a few little scholarships I \nhad. You cannot do that anymore. You cannot work during the off-\nseason--unless you rob banks--to pay for a college education. It is too \nexpensive. So that is another thing a family would lose--the ability to \nprepare for their children to attend college. That is why the loss of \nAmerican jobs is a crisis in our country. We need a real plan to \naddress that issue. We cannot afford to wait until the next business \ncycle because the flight of jobs overseas is a result of powerful \neconomic forces.\n  American workers are not afraid of fair competition. I am not against \nthat, but I am against the mentality of chasing cheap labor around the \nglobe with no regard to long-term implications. When American companies \nchoose cheap labor, they are saying our environment doesn't matter. \nThey are saying conditions for their own workers do not matter, and \nthey are forgetting the great lesson learned from Henry Ford. Henry \nFord was not a person I liked everything he did or said, but he was a \ngood businessman. He realized in order for his company to sell cars, \nthe people who build them should be able to also buy those cars. In \nother words, workers are also customers. A worker who earns a decent \nliving can afford to buy the products and services American companies \nare selling. So every time a so-called American company chases cheap \nlabor by moving jobs overseas, we are all diminished. The market for \ngoods and services in our country is damaged.\n  As I have said, the President's top economic advisers said the \noutsourcing of jobs is a good thing. Every day someone in the \nadministration says the economy is getting better. It might be looking \nup to those who have the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times \ndelivered to their homes but not to middle class Americans. They feel \nthat inside something is happening that goes beyond the normal business \ncycle.\n  Middle class Americans are deeper in debt than ever. Consumer debt is \nat an all-time high. Middle class Americans are afraid the Social \nSecurity benefits will be swallowed in the sink hole of a half-\ntrillion-dollar deficit. And they are right. The debt would be much \nbigger for the 3 years that this President has been in office but for \nthe fact that the debt is being disguised by the Social Security \nsurplus. Middle class Americans are worried their jobs might be \noutsourced. They are being hit hard by the skyrocketing cost of health \ncare. Their deductibles and copayments keep going up, and they wonder \nwhether they are going to lose coverage entirely.\n\n  There are 77,000 people on strike in California who work in grocery \nstores. They are not on strike because of working conditions, not \nbecause of wages or hours; they are striking for one simple reason, \nhealth benefits. They could not make ends meet by having to pay what \nthey were going to be told by their employer they had to pay for health \ncosts, so they went on strike--one of the longest strikes in modern \nhistory.\n  All these problems are deeper than the business cycle. They all \ndemand a real economic plan, and part of that plan is the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Connecticut. It is not everything. If we \nhad the opportunity, we could come up with a better plan. This is a \nstep in the right direction. What we have to do in Congress today is \nunderstand that we are not going to completely rewrite Superfund, \nendangered species, clean air and clean water, or the economic \nsituation this country faces. But we have the ability to do things to \nimprove Superfund and endangered species. We can do a little here and a \nlittle there to help the economic situation in this country.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Connecticut is a good amendment. It \nis a step in the right direction. That is why we chose this as our \nfirst amendment. It sends a message to the American people that we want \nto do something to stop the outflow of these jobs. Focusing on Federal \nGovernment outsourcing is one of the things at which we need to take a \ncloser look.\n  We can start trying to improve our economy now, today, by cutting off \nGovernment contracts to companies that plan to outsource their work. \nTwo years ago, the State of Florida ordered a $280 million contract to \na company that outsources its work to India. If Florida wants to do \nthat, it is their business. But when the American taxpayers hire \nsomebody to do a job, it should be done by an American worker who is \nalso a taxpayer.\n  For the fourth time in the last few minutes, I commend Senator Dodd \nfor this amendment and urge all of my colleagues to support it. I also \nsay this to the majority: If tomorrow, when we come back in session, \nthere is an effort made to prevent the Senator from Connecticut from \nhaving a vote on this, we are going to keep offering it and offering it \nuntil we get a vote on it. If we don't get it done on this bill, we \nwill get it done on the next bill. If we don't get it done on the next \nbill, it will be offered on the next bill. This is our No. 1 amendment, \nand we are going to continue pushing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for his \ncomments. He is absolutely right about changing the rules. I have \nworried about that, when all of a sudden--and I have seen it happen in \nthe past--you don't like the numbers you have, so you come up with a \nwhole new definition and expand the numbers. That is what it looks like \nwhen you start talking about what clearly are fast food service jobs, \nmanufacturing jobs, and we have seen those efforts being made.\n  This wasn't the first administration trying games like that. We have \nhad others in the past doing that. I appreciate his comments, and I \nthank him for his support as well.\n  I have just a couple of other points. My friend and colleague from \nTexas cited earlier some of the efforts in the area of job training, \nvocational education. I wanted to respond by saying I don't disagree. I \nthink that is an important element. But the problem is that one of the \nfrustrations is the outsourcing of jobs that is occurring at a rather \nremarkable rate now, and it seems to be accelerating and very little is \nbeing offered to try to do something about this.\n  In fact, even in the area of protecting manufacturing jobs and doing \nsomething about retraining, let me share with my colleagues what is \ngoing on. In the manufacturing extension partnership, which is a very \nimportant issue for the manufacturing firms of this country, this is \ngoing to mean less help to an estimated 11,000 small businesses; 28,000 \nworkers will either lose their jobs or not be hired as a result of \nthese cuts.\n  So there is cutting back in this area. Outsourcing is going to have a \nhuge impact on the manufacturing sector.\n  The Small Business Administration is being cut by $79 million, \nhurting hundreds of thousands of small businesses struggling to create \njobs for Americans. There is a cut of $316 million for vocational \neducation. This is in addition to the more than $1.5 million in \nproposed cuts to job training and vocational education made over the \nlast 3 years. We are also cutting $448 million for the Workforce \nInvestment Act programs.\n  My point is, as we watch these outsourcing of jobs and the loss of \n2.8 million manufacturing jobs, I would be heartened if I thought we \nwere making an effort at least to commit additional resources to help \nprovide training for people who find themselves under normal cyclical \ncircumstances losing a job, but here we are in an abnormal situation \nwhere there is an extraordinary loss of manufacturing jobs occurring \nacross the country in the last 36 months and we have an extraordinary \nacceleration of outsourcing of jobs occurring over the same period of \ntime--I pointed out that now 400 of the top 1,000 businesses in America \nare outsourcing, 40 of the 50 States, all for a very obvious reason. \nYou can save a lot of money right off the top by doing it. When you can \nhire somebody in India at $7 a day as opposed to paying someone a \nsalary in Silicon Valley, you\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\ndo not have to have a Ph.D. in mathematics to know the outcome.\n  I understand the motivation behind it. The question I have is, are we \ngoing to sit back and allow this to continue at the expense of losing \nthe kind of human investments that we ought to be making to guarantee \nthat we have a workforce capable of doing jobs and providing the \nservices that America ought to be providing in the coming years?\n  In addition to that, even if we were not doing an amendment or were \nnot going to support language that would say that Federal taxpayer \nmoney ought not be used for this purpose, I would like to think that in \nthe area of vocational education, small business assistance, \nmanufacture extension partnerships, and certainly Workforce Investment \nAct--all of these areas--that the administration would say: Look, this \nis our answer to this. We don't agree with you, Senator, about not \nusing Federal funds.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Los \nAngeles Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Nation; Feb. 10, 2004]\n\n                  Bush Supports Shift of Jobs Overseas\n\n                    (By Warren Vieth and Edwin Chen)\n\n       Washington.--The movement of American factory jobs and \n     white-collar work to other countries is part of a positive \n     transformation that will enrich the U.S. economy over time, \n     even if it causes short-term pain and dislocation, the Bush \n     administration said Monday.\n       The embrace of foreign outsourcing, an accelerating trend \n     that has contributed to U.S. job losses in recent years and \n     has become an issue in the 2004 elections, is contained in \n     the president's annual report to Congress on the health of \n     the economy.\n       ``Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international \n     trade,'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of Bush's Council \n     of Economic Advisers, which prepared the report. ``More \n     things are tradable than were tradable in the past. An that's \n     a good thing.''\n       The report, which predicts that the nation will reverse a \n     three-year employment slide by creating 2.6 million jobs in \n     2004, is part of a weeklong effort by the administration to \n     highlight signs that the recovery is picking up speed. Bush's \n     economic stewardship has become a central issue in the \n     presidential campaign, and the White House is eager to \n     demonstrate that his policies are producing results.\n       In his message to Congress on Monday, Bush said the economy \n     ``is strong and getting stronger,'' thanks in part to his tax \n     cuts and other economic programs. He said the nation had \n     survived a stock market melt-down, recession, terrorist \n     attacks, corporate scandals and war in Afghanistan and Iraq, \n     and was finally beginning to enjoy ``a mounting prosperity \n     that will reach every corner of America.''\n       The president repeated that message during an afternoon \n     discussion about the economy at SRC Automotive, an engine-\n     rebuilding plant in Springfield, Mo., where he lashed out at \n     lawmakers who oppose making his tax cuts permanent.\n       ``When they say, `We're going to repeal Bush's tax cuts,' \n     that means they're going to raise your taxes, and that's \n     wrong. And that's bad economics,'' he said.\n       Democrats who want Bush's job were quick to challenge his \n     claims.\n       Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the front-runner for \n     the Democratic presidential nomination, supports a rollback \n     of Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and backs the \n     creation of tax incentives for companies that keep jobs in \n     the United States--although he supported the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement, which many union members say is \n     responsible for the migration of U.S. jobs, particularly in \n     the auto industry, to Mexico.\n       Campaigning Monday in Roanoke, Va., Kerry questioned the \n     credibility of the administration's job-creation forecast.\n       ``I've got a feeling this report was prepared by the same \n     people who brought us the intelligence on Iraq,'' Kerry said. \n     ``I don't think we need a new report about jobs in America. I \n     think we need a new president who's going to create jobs in \n     America and put Americans back to work.''\n       In an evening appearance at George Mason University in \n     Fairfax, Va., Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina mocked the \n     Bush administration's economic report.\n       Edwards, who also supports repealing tax cuts for the \n     richest Americans and offering incentives to corporations \n     that create new jobs in the United States, said it would \n     come as a ``news bulletin'' to the American people that \n     the economy was improving and that the outsourcing of jobs \n     was good for America.\n       ``These people,'' he said of the Bush administration, \n     ``what planet do they live on? They are so out of touch.''\n       The president's 411-page report contains a detailed \n     diagnosis of the forces the White House says are contributing \n     to America's economic slowdown and a wide-ranging defense of \n     the policies Bush has pursued to combat it.\n       It asserts that the last recession actually began in late \n     2000, before the president took office, instead of March \n     2001, as certified by the official recession-dating panel of \n     the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n       Much of the report repeats the administration's previous \n     economic prescriptions.\n       For instance, it says the Bush tax cuts must be made \n     permanent to have their full effect on the economy.\n       Social Security also must be restructured to let workers \n     put part of their retirement funds in private accounts, the \n     report argues. Doing so could add nearly $5 trillion to the \n     national debt by 2036, the president's advisors note, but the \n     additional borrowing would be repaid 20 years later and the \n     program's long-term health would be more secure.\n       The report devotes an entire chapter to an issue that has \n     become increasingly troublesome for the administration: the \n     loss of 2.8 million manufacturing jobs since Bush took \n     office, and critics' claims that his trade policies are \n     partly to blame.\n       His advisors acknowledge that international trade and \n     foreign outsourcing have contributed to the job slump. But \n     the report argues that technological progress and rising \n     productivity--the ability to produce more goods with fewer \n     workers--have played a bigger role than the flight of \n     production to China and other low-wage countries.\n       Although trade expansion inevitably hurts some domestic \n     workers, the benefits eventually will outweigh the costs as \n     Americans are able to buy cheaper goods and services and as \n     new jobs are created in growing sectors of the economy, the \n     report said.\n       The president's report endorses the relatively new \n     phenomenon of outsourcing high-end, white-collar work to \n     India and other countries, a trend that has stirred concern \n     within such affected occupations as computer programming and \n     medical diagnostics.\n       ``Maybe we will outsource a few radiologists,'' Mankiw told \n     reporters. ``What does that mean? Well, maybe the next \n     generation of doctors will train fewer radiologists and will \n     train more general practitioners or surgeons. . . . Maybe \n     we've learned that we don't have a comparative advantage in \n     radiologists.''\n       Government should try to salve the short-term disruption by \n     helping displaced workers obtain the training they need to \n     enter new fields, such as health-care, Mankiw said, not by \n     erecting protectionist barriers on behalf of vulnerable \n     industries or professions. ``The market is the best \n     determination of where the jobs should be,'' he said.\n       Bush's quick visit to Missouri--his 15th to a state \n     considered a critical election battleground--was the first of \n     several events this week intended to underscore recent \n     economic gains. Although U.S. job creation remains relatively \n     sluggish, the nation's unemployment rate fell from 6.4% in \n     June to 5.6% in January, and the economy grew at the fastest \n     pace in 20 years during the last half of 2003.\n       The format of his visit to SRC Automotive--one that he \n     particularly likes--involved several employees and local \n     business owners sharing the stage with the president to \n     discuss their perspectives on the economy, with Bush \n     elaborating on their stories to emphasize particular aspects \n     of his economic program.\n       Today, Bush is scheduled to meet with economic leaders at \n     the White House. On Thursday, he goes to Pennsylvania's \n     capital, Harrisburg--in another swing state that he has \n     already visited more than two dozen times since becoming \n     president.\n\n  Mr. DODD. The headline in the Los Angeles Times--it is a viewpoint--\nsays: ``Bush Supports Shift of Jobs Overseas.'' It goes on to talk \nabout the report that I talked about all afternoon, this economic \nreport prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers, where they \nconclude that the outsourcing of jobs is a good thing. The author of \nthat language apologized for his use of those words, but he has not \napologized, and I understand why, because he believes it is good \neconomic policy to be outsourcing.\n  There are some of us--I do not know if it is a majority--who disagree \nwith that conclusion, that outsourcing is necessarily good.\n  I cited already from the Wall Street Journal companies that painfully \ndiscovered when they outsourced, while they thought they were going to \nsave money, it actually cost them dearly. It is not only not good, but \nit fails to take into account--watching somebody's job be lost because \nthere is a cheaper labor pool that you don't have to pay health care \nbenefits to, despite the fact the person here is going to lose them--if \nit is really good for America.\n  I am suggesting while this rush is occurring that we ought to put on \nthe brakes and stop, look, and listen so we will not necessarily be \ncaught up in a situation where a year or two or five from now we will \nlook back and say: Why didn't somebody say something or do something \nwhen we knew this was happening, when we could sit, watch, and read on \na daily basis the pouring of\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\njobs out of this country to 14 time zones away, depriving people of \nbenefits and income they needed for their families; what did you do on \nyour watch? What did you do?\n  If the answer is we thought it was a good thing for the American \neconomy, then I think we will be suffering an indictment historically.\n  I see my colleague from Kentucky who wants to move on to matters of \nthe day. I yield the floor, with the right to be recognized at the \nconclusion of his remarks.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Connecticut, he will hardly \nhave to hold his breath and he will be back up waxing eloquent to all \nof our colleagues who I am sure, back in their offices, are watching \nhis speech and listening carefully to every word.\n\n\n                 eliminating the ``haircut'' provision\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 1637, the \nJOBS Act, which will halt European Union trade sanctions against \nAmerican industries and provide immediate tax relief for domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  U.S. manufacturing has experienced a crisis over the last three years \ndue to the global economic downturn, sharply diminished capital \nspending, global overcapacity, and steady price declines for \nmanufactured goods. S. 1637 provides a strong incentive for companies \nto keep and create jobs in the U.S.\n  However, I believe we can improve S. 1637 by eliminating the \n``haircut'' provision that increases the taxes on U.S. manufacturers \nfor their U.S. companies merely because these companies also \nmanufacture products abroad. This concept is totally at odds with the \npurpose of this legislation--to cut taxes on manufacturers that employ \nAmerican workers. U.S. companies with global operations employ more \nthan 23 million Americans--9 million of which are manufacturing jobs. \nForeign-owned companies with U.S. operations employ more than 2 million \nmanufacturing workers in the U.S.\n  The haircut is structured so that the more a company manufacturers \nabroad, the less of a manufacturing rate cut it gets. The ``haircut'' \nmakes the U.S. a less competitive location for current and future \ninvestment. Thus, it is less likely that multinational manufacturing \ncompanies will site new plants and new high-paying jobs in the U.S.\n  Furthermore, I am concerned that the ``haircut'' invites mirror \nlegislation in other countries. In this time of crisis for the U.S. \nmanufacturing industry, we cannot afford to let any more manufacturing \njobs slip away, particularly due to bad tax policy.\n  With my colleague, Senator Breaux, I am offering an amendment to the \nJOBS Act which will eliminate the ``haircut'' and provide an equal tax \nbenefit for all manufacturers that employ American workers. Congress \nshould be in the business of rewarding all well-paid manufacturing jobs \nthat are created in the U.S.--not just those created by certain \ndomestic manufacturers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we call this bill the ``Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Strength Act''--the JOBS Act, because that is exactly what we \nare debating this week--the critical issue facing so many millions of \nAmericans, the lack of jobs.\n  To hear President Bush, you would never know there was a problem with \njobs. According to the Bush administration, everything is sunshine and \nroses.\n  Over and over again, the President says things that show he is out of \ntouch with the lives of ordinary Americans and can't understand the \neconomic hardships they are facing. Happy talk about economic recovery \ndoesn't jibe with the daily lives of the people on Main Street.\n  In his State of the Union Address in January, the President said ``. \n. . this economy is strong, and growing stronger . . . Productivity is \nhigh, and jobs are on the rise.''\n  A week later he said: ``The economy is growing, people are finding \nwork. There's an excitement in our economy . . . You can tell I'm \nupbeat, and I've got reason to be. Not only the numbers say things are \nlooking pretty good, the American people are telling me they feel \npretty good.''\n  Then came his annual economic report and its ringing endorsement of \nsending jobs overseas.\n  At the National Governors Association meeting last Monday, he said he \nthinks the 5.6 percent unemployment rate is ``a good national number.''\n  Yesterday, Vice President Cheney said, ``The economy's in very good \nshape, and going forward there's every reason to be optimistic that we \nwill have the kind of growth that we need to create jobs out there.''\n  In fact, he went on to say that if ``Democratic policies had been \npursued over the last two or three years.  . . . we would not have had \nthe kind of job growth that we've had.''\n  Job growth? Someone should tell the Vice President that we have lost \nover two million jobs in the Bush economy.\n  The reality of the Bush economic record is very different from the \nrhetoric.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the President said in his economic report that \nthe economy will create 2.6 million new jobs this year. The reality is \nthat no one in the White House or the Cabinet will endorse the 2.6 \nmillion number.\n  President Bush said his first tax cuts in 2001 would create 800,000 \nadditional jobs by the end of 2002. The reality is, we lost 1.9 million \njobs instead.\n  His 2002 economic report predicted 3 million jobs would be created in \n2003. Instead, more than 300,000 were lost.\n  He said the tax breaks enacted last year would create 510,000 \nadditional jobs by the end of the year, but we lost 53,000 jobs last \nyear.\n  Even the few jobs being created are not as good as the jobs we have \nlost. The new jobs pay on average $8,000 less than jobs lost in the \nBush economy. In 48 of the 50 States, jobs being created pay 21 percent \nless than had been paid by industries losing jobs.\n  Employees have smaller paychecks, and are even less able to keep up \nwith the rising costs of education, let alone pay the bill for food, \nrent and health care.\n  A big part of the job problem is the worsening crisis in \nmanufacturing. We have lost nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs since \nthe Bush administration took office. It is a nationwide problem, \naffecting almost every State in the Union. Forty-nine of the 50 States \nhave lost manufacturing jobs under this President.\n  That is only part of the story. Fourteen million other jobs are newly \nat risk of being sent overseas as well. Every day, we hear more stories \nabout how white collar jobs and service sector jobs in health care, \nfinancial services, and information technology are going to other \ncountries.\n  What is the President's response? More empty rhetoric and broken \npromises. Last year on Labor Day, the President met with workers and \npromised to appoint a manufacturing czar to deal with the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs. How typical of the President to make a promise like \nthat on Labor Day and then forget all about it.\n  Six months later, there is still no manufacturing czar. \nAdministration officials say they're working on it, but the economy is \nstill hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs.\n  American workers deserve better than this. They deserve better than \nto have their jobs exported with the President, as cheerleader in \nchief, waving good bye.\n  We need to do more, to encourage good-paying manufacturing jobs to \nstay here, and discourage corporations from sending jobs and new \ninvestment overseas.\n  This bill contains provisions to encourage manufacturing in the \nUnited States, and I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for \ntheir bi-partisan work on this bill. But we can do more and we must do \nmore.\n  We need to provide incentives now for companies to keep and create \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States. A key weakness in this bill is \nthat the tax benefits for domestic manufacturing are phased in too \nslowly. These companies and their workers need help now.\n  We need to stop rewarding multinational corporations that send jobs \nto other countries.\n  This bill not only fails to do that, it creates $35 billion in new or \nlarger tax breaks for companies doing business abroad. Why on earth do \nwe want to make exporting of American jobs more attractive to \ncorporations? These international provisions should be removed from the \nbill, and the tax dollars should be used to make the tax benefits for \ndomestic manufacturing more robust.\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\n  In many respects, the tax code already gives a greater subsidy to \nprofits from foreign operations over domestic plants. We ought to \nchange that too, instead of kowtowing to the clout of multinational \ncorporations. Our corporate tax laws should be rewritten to increase \nthe cost of exporting jobs and decrease the cost of maintaining jobs in \nAmerica.\n  And what about the urgent needs of Americans who have already lost \ntheir jobs and their long-term unemployment benefits too?\n  Solid majorities in the Senate and the House have already sent a \nmessage loud and clear to the White House and the Republican leadership \nin Congress that we want to reinstate those benefits, which expired on \nDecember 31st. Ninety thousand workers a week have lost their benefits \nand still can't get a job. They're moving in with friends or family, \ngiving up health care, and struggling to pay every bill. Yet our \nRepublican colleagues say, in their best imitation of Marie Antoinette, \n``let them eat cake.''\n  They tell the unemployed to look harder for work. They treat them as \nslackers, and say they won't subsidize their idleness any longer. That \nattitude is wrong. The unemployment insurance extension we enacted when \nthe economy began to decline has expired, and I urge my colleagues to \nfix it, before these hard-working employees who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own suffer any longer.\n  I also urge my colleagues to join me in strengthening this \nlegislation. We must improve incentives in the manufacturing industries \nand give working Americans a chance for the jobs and the better future \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I will offer an amendment which would \nallow commercial fishermen to use income tax averaging to help mitigate \nthe negative effects of their fluctuating incomes.\n  Progressive tax systems, like the Federal income tax, often penalize \nfarmers and others whose incomes vary greatly from year to year. \nRecognizing this fact, Congress, in 1997, gave farmers the option to \ncalculate their taxes by averaging their income over a 3-year period. \nThis was an important change in the Tax Code and has helped many in our \nagriculture communities weather the up-and-downs of a sometimes erratic \nfarm economy.\n  Like farmers, our fishermen are often subject to dramatic swings in \nincome. Whether it's changing ocean conditions, harvest restrictions, \nor bad weather that keeps them in port, the change in income can be \nsevere and beyond their control. For example, fishermen in Coos Bay, OR \nhave struggled with regulatory restrictions and reduced stocks over the \nlast several years. Unfortunately, our Tax Code doesn't allow for \nflexibility, and fishermen, who experience both good and bad years, are \nforced to pay more taxes than if they had steady income levels.\n  My amendment would resolve some of this inequality by extending to \ncommercial fishermen the same income averaging benefit given to \nfarmers. It would also fix a technical error in the original provision \nthat has led to some farmers being caught under alternative minimum \ntax.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue in the past and \nincluding this important provision in his bill, the Tax Empowerment and \nRelief for Farmers and Fishermen, TERFF, Act. I am pleased to see that \nportions of the TERFF Act were incorporated into the bill now before \nus, and I am hopeful that we will be able to address the issue of \nincome averaging for fishermen also at this time.\n  Our farmers and fishermen represent an important sector of our \neconomy. Unfortunately, they and their families often have to deal with \nmore than their fair share of challenges. Making the Tax Code more \nconsistent and more reflective of the variable nature of resource \nindustries will also make it more fair and provide some measure of \nstability for these hard working individuals.\n  I encourage the Senate to consider and pass this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Over the weekend, the United States of America lost \none of its great teachers of what it means to be an American. Daniel \nBoorstin died at the age of 89. He served as Librarian of Congress and \ndirector of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Science \nand Technology. Daniel Boorstin's books about the American experience \nearned a Pulitzer Prize in 1974. He believed America's success came \nlargely because we have been free from the ``virus of ideology,'' free \nto be flexible and responsive, ``free to take clues from the \ndelightful, unexplored and uncongested world around us.'' Free from \nideology, being an American became its own ideology.\n  Daniel Boorstin celebrated Americans for always trying the new. He \nbelieved we have been at our best when we have been ``on the verge,'' \nencountering new territory--whether it was creating new schools, new \ncrops, new planting techniques, new towns, a new form of the English \nlanguage, new technologies, new cars and trains, or John Winthrop's new \nCity on the Hill.\n  He observed during these encounters with new circumstances, we have \nbeen more aware of our Americanness, that our appetite for the new has \nbeen whetted, and that we have leaned on one another for support, often \norganizing new forms of communities to deal with new circumstances. \nBoorstin believed America works community by community. He argued that \nthe prototype early American was not the solitary trailblazer but a \nwagon train community.\n\n  Despite his erudition and his Pulitzer, Dr. Boorstin was not \nespecially popular with professional historians. Perhaps it was because \nhe was such a booster, as have been most Americans. Perhaps it was \nbecause he contented himself with being an ``amateur'' historian, not \nshackled by the ruts along which professionals often trudge. Or, \nperhaps it was because he was a member of a diminishing band of public \nfigures--the late Senator Pat Moynihan and American Federation of \nTeachers President Albert Shanker were two others--who believed \npassionately in American exceptionalism. A growing number of history \nprofessionals today reject this idea of exceptionalism. To them, our \ncountry is fortunate, rich and large, but not more exceptional than \nmany other countries. These professionals prefer social studies to U.S. \nhistory. They take snapshots of our national experience instead of \nteaching the steady drumbeat of a work in progress toward grand goals. \nIn their enthusiasm for overlooked victims, they themselves overlook \nheroes.\n  Because of their growing influence we now find American history \ncourses watered down, the great controversies of race and religion \n``sensitized'' from textbooks. Civics is often dropped entirely from \nthe curriculum. As one result, our high school seniors score worse on \nU.S. history tests than on any other subject.\n  Daniel Boorstin's writings have reminded us of what is truly \nexceptional about America, warts and all. He emphasized that our \ngreatest accomplishment is that, more than any other country, we have \nunited people from everywhere into a single nation, united by beliefs \nin a few principles rather than by race, creed, and color. He taught \nthat we may be proud of where we came from, but should be prouder to be \nAmericans.\n  He left us one other very special insight. In an essay written in \n1962, Dr. Boorstin foresaw that television would create a world in \nwhich we would have a hard time telling the difference between heroes--\nthose worth paying attention to because we might learn from their \nnobility--and celebrities who are ``famous primarily for being \nfamous.'' He invented the term pseudo event, which most of us will \nrecognize as today's photo opportunity.\n  My favorite of Daniel's Boorstin's books was not his Pulitzer winner. \nIt was The Discoverers, a stream of stories about men and women in \nhistory who challenged dogma and created a better life for mankind.\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\n  As we are poised on yet another verge in our national experience, we \nwould do well to remember Dr. Boorstin's advice about what has served \nus well before: be more aware of our Americanness, whet our appetites \nfor the new, and form new communities so that we might rely better on \none another as we deal with changing circumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2103-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REPORT PURSUANT TO WAR POWERS RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

On January 23, \n2004, Mr. McNeil discovered a new nebula while examining the night sky \nover Western Kentucky.\n  Mr. McNeil immediately established himself as an extremely capable \namateur astronomer. The discovery was made with a relatively small \ntelescope. His discovery was a very rare occurrence. According to \nexperts in the field, such a discovery by an amateur of this magnitude \nhas not occurred since 1939.\n  The discovery, later named McNeil's Nebula, was verified by the \nInternational Astronomical Union in February of 2004. The nebula is \nbelieved to contain a newborn star and is about 1,500 light years from \nearth. This means that what Mr. McNeil saw actually occurred a \nmillennium and a half ago, and is just now being seen on earth.\n  I salute Mr. McNeil for his discovery. The thirst for knowledge and \nappreciation for science that he has shown serves as an example for all \nKentuckians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2103-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2103-S2104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      LEWISTON ELKS LODGE NO. 896 CELEBRATES 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \ncongratulate the Lewiston Elks Club, Lodge No. 896, on its 100-year \nanniversary. The organization has overcome multiple obstacles in its \nefforts to continue the fellowship among its members, and more \nimportant, its consistent and significant contributions to the local \ncommunity.\n  Lodge No. 896 was first chartered on March 8, 1904 by just eight \nmembers. The organization envisioned by the original eight founders has \ngrown to include more than 13,000 members over the past century. Today \nit is the largest Elks Club in Idaho. Successful recruitment efforts \nbring in 15 to 18 new members each month, making the Lewiston lodge one \nof the Nation's best. Together, the Elks have made countless positive \nimpacts on the Lewiston area, and have been stellar ambassadors of our \ngreat State.\n  The Lewiston Elks Lodge has endured two devastating fires, the first \nof which occurred in 1904 after the club's second meeting. The second \nfire happened in 1969, and spurred the group to move the lodge to a new \nlocation overlooking the beautiful Snake River, which passes through \nLewiston. It was at its present location that disaster made a third \nattempt. In 1998, the lodge was closed for more than 18 months after a \nlandslide on the hillside below threatened the structure. Despite these \nobstacles, the Lewiston Elks have continued their community service.\n  The service projects carried out by the Lewiston Elks are \nsignificant. They serve people of all ages, and from every walk of \nlife. Some projects include making Christmas baskets, supporting a drug \nawareness program, poster contests, and an annual food caravan for \nneedy families. The Elks also express their support for individuals and \ngroups in the community by sponsoring a number of awards recognizing \nBoy Scouts, Cub Scouts, Special\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\nOlympics, and Teenager of the Month and Year. Education is another area \nthat the Elks are firm in their support. The Lewiston club offers \nyearly scholarships to local youth ranging from $100 to $1,000.\n  Perhaps one of the greatest contributions from this organization is \nthe support it offers to the Idaho State Elks Rehabilitation Hospital. \nThe modern hospital, located in Boise, serves nearly 12,000 patients a \nyear and is working on a proposal to provide rehabilitation services to \nmilitary veterans returning from war zones. With the support of the \nLewiston Elks and other organizations, the hospital plans to open a new \nHearing and Balance Center in the next few months.\n  On behalf of the citizens of the Lewiston area, and the entire State \nof Idaho, I thank Lodge No. 896 for their commitment to their \ncommunity.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication. It states that \nthe national emergency blocking the property of persons undermining the \ndemocratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe is to continue in \neffect beyond March 6, 2004.\n  The crisis caused by the actions and policies of certain members of \nthe Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's \ndemocratic processes or institutions has not been resolved. These \nactions and policies pose a continuing, unusual, and extraordinary \nthreat to the foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared on March 6, 2003, blocking the property of persons undermining \ndemocratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe and to maintain in \nforce the sanctions to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to regulate interstate commerce by prohibiting the \nsale of children's personally identifiable information for commercial \nmarketing purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, there is now clear evidence \nthat it is open season for large-scale commercial marketing to the \nNation's smallest children. As a result, today I am introducing with \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, legislation to protect the privacy of America's \nchildren.\n   I suspect parents of very young children would not want their \nchildren's names and addresses, their e-mail addresses, their ages and \nother data\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\ntreated as a simple marketplace commodity to be freely bought and sold \nfor a profit with no questions asked. Yet that is exactly what happens \nevery day.\n   Parents may not be aware of it, but large list brokers routinely \nadvertise and sell information on very young children for marketing \npurposes. Their lists cover millions of children and often include such \ndata as ethnicity, family income, and hobbies or interests. In short, \ncommercial trafficking in personal information about very young \nchildren is surprisingly commonplace.\n   How extreme has it gotten? Take a look at this example. The broker \nof this list says on their Web site that they have more than 15 million \nnames of children from the ages of 2 to 13. They said they update it \nmonthly. That is why it is clear it is open season for large-scale \nmarketing to the country's smallest children, which has concerned \nSenator Stevens and I. The list brokers break it down for the \nmarketers, as well, to help them target the very young.\n   On this next graphic, a list broker offers marketing lists that only \ncontain the names of preschool children ages 2 to 5. If that is too \nyoung for a particular marketer's needs, the marketer could pursue \nlists of elementary school children ages 5 through 11 or junior high \nschool kids age 11 to 13. These lists of young children are advertised \nopenly on the Internet for anyone who is interested.\n   We can see the details promised: Full name, address, and age. My \nview is that is not information about youngsters that parents want \navailable for sale without the consent of the parents. But it is \nhappening now all the time because there is big money in marketing to \nthe very young. Children, of course, influence the purchases of their \nparents. Sometimes they have money to spend of their own. As a result, \nan estimated $12 billion per year is spent on marketing to these very \nyoung children.\n   Unfortunately, with all the money involved, the ethics of direct \nmarketing to children and appropriate limits get short shrift. The very \nyoung are not likely to understand the intent and tactics of marketing \npitches the way adults do and may be more vulnerable to influence, \nmanipulation, and questionable and deceptive tactics. The wholesale \ntrafficking of specific information about individual youngsters and the \nuse of that information to target and contact those children for \nmarketing purposes is something that most parents find very troubling.\n   The suggested use for these lists runs the gamut. Here is another \nlist broker that has 20 million names of children in preschool through \neighth grade. They have all kinds of suggestions. We can see a few of \nthe examples on the chart that make it clear exactly how great this \npotential market is.\n   That is why I am introducing today, with the bipartisan support of \nour colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, a privacy act to protect our youngsters.\n   The bill's premise is simple: Trafficking in data on very young \nchildren for the purpose of commercial marketing should not be \npermitted in our country. Specifically, the bill bans the selling or \npurchasing of personal information about people that the seller and \npurchaser know to be very young. There would be an exception for cases \nwhere the parent is given express consent, provided that the parent had \nnotice of what he or she was consenting to and was not required to \ngrant consent as a condition of obtaining a desired product or service.\n  There would also be an exception for the sale of information for \nnonmarketing purposes as long as the purchaser certifies it will \nneither use the information for marketing nor allow others to do so. \nThis exception would allow, for example, health care officials to still \nuse available data to track the spread of a disease or for students, of \ncourse, to get information about various academic activities. The list \nbuyers would have to certify that lists are not being purchased or \nresold for marketing; otherwise they will be in violation of the law.\n  The bill's enforcement provisions track those of the Children's \nOnline Privacy Protection Act. Primary enforcement authority would rest \nwith the Federal Trade Commission, and State attorneys general would be \nauthorized to bring enforcement actions as well.\n  I think we all understand marketers have products they want to get \nout, and lists are a big part of their trade. But it is one proposition \nwhen the person on the list is an adult; it is quite another to be \nbuying and selling and trafficking in all of this data and all of these \nlists on the very young.\n  I say to the Senate, if you just spend a little time on the Internet, \nyou will see what I have concluded; that it is open season for the \nlarge-scale marketing that is targeted at very small children, and we \nought to make an effort to draw some lines.\n  Yes, marketing is accepted and important with respect to adults. But \nI hope my colleagues will join me and Senator Stevens today in \nsupporting a commonsense effort to limit the way in which data is used \nand commercialized about America's smallest children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation I am introducing today with Senator Stevens be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Listbroker \n     Privacy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Commercial list brokers routinely advertise and sell \n     detailed information on children, including names, addresses, \n     ages, and other data, for use in marketing. This data is \n     commonly available on children as young as two years old, \n     enabling marketers to target specific demographics such as \n     junior high school, elementary school, or even preschool.\n       (2) Commercially available marketing databases can be very \n     large, covering millions of children.\n       (3) Commercially available marketing databases can include \n     a variety of information on the children they cover, from \n     ethnicity to family income to hobbies and interests.\n       (4) Money spent on marketing to children has been estimated \n     at $12 billion per year.\n       (5) Several Federal statutes, including section 1061 of the \n     No Child Left Behind Act, the Children's Online Privacy \n     Protection Act, and the Family and Educational Rights and \n     Privacy Act, restrict the collection and disclosure of \n     information about children or students under specified \n     circumstances. When data on children is collected in a manner \n     that is outside the scope of those statutes, however, Federal \n     law does not significantly restrict the commercial sale or \n     resale of such data.\n       (6) The ability to sell information about children to \n     marketers for a profit creates an economic incentive to find \n     new and creative ways to collect and compile such \n     information, and possibly to circumvent or subvert the intent \n     of those Federal statutes that do govern the collection of \n     information about children or students. There are a variety \n     of means and sources that marketers and list brokers can and \n     do use to compile names, addresses, and other data about \n     children.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON SALE OR PURCHASE OF CHILDREN'S \n                   PERSONAL INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is unlawful--\n       (1) to sell personal information about an individual the \n     seller knows to be a child;\n       (2) to purchase personal information about an individual \n     identified by the seller as a child, for the purpose of \n     marketing to that child; or\n       (3) for a person who has provided a certification pursuant \n     to subsection (b)(2), in connection with the purchase of \n     personal information about an individual identified by the \n     seller as a child, to engage in any practice that violates \n     the terms of the certification.\n       (b) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Parental consent.--Subsection (a) does not apply to any \n     sale, purchase, or use of personal information about a child \n     if the parent of the child has granted express consent to \n     that sale, purchase, or use of the information.\n       (2) Certification.--Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to \n     the sale of personal information about a child if the \n     purchaser certifies to the seller, electronically or in \n     writing, before the sale is completed--\n       (A) the purpose for which the information will be used by \n     the purchaser; and\n       (B) that the purchaser will neither--\n       (i) use the information for marketing that child; nor\n       (ii) permit the information to be used by others for the \n     purpose of marketing to that child.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this \n     Act shall be enforced by the Commission as if the violation \n     of section 3 of this Act were an unfair or deceptive act or \n     practice proscribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the \n     Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\n       (b) Enforcement by Certain Other Agencies.--Compliance with \n     this Act shall be enforced under--\n       (1) section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1818), in the case of--\n       (A) national banks, and Federal branches and Federal \n     agencies of foreign banks, by the Office of the Comptroller \n     of the Currency;\n       (B) member banks of the Federal Reserve System (other than \n     national banks), branches and agencies of foreign banks \n     (other than Federal branches, Federal agencies, and insured \n     State branches of foreign banks), commercial lending \n     companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and \n     organizations operating under section 25 or 25A of the \n     Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 601 and 611), by the Board; \n     and\n       (C) banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (other than members of the Federal Reserve \n     System) and insured State branches of foreign banks, by the \n     Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation;\n       (2) section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1818), by the Director of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision, in the case of a savings association the \n     deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation;\n       (3) the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) \n     by the National Credit Union Administration Board with \n     respect to any Federal credit union;\n       (4) part A of subtitle VII of title 49, United States Code, \n     by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to any air \n     carrier or foreign air carrier subject to that part;\n       (5) the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 U.S.C. 181 et \n     seq.)

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act takes effect 6 months after the date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce, with my \ncolleague from Oregon, a bill which protects children from being \nstrategically targeted by commercial advertising.\n  I was shocked to learn that presently there is no law that restricts \ncompanies from purchasing databases which contain information about \nchildren.\n  In fact, websites have been brought to my attention that actually \nsell lists of children as young as pre-school.\n  The thought of companies acquiring lists of information about kids \nthat are barely past the toddler stage is appalling.\n  These companies actually market that the lists can be selected and \npurchased by sorting according to different age groups. They suggest \npossible commercial uses for the lists such as for magazines, amusement \nparks, child care services, etc.\n  One of the websites even points out that many high school students \nhave their own credit cards or have use of their parents' credit cards. \nThe website then suggests that companies could buy these lists so they \ncould market to children various products such as clothing, computers, \netc.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will deter entities from \nselling\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\nthese lists of personal information about children to be used for \ncommercial purposes.\n  The bill will prohibit anyone from selling or buying personal \ninformation about a person who is known to be under 16 years of age \nunless: 1. The parent has given express consent; or 2. The buyer \ncertifies that the information is being obtained for strictly non-\nmarketing purposes. If that is the case, they can't subsequently sell \nthe information to a commercial marketing group.\n  The enforcement will be by the Federal Trade Commission and the 50 \nattorney generals.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon and others on \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2161. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to establish a \nnational health program administered by the Office of Personnel \nManagement to offer Federal employee health benefits plans to \nindividuals who are not Federal employees, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, over 43 million Americans are uninsured, \nwhich means that one in every 7 Americans has no health insurance. It \nis not surprising that two-thirds of the uninsured are low-income. What \nmay be surprising to some is that most of the uninsured--8 in 10--come \nfrom working families. Most of these uninsured are not eligible for \npublic health insurance programs, such as Medicaid or SCHIP.\n  Lack of health insurance too often means poorer health care. The \nuninsured receive less preventive care, are diagnosed at more advanced \ndisease stages, and once diagnosed, tend to receive less therapeutic \ncare. The Institute of Medicine estimates that 18,000 Americans die \nprematurely each year due to the effects of a lack of health insurance.\n  The plight of the uninsured has consequences that reach beyond the \nuninsured. In 2001, the uninsured amounted to about $35 billion in \nuncompensated care. Those costs are borne by all of us through higher \nhealth care costs and government-funded reimbursements.\n  Furthermore, the Institute of Medicine suggests that the reduced \nhealth and higher mortality of the uninsured costs society between $65 \nbillion and $130 billion a year, and concludes that public programs are \nlikely to have higher budgetary costs than they would if everyone under \n65 had health insurance. In addition, the Urban Institute recently \nfound that if people were covered by insurance, there could be savings \nto Medicare and Medicaid of $10 billion a year.\n  Even those who have health insurance find it extremely expensive and \nof poor quality. It is time to expand access to affordable, quality \nhealth insurance for all Americans.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the ``Universal Access to Affordable \nInsurance for All Americans Act of 2004,'' is a partial solution that \nwill give Americans access to the same health insurance program as \nMembers of Congress.\n  It establishes a separate risk pool within the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Program for individuals who wish to purchase individual \nor family coverage. The Office of Personnel Management would make at \nleast one private health insurance plan available through the FEHBP to \nnon-Federal employees. While individuals will have access to the same \nprogram as Federal employees, the entry of others into FEHBP will not \naffect Federal employees at all.\n  My bill also makes this insurance affordable by establishing \nadvanceable, refundable tax credits for certain low and middle-income \nparticipants. For those below poverty, the credit is 100 percent. The \ncredit is gradually decreased up to 400 percent of poverty. So a family \nof 4 making $18,850 or less would receive a 100 percent credit. A \nfamily of 4 making $75,000 would receive a 30 percent credit.\n  We need to begin implementing measures to provide all Americans with \naccess to affordable health coverage. My bill is a step toward this \ngoal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2109-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2109-S2110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 308--DESIGNATING MARCH 25, 2004, AS ``GREEK \n INDEPENDENCE DAY: A NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION OF GREEK AND AMERICAN \n                              DEMOCRACY''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Cochran, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley, \nMr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, \nMs. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \nReed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Senators will be notified when the first vote is scheduled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2171-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I may not use all of my 20 minutes. I have \nbeen talking at some length this afternoon, although it is my custom to \ndo so. I might point out, for those who are interested, this is not a \nfilibuster. I am prepared to vote on this amendment right now. I was \nprepared to vote on it an hour and a half ago, but there are those who \nwant to analyze what I am proposing.\n  I suppose it is more than analysis that is occurring. They are trying \nto figure out how to defeat it, and I regret that because I do not \nthink it is complicated. I think it is straightforward. I think it \nmakes sense.\n  I would not be offering this if this was not a problem sweeping \nacross the country. Concerns are being expressed everywhere by \nAmericans of varying incomes and positions. I know in my own State I \nhave had meetings with people I could not put in the same town or \ncounty together a year ago who are coming to us now and saying, would \nyou please do something here. I am talking about my chambers of \ncommerce.\n  I had a meeting last week at a Teamsters Local that included the \nchambers of commerce, the Manufacturers Association, the International \nAssociation of Machinists and Teamsters. I do not need to remind the \nChair what a unique circumstance that is when a crowd like that gets \ntogether--by the way, all asking me to do the same thing.\n  They were not just asking me but asking us what we were going to do, \nbecause they have watched the alarming decline of manufacturing jobs in \nthe country, and it seems to be accelerating at a dramatic pace.\n  Also the problem they foresee, and I agree with them on this \noutsourcing of jobs, which is very appealing, and I understand it from \na corporate standpoint, when one sees their competitors, neighbors, and \nbusinesses are outsourcing and cutting their budgets by huge amounts \nbecause they can hire someone for $7 a day or $2 an hour, as opposed to \npaying them $40,000, $50,000 or $60,000 a year, then the lure is \nremarkable.\n  As we know, in fact, the Indian government is providing tremendous \nincentives to lure call centers, providing corporations with tax \nexemptions and building western-style technology parks fitted with \ntelecom infrastructures.\n  What are we doing? Are we doing anything to try and compete with that \nor are we just saying that is the way the world is and we better get \nused to it because that is what is going to happen for the foreseeable \nfuture, and maybe something will come along that will all of a sudden \nfill this vacuum, that will restore these manufacturing jobs or \ninformation technology and the like?\n  I can only hope that would be the case because in the absence of \ndoing anything else, we are going to find a continuing decline in this \narea.\n  I worry about this from the standpoint of national security. In my \nState, I have over 5,000 small manufacturers. I have major corporations \nas well. I probably have more large Fortune 500 corporations in my \nState than any other State in the country on a per-capita basis, given \nthe size of my State. My State is the home of major corporations. Many \nof them are major defense contractors, and those 5,000 small \nmanufacturers in many cases are\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nsuppliers of very sophisticated technologies for my defense contractors \nand others who produce sophisticated products.\n\n  I do not need to tell the Presiding Officer, we have lost 35,000 jobs \nnow in 36 months in this area. When those are lost, they are not \nreconstituted. Once they are gone offshore, the idea that you are going \nto rebuild that, my experience is--and I am prepared to listen to \nothers who want to contradict me--I think it is unlikely.\n  So the question I have to ask, as we stand here and receive this news \nalmost on a daily basis, is there not some danger in losing this \nmanufacturing capability for a time in the 21st century when we may \nfind ourselves confronted with the fact these jobs we gave away are now \nbeing held by people in countries that do not agree with us on certain \nmatters, and all of a sudden they do not want to supply us with certain \ncomponent parts that may be necessary to build jet engines, submarines, \nBlack Hawk helicopters or something else my State or the State of \nTennessee or some other part of the country produces?\n  We are watching this tremendous outflow occurring. The Presiding \nOfficer was the former Secretary of Education, as I pointed out \nearlier, and again I understand the budget constraints. This is a very \ndifficult time. Putting aside whether one agrees or disagrees on how we \ngot to this situation, we have a terrible fiscal situation on our hands \nand yet even in the area of job training and assistance we are wiping \nout the manufacturing extension partnerships; we are cutting the SBA by \nmillions of dollars; we are cutting vocational education by $316 \nmillion; we are cutting the Workforce Investment Act by $448 million.\n  We are not only not trying to compete with what India is doing on its \ncreation of call centers, by offering tax incentives for businesses to \nstay here, we are even cutting back in the area that might offer some \nhope to someone in this area who is losing their job because it has \nbeen outsourced some place.\n  On every front, we seem to have nothing to say to this issue right \nnow, except this is the way life is; get over it, America. You just \nhave to live with this. This is the way the world is going to be.\n  I do not think it has to be that way. I think we can do better. I \nthink that is what the American people ask us when we come here--try to \ndo better.\n  I have to look in the eyes of my own child, an infant, and I wonder \nwhat kind of a century she is going to grow up in. She will look back \nsomeday and ask herself, or hopefully me, what did you do back at the \nturn of this century when you knew this was going on, when you saw \nthousands of jobs leaving our country, when you saw manufacturing \ndeclining, what did you do? This was not some sneak attack. You were \nall aware of it. Your local papers wrote about it every day. Did you \noffer any ideas and suggestions on how we might compete in a global \nmarketplace--because we should, we must--while simultaneously not \nlosing the human investments, the human capital, that are critical for \nany successful society to succeed? What did you do?\n  I am afraid if we go back and she looks at what we are doing at the \noutset of this century, then she would be startled to learn we are \ncutting back in the areas that might provide some educational \nopportunity for people in vocational areas, that we had nothing really \nto say to a hemorrhaging of jobs going out of the country, and that we \nwere basically silent except to bemoan the fact that 2.8 million \nmanufacturing jobs in 36 months disappeared in the country. And there \nis every indication those numbers are going to increase, and the impact \non other sectors of our economy will be very profoundly affected.\n\n  I mentioned already we are now being told the outsourcing of American \njobs will probably exceed 3 million, close to 4 million over the next \ndecade, unabated. That is a loss of $136 billion to $140 billion in \nsalaries and wages in the United States, not to mention the human and \nsocietal impact.\n  So I do not apologize to my colleagues for feeling as strongly as I \ndo about this. I am a free trader. I voted for NAFTA. I thought it was \nthe right thing to do. I voted to give fast track authority. I voted \nfor the Jordanian agreements and others. I have opposed some as well. I \nhave not been exclusively for them, but I believe in free and fair \ntrade. I also believe a self-respecting nation cannot allow its human \ncapital intelligence to be lost without standing up and trying to do \nsomething about it.\n  The subject matter of this amendment very simply says at this \njuncture, look, let's stop. At least when it comes to the expenditure \nof Federal taxpayer money, those dollars ought not to be used to pay \nfor outsourcing jobs until we figure out a better way to answer this \nproblem. I do not think that is complicated.\n  Now, I gather K Street in town is going ballistic at this very hour \nbecause obviously major corporations, 400 out of 1,000 top ones in the \ncountry, are doing it. Forty of fifty States are doing it right now. So \nthey want to continue doing it because it is a great saver of money if \nyou are focused on quarterly reports.\n\n  That is their job on K Street and that is their job in the corporate \nboard rooms, to worry quarter by quarter by quarter. I don't think that \nis right, but that is what they do. Thank the Lord there are many \ncorporations who do think longer than that.\n  Our job is not to think in quarters, not to be unmindful that \ncorporations should and must. But our obligation is to have a broader, \ndeeper vision; to think about longer term effects of decisions we make, \nno matter how attractive and how appealing they may be to someone who \nhas to explain to a group of shareholders why it is that they have or \nhave not exceeded last quarter's profit margins--bottom line.\n  Certainly outsourcing will help do that on any given day. If you can \nhire someone for a couple of bucks and lay off that person in \nConnecticut, Tennessee, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, you are going \nto save money, I promise you. Quarterly reports are going to look \ngreat.\n  But my question is, What does America look like? What does our Nation \nlook like in the coming generation? In fact, if we lose these jobs, \nwhich are critical to our own well-being and success, if we lose \nmanufacturing that we cannot replace, if we squander the ability to \nproduce vital components and parts that are essential to contribute to \nour national defense structure, what does my country look like in 5 \nyears, 10 years, 20 years down the line?\n  That is the question I am asking. That is why I am offering this \namendment, to see if we cannot at least step up and say when it comes \nto the taxpayer's dime, that we should not be taking your tax dollar \nand subsidizing this outsourcing of jobs. If a private company, with \nits own money, wants to do it, that is their business. I regret it, but \nif they want to do it they have a right to do it. I think we ought to \nhave tax incentives to discourage them one way or the other, but at the \nend of the day if they want to do it, they ought to be given the right \nto do it. I can't stop that. That is their dime.\n  But on the taxpayer's dime, I think we ought to say something else. \nWhat my amendment does is say you cannot use that dime. You cannot use \nthat dime to lay off somebody and hire someone 14 time zones away to do \na job that a hard-working American ought to be able to hold and do in \norder to provide for their family.\n  I don't think that is outrageous. I don't think that is isolationist \nor protectionist. I think that is standing up for the people of this \ncountry who expect nothing less from those of us who represent them in \nthis Chamber. That is why I am offering this amendment. My hope is \ntomorrow morning we can get to it and vote on it and dispose of it one \nway or the other. If you want to vote against it, vote against it. But \nI ask you to join with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman, \nand others who have been a part of this effort, to say this is our way \nof saying to people out there we hear you.\n  We are not suggesting this amendment is perfect. I would be the last \nperson to say that. I am sure it is not perfect. But at least it says \nto voters and to constituents out there who are worrying every day \nwhether they are going to become one of those statistics, that we are \ngoing to try to do something about this, so you need to know your \nGovernment, your Congress is doing what it can to stop this.\n\n  Our obligation is not exclusively to them. We have obligations to \nothers as\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\nwell, including those who serve and work in these corporations. I am \nnot against them at all, but they are making their decisions in what \nthey determine is in their best interests and the best interests of \ntheir shareholders. I respect that.\n  But I have a higher obligation. I have an obligation, not only to \nthat shareholder but to the people who work for them as well. I respect \nthose who only have to worry about the narrow constituency, but I \nwasn't elected by the people of Connecticut to come here and merely \nworry about that narrow constituency. I have another obligation. I \nserve in the Senate, not just a State legislature. When I am here and I \nvote and I cast ballots, they don't just affect the people who live in \nmy State, that I represent; they are part of the 280 or 290 million \npeople across this country.\n  I look at the 2.8 million who have lost their jobs in manufacturing, \nthe close to 3 million who will lose their jobs to outsourcing in the \ncoming days, maybe as many as 14 million, we are being told, over the \nnext couple of years. I didn't dwell on this particular chart at this \nmoment, but 14 million additional jobs are in danger of being shipped \noverseas. Those people want to know whether or not we have anything to \nsay to them.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I don't know of \nanother issue that is more important to the American public at this \nhour than this one. We have seen it all across the country in the last \nnumber of days. National news programs talk about it every single night \nand report nightly about corporations that are outsourcing more and \nmore jobs.\n  The American people want to know what we have to say to them. So I \nregret we have not been able to vote on this earlier. I didn't intend \nto take this time. I was prepared to vote 2 hours ago, 3 hours ago, but \nthere are those who do not want to vote on this amendment right now. My \nhope is we will be able to do so first thing in the morning and say \nwith a very loud, clear, and my hope is a unanimous voice that we stand \nwith those who worry about whether America is squandering its wealth \nand its treasury, not just the treasury of dollars and cents but a far \nmore important treasury, the human capital that is the American \nworkforce.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I respect the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, as he knows. I will certainly look at this amendment. But \nthroughout this day I have seen others on the other side continually \ntalk about jobs and loss of jobs like we are not doing anything about \nit. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This very bill, FSC/ETI, \nis a very important bill. We call it the Jumpstart Our Business \nStrength on Jobs bill because it will help us to increase the number of \njobs in this country by huge dimensions. It also is a smart thing to \ndo. It also saves us $4 billion in assessed costs with the E.U. in \ninternational trade, if we get this done. That is very important.\n  Some of the comments I have heard today, not those of the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut--in fact, I exclude his \ncomments--some of the comments I have heard today would have you \nbelieve the only way you are going to get jobs is more of the same: \nMore Government, more Government support, more and more controls, more \nand more approaches towards unionizing America.\n  I am one of the few Members of this body who ever held a union \njourneyman's card. I worked 10 years in the building construction trade \nunions and earned my journeyman lather's card. The laths trade was one \nof the most interesting trades. In the early days it was wood lathing, \nlittle partitions of woods that you put on partitions and ceilings that \nyou would plaster over. In my day it was metal lath, which was a much \nmore high-tech approach towards putting up partitions and ceilings and \nelliptical arches and Gothic arches, and it was a very skilled trade \nand I was fortunate that I was able to do that and I am proud I was \nable to do that.\n  Today, the lathing trade is no longer in existence because we priced \nourselves out of the marketplace. Today, all of the lathers who used to \nwork in this very skilled trade had to transition into the carpenters' \nunion because their trade no longer could pay for itself.\n  As a matter of fact, you don't see many buildings plastered today. \nThe reason you don't, it is just too expensive. So drywall has become \nthe norm. I am not criticizing anybody. What I am saying is, we can \nprice ourselves out of the marketplace.\n  I can remember time after time, my fellow union lathers would say: \nHey, kid, slow down. We are not going to have any work if you keep \nworking so fast.\n  My father was one of the best lathers in the world and taught me the \ntrade.\n  He said: Look, you give an honest day's work for an honest day's \ndollar and you work as hard as you can.\n  It was anathema to me to slow down so we could have more work. That \nis what happened. They slowed down and the work dissipated and, of \ncourse, the trade no longer exists.\n  I think we are worse off because we don't have lath and plaster in a \nlot of our buildings today. I am not blaming my fellow union members, \nbut sometimes we have to acknowledge that there are gives and takes in \nthe business world. The fact that some businesses do their business \noffshore is not necessarily bad because in many cases we get even more \njobs onshore. Sometimes we don't. Sometimes it is bad. But by and \nlarge, business in this country has always worked because we believe in \nthe free market system. We believe in competition. We believe in high \nproductivity.\n  My feeling is that this country cannot be beat in productivity. If we \nreally work hard and we continue to do the best we can, we are always \ngoing to be able to compete.\n  But where we cannot compete because of low wages and government \nsubsidization and violations of international trade laws, then, my \ngosh, let's not quit. Let's go and find new jobs.\n  This administration inherited some terrifically bad times. The whole \nlast year of the Clinton administration was headed into recession, and \neverybody knows it. Anybody who says otherwise is not telling the \ntruth. Everybody knows that. So this President inherited that.\n  I don't particularly blame the Clinton administration. We do have \ncycles. But I have to say I think they could have done some things to \nhave prevented it. But that is probably true of everything. He then \ninherited this recession, and on top of that comes September 11, which \ncreated magnificent problems for all of us. It was very costly and \nexpensive and put pressure on the budget. It cost us in so many ways, \neven from a productivity and jobs standpoint.\n\n  But economic growth for the third quarter of last year was up over 8 \npercent. In the fourth quarter, it was 4.1 percent. I know years here \nwhen we would have killed for 4.1 percent. Frankly, I believe the first \nquarter of this year is going to be all right too, even though normally \nit is a slow quarter.\n  I think all we have to do is do our best to work together as \nDemocrats and Republicans without all the screaming and shouting like \none side has all the answers and the other side doesn't, which I have \nheard a lot of today, and put aside the politics and do what is best \nfor our country. Unfortunately, some just can't seem to do that.\n  I believe the President is doing a great job. I believe his various \nCabinet-level officials are doing great work. In fact, I have never \nseen better in my 28 years in the Senate. I believe it is time to be \nfair, decent, and honorable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2173-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2173-S2176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the comments from \nthe distinguished majority leader of last Friday with respect to the \nasbestos legislation. This is an absolutely vital issue for this \ncountry's civil justice system and, most importantly, to our economy.\n  If you want to have jobs, then let us get this asbestos reform bill \nthrough and we will get hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jobs \nback, and perhaps the 70 large companies which have gone into \nbankruptcy will be able to\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\nresurrect themselves and be able to employ more people.\n  We now have the opportunity with S. 1125, the Fairness In Asbestos \nInjury Resolution Act, to correct what has become a gross injustice \nagainst asbestos victims and the defendants who are relentlessly hauled \ninto court despite having never manufactured or ever sold a shred of \nasbestos fiber.\n  It has been a long road for this legislation so far. But I concur \nwith Senator Frist, our distinguished majority leader, that we are \nfinally in a position where we can enact this legislation.\n  We went through a grueling markup of this bill last year, and since \nthen have engaged in focused discussions over remaining differences \nunder the stewardship of my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nand Judge Becker of the third circuit court of appeals. The \nstakeholders and Members involved in these discussions all agree that \nthis process has proved to be quite successful, not only in clarifying \nareas of disagreement but in proposing workable solutions to these \nareas. As a result, there now remains a mere handful of issues left to \nconsider. But given the timeframe set forth by the leader last Friday, \nI believe more needs to be done to help bridge the gap on the remaining \nissues. Therefore, I propose that we get the primary stakeholders and \ninterested Members together for a 2-day-long negotiating session \nsometime in mid- to late-March with this type of focus on the last \nhandful of these issues. I believe we can resolve the remaining \ndifferences in this bill. There is nothing we can't solve, if we will \nwork together. This issue is too important, and we are too close not to \ngive this one last effort through an extended 2-day-long meeting. I \nknow Judge Becker and the stakeholders and the key Republican Members \nhave all expressed their desire to participate in this 2-day meeting. I \nhope my Democratic colleagues who have been working on this issue will \njoin us in the final push toward reaching consensus.\n\n  Let me give some background for those who have not been as steeped in \nthis legislation over the past year or so. For more than 20 years, \ncompensation to legitimate victims of asbestos exposure has been \nunacceptably diminished and delayed. It has become quite evident to the \ncommittee that tens of thousands of true asbestos victims are faced \nwith agonizing pain and suffering with uncertain prospects of a \nmeaningful recovery in our existing tort system. These victims are left \nwith little to nothing because precious resources are being diverted to \nunimpaired plaintiffs and a handful of creative trial lawyers who are \nlooking to make a quick buck.\n  I am a member of the American Trial Lawyers Association, having been \na trial lawyer in my former non-Senate life, since we Mormons believe \nin a premortal existence. I have to say that my fellow ATLA members are \nembarrassed by this small cadre of personal injury lawyers who are \nthinking only of themselves and the huge fees they make, with the \napproximately 50 to 60 percent of the moneys that go to attorneys. They \nare embarrassed by it. They won't say that because they don't want to \ncut up their fellow personal injury lawyers. But that is what is going \non here.\n  In up to 90 percent of the cases that have been filed, the person has \nnever had a sick day in his life with regard to asbestos. In most of \nthose cases, they have been sent to doctors who will find injury no \nmatter what. It borders on fraud and in some cases it is fraudulent. It \nis wrecking the country. Seventy major companies are now in bankruptcy, \nand there are over 8,400 or more, going up to 15,000, that possibly \nwill be thrown into bankruptcy that never had anything to do with \nasbestos or made anybody ill from asbestos.\n  At the same time, scores of companies with almost no connection to \nthe problem have had to file for bankruptcy, as I have said, and \nhundreds of others live under the constant threat of insolvency from \nthis litigation. What this translates into is lost jobs, depleted \npensions, and weaker financial markets.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle want to do something \nabout jobs, let us get serious about asbestos reform. Let us get \nserious about doing what is right for those who are truly ill and who \nwon't get very much at all. Those who were employed by 70 companies are \ngetting 5 cents on the dollar. We take care of them with this trust \nfund.\n  We have heard the statistics but they bear repeating. The RAND \nInstitute for Civil Justice tells us, to date, 70 companies have been \nforced into bankruptcy--at least 3 with operations in my home State of \nUtah.\n  The number of claims continues to rise as does the number of \ncompanies pulled into the web of this abusive litigation, often with \nlittle, if any, culpability. More than 600,000 people have filed \nclaims, and more than 8,400 companies have been named as defendants in \nasbestos litigation.\n  This has become such a gravy train for some abusive personal injury \nlawyers that over 2,400 additional companies were named in the last \nyear alone. RAND, this great research institution, also notes in its \nbipartisan research that about ``two-thirds of the claims are now filed \nby the unimpaired, while in the past they were filed only by the \nmanifestly ill.''\n  That is a low number. It is really up to 90 percent. But let us take \ntheir number. Two-thirds of them are filed by people who really are not \nimpaired.\n  Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, amongst many others, has \ndenounced this type of ``jackpot justice.''\n  To address this national problem, I introduced a bipartisan bill with \nmy friends, Senators Ben Nelson, Mike DeWine, Zell Miller, George \nVoinovich, George Allen, Saxby Chambliss, and Chuck Hagel. This bill \ncreates a trust fund which provides expedited no-fault compensation to \nvictims while reducing the wasteful transaction costs. Attorney's fees \nand transactions costs have been as high as 60 percent of the amounts \nrecovered.\n  After weeks of marking up the bill, we passed this legislation \nfavorably from the committee with bipartisan support last July. No one \ncan accuse us of being unwilling to compromise. When I look at where \nour bill started--and it was a good start--and where it is now, our \nwillingness to compromise is abundantly clear.\n  Let me show you this chart. In total, we have made 53 changes to this \nbill to accommodate concerns raised by our friends on the other side, \nthe Democrats.\n  Let me review a brief history of these changes. In May, we circulated \na bipartisan draft measure, and my staff met then with Democratic staff \nto listen to their concerns. As a result of these discussions, we \nincorporated many of their requests even before introduction.\n  We then embarked on several weeks of markups that saw dozens of \nDemocratic-initiated amendments adopted into this legislation. I didn't \nagree with all of these amendments, but it can't be said that there \nhasn't been strong participation with Democrats on this bill.\n  By the way, I met for a couple of hours with the head of the AFL-CIO \nto explain this bill to him.

That chart is amazing. I don't agree with all those \nchanges, but we made them to accommodate our friends on the other side. \nJust look at all these changes. No one can tell us we are not doing \neverything we can to make this bill a consensus bill and to be fair to \neverybody.\n  We know there are a lot of people who will be compensated under this \nbill who have never suffered a bit from asbestos, but we have given the \nbenefit of the doubt. Many of them are union workers who have smoked \nall their lives and got cancer from smoking but have had something to \ndo with asbestos at one time or another in their career but probably \nhave shown no feasible asbestos.\n  Literally thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands, will be \ncompensated. There comes a point where you have to say, Let's do what \nis right here. Let's not just keep loading this bill up so you can beat \nyour breast and claim you get more money, more blood out of these \ncompanies.\n  Moreover, even though our original claim values would have on average \nprovided more money to legitimate claimants, we increased the values \neven more and we removed most collateral source offsets to ensure more \nof the award goes directly to the claimant. That means even though they \nreceived moneys, we removed those as offsets.\n  These changes listed on the chart behind me do not even include other \nchanges we have offered since the bill was reported out of committee. \nThrough the leadership of the majority leader, we got contributors to \nadd an additional $6 billion in overall funding along with significant \nincreases in claims values in many categories. We started at $94 \nbillion in mandatory funding because this amount would give more money \nto claimants on average than they received in the current tort system. \nNonetheless, through the markup in the Frist financing agreement, we \nincreased the fund to have the capacity to pay out $114 billion to \nclaimants. It is not just money, either. The Frist financing deal adds \nmore flexible borrowing authority as yet another safeguard for \nsolvency. Senator\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\nFrist has my cooperation and support in doing this.\n  Our willingness to resolve the Democratic concerns speaks for itself \nby virtue of where this bill stands today. I again thank Senators Frist \nand Specter for their willingness to help resolve some of the difficult \nissues on this legislation and, of course, the cosponsors as well.\n  Let me talk about the final issues. Even though we made all of these \nchanges that show up here, I understand some want to make further \nchanges, including streamlining the claims process even more. I have \nsaid I am willing to look at such proposals, but the time has come and \nthe time is past to wrap up this process. It passed out of the \ncommittee last summer and we need to stop talking and do something. \nWith all of this whining about jobs that all of us want to get in this \ncountry, this bill would do more to create jobs and solidify our \neconomy than any other bill we can pass this year. This bill makes \nsense except for how costly it is, but even then we are willing to do \nthat. This is why we need to continue working for the next several \nweeks on the issues and sit down in a 2-day meeting sometime in the \nlast half of March to see if we can finally get agreement on all of the \nissues.\n  I thank Senator Specter and Judge Becker for their valuable \nassistance. I was not really happy because we had gone through so much \nand I had commitments from so many people if we got to $108 billion, \nthis bill would go and they would support it. I got it to $108 \nbillion--and I think they thought we could not do it--and they said we \nhave to have more and more and more. We are giving them more, even.\n\n  I also appreciate the willingness of Senator Specter and Judge Becker \nto help finally resolve these issues in a 2-day session. My friends, \nSenators Leahy, Dodd, and Daschle, have been graciously willing to sit \ndown with us at a staff level to narrow the differences and I am \nconfident they will be willing to join in this 2-day meeting as well. \nWe are willing to accommodate schedules to get full participation in \nthis meeting within a reasonable fashion.\n  We simply cannot delay any longer. We need to ensure the truly sick \nget paid and paid in a timely manner. We need to provide stability to \nour economy by stemming the rampant litigation that resulted in a tidal \nwave of bankruptcies and stop endangering jobs and pensions through the \ncurrent broken system. This crisis reaches far and wide and it hurts \neveryone.\n  What is happening with these bad acting personal injury lawyers who \nhave been handling some of these cases, they forum-shop the cases into \njurisdictions where juries go wild and judges support them and judges \nare in the pocket of the plaintiffs' lawyers. In one case, if I recall \nit correctly, five people, not one of whom experienced a sick day up to \nthat time, got $125 million, while thousands and thousands of very sick \npeople get nothing. That is wrong.\n  For anybody to keep supporting that process the way some have done is \nwrong. That is why I am here on the floor to challenge all of our \ncolleagues to work together in good faith, put our differences aside \nand let's get this bill done in the best interests of our country and \nthe best interests of jobs. If that is not done, I would not listen to \none ``mouthing'' word from people on jobs because they are playing \npolitics rather than doing the art of the doable, doing what needs to \nbe done, what must be done in the interests of the sick people, the \ntruly sick people and, I might add, many others who did not get their \nsickness from asbestos, but we give them the benefit of the doubt.\n  This bill really will work even though I have to admit it is very \ntough on the companies that have to come up with this $114 billion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/03/senate-section/article/S2176-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
