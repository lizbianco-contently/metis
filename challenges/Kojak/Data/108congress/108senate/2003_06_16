Mr. President, I will make a very brief opening \nstatement and then our friend and colleague from Nebraska, Senator \nHagel, who has been extremely active and has a very innovative proposal \nto deliver prescription drugs to our seniors, is going to take over for \nthis side for the remainder of the afternoon.\n  This is indeed a historic debate. ``Historic debate'' is a term \nperhaps over used in the Senate but that is not the case today. Today, \nafter almost 40 years from Medicare's creation, we begin debate on \nlegislation to help our most frail citizens acquire the miraculous but \nexpensive prescription drugs they need.\n  For decades, we have witnessed the ever-expanding power of innovative \npharmaceutical drugs both to cure and to treat. For decades, we have \ntalked about providing our seniors, the poor and fragile of our \nsociety, the financial aid and means to acquire those wonder drugs. For \nyears, colleagues on both sides of the aisle have talked of the need. \nToday, the talk ends and the action begins.\n  What begins today will be completed this year. There are many reasons \nbut none greater than the leadership of one man, George W. Bush. He is \nthe reason we are at this point in the Senate today. It is President \nBush who has made the commitment, shown the leadership, and challenged \nthe Congress to act that has made this day possible. Yet President \nBush's Medicare effort, like that of past Presidents, might have been \nfor naught except for the leadership of Dr. Bill Frist. As a doctor and \nreformer in the 1997 Medicare Commission and now as Senate majority \nleader, he is uniquely qualified to make a difference, and a difference \nhe has made in that his decisive leadership has resulted in this bill, \nS. 1, which we have before us today and will have before us for the \nnext 2 weeks, if that is what it takes to get final action.\n\n  Other prescription drug bills have been before the Senate, but this \nis the first time the Senate considers a bill actually reported out of \nthe Finance Committee with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. That is \ntruly unprecedented and a further tribute to Dr. Frist.\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\n  Success has many fathers and anyone would be hard-pressed to limit \njust one Democrat as critical to the success we have today. Senators \nBreaux, Baucus, and Kennedy have all been as unwavering as they have \nbeen untiring in their efforts to provide prescription drugs to our \nsenior citizens. On our side of the aisle, Chairman Grassley skillfully \nnavigated this bill through the Finance Committee to a strong \nbipartisan vote. Senator Nickles, the Budget chairman, is to be \ncommended for ensuring full funding of the President's Medicare \nproposal in the budget and his tireless work to ensure the bill keeps \nfaith with the President's original proposal and the future generations \nhis proposal sought to protect. I look forward to continuing working \nwith him to produce the best bill possible.\n  I want to say again the efforts of our colleagues, Senator Chuck \nHagel and Senator John Ensign, with their innovative proposal, which I \nhope will be thoroughly vetted in the course of this debate, are to be \ncommended for their outstanding leadership on this issue. Combined, \nthese efforts have produced a bill that will strengthen and improve \nMedicare and guarantee a prescription drug benefit. It will improve the \nquality of Medicare to guarantee its benefits for our parents and our \nchildren. It preserves traditional Medicare while allowing seniors to \nchoose a benefit package that best fits their needs and gives them the \nsame type of choices enjoyed by those of us in Congress and other \nFederal employees. It protects low-income seniors by giving them \nadditional help in paying for prescription drugs. It protects all \nseniors from catastrophic drug costs. It addresses many of the problems \nassociated with rural health care for our seniors on Medicare.\n  Debate on this bill will be difficult. Some will say it does too \nlittle. Others insist it does too much. Some will say the reforms go \ntoo far. Others will say the reforms do not go far enough. Where I \nstand is about where the President stands. He applauds the product but \nbelieves we need to do more reform, and I agree with that entirely. He \nbelieves in a fair competition between Government and the private \nsector to provide goods and services at the lowest costs, the private \nsector will win. I certainly agree with that, provided we craft this in \na way that gets the private sector a chance.\n\n  He believes any reform of Medicare must begin with the infusion of \nprivate sector responsiveness and cost control. Again, I certainly \nagree.\n  The questions we share are: Will we achieve more reform? Will we \nensure fair competition between the Government and the private sector? \nWill the reform we inject exceed the costs of the new benefit? That is \nwhat this debate is about. Today we begin to shoot with real bullets. \nThis is no longer a ploy for the next election; this is about the next \ngeneration. This is not just about Medicare prescriptions; it is about \nMedicare preservation. This is not just about our parents and our \ngrandparents; it is about our children and our grandchildren. If we \nkeep this in mind, I believe we can produce a product that preserves \nthe social contract of Medicare with our parents, as well as our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7906-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the hour \nof 2 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof S. 1 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act to make improvements in the medicare program, to provide \n     prescription drug coverage under the medicare program, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge my colleague, the \ndistinguished Republican assistant majority leader, for his remarks.\n  I see Senator Kennedy in the Chamber.\n  Senator Kennedy, thank you for your leadership.\n  I have a statement, and my understanding is that we will then rotate \nstatements on both sides for the rest of the afternoon.\n  Over the next 2 weeks, the Senate will begin a historic effort to \nreform and strengthen Medicare. What we do here over the coming weeks \nwill affect every American and future generations. Health care is a \ndefining issue for our Nation. We must take the long view and recognize \nthat if we do it right, the changes we make in health care, in the \ndelivery of that care, will result in improved access to quality care \nand lower costs for Americans well into the future. This must be our \nobjective.\n  The Senate Finance Committee bill represents a good solid beginning. \nThe Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Grassley \nand Ranking Minority Member Baucus, deserves great credit for its hard \nwork and efforts in bringing the bill to the floor of the Senate. Over \nthe next 2 weeks, the Senate will work with members to improve upon \ntheir bill.\n  Medicare is one of the two largest programs in the Federal \nGovernment. Today, Medicare covers over 40 million Americans, including \n35 million over the age of 65 and nearly 6 million younger adults with \npermanent disabilities.\n  Medicare serves all eligible beneficiaries without regard to income \nor medical history. It is projected to pay out $269 billion in both \nPart A and Part B benefits this year. This accounts for 13 percent of \nthe Federal budget and $1 out of every $5 spent in America on health \ncare.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was created, only about half of America's \nseniors had health insurance and fewer than 25 percent had adequate \nhospitalization insurance. Now, because of Medicare, nearly all seniors \nhave coverage. Medicare has been good for seniors and has become a \ndominant part of the U.S. health care system.\n  But Medicare does more for seniors than protect their health. \nMedicare improves their quality of life. Since Medicare was enacted, \npeople are living longer and living better. Life in America has changed \ndramatically over the last 40 years, especially health care.\n  Medicine today addresses all conditions and diseases, with a special \nemphasis on preventive medicine and management of chronic conditions. \nThis includes an emphasis on prescription drugs, diet, exercise, and \nlifestyle--health dynamics that were not given much consideration when \nMedicare was enacted in 1965.\n  Medical technology has exploded, and we have experienced a revolution \nin the development of new and effective pharmaceuticals. Outpatient \ntreatment and prescription drugs have become mainstays of medical care, \nbut the Medicare Program does not reflect these changes in health care. \nLike medicine itself, the Medicare Program must adjust and reform to \naddress these new realities in health care delivery, consumer demand, \nand costs. Medicare is a 1960s model trying to operate in a 21st \ncentury world. Our goal in this debate is to bring this valuable \nprogram in line with today's health care needs in a responsible and \nsustainable program and prepare for the future.\n\n  As we look forward, we should also heed the lessons learned when \nMedicare was created. When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the Federal \nGovernment's lead actuary at the time projected that the hospital \nprogram, Medicare Part A, would grow to $9 billion by 1990. But the \nprogram actually ended up costing more than $66 billion by 1990. Even \nafter adjusting for inflation and other factors, the cost of Medicare \nPart A in constant dollars was 165 percent higher than the official \nGovernment estimate according to the actuary who produced those \nnumbers. In unadjusted dollars, actual costs were 639 percent above \nestimates.\n  A 1968 Tax Foundation study found that public spending on medical \ncare had nearly doubled in just the first 3 years of Medicare. A recent \nexample of these accelerating costs is that since 1999, drug prices \nhave risen about 20 percent. The average cost of these lifesaving \npharmaceuticals will likely continue to increase, placing further \npressure on seniors with fixed incomes.\n  In addition to the internal problem of the changing realities of \nhealth care,\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nMedicare is facing a looming external program. The largest generation \nin American history, the baby boomers, is aging. These Americans--over \n75 million--will be added to the Medicare rolls over the next few \nyears. The baby boom generation has changed and shaped every market in \nwhich it has ever participated. Medicare health care will be no \nexception. We have a responsibility to address this demographic \npressure now or risk the system collapsing under its own weight in the \nfuture.\n  The task before us is immense but so is the opportunity. Although \nCongress has been working with health care professionals, we must \ncontinue to listen carefully to those who know most about health care. \nWe need to assure the American people that the promises made to them \nwill be kept and that seniors on Medicare today will not be forced to \nchange or lose their benefits, but for the future enhancement and \nviability of Medicare, changes will be required. The American people \nmust have confidence in the medical reform process, the process we use \nto reform Medicare. This is important because as we move forward, all \nAmericans, especially seniors, must then have confidence in the \nresults.\n  Facing these challenges will require difficult decisions. There will \nbe no perfect solutions. There will always be imperfect solutions at \nthe end of the day. At the same time, we must be responsible with our \nefforts. We are adding a costly new benefit to America's largest health \nentitlement program. In making decisions, we must not discount or \nminimize what we know has worked and what has not worked.\n  Much of the debate over the next 2 weeks will focus on prescription \ndrugs. Medicare does not currently cover outpatient prescription drugs. \nAdding a responsible, sustainable, and meaningful drug benefit is a top \npriority for most in the Senate. Seniors are expecting to spend nearly \n$1.9 trillion on drugs over the next 10 years. Clearly, the Federal \nGovernment simply cannot take on all of that expense. But seniors need \nhelp. They need help now. More than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries \nhave no prescription drug coverage.\n  Mr. Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute was quoted in \nthe New York Times on Saturday as saying:\n\n       These seniors are the last people in America who are paying \n     retail. When I turn 65, I'd hate to be the only one in the \n     pharmacy line who's not in some kind of pain.\n\n  Also in Saturday's New York Times, Mr. Dana Goldman of the RAND \nCorporation, said:\n\n       What you really want to do is insure against very high \n     expenditures. A catastrophic plan would be a cautious \n     approach to sticking your toe in the water.\n\n  We should heed their advice as we move forward.\n  Any Medicare drug benefit must be sustainable. The benefit must deal \nwith the realities that people are living longer and better, and have \nhigher health care expectations than ever before.\n  A new drug benefit should strengthen public/private partnerships that \nwork. Any new drug benefit must pay particular attention to those in \ngreatest need who have no options today, but this should not be at the \nexclusion of other seniors.\n  We must take care that we do not inadvertently stifle innovation in \nthe private pharmaceutical, medical research, and healthcare sectors.\n  We know advances in research and medicine have been the critical \nfactors in our increased lifespans, better health, and improved quality \nof life. The public/private relationship in these areas has been \nessential to that success.\n  The United States leads the world in medical innovation. Our actions \nover the next 2 weeks must not jeopardize that continued innovation \nbut, rather strengthen it for the future.\n  The special healthcare needs of rural areas are of great importance \nto me and many of my colleagues. What we do in this body over the next \n2 weeks should enhance rural healthcare as well as urban healthcare.\n  Tough choices and difficult decisions will have to be made. Not \neveryone will agree with the choices we make, but we owe it to the \nAmerican people to face these challenges and produce a reformed \nMedicare program that will take America's seniors well into the 21st \nCentury. That is doable, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in this important effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me begin by praising the chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley, for his fine \nleadership and cooperative management of this bill. He has been very \ngood. I know the folks in Iowa know that, but I want everybody else \ntuning in to know it as well. The chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Chuck Grassley, has done a tremendous job. He deserves a lot \nof praise for this bill.\n  On that point, sometimes we fail to recognize just how historic some \nlegislation is. This is truly a historic bill. This is not some garden \nvariety piece of legislation that has come up and will pass in the \nSenate. This is a major expansion of Medicare--major. It is going to \nmake a huge difference in the lives of many senior citizens in America. \nI again thank Senator Grassley for his help putting this together.\n  I also thank many Senators who have helped bring us here today. \nSenator John Breaux from Louisiana has been tireless in his effort on \nthe Medicare Commission and other efforts to get prescription drug \nbenefits and to try to reform Medicare. His work has been \nindispensable.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine, Senator Hatch from Utah, Senator \nJeffords from Vermont, have all contributed mightily to these efforts. \nIt would take me a long time to go through all the efforts they have \nundertaken if I were to recite chapter and verse all they have done. It \nhas been monumental.\n  Any discussion for the long struggle for improved health care in \nAmerica would be absolutely incomplete without the mention of the \nlongstanding effort of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. \nSenator Kennedy is on the floor. He is probably going to speak a little \nlater. Without Senator Kennedy and his efforts, I am not so sure we \nwould be here today, on cusp of passing truly historic legislation.\n  We are here today to make a meaningful improvement in health care for \nour seniors. That is why we are here. We are here at last to bring \nprescription drug coverage to Medicare.\n  On July 30, the Nation will celebrate the 38th anniversary of the \nenactment of Medicare. Without exaggeration, Medicare is simply one of \nthe most successful enterprises ever taken by a free people working \nthrough their government. Today we are about the business of making it \neven better.\n  Medicare took a long time in coming. Following the enactment of \nSocial Security in 1933, progressives called unsuccessfully for a \nprogram of national health insurance. President Harry Truman repeatedly \nadvocated national health insurance funded through payroll deductions, \nbut as we know, his plan went nowhere. But the fact remains, retired \nAmericans had a particularly difficult time getting health insurance in \nthe private sector.\n  In 1951, planners at the Federal Security Agency, recognizing that \ndifficulty, examined extending health insurance to this population. The \nidea slowly gained popularity in the 1950s.\n  Senator John Kennedy raised health care as a campaign issue in his \nsuccessful 1960 Presidential campaign. Taking the reins of the \nPresidency from his fallen predecessor, President Lyndon Johnson spoke \nof moving, ``not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, \nbut upward toward the Great Society.''\n\n  At the height of legislative action of President Johnson's Great \nSociety in July 1965, Congress enacted Medicare into law in the Health \nInsurance for the Aged Act. With President Truman at his elbow, \nPresident Johnson signed the bill in Independence, MO. President \nJohnson at that time said, ``No longer will older Americans be denied \nthe healing miracle of modern medicine.''\n  And President Truman told President Johnson, ``You have made me a \nvery happy man.''\n  Since then, over the nearly four decades of its life, Medicare has \nimproved the lives of over 100 million Americans. Medicare now provides \nhealth insurance coverage to more than 35 million seniors, virtually \neveryone aged 65 or older, and 6 million disabled enrollees for \nhospital or related care under the\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\nHospital Insurance Program. It covers nearly as many for doctors' \nservices, outpatient hospital services, and other medical expenses \nunder the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program.\n  Medicare has been a success. Health care expenses used to impoverish \nseniors. In conjunction with Social Security, Medicare has \nsignificantly reduced poverty among seniors. Despite progress on \npoverty among seniors, they are by no means an affluent group. From \n2001 data, we can see that nearly two-thirds of Social Security \nbeneficiaries rely on Social Security for most of their income. A third \nof beneficiaries rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of \ntheir income. In 2001, the median income for all eligible households \nwas $19,000, and one-fifth have incomes under $10,000; thus, vast \nnumbers of America's seniors need Medicare and Social Security to keep \nout of poverty.\n  With the nearly universal health insurance coverage and decreasing \npoverty achieved by Medicare and Social Security, seniors are also \nliving longer. Before Social Security and Medicare, in 1930, for \nexample, a 60-year-old had a life expectancy of 77 years of age. In the \nyear 2000, 70 years later, a 65-year-old-man could expect to live to 81 \nand a 65-year-old woman could expect to live to 84. Partly because of \nMedicare, more and more Americans are living into their late eighties \nand into their nineties.\n  Medicare has also improved the quality of seniors' lives. It has \nhelped them to combat debilitating illnesses. It has helped them be \nfree from pain. It has helped them to live fuller, better lives.\n  But the practice of medicine has also progressed since Congress set \nup the structure of Medicare. Prescription drugs have taken on a much \ngreater role in maintaining health, replacing procedures, as has more \nprevention. Prescription drugs are just proportionately so much more \nimportant today than they were when Medicare was created.\n  The Congress that created Medicare did not envision that role of \nprescription drugs. Although former employers and other private \ninsurance plans cover some seniors, about 10 million seniors have no \nprescription drug coverage at all.\n  Because seniors are not a wealthy group, for many this reality means \na painful choice between filling their prescriptions and buying food.\n  I visited a community health center and talked to an internist--a \ndoctor--the administrator of that health center. She told me she had to \ncut back on her medicine. She has to give up some of her medicine. Why? \nIn order to pay for the medicines for her mother. Just think of it. A \ndoctor who has to cut back on medicines for herself because they are so \nexpensive and because her mother can't afford them. The doctor is \nsacrificing her health care to make sure her mother has prescription \ndrug benefits. That is not an isolated incident. It is happening over \nand over again in America, and it is wrong.\n  Seniors should not have to choose among necessities in order to \nmaintain their health. We can do something about that today.\n  To maintain Medicare's success, we must expand it to address the \nhealth care delivery structure that we have today. The bill that we \nbring to the floor would take a substantial step in that direction.\n  This bill would make available Medicare prescription drug insurance \nuniversally to all seniors. It maintains the important principle of \nuniversalism that has held together the remarkable social compact of \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  This bill would ensure that 44 percent of Medicare beneficiaries--\nthose with the lowest incomes--would have truly affordable prescription \ndrug coverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs. For these lower-income \nseniors with incomes up to 160 percent of the poverty level, co-\npayments would never exceed 20 percent of the cost of drugs.\n  Just think of that--never more than 20 percent.\n  This bill would make it so that an elderly retired couple in Great \nFalls, MT with an income of $16,000 a year, would be able to buy their \nprescription drugs without ever having to pay more than 10 percent of \nthe cost of the drugs.\n  This bill would thus ensure that those who have been least able to \nreceive what President Johnson called ``the healing miracle of modern \nmedicine'' would now be able to do so. Millions of people would have a \nbetter quality of life. Lives would be saved.\n  This bill would create a strong government fallback. Seniors would \nhave access to at least two private plans for a prescription drug \nbenefit or the government would provide a standard fallback plan. If \nthere is no true competition, then traditional Medicare would provide a \nfallback.\n  Now some have raised fears that the competition that this bill seeks \nto foster would lead to the privatization of Medicare. This is not so. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services would continue to oversee \nthese plans. The plans would operate within tightly-controlled limits. \nThis bill includes strong consumer protections.\n  This bill does not tilt the playing field. This bill does not make \nprivate plans a better deal than traditional Medicare.\n  But those of us who believe in traditional Medicare should not fear \nthe entry of private options. For either they will work and make things \nbetter for beneficiaries, or traditional Medicare will still be there. \nIt is another opportunity. Either private plans will deliver the \nefficiencies that their advocates on the other side of the aisle \npromise for them--in which case the beneficiaries who choose them will \nget more value for their contributions--or traditional Medicare will \nstill be there.\n  Others have found fault with the costs that this bill would ask \nbeneficiaries to pay. Some have focused on what they call a break-even \npoint--of a little more than a thousands dollars in drug spending--\nbelow which higher-income beneficiaries would spend more on the plan \nthan they would receive in benefits. Yes, from a third to half of \nbeneficiaries might spend more in a given year than they receive in \nbenefits. But that means that from half to two-thirds will get more in \nbenefits than they spend.\n  But it should not be surprising that some will pay more in premiums \nthan they receive in benefits. That is the nature of insurance. We pay \nfor insurance to protect against the risk of something that we hope \nwill not happen. Most of us would be thankful if we do not encounter \nthe ailments that require us to use our health insurance. Many would \ncount that a blessing.\n\n  But this bill would provide a substantial subsidy for the health \ninsurance need of Medicare beneficiaries. That is the nature of the \ncost of this bill. We as a society are choosing to make this insurance \navailable at a substantial subsidy to all seniors.\n  For millions of Americans who are less fortunate, who have lower \nincomes and health needs, this bill will make a dramatic difference. \nFor the 44 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with lower incomes, this \nplan would provide very affordable benefits. And remember that this \nlower-income population includes precisely the group most likely to be \ndoing without prescription drug coverage today.\n  I acknowledge that some may have legitimate concerns with this bill. \nI note, in particular, that I and other drafters of the bill have \nbecome struck by CBO's high estimate of the percentage of beneficiaries \nwhose former employers would drop their coverage, if Medicare started \nproviding it. I would also like to find a way to make it so that \nseniors who were in a fallback plan could stay with that plan longer. \nI, for one, will look for opportunities during this process to address \nthese concerns and improve the bill.\n  But this bill would create a $400 billion expansion of a major \nentitlement program. Yes, we could have done more with more money. But \nthis is a historic opportunity to make a fundamental change for the \nbetter, for millions of Americans.\n  In so doing, this bill would finally do something that the \noverwhelming majority of industrialized nations have already done; that \nis, provide prescription drug benefits to their seniors.\n  Medicare took a long in coming. But it came quickly when it did. \nSometimes, the time is simply ripe.\n  The Health Insurance for the Aged took several decades to come to the \nSenate floor in 1965. But when the Senate took it up in 1965, it \nfinished its debate in 4 days--July 6 through July 9 of 1965--and \npassed the bill with 68 votes.\n  Starting today, we will spend 2 weeks on this debate. And we should. \nAnd I look forward to a full and open airing of the issues.\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\n  But in the end, I also look forward to passage of this new benefit, \nwith substantial support from both sides of the aisle.\n  The time was ripe in the summer of 1965, when Congress enacted the \nHealth Insurance for the Aged Act and created Medicare. I believe that \nthe time is ripe again, today.\n  The time is ripe for a new chapter in the successful story of \nMedicare. And we begin that chapter today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to at the opening of this debate \nand discussion recognize the guiding lights of this legislation, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus, for bringing this legislation to \nthe floor.\n  This legislation in one form or another has been before the Finance \nCommittee for 5 to 6 years in recent times, actually going back to 1978 \nwhen legislation was introduced by myself, Senator Thurmond, and others \nat other times. But this is a major breakthrough, as was pointed out by \nthe Senator from Kentucky. This legislation is going to lead to \nconference and eventually it will be signed by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  So this is good news for all the seniors of this country. It isn't \nall that all of us would like to have achieved. But, nonetheless, it is \na solid downpayment.\n  I will take a few minutes of the Senate's time to indicate what I \nfind to be the most compelling reasons for the legislation, and also \ndiscuss areas which I hope in the time we have to debate that the \nSenate will give some focus and attention to.\n  But we should not minimize the extraordinary work that has been done \nby the chairman, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus of Montana, in \nmoving this legislation through the committee; and also other members \nof the committee. I also add to that the majority leader, Senator \nFrist. Senator Frist is a member of the Committee on Finance but he is \nalso on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. He \nbrings a very unique background and experience in health care policy \nmatters. Clearly, he has had a very important influence in the shaping \nof this legislation. All of us welcome his involvement in the health \ncare debate. We have worked together on a number of the bioterrorism \npieces of legislation and in other areas. I think we are fortunate to \nhave his expertise in the Senate on health care matters. We are \ngrateful for his involvement in this legislation.\n  I was here in the spring of 1994 when the Medicare legislation was \ndefeated. It was defeated by a significant number--I think 15 or 18 \nvotes--at that particular time. And then I was here again in 1995--\nabout 10 months later--when again the Senate considered the \nlegislation, and it passed overwhelmingly; and a number of those who \nvoted against it actually voted in favor of it.\n  The principal intervening event between 1964 and 1965 was the 1964 \nelection, where this was front and center in terms of President \nJohnson's election. It had been in the 1960 election, but in 1964, \ngiven the fact that Medicare had been defeated, it was a matter of \nenormous concern to seniors.\n  As has been appropriately pointed out, it isn't just the seniors who \nare interested in this legislation, it is generational because so many \nof those who are not seniors are involved in the quality of life for \nthose who are seniors. They are the children and the grandchildren, and \nthey care very deeply that their parents and grandparents are going to \nlive in peace and security and dignity.\n  When we passed the Medicare proposal, we gave the assurances to our \nseniors that if they played by the rules, paid into the health care \nsystem, paid into the Medicare system, that their health care needs \nwould be attended to. That was true with regard to hospitalization. It \nwas true with regard to physician services. We did not anticipate the \nthird leg of that stool of Medicare was going to be the prescription \ndrugs. Only about 3 percent of the total private insurance company \nplans at that time had a prescription drug program. It was not \nincluded.\n  And now, if you look at the needs of our senior citizens, we ask \nourselves, why didn't we have the foresight to see that need? And why \nhaven't we taken action in order to remedy that loophole?\n  It has taken a long time, but we are finding a strong downpayment in \nmeeting that obligation today. I have always believed that every day we \nfail to pass a prescription drug program we are violating our \ncommitment, our promise, our guarantee to the elderly people in this \ncountry in that solemn promise we made when we passed Medicare: Pay \ninto the system, and you will be assured that your health care needs \nwill be attended to. So it has been a long time in coming.\n  There are those who have been strongly opposed to a prescription drug \nprogram for ideological reasons. They are strongly opposed to Medicare. \nYou can go back and look and read the history of the debates on \nMedicare--both in the past and the statements made in recent times, and \nas recently as in the past few weeks--where we have found Members, \nprimarily our friends on the other side of the aisle, who do not \nbelieve in Medicare and who never believed we ought to have a \nprescription drug program that was rooted in the Medicare system.\n  There are recent times most of us can remember where statements were \nmade. There was the Speaker of the House who talked about the Medicare \nsystem, that they wanted to see the Medicare system wither on the vine, \nand so there was an ideological commitment that said: If we are ever \ngoing to pass a prescription drug program, it has to be rooted not in \nMedicare, but it has to be rooted in the private sector, and we will do \neverything we can to make sure it is. We will provide all the financial \nincentives. We will effectively bribe individuals into the private \nsector or coerce them into the private sector and let the Medicare \nsystem wither over here.\n\n  If that was the program, there would not be anyone on this floor who \nwould take stronger issue with it than I would, as one who has followed \nthe Medicare system, believes in it deeply, and has seen the benefits \nit has provided to hundreds of thousands of the citizens of my own \nState of Massachusetts and around this country and knows the great \nsense of confidence our seniors have in this system and the Social \nSecurity system.\n  In fact, these are the men and women who brought us out of the \nDepression, who fought in the World Wars, who fought in Korea, who \nfaced the challenge of nuclear terror and the dangers of the expansions \nof communism. They have sacrificed for their children and their \ngrandchildren, and they are entitled, in the richest country in the \nworld, to live in some security and dignity, and the lack of being able \nto get prescription drugs is denying them that opportunity. They \nbelieve in Social Security and the Medicare system. This legislation \nwill give them the assurance that if that is their desire, they will be \nable to receive prescription drugs under Medicare. That is why I \nsupport this legislation. Those who believe it should be just a private \nsystem are not going to vote for this bill. They shouldn't vote for it \nbecause it isn't going to be a private system. We will have the \nopportunity to explain that in more detail.\n  I will take a moment to review some of the facts that are known to \nevery senior citizen in this country. I think they are reflected on \nthis chart I have in the Chamber.\n  First of all, let's look at what has happened in terms of the cost of \nthe prescription drugs our seniors need.\n  The yellow on the chart shows the COLA for Medicare, Social Security. \nThe blue shows the increased costs of prescription drugs over the same \nperiod of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, with the increased costs, \nrespectively, being 10 percent, 19 percent, 16 percent, 15 percent, 14 \npercent, 13 percent. This all comes out of the income of individuals \nwho effectively have fixed incomes, and this with a modest COLA.\n  You can see with these extraordinary escalations of costs what is \nhappening to our seniors. Often on the floor we have seen and heard our \ngood friend from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, who has provided great \nleadership--as have others--about the hard and harsh choices that are \ntaking place in homes all over this country, where seniors are making \nchoices between the prescription drugs which are vital to their health \ncare and the food they need to eat, or in our part of the country, it \nis the heating so they can survive in the\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\nwinter, or in other parts of the country, it is the cooling to make \nlife at least livable in the South.\n  There has been an extraordinary escalation and continuation of costs. \nWe will have an opportunity during the debate and the discussion on \nthis issue to consider legislation that has come out of our Human \nResources Committee, out of the Health Committee, that was initiated by \nSenator McCain and Senator Schumer that we addressed last year on the \nfloor of the Senate and which passed the Senate, which will help and \nassist generic drugs to come further forward. And, in the meantime, \nover the period of these past months, with a lot of hard work, there is \nlegislation that now has very broad support, which was virtually \nunanimous out of our committee, with the support of Senator Gregg, \nmyself, and others who are strongly behind it. I supported it \nlast time. We are hopeful of doing something in the totality, not only \nin the area of coverage, but also in the areas of cost. We are not \ngoing to solve all of the problems in either area, but this kind of \ndebate and discussion is going to include both the issues of coverage \nand the issues of cost.\n\n  Let me review very quickly where we are in terms of the coverage for \nour senior citizens. Of the 38 million seniors, we know 13 million lack \nany kind of quality drug coverage. They are effectively on their own. \nThey buy at the top price. They do not really get any deduction, and \nthey are virtually without any kind of coverage. Another 10 million \nhave employer-sponsored coverage. Another 5 million have Medicare HMO, \n2 million are under the Medigap, and 3 million are under Medicaid.\n  I believe when we used to debate this issue in years past, we would \nsay the only group among these seniors that was really guaranteed \naffordable, dependable, reliable prescription drugs were the 3 million \nunder Medicaid. That is not true any longer. Let's see what has \nhappened.\n  There is a general kind of profile of where our seniors are with \nregard to the quality of their drug coverage. Let's take, No. 1, the \nemployer-sponsored programs. This will raise an issue on one of the \nchallenges this current bill is facing. But let's just review very \nquickly what has happened in terms of employer-sponsored coverage in \nrecent times. If you go back to 1988, it was about 80 percent. In 1994, \nonly 40 percent of all the retirees were included in the program. Look \nat this, as shown on the chart: Going down from 1994 to 2002, now it is \nabout 22 percent, and falling rapidly.\n  The bottom is falling out in terms of the kinds of guarantees for the \nmillions of Americans who have employer-sponsored plans. So we have one \nlarge group of Americans with nothing. We have another group that has \nemployer-sponsored plans, but the total number of programs now \nproviding these is dropping down, and employers who have them in many \ninstances are dropping them. So there is no guarantee for that group of \nAmericans.\n  What about this other group of Americans, those with regard to the \nMedicare HMO? If you look at what is happening with regard to the \nMedicare HMO, you will find out the drug benefit is only offered as an \noption of the HMO. Thirty-four percent offer no drug coverage at all; \nmore than 2 million Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage \nsince 1999, so they are dropping. But this is the other insidious \nfactor: 86 percent of HMOs limited the coverage to less than $1,000 in \n2003; 70 percent limited coverage to $750 or less in 2003. So you can \nsay on the one hand, some are covered with the employer-based system, \nbut you can see that the system is at the point of collapse. Others say \nHMOs are offering coverage. But, they are dropping them on the first \nhand, and they are putting the blockage there to protect themselves, \nand that is, of course, a disaster for many other seniors.\n  We say we have the Medigap coverage that provides for 2 to 3 million. \nYou all are familiar with the absolute explosion of the cost and \nincreasing numbers. Both have dropped it.\n  This is the background. We find millions have no coverage. Even for \nthose who have coverage there is uncertainty, even if they are employer \nbased. If it is HMOs, we are finding increasing restrictions that make \nit unreliable. We have a whole population that is faced with a serious \nchallenge and a serious need.\n  Now, what does this proposal do? How will our senior citizens under \nMedicare benefit under this program? What is basically the delivery \nmechanism that has been a key element in terms of trying to make sure \nwe were going to give the assurances to our seniors that there will be \nsomewhere, in any part of America, the guarantee that Medicare will be \nthere but also permits the private plans, if they are in local areas, \nto be able to, if that is the desire at least, if they are going to \nmeet the obligations? We will have a chance during the course of debate \nto review it. I know the ranking member and chairman have gone over in \nthe markup those particular provisions that talk about the guarantees \nof the program and why the various kinds of conditions to make sure we \nare not going to have the excess charges and how we are going to have \nthe standards and how we are going to have a good benefit package.\n  On the one hand, there is the traditional Medicare Program. The \nindividual will be able to continue. The Government delivers the \ndoctors, hospital, and other services. Then, in many areas, the \nindividual will have a choice between two different private plans and a \nguaranteed fallback of the Medicare system, if the private plans are \nnot successful. So there is the guarantee there. And in the cases where \nthere is the Medicare Advantage and the private plans, you will have \nthe PPOs and the local HMOs that will be able to submit the plans. We \nwill have the guarantee on the one hand through the Medicare system, \nand the opportunity on the other. We will have an opportunity to go \nthrough it in greater detail.\n  Let me mention, for those who are watching this broadcast, what this \ncan really mean to individuals. We know the average cost for seniors is \n$2,300. That is the average cost per year. As we have pointed out, and \nit has been mentioned earlier, the elderly are going to spend $1.7 \ntrillion, $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years on drugs. This is only \n$400 billion, 24 or 25 percent. So we know there are large gaps. This \nwill not be everything for everybody, but it is going to provide \nimportant coverage to about 35 to 40 percent of our elderly under \nMedicare, those of the lowest income who are in desperate need, and \nalso be sensitive to those with catastrophic kinds of health needs. And \nit also provides some important relief for those in the middle, \nalthough not all of what we would like because individuals will for a \nperiod of time fail to get the coverage, the area that we call the \ndonut, and then pick up coverage later on.\n\n  But let me use the example of a typical income which would be about \n$15,000 for a senior. This is the chart that will indicate what the \nsavings would be. The typical one is $15,000. The typical prescription \ndrug cost would be $2,300. The premium would be $420. Their cost \nsharing would be $1,250. They would save $600 in this program. I wish \nit was a good deal more, but that is $600 over the cost of the year.\n  Take that same individual, $15,000, they have $10,000 in health care \ncosts. They would spend $400, and they would save $5,462 under the \nbill. This is a dramatic savings for those on the upper end, and let me \ntell you what it would be on the lower end.\n  Let's take an individual with $15,000 income who might have expenses \nat the lower level. I will have a chart for this. I am sorry I don't \nhave it. What we are trying to do with each example is to give \nindividuals who might be watching some idea as to what would happen to \nthem. Say a senior with an income of $9,000 and they currently have \nmonthly drug bills of $500. They would, under this bill, pay a total of \n$15 and have $484 in savings. Low-income people who have drug bills of \n$500 would have $484 of savings. If they are $12,000, they would have \n$468 in savings, if they spend $500. And if they are $13,500, which is \nthe 160 percent of poverty on this thing, and had $500 a month, they \nwould save themselves $416.\n  So we see for the very needy it is a very important benefit. For \nthose who will be facing catastrophic drug costs, it is a great help. \nFor those in the middle, it is some help but not all the help we would \nlike to see, or that they deserve.\n  Beyond this, one of the other features I find enormously appealing is\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\nwhat they call the card, the discount card that seniors will be issued. \nIt is called the prescription card. It will be issued next January. \nBasically, what that will do, for approximately 5 million low-income \nseniors, if this bill gets passed and signed into law, basically, \nagain, the 5 million low-income seniors, they will be able to get a \ncard for $25 and be guaranteed up to $600 at their pharmacy. If they \ndon't spend it all the first year, say only $400, the remaining $200 \nwill kick over for the next year. That will begin immediately.\n  This legislation will take time. It will take 2 years before they are \nable to set up the various kinds of structures which I outlined earlier \nto achieve it.\n  There are important areas I am hopeful we can address in this area. \nThis is $400 billion. It is a lot of resources. But we have also seen \nwhere this Senate has passed tax cuts for $2.3 trillion. This is $400 \nbillion. So it does seem to me we ought to be able to find some way to \nhelp middle-income seniors more than we have by providing additional \nresources to this particular proposal. An effort certainly will be \nfocused on that.\n  There is a second area which is of central concern. That is the \nretirees. The way this legislation has been constructed, there may be \nthose companies that feel that rather than continue to provide coverage \nfor retirees, this will be a way to drop them off and have them picked \nup under this program rather than meeting their obligations and their \nresponsibilities under the agreements which they have had and committed \nthemselves to over time.\n  We believe that is an area that needs focus and addressing during the \ncourse of the debate. You cannot get away from the fact that this \nlegislation is, as Senator Baucus has pointed out, major legislation in \nterms of the unfinished business and in terms of Medicare, particularly \nin the area of prescription drugs. Many of us believe this is the life \nsciences century, where we have seen breakthroughs that are coming, \nlike the mapping and sequencing of the human genome which has permitted \nus to be able to screen and inform people who might have a \npredisposition in terms of breast cancer, for example. We are \nconsidering legislation to make sure people will not be discriminated \nagainst in terms of employment and getting medical insurance because of \nthese kinds of indications. But we are able to find out through the \nwork on the human genome so much about the types of illnesses that \npeople have proclivities to develop.\n  So we are in the century of the life sciences and breakthroughs. We \nhave doubled our basic commitment in terms of basic research. We are \nseeing the breakthroughs in these extraordinary kinds of developments \nof pharmaceutical drugs that can be lifesaving and can relieve the most \nchallenging and difficult illnesses and diseases that we face in the \ncountry and around the world. We are going to face a challenge about \nhow we are going to get the best of those prescription drugs into the \nhomes of people who need them. That will be a challenge. That will be a \nchallenge for us here as a matter of national priority, I believe.\n  A defining aspect of our humanity and decency is whether we are \nprepared as a nation to make it a priority to be able to do that. This \nis a downpayment on that commitment. That is why this legislation is of \nessential importance and consequence and why I look forward to the next \ndays in terms of the debate and discussion that we can move this \nprocess forward and move to making sure we are meeting the challenges \nthat our seniors are facing in all parts of the country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased we now have gotten to the \nfloor with this bill. Certainly, most everyone agrees that this may be \none of the most important issues that we will undertake this year. \nAlong with that, of course--which I guess is not unusual--it will be \none of the most difficult. I think there is a strong feeling that this \nneeds to be done. I believe that will drive us. We certainly have had a \ngood deal of support from the administration, from the President, and \nfrom Secretary Thompson. So we have an opportunity to move forward.\n  This is a very difficult issue. It is one that is hard to deal with, \nto make sure that everybody is treated properly. It is hard to deal \nwith in terms of costs. It is also hard to deal with in terms of \ndifferent parts of the country and how you have a delivery system that \nfits everywhere. It will be a challenge, but I believe we have no \ngreater domestic challenge than reforming Medicare and providing \nseniors with access to prescription drugs. We will hear a great deal of \nthe same sort of conversation during this week. We will also find that \nthere are different ideas about how this is done.\n  The committee approved a prescription drug bill last Thursday night \nafter an all-day markup, which was interesting--by a substantial \nbipartisan majority, which is very good. So it is a promise that most \nof us have made to take a look at Medicare and to be able to strengthen \nit. It has been mentioned that it is more than 30 years old and hasn't \nbeen changed a great deal. The greatest change that has come about is \nin pharmaceuticals, which has become one of the most expensive aspects \nof health care and has not been covered under Medicare in the past.\n  So I think we have two things we are seeking to do, and I hope we \ndon't lose sight of them. One is to make the Medicare delivery system \nwork better. Second is to include a reasonable access to pharmaceutical \ndrugs. The program we have had has been difficult in a number of ways. \nWe have had more and more providers that will not provide care under \nMedicare because the fees have not been equal to what they get in the \nprivate sector, and therefore access is not available. That is a \ndifficult issue, particularly in rural areas where there are not a lot \nof providers. So we have to make sure we have a plan that puts this \nkind of program basically in competition with the private health care \nsector. The program has been inefficient and, no doubt, we need to \nchange some things, particularly with respect to chronic illness.\n  A relatively small percentage of the elderly use a very high \npercentage of the total expenditure. So it has to be oriented somewhat \ntoward dealing with those things that we know are the most expensive, \nand this cannot be done without some special attention to those things. \nThese are the people who need the most expensive drugs. We ought to \nhave a plan in which seniors could choose what fits them best.\n  We will be continuing to have the general plan that is in place now. \nIf people find they want to stay with it, they will be able to do that. \nNobody will be forced to change--at least in the near future. But there \nwill be another plan, an alterative. We have felt that we could follow \nthe plan that is used by Federal employees, generally, as an \noption. That would be one where there would be a plan laid forth, where \nwe would have different sorts of insurance coverage, and providers will \nbid on doing that job. Maybe we would take the lowest bids--maybe the \nthree lowest bids, or whatever. It would be a little different--sort of \na PPO program, preferred provider program. Some say if you have a PPO, \nit won't cover everybody. In Wyoming, there are not formal PPOs, but we \nstill have coverage for Federal employees, and there will be an \narrangement made so where they are without a form of specific PPOs, \nthey will still be available in the private sector. So I think that is, \nindeed, the way it ought to be. If we follow that plan, I think it \nwould be one that we can really make available.\n\n  One of the things we have been working on--and I happen to be \nchairman of the Rural Health Caucus--there has always been a \nconsiderable amount of difference in the health care programs between \nurban areas and rural areas. One of the things is, there has not been \nequity in payments. Payments in urban areas have been higher than in \nrural areas. They have thought the costs are not as high in rural \nareas. In fact, because of lower volume, they may be higher in rural \nareas than in urban areas.\n  I had an experience recently where an MRI in one town costs almost 50\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\npercent more than the larger city simply because they didn't have the \nvolume. This bill, by the way, has that sort of remedy in it so that we \nwill have urban areas and rural areas that will have equity in the way \nthey are handled. We hope we can do that.\n\n  Some have a concern about small counties. We have a situation now in \nMedicare where we deal with each county to determine the price of \nservice. Here we will have 10 regions over the whole country, so it \nwill be a broader base, which is the basis for insurance, to spread \nthat over a broader number of people so that there is better equity for \neveryone. I think a lot of provisions in this bill will be much more \nadvantageous for users than what we have had in the past.\n  We will all be talking about this bill in more detail. I hope we can \nmake some changes and we can remember the objectives. There are so many \ndetails involved with Medicare and with health care, as a matter of \nfact, that I think we have to focus on what it is we are seeking to do \nand to stay with that.\n  I hope we can develop a vision of what we want this to be when we are \nthrough and try and stay within the parameters of that vision. The \nobjectives will be to strengthen Medicare and provide accessible \npharmaceuticals.\n  There are, as we go about our work, lots of issues involved in health \ncare, many of them beyond Medicare. We have to deal with those issues \nat another time. I hope we do not try to remedy all problems in health \ncare and get it confused with this program, which is a specific \nprogram. For instance, we had some amendments having to do with \nrefugees and legal immigrants. That is an issue, and it is a tough \nissue, but it is not part of Medicare and we ought to separate those \nissues so we keep it that way. I hope we maintain our focus so \nunrelated issues do not become wrapped up in this bill.\n  We also need to be conscious of spending. We have a budget of $400 \nbillion, an amazing amount of money. But when we compare it to health \ncare costs, it is not huge. I did not think I would ever say $400 \nbillion is not huge. Cost is something, and we have to do something \nthat is efficient. Money is not endless, particularly when it relies \nlargely on what you and I pay in every month. If we have total \nexpenditures that continue out of control, we have to do something \ndifferent as to how they are paid. We should keep that in mind.\n  One of the keys--even though we should recognize the needs of low-\nincome people certainly, and that is in the plan and we should do that, \nas opposed to higher income people--I think it is important everyone \nwho is a beneficiary have some responsibility. When we have a program \npaying for all of the health care, we get overutilization, without \nexception. So there has to be some first dollar payment in this \nprogram, even though it can be very small, I believe.\n  We need to take advantage of the opportunity with the volume of \npharmaceuticals we will be using, for example, to hold down the costs \nsomewhat. Health care has been going up almost 13 percent a year, which \nis much higher than almost every other activity. Part of it is because \ntimes change and we are doing things so people are healthier, and \npeople are living longer partly because of that. Nevertheless, if you \nstart adding up 13 percent a year on these costs, it would be an almost \nunmanageable program over time.\n  I already mentioned this will serve all eligible seniors, whether \nthey are rural or urban. I am hopeful as we go through this very \ncomplicated and difficult program. I am very pleased, particularly \nserving on the committee of jurisdiction, to have been involved in this \ndebate and to see we are as far along as we are, and I am very \nconfident we are going to come out with a package. That, of course, is \nour responsibility and what we ought to do. As we do that, I hope we \nhave a vision of where we want to be when it is over and take a look at \nthe issues we do in the interim and see if they are going to contribute \nto providing that program we envision for the future. It is one that \nought to strengthen the program. It is one that ought to be available \nto people all over the country. It is one that ought to recognize the \nspecial needs, particularly of very low-income people. It is one that \nought to give choice of different kinds of programs so you can choose \nsomething that fits you.\n\n  I think we have to have a program that does not have runaway spending \nso that it destroys the whole program over time and that we also \nrecognize related programs, whether it be VA or retirement. These had \nto be fit in so we could have a total package.\n  I am looking forward to 2 weeks of considerable debate. I think with \nall these various issues, we will, frankly, have hundreds of \namendments, most of which will be dealt with, and that is good. But as \nwe look at all these different issues, I suggest to my friends in the \nSenate that we try to focus on what we want the result to be and \nmeasure these amendments against that.\n  I am looking forward to the debate. I am sure most of us are. I think \nwe can come up with a program that will be much better and provide \nservices for the needy better than we have in the past.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. \n1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003. Medicare \nbeneficiaries have been waiting decades for a comprehensive and \npermanent prescription drug benefit. Debate on this legislation is \ntruly a landmark occasion for America's seniors, the disabled, and the \nUnited States of America, including our own Senate. I congratulate both \nthe Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Senator Grassley, and the \nranking member, Senator Baucus, on a job well done. Both of them worked \nwell together. It has been bipartisan. They have done everything they \npossibly can to bring people together so that we can pass a bill out of \nthe Senate, and they both deserve a lot of credit.\n  Both of them have been able to put together a Medicare prescription \ndrug bill that not only has bipartisan support but was also approved by \nthe Senate Finance Committee, both remarkable feats. I am so proud of \nboth of them.\n  The majority leader, Bill Frist, also deserves credit for his \ncommitment to this issue. He is to be congratulated not only for his \nbehind-the-scenes efforts to move this bill forward but also for his \nvision in developing with Senator Breaux the model upon which many of \nthe improvements in this bill are based. Of course, Senator Breaux \ndeserves a great deal of credit. He has consistently fought to try and \nget a prescription drug benefit bill, and of course was a member of the \ntripartisan group in the last Congress.\n  Finally, I would be remiss unless I recognized the central role the \nPresident played in this matter by insisting that Medicare drug \ncoverage must be a top domestic priority. Many believed it could not be \ndone, especially in this, a non-election year.\n  President Bush's persistence, his commitment, and, indeed, his \nleadership on this issue will prove those naysayers wrong.\n  At last, we will provide senior and disabled citizens across the \ncountry with the prescription drug coverage they need.\n  In fact, prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries has \nbeen one of my top priorities, as well, and think everyone knows.\n  I was the principal cosponsor with then-Chairman Bill Roth of the \n1997 legislation creating the Bipartisan Medicare Commission.\n  That commission, as my colleagues are aware, was charged with making \nrecommendations on how to improve the current Medicare program.\n  And although commission members were unable to report a \nrecommendation due to the ``super-majority'' vote requirement, the work \nthey did laid the groundwork for efforts to improve Medicare by \nincluding the private competition that could provide prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  Through their leadership on the commission, my friend and colleague, \nSenator John Breaux, and our House colleague, Ways and Means Committee\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nChairman Bill Thomas, were instrumental in laying the groundwork for \nMedicare prescription drug legislation.\n  More recently, I worked closely with Chairman Grassley, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Breaux, and Senator Jeffords in an effort to develop a \ncentrist, Medicare prescription drug bill that the Congress could adopt \nfree from partisan politics. This was an 18-month effort.\n  We called our effort ``tripartisan,'' because Senators participated \nfrom the Democratic, Republican and Independent parties.\n  I took great pride in our effort, which I believe would have passed \nthe Senate but for election-year maneuvering.\n  The goal of the tripartisan legislation was to provide all \nMedicare beneficiaries with quality drug coverage through private \nhealth plans. In addition, the tripartisan bill gave seniors and the \ndisabled a choice in health coverage: They could have traditional \nMedicare, a Medicare+Choice plan or a new enhanced Medicare plan.\n\n  It was truly a labor of love. We are proud of that effort and the \nfact that it laid the foundation for S. 1, the Prescription Drug and \nMedicare Improvement Act of 2003, which we are considering today.\n  I predict that S. 1 will not only pass by the Senate by the end of \nthe month, it will be signed into law at the end of the summer. What a \ndifference a year makes.\n  S. 1 builds on several important foundations we laid in the \ntripartisan initiative.\n  And, in many ways, it is far superior to our tripartisan initiative.\n  It offers beneficiaries a meaningful and reliable drug benefit \nthrough the private sector with reasonable and fair cost-sharing. \nBeneficiaries will have the ability to obtain the drugs of their choice \nwithout Government interference and with better coverage choices.\n  In contrast to last year's bill, the measure we have before us today \nprovides beneficiaries with several choices: A stand-alone drug \nbenefit, a drug benefit through a Preferred Provider Option, PPO, or a \ndrug benefit through an HMO.\n  Those who do have drug coverage will have the choice of remaining in \nthe existing plans or choosing a Medicare prescription drug benefit. S. \n1 also offers beneficiaries a temporary drug discount card available to \nseniors no later than January 1, 2004. This drug card would be in \noperation until the Medicare prescription drug benefit is fully \nimplemented.\n  In sum, S. 1 offers additional assistance to those who cannot afford \nto purchase their prescriptions.\n  In a country as prosperous as ours, we can no longer tolerate \nsituations where seniors have to split their pills in half or cannot \nfill necessary prescriptions because they do not have the money.\n  A land as great as ours owes it to needy seniors and disabled to help \nthese individuals who many times cannot help themselves.\n  Another important point is that S. 1 also ensures access to drug \nbenefits for beneficiaries who live in rural areas. This is a must-do \nfor my home State of Utah. S. 1 provides reliable coverage everywhere \nin America. Wherever there is Medicare coverage, there will be Medicare \nprescription drug coverage.\n\n  In addition, this bill includes important consumer protections. Every \nplan offered to Medicare beneficiaries will have to be certified by the \nFederal Government.\n  A key point is that S. 1 recognizes the role of employers in \nproviding their retirees with health coverage. Let me make it perfectly \nclear that the intent of this plan is not to disrupt that important \nrelationship between employers and their retirees. We should encourage \nemployers to continue to offer retiree health coverage.\n  Finally, I must note that this legislation does nothing to dismantle \nor weaken the traditional Medicare program. The bill offers \nbeneficiaries more coverage options, and does nothing to disrupt the \nexisting physician-patient relationship. That is a fundamental \nprinciple that was very important to me as I worked with committee \nmembers to draft this legislation.\n  At this point, I would like to take some time to go into the details \nof the principles I have just outlined. First, and most important, this \nlegislation provides beneficiaries with more coverage choices.\n  Let me emphasize, S. 1 does not, I repeat, does not, take anything \naway from Medicare beneficiaries. If beneficiaries like what they have, \nthey may keep their current coverage. However, if they want coverage \nsimilar to private health insurance, S. 1 offers them this choice.\n  Those remaining in traditional Medicare will be able to receive \nprescription drug coverage equal to that received by beneficiaries who \nelect to receive their prescription drug coverage through the new \nMedicareAdvantage program. MedicareAdvantage is the new name for the \ncurrent Medicare+Choice program, also known as Medicare Part C.\n  As my colleagues are aware, today we have Medicare Part A, which is \nfor hospitalizations, and Part B, which is for outpatient and physician \ncoverage.\n  This legislation will then add Part C, for Medicare Advantage. And, \nbeginning on January 1, 2006, a Medicare prescription drug benefit will \nbe established under a new program which will be codified as Part D of \nMedicare.\n  Beneficiaries will have the choice of either adding a new stand-alone \ndrug plan to their current coverage, delivered through fee-for-service \nreimbursement or they may participate in a program which integrates \ntheir basic medical coverage with added pharmaceutical benefits through \neither a health maintenance organization, HMO, or a preferred provider \norganization, PPO.\n\n  There will be a new Center for Medicare Choices established at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, with an administrator who will \noversee both the new drug plan under Medicare Part D and the new \nMedicareAdvantage program under Medicare Part C.\n  To operate the prescription drug plan, the Administrator will create \nat least 10 regions throughout the country, which must be at least the \nsize of a state. States will not be allowed to be divided among \nregions.\n  Private-sector entities will bid to provide coverage. For PPOs, they \nwill contract to provide the entire spectrum of Medicare services, \nincluding drug coverage, for the region. For HMOs, they will contract \nto provide Medicare services, including drugs, for a county.\n  If a beneficiary elects to remain in the traditional Medicare \nprogram, he or she may receive pharmaceutical assistance through a new \nadd-on program which will be administered by a private insurer who has \nbeen certified by the government to provide coverage in that region. \nMany have been concerned that in some areas of the country there will \nnot be private sector entities that wish to provide this new coverage. \nI share that concern, especially after my own State's experience with \nMedicare+Choice program.\n  For this reason, we worked very hard to make certain that there was a \nsafety net, a ``fall-back'' plan that would provide seniors with the \ncoverage they need if no private sector plans came forward.\n  I will discuss how the fall-back operates in a few minutes, but I did \nwant to assure my constituents that there will be safety net if it is \nneeded.\n  Another assurance this bill provides to our constituents is that \nbeneficiaries will be allowed to change plans on an annual basis. We do \nnot want any beneficiary to feel that he or she is locked into a \nprogram that is not a good fit. So, I have insisted that the \nflexibility to change plans was present in the bill, and I am pleased \nit was included.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, one important principle of our plan is that \nbeneficiaries who continue in traditional Medicare or those who enter a \nnew integrated plan should have the same level of coverage.\n  So beneficiaries can either purchase standard coverage form an \ninsurer or they will have the benefit of participating in a new HMO or \nPPO plan that includes pharmaceutical coverage valued at the equivalent \namount of the subsidy the government is providing for the stand-alone \nplan.\n  In 2006, standard coverage would have a $275 annual deductible. For \nspending over the deductible up to $4,500, beneficiaries would pay one \nhalf, and the government the other half.\n  Eighty-eight percent of Medicare beneficiaries will not reach this \nlimit of $4500 in 2006.\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\n  Even so, the plan envisions generous subsidies for beneficiaries who \ncannot afford their drug coverage, in this case those with incomes less \nthan 160 percent of the federal poverty level.\n  However, for those with incomes at the above 160 percent of the \nfederal poverty level, there would be no government subsidy for out-of-\npocket expenditures once drug costs in total reach $4,500, of which the \ngovernment would have paid roughly half once the deductible was \nsatisfied.\n  As a protection against extremely high drug costs, which can prove \ncatastrophic to a beneficiary, we have included a provision limiting a \nbeneficiary's spending to 10 percent of costs once their out-of-pocket \nexpenditures for drugs reaches $3,700.\n  We want this program to be as affordable as possible for \nbeneficiaries. Indeed, the committee was torn.\n  We needed to make certain that the program is affordable to Federal \ntaxpayers and does not exceed the $400 billion we have planned for in \nour budget.\n  On the other hand, we wanted the coverage to be meaningful and really \nhelp seniors and disabled who need assistance.\n  This is one reason the bill contemplates an affordable, national \naverage premium for pharmaceutical assistance of $35 per month. I know \nthis can be very confusing--even for those of us who drafted the bill--\nso I want to take this opportunity to explain the standard drug plan \nand the actuarial equivalent drug plan--the two types of drug plans \nthat will be offered to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  First, both the standard drug plans and the actuarial equivalent drug \nplans would have the same deductible.\n  Second, beneficiary out-of-pocket expenditures would be the same in \nboth the standard and actuarial equivalent plans.\n  Both the stand-alone drug plan and the MedicareAdvantage PPO plan \ncould offer beneficiaries standard coverage that is described in the \nstatute, or they can offer differing coverage as long as certain \nprovisions are met: The actuarial value of the prescription drug plan \nwould have to be at least equal to the actuarial value of the standard \nplan; and the coverage would be designed to cover the same percentage \nof costs up to the initial benefit limit as that provided under the \nstandard plan. Again, the limits on beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses \nand annual deductibles would be the same in both the standard plan and \nthe actuarial equivalent plan.\n  Finally, actuarially-equivalent plans would be allowed to vary the \nmonthly beneficiary premium and the beneficiary copayments. In \naddition, if these plans wanted to offer additional benefits to \nseniors, they may do so and the beneficiary would be responsible for \npaying additional costs.\n  In sum, a beneficiary is permitted to choose a drug plan that best \nsuits his or her health care needs.\n  In S. 1, we are offering seniors choice in drug coverage. Medicare \nbeneficiaries may stay in traditional Medicare fee-for-service and \nreceive their drug plan through a stand-alone drug plan. Or, they may \nreceive their drug coverage through the new MedicareAdvantage program \neither through an HMO or the new PPO option.\n  The plans offered through MedicareAdvantage are integrated health \nplans which means these plans are similar to private health \ninsurance which combines health and drug benefits in one insurance \nplan. In order to encourage plans to participate as stand-alone drug \nplans, interested entities would submit bids to the administrator. This \nbid would include information on benefits, the actuarial value of the \nprescription drug coverage, the service area for the plan, and the \nmonthly premium.\n\n  Plans could submit bids to provide coverage for a specific region, as \nestablished by the Administrator, or the entire area covered by \nMedicare. Plans could also submit bids for more than one region and \nthey may also bid nationally.\n  A plan would not be accepted by the Secretary unless the premium, for \nboth standard coverage and for any additional benefits, accurately \nreflected the actuarial value of the benefits.\n  The administrator will work with bidding plans so a region will have \nat least with two stand-alone drug plans that will offer prescription \ndrug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in an area. These contracts \nwould be awarded for 2 years. Finally, the stand-alone drug plans would \nbe required to accept some level risk.\n  If only one plan, or even no plans, are unwilling to offer stand-\nalone prescription drug coverage within a region, the Administrator \nwill enter into an annual contract with an entity to provide a \nprescription drug fallback plan. This fallback plan, which would be \ngiven a 1 year contract, would offer Medicare beneficiaries the \nstandard drug plan.\n  We have designed this fallback plan to ensure that seniors will have \nprescription drug coverage across the country. In addition, seniors \ncould be offered prescription drug coverage through a MedicareAdvantage \nHMO or PPO.\n  During the Finance Committee mark-up, an amendment was offered that \nwould have given the fallback plan a two-year contract instead of a \none-year contract.\n  While I am sympathetic to some of the concerns raised about the \nadministrative difficulties surrounding choosing a fallback plan within \na few months, I do not believe that a 2-year fallback plan is the \nsolution.\n  I believe that having a two-year fallback plan makes it even more \ndifficult to encourage other private plans to bid in a region. As a \nresult, a two-year fallback plan could prevent a private plan from ever \nwanting to enter the region and beneficiaries are left with a fallback \nplan that does not offer much flexibility. Therefore, I would strongly \noppose such an amendment.\n  With regard to the low-income, I believe that we should provide \nadditional assistance to the low-income Medicare beneficiaries when it \ncomes to prescription drug coverage. S. 1 provides additional subsidies \nfor drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries under 160% of the federal \npoverty level, individuals with income limits of $14,368 for \nindividuals and $19,360 for couples.\n  Let's face it, these beneficiaries, in many cases, are struggling \nwith their bills and are barely making ends meet. These are the \nindividuals who are deciding between paying the rent and paying for \nfood. This population makes up 37.4 percent of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  S. 1 continues to provide drug coverage for the dual eligible \npopulation, those who are currently eligible for both Medicare and \nMedicaid, through the Medicaid program.\n  Dual eligibles have incomes that are below 74 percent of the Federal \npoverty level--annual income limits are $6,555 for individuals and \n$8,848 four couples.\n  During the Committee's consideration of S. 1, I authored a provision \nthat would reward states that already provide both Medicare and \nMedicaid coverage for low income individuals between 74 percent and 100 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n  For the 19 States that have expanded their Medicaid coverage to these \nseniors, the Federal Government would pay for the Medicare Part A cost-\nsharing of these beneficiaries. The provision is important because it \ngives incentives to States that expand their dual eligible programs.\n  This legislation provides these beneficiaries who are below 160 \npercent of poverty with additional subsidies for their drug coverage.\n  There are some who are concerned about the Federal Government heavily \nsubsidizing this population because drug coverage is so expensive. In \nmy opinion, providing additional assistance to these lower-income \nbeneficiaries is the right thing to do. End of story.\n  With regard to the comprehensive drug program, some have expressed \nconcern that the program will not begin until January 1, 2006. I \nunderstand the concerns of those who advocate for immediate coverage \nfor seniors. That's why we created the Medicare Prescription Drug \nDiscount Card available to Medicare beneficiaries no later than January \n1, 2004 and would provide discounts up to 25 percent on their \nprescription drugs.\n  Medicare beneficiaries would be charged an annual enrollment fee of \n$25 and could only be enrolled in one endorsed card program. The \nprescription drug card program would continue to operate for at least 6 \nmonths after the implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug \nBenefit Plan.\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\n  At the beginning of 2004 and 2005, low-income beneficiaries under 135 \npercent of poverty would be given $600 per year for their drug \nexpenses. These beneficiaries would be permitted to carry any left-over \nmoney from year to year. Additionally, spouses may share their drug \ncards.\n  I worked very hard to make certain that our new plan does not \ndisadvantage rural areas such as my home state of Utah. The bill before \nus provides assurances that any Medicare beneficiary, regardless of \nwhere he or she lives, will have access to prescription drug coverage.\n  For example, the legislation requires that at least two stand-alone \ndrug plans would be offered to Medicare beneficiaries in each region. \nAnd, if only one plan, or worst case scenario, no plans, bid to offer \nstand-along coverage, there will be a fallback plan to provide \nprescription drug coverage. No beneficiary, regardless of where he or \nshe lives, would be without prescription drug coverage.\n  In addition, for those living in rural areas, the MedicareAdvantage \nplans will offer beneficiaries a maximum of three PPO plans per region. \nIf PPOs decide not to bid in a specific area, these beneficiaries still \nwill have coverage through traditional Medicare and will also have \noptional prescription drug coverage.\n  S. 1 also gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \ndiscretion to make adjustments in geographic regions so there will not \nbe a large discrepancy in Medicare prescription drug premiums across \nthe country.\n  However, our first and foremost goal in S. 1 is to provide drug \ncoverage to those who currently have no coverage. We need to help \nbeneficiaries first, but we also need to continue our work with the \nemployer community to ensure that they will continue to offer retiree \nhealth benefits.\n  Finally, I want to take a minute to talk about traditional Medicare \nand why I believe that the PPO option under the MedicareAdvantage \nprogram is the better choice.\n  Most will agree that the current Medicare program is an archaic \nsystem that still looks very much like the program when it was created \nin 1965. Do any of you remember what was popular in 1965? Most of you \nprobably do not but, unfortunately, I do.\n  What we are trying to do in S. 1 is provide seniors with the same \nhealth choices available to those under 65 today, and not offer them \nonly health choices that were available in 1965! While most seniors are \ncomfortable with the current Medicare coverage, traditional Medicare is \noutdated in several ways. Besides not offering seniors prescription \ndrug coverage, it does not provide protections for the sickest \nbeneficiaries. To me, that is a major flaw of the program. Most drug \nplans offer catastrophic coverage for seniors once they spend a certain \namount of money for their health care costs. Not traditional Medicare. \nMedicare requires the sickest seniors to continue to pay for their \nhealth coverage out of pocket without assistance.\n  In addition, beneficiaries currently receive their coverage through \nMedicare Part A, which covers hospital expenses, and Medicare Part B, \nwhich covers providers' expenses, such as physicians. There are \ndeductibles for Medicare Part A, which is $840 in 2003, per spell of \nillness.\n  Simply put, this means that a beneficiary who is admitted to the \nhospital for different illnesses ends up paying this hospital \ndeductible more than once per year. The Medicare Part A program also \nhas copayments and other beneficiary cost-sharing that could be very \nexpensive. On top of it, beneficiaries also must pay a $100 annual \ndeductible for Medicare Part B, along with beneficiary copayments for \nthese services.\n  The bottom line? Medicare beneficiaries are paying two different \ndeductibles each year for different health services. How fair is that \nto seniors? And why should seniors be the only ones who have to adhere \nto such a crazy system?\n  Private health insurance does not operate like this. Those under 65 \ndo not have to pay arbitrary copayments and deductibles. They have \nprescription drug coverage in many cases. And they typically do not \nhave to pay extra money out of pocket if they are seriously ill.\n  I believe that Medicare beneficiaries should have those same choices \nand that's why we created the MedicareAdvantage program in S. 1.\n  MedicareAdvantage improves the choices offered to beneficiaries. They \nwould have their choice of coverage in MedicareAdvantage through HMOs, \nthe same Medicare+Choice plans many have been offered or the new \npreferred provider organization, better known as PPOs.\n  MedicareAdvantage PPOs would have a network of providers that will \nagree to offer Medicare beneficiaries coverage for benefits in the \ntraditional Medicare program. Through this PPO system, beneficiaries \nwill be able to see their same doctors, and go to the same hospitals.\n  If these medical providers are in the PPO network, the beneficiaries \nwill pay the standard coverage for participating network providers. If \nthey do not participate in the PPO network, seniors will pay more to \nsee them. The important point is that, through PPOs, beneficiaries \nwould still be able to see the doctor of their choice.\n  Similar to the regions created for the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, S.1 also creates 10 regions for PPO coverage. To make things \nsimpler, the secretary of Health and Human Services would be allowed to \nuse the same regions as the ones established for the prescription drug \nprogram.\n  Again, these regions must include at least one State--and parts of \none State could not be divided up into separate regions. A maximum of \nthree PPO plans per region would be offered to Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe HHS Secretary would calculate what the benchmark payment from the \nfederal government would be for these new PPOs. This benchmark would be \nbased on the higher payment of traditional Medicare FFS or the \nMedicare+Choice payment for the specific region.\n  The MedicareAdvantage PPO will provide beneficiaries with the health \ncoverage that is similar to private health insurance. Instead of the \ncrazy patchwork of deductibles and copayments imposed on beneficiaries \nin traditional Medicare, it would offer them a combined deductible, \ninstead of separate deductibles like traditional Medicare.\n  MedicareAdvantage PPOs will offer beneficiaries with catastrophic \nhealth coverage. If beneficiaries choose the PPO option, they will not \nlonger be completely responsible for bills associated with catastrophic \nillnesses. The PPO plans would determine appropriate levels of \nbeneficiary cost-sharing--deductibles, catastrophic limits and \ncopayments, not the federal government.\n  In addition, plans under the MedicareAdvantage program will provide \nbeneficiaries with coordination of care.\n  It is unfortunate that the traditional Medicare program does not have \nany disease management or chronic care management programs available \nfor all Medicare beneficiaries. This is something many of us had hoped \nto improve for years.\n  Under S. 1, MedicareAdvantage plans will create disease management \nprograms and, in my opinion, do a much better job of monitoring the \nhealth care needs of individual Medicare beneficiaries than traditional \nMedicare.\n  In the worst case scenario, if PPO plans do not offer coverage for a \nspecific region, the Medicare beneficiary would have traditional \nMedicare coverage along with a prescription drug benefit. Seniors will \nalways have health insurance coverage and the option of prescription \ndrug coverage as well.\n  Before I close, I want to address one of other important priority of \nmine.\n  Although we have worked for several years to pass a Medicare \nprescription benefit in the Senate, we have worked just as long to pass \na Medicare regulatory reform bill.\n  That is why I am delighted that the ``Prescription Drug and Medicare \nImprovement Act of 2003'' includes ``The Medicare Education, Regulatory \nReform and Contracting Improvement Act'' a bill that I am introducing \nthis year in the Senate. This bill is called MERCI [mercy] because it \nprovides regulatory relief for Medicare providers and improved services \nfor beneficiaries.\n  Medicare's antiquated regualtions--three times longer than the U.S. \ntax\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\ncode--prevent providers from delivering health care efficiently and \nbeneficiaries from receiving the care they need.\n  Secretary Thompson has said, ``Patients and providers alike are fed \nup with excessive and complex paperwork. Rules are constantly changing. \nComplexity is overloading the system, criminalizing honest mistakes and \ndriving doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals out of the \nprogram.''\n  Failure or just the perception of failure to follow Medicare's \nneedlessly complex rules can result in audits, withholding of payments, \nand crippling of a physicians' practice. Furthermore, obsolete \nrestrictions on Medicare contracting authority impose burdens and \ninefficiencies on contractors, taxpayers, providers and beneficiaries.\n  This bill improves the Medicare program for beneficiaries and \nprovides by clarifying regulations, rewarding quality and by enhancing \nservices.\n  The bill decreases waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare in ways that \nare just and fair for beneficiaries, contractors, and providers by \neliminating retroactive application of regulatory changes, and by \nexpediting the appeals processes for beneficiaries, providers, and \nsuppliers of Medicare services.\n  It improves communication between HHS and both Medicare providers and \nbeneficiaries by enhancing central toll-free telephone services and \nproviding for provider and beneficiary ombudsmen. It increases \ncompetition, improves service and reduces costs by providing for a \ncompetitive bidding process for Medicare contractors that takes into \naccount performance quality, price and other factors that are important \nto beneficiaries.\n  And, it decreases Medicare billing and claims payment errors by \nimproving education and training programs for Medicare providers and at \nthe same time creates an expedited appeals process for Medicare claim \ndenials.\n  These provisions will improve the delivery of health care services to \nMedicare beneficiaries by enhancing the efficiency of the program for \nall concerned.\n  It is high time that we made Medicare more user-friendly. I want to \nthank my colleagues Senators Grassley and Baucus for working with me on \nthese provisions.\n  In conclusion, I believe that this will assist all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, especially those without prescription drug coverage, by \nproviding them with a choice of quality prescription drug coverage and \na choice of quality health coverage. Passing this legislation is the \nright thing to do for our seniors.\n  It is remarkable to me that close to a year ago, we were having the \nsame debate on the Senate floor.\n  Last year's outcome was a major disappointment to me and my \ntripartisan colleagues. At the time, I honestly believed that last year \nwas our final chance to make improvements to the Medicare program for a \nlong time.\n  But here we are, almost a year later, debating this important issue \nonce again. Thankfully, we have a Finance Committee chairman who has \nbeen able to guide this legislation through the Senate in a timely \nmanner. Thankfully, we have a President who made Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors one of his top priorities.\n  This year is different than 2002.\n  This year, we have accomplished what we could not accomplish last \nyear.--We have put partisan politics aside and written a bill that is \ntruly bipartisan.\n  And because of this bipartisan effort, I believe a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit will become a reality for Medicare \nbeneficiaries across the country. The wait for Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage will soon be over thanks to the hard work of the Senate \nFinance Committee, especially Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Breaux and Senator Jeffords.\n  This is a historic time for the United States Senate.\n  I notice my esteemed colleague who has done so much in the field of \nhealth care in the House, and who has started anew here in the Senate \nin many ways, is here to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to \ncommend the distinguished Senator from Utah on all his extraordinary \nwork in the health care field. If you look at what the Senator from \nUtah has achieved in the S-CHIP area, his work that led to the Hatch-\nWaxman legislation, and what he has done on a whole host of health care \nissues, the senior Senator from Utah has made an extraordinary \ncontribution.\n  As we begin this discussion on Medicare reform, I commend the Senator \nfrom Utah on an excellent statement. I think the Senate will have \nanother success over the next few weeks. After the Senator's success on \nS-CHIP, Hatch-Waxman, community health centers, and other areas, there \nwill be yet another significant milestone the Senator from Utah will \nhave helped to achieve in the health care area. He and I are working on \na variety of initiatives now. I commend the Senator on an excellent \nstatement and wish to associate myself with his remarks.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He is a definite \nleader in health care. I enjoy working with him and appreciate his kind \nremarks.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a Congress that can find hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in money for tax cuts and the money to rebuild a \nforeign country must find a way to make Medicare work better for the \nNation's vulnerable senior citizens. That is what the next two weeks \nare all about, and they are historic weeks for the Senate.\n  Updating Medicare is an issue I have felt very strongly about for \nseveral decades because my public service career began in the early \n1970s, when I served as codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers and ran \nthe Oregon Legal Services Program for the elderly. Back then, the old \nsaw was that Medicare was just half a loaf. Of course, from its \nbeginning, Medicare did not cover eyeglasses, hearing aids, dental \ncare, and a host of services that are so important to vulnerable older \npeople. But of particular concern, even then, was the fact that \nmedicine, in so many instances, was both unaffordable and inaccessible. \nNow the Senate has an opportunity to do something about that in \nproviding a real measure of relief for the Nation's older people. I \nbelieve over the next couple of weeks what the country is going to ask \nis not what a particular philosophical approach of a Senator was, but \nwhether that Senator was part of an effort to find the common ground in \nfinally getting real results for the Nation's older people.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe and I offered the first bipartisan amendment to \nthe budget resolution to fund a Medicare prescription drug program back \nin 1999. We followed that action up by introducing the first bipartisan \nproposal called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage \nEquity Act. I am very proud to be able to stand on the floor today and \nsay that because of the dedication of members of the Finance Committee, \nthe leadership of both sides, many of the provisions Senator Snowe and \nI have been advocating for a number of years have been included in the \nlegislation the Senate will vote on over the next couple of weeks.\n  We were concerned then that traditional Medicare not be skimpy, that \nit be a good benefit package, and that it would be affordable for older \npeople. Suffice it to say, under the legislation the Senate will be \nconsidering, traditional Medicare will survive. The millions of seniors \nwho want to take that program will be able to do so. Traditional \nMedicare will not wither. It will not vanish as a result of being \nunderfunded or having provisions that would make it less attractive for \nseniors to choose.\n  A number of important consumer protection provisions are included in \nthis legislation, something I think is absolutely critical if you are \ngoing to allow private plans to play a bigger role in delivering this \nbenefit.\n  I have had a great interest in this area since the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, and I wrote a Medigap law a number of \nyears ago which eliminated a lot of the unscrupulous practices that \nwere taking place in the insurance market designed to supplement \nMedicare. Now there are standardized benefit packages for these Medigap \nsupplements, and a lot of the abusive activity that used to go on, that \nused to exploit older people, has been eliminated.\n  Many of the consumer protections in this legislation have been \nborrowed from the Medicare Choice Program,\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nreally building on what Senator Daschle and I wrote into the Medigap \nlaw years ago, and are a significant step in the right direction.\n  I think there are also important steps included in this legislation \nto make medicine more affordable to the Nation's older people. It seems \nto me by giving seniors more choices, you make it possible for seniors \nto have the opportunity to get medicine that is more affordable because \nfor a private plan to attract a senior subscriber, that private plan is \ngoing to have deliver medicine in an affordable way. So there will be a \nconcrete incentive to actually hold down the cost of medicine because \nthose private plans will not be in a position to make money, they will \nnot be in a position to be profitable if they cannot attract seniors by \nkeeping down the cost of medicine.\n\n  So it is important that this legislation be enacted. I have always \nfelt Government really comes down to people, and it comes down to those \nwho tell us exactly what their experience has been with health care and \nvarious other areas of Government.\n  What has really colored my judgment on this issue are the accounts I \nhave heard from seniors, many of them going back to my days with the \nGray Panthers. Not long ago a woman from my hometown of Portland, with \n$806 in monthly income, had prescription drug bills totaling $150 a \nmonth, and she got no help from Medicare whatsoever. My staff and I \ninquired about how she was able to get by, and her answer was just \nheartbreaking. She said: I just do without, and I pray.\n  I do not think that is good enough. As I said earlier, I think a \ncountry and a Congress that can find hundreds of billions of dollars \nfor tax cuts and a hundred billion dollars or so to rebuild a foreign \ncountry can do better by seniors on Medicare. So this legislation \nprovides an opportunity to do that.\n  I think there are a number of important issues for the Senate to zero \nin on as we begin this debate, the first of which is the cost. A number \nof Senators have said this legislation is costly and it will be \ndifficult to finance in the years ahead. What I would say, Mr. \nPresident and colleagues, is this country cannot afford not to cover \nthis vital service for older people.\n  Not very long ago a physician in Hillsboro, OR, wrote me and said he \nput a senior citizen in the hospital for something like six weeks \nbecause that person could not afford their medicine on an outpatient \nbasis. That is pretty bizarre by anybody's standards. If a senior is \nhospitalized, they get their medicine covered under part A of the \nMedicare program. But, of course, if the senior faces a serious health \nproblem and is not hospitalized, they have to resort to outpatient \nservices, and Medicare part B historically has not picked up the bill \nfor drugs.\n  So what we saw in Hillsboro, OR, not long ago is that it costs \nthousands and thousands of dollars for a senior to be hospitalized in \norder to get the Medicare benefit. It would have cost a small fraction \nof that if the drugs were covered on an outpatient basis.\n  When seniors and others wonder about the cost of this benefit, and \nfor Senators who are asking if the Nation can afford prescription drug \nrelief for older people, my message is, America cannot afford not to do \nthis. America cannot afford inaction and having older people \nhospitalized, facing serious health problems simply because they are \nnot able to get medicine in a cost-effective kind of way.\n  Second, as we look at this issue, we ought to understand that older \npeople are getting hit by a double whammy when they try to afford their \nmedicine. First, Medicare does not cover their purchases. But secondly, \nthe older people of this Nation are subsidizing those who do have \nbargaining power, the health plans and big buyers who are using \nbargaining power to knock the price down. What we have been trying to \ndo, going back to the days when Senator Snowe and I introduced the \nSPICE legislation, is give seniors some bargaining power, a chance to \nbe on a level playing field with the big buyers, with the HMOs, with \nthose who have bargaining clout. This legislation puts seniors on a \nmore level playing field so that they are able to better afford their \nmedicine and that is a step in the right direction.\n  There are going to be a number of issues that will come up in the \ncourse of the debate. One that my State feels very strongly about is \nthe fact that Medicare's payment system penalizes those who have been \nefficient. Historically, States such as Oregon that have been \ninnovative in the health care area have taken concrete steps to hold \ncosts down. You would think the Federal Government would reward them. \nYou would think the Federal Government would give them a break for \nstressing cost containment. The reality has been just the opposite. The \nMedicare Program has penalized States for holding costs down.\n  This legislation doesn't do as much as I would like it to do to \nremove the penalties against those who have been efficient, and I am \nhopeful that as we consider the legislation more can be done in that \narea.\n  It does take significant steps to address the question of rural \nhealth care, something that has been particularly important to me. \nSenator Smith and I have included it in our bipartisan agenda for the \nState of Oregon. All who represent States like ours know that States \nthat are largely rural find it extremely hard for seniors to get the \ncare they need. Very often they don't have hospitals or doctors in \nclose proximity and clearly need extra help in order to ensure that our \nrural communities survive. The fact is, without rural health care, you \ncannot have rural life. I am not prepared to sit by and let rural \ncommunities become sacrifice zones. That is why the provisions in this \nlegislation to provide better reimbursement for rural health care are \nheartening.\n  The provisions in the legislation for rural health take strong steps \nforward. It would adjust hospital payments to account for the higher \ncosts associated with low-volume hospitals. It makes changes to what is \nknown as the ``swing bed concept'' which will help critical-access \nhospitals, and it creates a floor for geographic payments for \nphysicians and offers improvements for rural health clinic \nreimbursement.\n  More needs to be done to assure that provider reimbursement is \nadequate. Better reimbursements obviously keep more qualified doctors \nand other providers in the Medicare system. That, of course, provides \nmore choice and better care for the Nation's older people.\n  I have been involved in a number of efforts with respect to trying to \nhelp seniors with their prescription drugs over the years. I have been \ninvolved in measures to expand access for generic drug coverage. I have \nbeen involved in efforts to give more bargaining power to public \nprograms, particularly the Medicaid Program, and the program for the \nVeterans Administration. I have believed, even most recently with the \ndrug Taxol, which is the largest and biggest selling cancer drug in \nhistory, that the Government has to do a better job of striking a \nbalance between the need to get drugs to market quickly and be \nsensitive to making sure that medicine is affordable and that the \ninterests of taxpayers are protected.\n\n  But all of those steps together, which have been of some help in \nterms of making medicine more affordable for older people, do not rival \nwhat the Congress is facing now in terms of modernizing the Medicare \nProgram and providing concrete relief to the millions of the country's \nelderly who are watching now and urging the Congress, after years of \npartisan action, to actually produce results and address their drug \ncosts.\n  The fact is, Medicare reform isn't easy. No Senator walks away with \neverything he or she wants. But there is a chance now to make sure \nseniors don't walk away empty handed. It is not going to be \ninexpensive. There will be some who want to spend more. Certainly, I \nhave believed the key issue for all these years has been to try to find \nthe common ground, to act on a bipartisan basis--Senators Baucus and \nGrassley have done that--and we must not let this legislation go by the \nwayside once more.\n  For my part, I will do anything over the next couple weeks to build \nthe bridges that are necessary to make health care more accessible and \nmore affordable for the Nation's older people. This is the issue I care \nthe most about, the question of making health care more affordable and \nmore accessible. We have the most talented, dedicated, and caring \nhealth care providers on Earth. They deserve a Congress that\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\ndoes a better job of setting in place the governmental policies that \nallow them to deliver the best and most affordable health care that is \npossible. This has been my goal since I came to the Congress. This is \nthe issue that has been most important to me throughout my years in \npublic service.\n  More than 25 years ago, when I was codirector of the Oregon Grey \nPanthers, we were talking then about what it would take to modernize \nthe program, to turn that program that began as just half a loaf into a \nprogram that would deliver the best possible services to the Nation's \nolder people. You cannot do that without covering prescription drugs \nfor vulnerable elderly. This is an opportunity, if not to do everything \nthat needs to be done, to take substantial steps in the right \ndirection.\n  I urge my colleagues over the next couple of weeks to work together \non a bipartisan basis to finally accomplish the reforms that are \nnecessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to address this historic opportunity \nfor strengthening Medicare and providing prescription drug benefits for \nour seniors. I am pleased that as a member of the Finance Committee I \nwas able to participate in the construction of the legislation which is \nbefore us now and to be able to speak to this historic legislation on \nthe first day we are considering it.\n  My understanding is that as of Wednesday we will be able to begin \noffering amendments to the legislation, and I know it is the leader's \nintention that we complete it before the end of the following week so \nthat the bill can be merged with the House bill which should be adopted \nat roughly the same time. We can go to a conference committee, iron out \nwhatever differences we have, and get this bill to the President as \nsoon as possible. It is the President who has led on this initiative \nand who has promised the American people that we are going to provide \nboth a new prescription drug benefit for America's seniors and a \nstrengthening of Medicare so that we know that this program can \ncontinue on into the long-distant future and not be troubled by \nfinancial problems that we can see on the very short-term horizon.\n  So this Medicare reform legislation, S. 1, that is before us now \noffers us a historic opportunity, one I think we must be very careful \nnot to squander. In that regard, let me discuss, first of all, the \nproblems we are going to be trying to deal with here, the way the \nFinance Committee bill attempts to deal with them, and then I will \nconclude with some concerns I have about some changes I believe we are \ngoing to need to make to ensure this will work for the benefit of our \nNation's seniors.\n  First, let me discuss the need. There are a couple of key things to \nkeep in mind here. Just as with the Social Security system, of which \nMedicare is actually a part, Medicare cannot continue to pay the \nbenefits we have promised America's seniors, primarily because of the \ngood news that America's seniors are living longer, and we are finding \nmore and more ways to treat their diseases and illnesses, all of which, \nof course, costs money. But we should not consider that bad news. In \nfact, we consider it a very fortunate dilemma that we face, in which we \nare not only able to prolong life but enhance the quality of life for \nour seniors. That is the reason we want to deal with this problem now.\n  But as seniors are living longer, this is going to provide a greater \nfinancial burden on taxpayers, and we find that the number of taxpayers \npaying for it is actually decreasing in relative size. Therefore, we \nsee a financial insolvency for Medicare not too far down the road. In \nfact, by the year 2026, the system will be, technically, out of \nbalance. By 2012 or 2013, we are going to have to begin paying out of \nthe trust fund for Medicare, which means that the general fund is going \nto have to be tapped to help to pay for the Medicare funding and the \nhospital insurance program is going to be in debt. The long-term costs \nfor Medicare are staggering when you stop and think about it, although, \nagain, this can be looked at as good news since we are finding ways to \ntreat our illnesses. And while it costs money, it still preserves our \nquality and length of life. Therefore, we should be happy for this \ncondition. But it will cost money.\n  To give you an idea, over the next 75 years, the average deficit of \nthe hospital insurance program is 2.4 percent of taxable payroll, which \nis 71 percent greater than the projected funds coming into the program \nover the same period. So we have a huge deficit we are going to face in \nhow to fund our Medicare commitments to seniors.\n  In addition, when Medicare was created in 1965, it was a very \ndifferent program than Americans have become accustomed to now. For one \nthing, it didn't have a drug benefit. We are all committed, I think, to \nthe proposition that we have to add a drug benefit to Medicare, among \nother things, because now, unlike in 1965, treating through \nprescription drugs, through medication, has become really the preferred \noption in most cases. We no longer need acute surgical care, for \nexample, to treat many situations. We are able to control the illnesses \nthrough the use of medications. Isn't that a much more humane and \nsatisfying way to treat diseases than through some intrusive kind of \ntreatment, such as surgery?\n  So medical advances have permitted us to accomplish a great goal. We \nare going to have to add this benefit to Medicare, however, if we are \nto achieve the degree of success we would like to achieve. Nobody who \nhas health insurance in the private sector has a structure like \nMedicare does today. For example, in the private sector, you usually \nonly have one deductible for your insurance. And then your copayment--\nif it is for drugs or some other kind of benefit--is usually at the \nfront end of most of those services. Most of the time in the private \nsector, people have catastrophic insurance coverage. In other words, \nyou will pay a deductible and there will be some copayment for the \nother services you derive along the way. But if your illness is so \nsevere as to cause huge medical costs, that catastrophic care is paid \nfor with your private sector insurance premium. Not so with Medicare.\n\n  With Medicare, it is almost exactly the opposite. There are two \ndeductibles, one for part A and one for part B, for hospital stays and \nphysician services. It is especially complicated for hospital stays. \nAnd you have high copayments under Medicare that are toward the back \nend of the coverage. You have no catastrophic coverage at all, as a \nresult of which seniors have had to go through a distribution of \nMedigap insurance, private sector coverage, coverage sometimes from \ntheir employer, and the Government's Medicare Program and, in some \ncases, some even do without. There is no drug benefit today as a part \nof Medicare.\n  So all of this has to be dealt with. Clearly, we cannot continue to \nwork with a program that is not going to be able to treat our senior \ncitizens as we have moved into the 21st century, which is the historic \nopportunity we are presented with. The first way to respond to that is \nto add a drug benefit to Medicare. Clearly, as I said, we are all \ncommitted to doing that.\n  S. 1 provides a generous universal benefit for prescription drugs. I \nthink, given our budget constraints, the bill put together by the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee is a very good \nstart to providing that kind of universal benefit of covered \npharmaceuticals.\n  Now, importantly, the way the bill is constructed, no senior will \nhave to leave the traditional Medicare. The first option is you can \nstay right where you are, and there is a drug benefit added to \ntraditional Medicare. It will have the same actuarial value as the drug \nbenefit added to the alternative choices that will also be provided \nnow. For those who are satisfied with Medicare, except they would like \nto have a drug benefit, that is precisely what will be available to \nthem. For those who would like to or are used to having a private \nsector insurance plan, that option or alternative will be available as \nwell. You don't have to choose it, but if you do choose it, it will \nhave a drug benefit with the same actuarial value as that provided or \nadded to the traditional Medicare. But it will also have a variety of \nother kinds of options.\n  For example, you will probably have just one premium, one deductible, \nand copayment then for some of the services at the front end. There \nwill probably be catastrophic coverage at the back end. In other words, \nyou will be\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\nprotected against the very large medical expenses you may face. That \ncatastrophic coverage will be part of the premium and part of the \nsubsidized care from the Government.\n  This new option that is being provided is primarily being structured \nlike the preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, which currently \nserve a lot of our population in the private sector today. If you are \npart of an employer-based insurance plan, for example, chances are you \nare enrolled in a PPO, or preferred provider organization. What is \nthis? It is an insurance plan that pays you benefits with a premium, \ndeductibles, and copays, as I said. There is provided a list of \nphysicians you can go to, including specialists, generalists, and so \non. Ordinarily, you can even go to a physician not on the list, but you \nmay have to pay a little bit more for the coverage. In other words, the \ninsurance will pay up to a certain amount and you may have to pay the \ndifference. It is your choice. If you want to do that, you can. If you \ndon't want to, you don't have to do that. That is what a lot of us are \nused to.\n\n  There is a third kind of insurance, called the HMO, or managed care. \nSome people are very happy with the Medicare version of that. It is \ncalled Medicare+Choice. That is only available in certain parts of the \ncountry. We are not touching that. If you are happy with \nMedicare+Choice and you are in that, you will be able to continue to \nparticipate in that. As a matter of fact, it is hoped there will be \nmore of those kinds of plans operating as a result of the private \ninsurance option that will be made available. But nobody has to \nparticipate in that if they don't want to.\n  The drug benefit that will be provided will have the same actuarial \nvalue as that of the PPOs and of traditional Medicare. Think of it in \nterms of traditional Medicare on one hand, plus a drug benefit and this \nnew option of PPOs on the other hand. It, too, will have the same \nactuarial value drug benefit.\n  On the PPO, however, there will be more integrated care. In other \nwords, there will be a group of physicians who are taking care of you \nand they may have you do more preventive care, more tests. It would be \nto their benefit to not have to pay a lot of money for your heart \nattack, for example, so they want to keep you healthy and not get that \nheart attack. It enables you to take care of yourself in such a way \nthat, hopefully, you will not have the heart attack. Under traditional \ncare, you may not go to the doctor until you are really sick, at which \npoint, of course, then are you not only going to be in trouble but \nthere will be higher bills to pay.\n  The idea of PPOs is maybe to reduce the overall cost of providing the \ncare by taking care of you better so, of course, you will be more \nhealthy, which is to the benefit of everybody.\n  It is not going to work out that way for everybody, but at least the \nalternative or the option is there. Therefore, if you decide this is a \nbetter option for you, you will be able to participate in the PPO.\n  I identified the need briefly, and I went into some description of \nthe alternative plans provided in this legislation. Let me turn now to \nthe one concern I have because I think we all want to make sure that if \nwe are going to provide an alternative, it works.\n  If we are really going to strengthen Medicare so people will have \noptions or have choices, we expect those choices to provide better \ncare, perhaps for a lesser amount of money, perhaps not, but better \ncare should be the primary goal here. If we are going to attract people \nto enroll in that option, then we have to make sure it works.\n  One of the concerns some of us have is that the way the bill is \nstructured currently, it is less likely to succeed than it would if it \nwere as the President originally proposed it. Let me go into a bit more \ndetail what I am talking about.\n  One of the problems with Medicare today is that we have price \ncontrols on the health care providers. The Government decides exactly \nhow much it is going to reimburse doctors, for example, and that is how \nmuch they get reimbursed. The problem with that is we are trying to \ncontrol costs, and so the Government keeps ratcheting down what we pay \nthe doctors until we find the doctors are deciding not to treat \nMedicare patients anymore, until they decide they just cannot afford to \ncontinue to be part of Medicare.\n  At this point, because we want to make sure seniors have plenty of \nhealth care providers available to take care of them--and, frankly, we \ndo not want to put any of the health care providers out of business, \nobviously--then all of a sudden we are going to pay more to allow them \nto stay in operation, and that costs a lot of money. We put that back \ninto the system. Then we begin to ratchet down what we pay again. It is \nthe traditional problem of price controls.\n  Nobody knows better than the market what the price of a good or \nservice ought to be, but some bureaucrats, the idea goes, know better \nthan the market. Whenever it is tempting for us to think that, we ought \nto look to history for a lesson. Price controls never work.\n  Think of it in the way earthquakes occur. We have the great tectonic \nplates of the country, and they are constantly under stress. We may go \nfor quite a long time without an earthquake, but if we have those \ntectonic plates stressing, all of a sudden, it is going to get to the \npoint where they just cannot stand to be together anymore, and they are \ngoing to move. That creates an earthquake.\n  It is a lot like that when it comes to price controls. We may be able \nto keep the lid on prices for a while, but the inevitable pressure will \nincrease to the point that eventually something has to give. One thing \nthat can give is that we no longer have the providers willing to \nprovide the service because they are not getting paid enough to stay in \nbusiness. Therefore, we have a little revolution on our hands where \npeople say: Look, they are all leaving the practice. We want to be \ncared for; can't you pay them more money? The Government says: OK, we \nwill do that. We provide the money. What have we saved?\n  It would have been much simpler to have allowed the market to work \nalong the way so that the providers could be reimbursed what they need \nto stay in practice, the beneficiaries of care continue to be provided \nthat care, and we have a more stable financial situation as well.\n\n  Price controls simply do not work, and they have not worked in \nMedicare where we have tried to control the prices of the providers.\n  What makes us think that controlling the prices of the PPOs is going \nto be any more successful? It clearly is not going to be, and yet that \nis, in effect, what we have in this bill.\n  We have said we want to provide a private sector option, and then we \nplace price controls on how much we are going to pay the providers. \nSome people say we might as well just stick with the current system of \nprice controls on the providers. If we are going to provide a real \nprivate sector alternative, then do not turn around and cap the prices \nwe are going to pay.\n  The Government has a legitimate obligation to keep prices down, and I \nwill get to that in a moment. But by the same token, we have an \nobligation to provide high-quality health care. If we are going to make \nthe decision to provide an alternative to traditional Medicare, one \nwhich provides choices for people and relies upon the private sector to \ndesign plans that best meet the needs of different seniors all over \nthis country, then we need to let those plans work.\n  The way the administration designed it was that in deciding which \nPPOs would be allowed to provide the services, they would simply allow \na competitive bid process. The plan is to have approximately 10 regions \nin the United States, to have the country divided; 50 States divided \ninto 10 regions. Think of it as roughly 5 States per region, although \nthat is not exactly how it will work out.\n  In each region, if you are an insurance company and you want to \nprovide this alternative to Medicare, you would bid and the three \ncompanies that provided the lowest bids would have the opportunity to \nprovide this care. They would then be reimbursed by the Government at \nthe level of the middle bid.\n  In other words, if you had $10,000 for the top bid and $9,000 for the \nmiddle bid and $8,000 for the third bid, then all three companies would \nbe reimbursed at the $9,000 per patient level, speaking hypothetically, \nof course. That competitive bidding process would enable\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\nthe insurance companies to figure out how much money they need to make \nto stay in business, but also how little they can charge in order to \nget the business.\n  It is the same process that any company undergoes. For example, a \nconstruction company wanting to build a highway bids on the highway. If \nthey bid too high, they are not going to get the job. If they bid too \nlow, they are not going to be able to pay all their workers and make a \ngo of it. So they have to calculate what it is going to take to stay in \nbusiness, to make a little profit, and still get the business. That is \nwhat encourages them to be careful with how they spend their money--to \nbe economical, frugal, and thoughtful with what they do, and keep the \ncustomer happy.\n  The same thing happens with insurance companies. When the Government \ncomes along and says, We are not going to take the three lowest bids, \nwe are going to put a cap on how much you can bid, they have totally \ndistorted the process. So if the Government came along and said, for \nexample, that $10,000, $9,000 and $8,000, no, we are not going to do \nthat, we are going to say no company can bid more than $8,000, what is \nthat going to do? The company that bid $10,000 is going to say: We \ncannot make any money at that; we cannot even serve the patients; and \nwe are not going to try to fool anybody and go into debt. So we are not \ngoing to bid.\n\n  The company that bid $9,000 is going to say: I do not know if I can \nmake it work. We had better not bid for the same reasons.\n  The company that bid $8,000 is going to say: We can make a go; the \nGovernment says we cannot bid more than $8,000; we are going to bid \nthat. What kind of choice do the consumers have? One company.\n  What if the Government decides it knows best and the bureaucrats \ndecide to set the level at $7,000? Then how many companies are going to \nbid? This is precisely the problem the Congressional Budget Office \nidentified.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said when you set the bid at the \nMedicare payment level, which is the way the bill is constructed, that \nis what the level is going to be, you may end up with nobody bidding. \nDo you know what the Congressional Budget Office says the participation \nrate is going to be under the bill? Two percent. Effectively nobody is \ngoing to bid. Nobody is going to be able to participate because the \nMedicare level--remember the price control level I talked about \nbefore--that level is going to be the level set under the bill.\n  What they are saying is almost nobody is going to be able to work \nunder that artificial capped rate. So only 2 percent of the people are \ngoing to participate in these plans. The plans are not going to be able \nto provide a robust enough benefit, a benefit that attracts people into \nthe plan. What are the plans going to do? Obviously, they are not going \nto participate. What kind of option have we created?\n  There are some on the far left, I suppose, who will say that is \ngreat; that proves the only thing that works is a Government, one-size-\nfits-all medical benefit, and we can finally get to the single-payer \nsystem some wanted to do all along. Those, on the other hand, who want \nto see the private market system work, will say: No, let's try to \nadjust the bill; it will not take a huge adjustment, to be sure it can \nactually work. The way we would adjust it is we would simply substitute \nthis Medicare capped rate, the price control rate, for that which the \nPresident originally proposed; mainly, take the three lowest bids. The \nbids still have to be low enough to get the business, so there is still \na big incentive to keep the cost down, but at least you know you are \ngoing to get some people bidding.\n  The estimate in this instance is the participation would be somewhere \nbetween 30, 40, or maybe even more than 40, 48 percent, something like \nthat, 43 percent. That is a lot more people participating in the plan. \nIt at least would have a chance to work then.\n  It seems to me, if we are dealing between estimates of 2 percent on \none hand and over 40 percent on the other hand, that is too big a \ndifference for us to be rushing to pass this bill.\n  Nobody knows for sure what the answer is. Will it be 2 percent? Will \nit be 40 percent? If we are dealing with that kind of uncertainty, it \nseems to me we should not be rolling the dice, especially since what is \nat stake is the quality of health care for our senior citizens. We \nought to take our time and do it right.\n  As I said, fortunately we have the answer in front of us. It is what \nthe President originally proposed, take the three lowest bids and then \nuse the middle of those three bids. We could easily substitute that for \nwhat is in the bill today. If I had my druthers, we would even go one \nstep further.\n  Those of us who say what we are providing for our seniors is very \nmuch like what Members of Congress get in health care are almost right \nbut not quite. Under the FEHBP, the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan, all of us, plus the other 10 million Federal employees, get a \nchance to enroll in one of several PPOs.\n  Do the PPOs that provide the care for Federal employees, including \nMembers of Congress, have price caps on them? No. Do they even have to \ntake the three lowest bids? No. Whatever companies would like to bid \nthat will offer the benefits that the Government promises to its \nemployees, if they are qualified companies and they offer the benefits, \nit does not matter what they bid; they get to offer those benefits to \nthe employees.\n  Now, if they bid way too high, they can still bid and they can still \noffer the plan, but none of us are going to join because it will cost \ntoo much money. So they still have to be reasonable. But if they want \nto participate at a rate higher than some of the other plans, they can \ntry. If they can sell their product, then who is hurt? Not so with \nMedicare. What the President has said is in order to keep the costs \ndown, we are going to take the three lowest bids. Well, that is not as \ngood as what the Federal employees have, but we believe it is a system \nthat can be made to work. What cannot work is to go to the lowest \ncommon denominator, and that is the Medicare artificially controlled, \ncapped price control rate that CBO says will not work. That is the \nchange we are working with the chairman and the ranking member of the \ncommittee and the administration to effectuate in this legislation. We \nhave to get the score from the Congressional Budget Office; that is to \nsay, they have to tell us how much the two different versions would \ncost so that we would know and be able to fold that into the $400 \nbillion budgeted amount with which we have to work. It is my hope over \nthe next few days that we will be able to do that and be able to offer \nan amendment that can be supported by all of us that would permit a \nmore plausible scenario for the preferred provider organizations to \nsucceed so that we can honestly say to our seniors they have two \nlegitimate options.\n  They can stay in traditional Medicare or there is a good PPO option, \ntheir choice, and have some confidence that the PPO option will \nactually work and will be a good option for them.\n  I am going to close with this thought: Whenever there is a third \nparty paying for something that is near and dear to you, you have to be \nvery careful because that third party is going to have a dual loyalty. \nIf it is an employer or the Federal Government, let's say, and they are \nbuying your health insurance, they want to take care of you, your \nemployer wants you to be happy and healthy, and in a plan like \nMedicare, the Government certainly wants to take care of the senior \ncitizens, but there is another motivating factor for either the \nemployer or the Government. What is it? It is, how much does it cost \nme? The employer can only afford to pay so much for the health care of \nhis or her employees. The Government, because it is taxpayer money, can \nonly afford to pay so much for the care it provides to senior citizens \nunder Medicare. So you always have to ask the question: If I am relying \nupon my employer's provided insurance or the Government's provided \ninsurance, am I getting the best quality care I can get? Reasonably. Am \nI getting affordable, high quality care? It is a question you should \nalways be asking because when a third party pays, there are mixed \nloyalties.\n\n  If I am paying for it all out of my own pocket, and I can afford to \ndo that, then I am going to pay for good care for me and my family. But \nif I am paying for a complete stranger's care just ask yourself: Do I \ncare quite as much? Am I going to be quite as concerned\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\nabout the quality of care or am I going to be at least equally \nmotivated by how much it costs?\n  Being concerned about saving money, am I going to maybe skimp and \nsave a little bit? What is the result of that skimping and saving? Is \nit going to be a lower quality care?\n  When we set a price and say you can only bid so much, what is the \npotential effect of that? It is lower quality care. That is the \ntradeoff we have to be very careful of. We are buying care for senior \ncitizens and we have to be very careful that in our concern about \nwasting taxpayer dollars and being able to afford this quality care, \nthat quality does not suffer as a result.\n  I submit the best way to do that, when the third party, the \nGovernment, is paying for the bulk of this care, is not to set a price \ncap because the inevitable result will be the ratcheting down of the \nprices and very uneven, if not poorer, quality care but, rather to \nallow the insurance companies to bid what they think they have to to \nwin the contract but enough to provide high-quality care.\n  Will that cost less than traditional Medicare? A lot of people at \nCMS, the Government-run Medicare system, think it will be actually less \nthan traditional Medicare. Will it be more than traditional Medicare? \nIt might be. CBO thinks it will be more. The experts are not sure. I \nsuggest that actually there is no one answer. It will depend upon how \nthings evolve. So we cannot know for sure one way or the other.\n  So why should bureaucrats or Senators think we are so smart as to be \nable to predict this in advance when, again, one Government agency says \n2 percent and another one says over 40 percent? Clearly, the experts \nare in disagreement. Why would we be so arrogant as to think we know \nbest and can set those prices? Let the market work and determine what \ncan be bid for companies to stay in business but provide high-quality \ncare. Then let the customer, the consumer, the seniors, decide are they \ngetting their money's worth or not. If they think this is a good deal \nfor them, they will choose that option. If they think it is not, they \nalways have the traditional Medicare option to stick with. So it is the \nbest of all worlds.\n  That is what this is all about, not trying to shoehorn everybody into \na one-size-fits-all plan. Regions of the country are different. Urban \nversus rural is different. The needs of seniors are different. There \nare so many different factors that we should not presume to know best. \nWe need to be willing to spend what it takes for high-quality care. The \nonly way we are going to know what that amount is, is to let the market \nwork, not to impose an artificial control on it. That is why I think we \nare going to have to make a change in this bill.\n\n  Fortunately, it is a relatively modest change, but I think it is a \ncritical change because it could mean the difference between a \nsuccessful Medicare Program and one which is not, and we will have \nmissed a historic opportunity to strengthen Medicare if we fail to \naddress these kinds of issues in the legislation that we are dealing \nwith over the course of the next 2 weeks.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for \ntheir hard work, the administration for the work it has put in, my \ncolleagues who have worked a lot on this, and I am hoping over the next \nseveral days we will be able to come together in a bipartisan way to \ncraft a plan that truly provides new drug benefits for our seniors, \nchoices that they will like and appreciate, and a private sector \nalternative that has a chance at working.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today the Senate begins a truly historic \ndebate on landmark legislation that will make affordable, comprehensive \nprescription drug benefits available to our Nation's seniors as well as \nto people with disabilities who receive Medicare benefits. This \nlegislation is long overdue, but I am confident the Senate will, in \nfact, approve it before the Fourth of July. That is good news for our \nNation's seniors.\n  The Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act that the Finance \nCommittee approved last week represents the most significant expansion \nof the Medicare Program in its 38-year history. I commend the chairman, \nthe ranking member, and the other members of the Finance Committee, \nincluding my senior colleague, Senator Snowe, for their hard work in \ndevising and developing this important package.\n  We now have an unprecedented opportunity to make the improvements \nnecessary to ensure that the Medicare Program can provide peace of mind \nto our Nation's seniors and true health security, not only to the 40 \nmillion American seniors who rely on Medicare today but to future \ngenerations as well. We want a strong Medicare Program that meets the \nneeds of our grandparents, our parents, and our children's generation.\n\n  With recent advances in research, prescription drugs can become \nliterally a lifeline for patients whose drug regimen protects them from \nbecoming sicker. Prescription drugs reduce the need to treat serious \nillness through hospitalization and surgery. Soaring prescription drug \ncosts, however, have placed a tremendous financial burden on millions \nof our seniors who must pay for these necessary drugs out of their own \npockets. Monthly drug bills of $300, $400, or even $500 are not at all \nuncommon for older seniors living on limited incomes.\n  For example, Emery Jensen of Gorham, ME, has an annual drug bill of \nabout $4,600. That is about one-quarter of the entire income he and his \nwife receive from Social Security. Another constituent from coastal \nMaine sent me a 2-page list of the medications her husband took over an \n8-month period before he died. The total cost: Nearly $4,000. More and \nmore, I am hearing disturbing accounts of older Americans who are \nrunning up huge high-interest credit card bills in order to buy \nmedicine they could not otherwise afford. Even more alarming are the \naccounts of patients who are either skipping doses to stretch out their \nprescriptions or forced to choose between paying the bills or buying \nthe pills that keep them healthy.\n  I will never forget an elderly woman coming up to me in the grocery \nstore in Bangor and saying to me she was only able to get half the \nnumber of pills her doctor had prescribed because otherwise she would \nnot be able to buy the food she needed. No senior in our country should \nbe forced to choose between putting food on their table and buying the \npills they need to remain healthy.\n  It is critical we bring Medicare into line with most private sector \ninsurance plans and expand the program to include coverage for \nprescription drugs. The legislation before the Senate today will make \nprescription drug coverage a permanent part of Medicare. This is an \nimportant improvement over previous versions of this bill which had \nsunset dates which would have created tremendous anxiety for our \nseniors on whether this would be only a temporary program.\n  This bill will make this coverage permanently part of Medicare. It \nprovides a comprehensive prescription drug benefit that will be \navailable to all seniors in Medicare, regardless of where they live. \nMoreover, that benefit will be equal for everyone, both for those who \nchoose to stay in the traditional program as well as for those seniors \nwho elect one of the new programs, the new plan options available in \nthe Medicare Advantage Program which is modeled after the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program.\n  Beginning in 2006, seniors will be able to get comprehensive \nprescription drug coverage, including both upfront and catastrophic \nprotection, for $35 a month premium. Moreover, low-income seniors will \nreceive generous subsidies and get additional protections and \nassistance. The more than 9 million seniors nationwide, including \n60,000 seniors living in Maine, who have incomes below 135 percent of \nthe poverty level will not have to pay any premium to secure coverage. \nThat 135 percent of poverty equals $12,120 for a single person and \n$16,360 for a couple. It is important we provide that extra assistance \nfor these very low income elderly people who would be hard pressed even \nto afford that $35 a month. Unfortunately, this is not going to happen \novernight. It will take some time for this new benefit to come online.\n\n  To provide some interim assistance, starting next year seniors will \nget prescription drug discount cards that will\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\nsave them between 15 and 25 percent on each drug purchase. Lower income \nseniors will receive a benefit of $600 on top of that starting next \nyear.\n  There are also some other significant features in this bill. \nMedicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to favor \nlarge urban areas and failed to take into account the needs of more \nrural States. This simply is not fair to States such as New Hampshire, \nwhich the Presiding Officer represents so ably, or my home State of \nMaine.\n  Ironically, Maine's low payment rates are also the result of its long \nhistory of providing cost effective high-quality care. We have a \nstrange system where, if you delivered care in a low-cost manner, the \nformula actually penalizes you for doing so. In the early 1980s, lower \nthan average costs in Maine were used to justify lower Medicare \npayments to doctors and hospitals. Since then, Medicare's payment \npolicies have only served to widen the gap between low- and high-cost \nStates.\n  This is an issue on which I have been working my entire time in the \nSenate. I remember in the previous administration meeting with the head \nof what was then called the Health Care Financing Administration and \nher telling me that in fact the State of Maine ranked dead last in \nMedicare reimbursements. Since that time, I have worked hard to improve \nthe reimbursements to Maine, and now we are up to about 46, but that \nstill represents a tremendous inequity.\n  I am, therefore, particularly pleased the legislation before the \nSenate takes steps to strengthen the health care safety net by \nincreasing Medicare payments to physicians and hospitals in rural \nStates such as Maine to help even out the reimbursement and eliminate \nthe inequities that have hurt rural States.\n  According to the American Hospital Association, the provisions in \nthis bill will increase Medicare payments to hospitals in Maine by \napproximately $63 million over the next 10 years. That is a step in the \nright direction. It will be particularly helpful for our small \ncommunity hospitals which are struggling to make ends meet. Those same \nhospitals tend to serve a population that is older, poorer, and sicker, \nso they particularly suffer when Medicare reimbursements are unfair \nbecause they simply do not cover the cost of treating this older, \npoorer, sicker population.\n  This legislation also restores funding to some extent for home \nhealth. That benefit has been cut far more deeply and abruptly than any \nbenefit in the history of the Medicare Program. Earlier this month, 54 \nSenators, at my request, joined me in sending a letter to the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Finance Committee asking that they avoid \nany further cuts in home health care and extend the additional payment \nfor home health services in rural areas that expired on April 1 of this \nyear.\n  I am pleased the legislation before the Senate does provide for a \nfull inflation update for home health agencies and also extends the \nrural add-on that is vital to sustaining home health care in rural \nareas of our country. Surveys have shown the delivery of home health \nservices in rural areas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly \nbecause of the extra travel time required to cover long distances \nbetween patients, higher transportation expenses, and other factors.\n  While I am disappointed the Finance Committee reduced the add-on \npayment from 10 percent to 5 percent, at least it has been extended, \nand that will help to ensure that Medicare patients in rural areas \ncontinue to have access to home health care services.\n  The Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act was approved by \nthe Finance Committee by a strong 16 to 5 bipartisan vote. I think that \nbodes very well for the future of this legislation. At long last, this \nlegislation holds out real hope to our seniors that they will finally \nreceive an affordable, comprehensive Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Since the cost of providing a meaningful drug benefit will only \nincrease as time passes, it is imperative that we act now. I am pleased \nthe majority leader has scheduled this legislation and set a goal of \nits passage before we adjourn for the July 4 recess.\n  Our senior citizens deserve no less from us. We must act. I am \nconfident we will act to provide a long overdue prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about our \nNation's immigration policy.\n  The United States has been built on the labor, industry, and \ninitiative of immigrants. The immigrant character that undergirds our \ncountry and enriches our society is expressed through our art, music, \nand culture--the fulfillment of one of America's greatest gifts to the \nworld: the promise of thriving multi-ethnic democracy. In every war \nAmerica has fought, from the Revolutionary War to Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, brave immigrants have fought alongside American-born citizens, \nwith distinction and with courage.\n  And throughout history, those who have longed for the blessings of \nliberty have looked to America as a beacon of hope, freedom, and the \nopportunity of a better life.\n  The American Dream itself is rooted in the immigrant spirit. What \nsets this country apart is our conviction that life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness are not just American rights, but the gift of a \nbenevolent Creator to all humanity. And so America has always welcomed \nimmigrants from every shore, saying: ``Give me your tired, your poor, \nyour huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''\n  Yet for too long, we have failed to address the flaws in our nation's \ncurrent immigration policy. This issue is even more urgent in a post 9/\n11 world. Special interest groups dominate the discourse, employing the \npotent but morally repugnant rhetoric of fear.\n  We must acknowledge that we have done far too little to reform a \nsystem that cries out for change. The fruit of our current immigration \npolicy is death, danger, and denial.\n  For immigrants willing to risk their lives for the opportunity to \nlive here in America, exploitation at the hands of human smugglers can \nmean a slow and painful death.\n  According to some estimates, there at as many as ten million \nindividuals who are in this country illegally; our homeland security \ndemands an accounting of the identities of these individuals, their \nreason for being here, and whether they pose a danger to our citizens. \nAnd we can no longer afford to deny both the sheer number of \nundocumented immigrants in our country and the extent of our economy's \ndependence on the labor they provide.\n  Our relationship with Mexico, an important ally and trading partner, \nis a prime example of the ramifications of the tired old status quo. \nThe stated desire of our Mexican friends for general amnesty for the \nmillions of undocumented immigrants here in America is an untenable \nposition in support of an unrealistic policy.\n  Instead, the guest worker program I propose acknowledges the vital \nrole hard-working immigrants play in our economy and creates a \ncomprehensive program, which will serve as an important step toward \nreestablishing respect for our laws and restoring dignity to immigrants \nwho work here. It will enhance America's homeland security, facilitate \nenforcement of our immigration and labor laws, and protect millions who \nlabor today outside the law. This program will benefit all \nparticipating nations and their citizens who wish to work in the United \nStates and contribute to our Nation's prosperity.\n  Our immigration policy must adapt to modern realities. An effective \nguest worker program will acknowledge that millions of undocumented men \nand women go to work every day in America in violation of our \nimmigration law, outside the protection of our labor law, and without \nany way of our Government knowing who, or where they are.\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\n  My proposal will encourage undocumented immigrants to come out of the \nshadows, to work within the law, and then to return to their homes and \nfamilies with the pay and skills they acquire as guest workers in the \nUnited States. It will help guest workers receive the health care they \nneed, without overburdening already strained health care providers.\n  It will protect immigrants from exploitation and from violence. And \nguest workers will no longer fear the authorities, but rather will come \nto see the law as an ally, not an enemy.\n  I have always believed that, as Americans, our patriotism isn't just \nexpressed by flying the flag. It's about more than that. Patriotism \nmeans we all share in an ideal that is larger than ourselves. In all of \nour differences, there are some things we all have in common. In all \nour diversity, each of us still has a bond with all humanity.\n  We must bring our broken immigration system into the 21st century. We \nmust move transient workers out of the shadows. We must ensure the \nsecurity of our borders.\n  We must act for the sake of the rule of law, for the sake our \nhomeland security, for the sake of immigrants who endure exploitation \nand even death for a chance to share in the blessings of American \nliberty--in hope, freedom, and the opportunity of a better life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan accomplished Kentuckian, Mr. Steve Reed. A native of Hart County, \nKY, Steve is a respected attorney, inspiring mentor, and loving husband \nand father of three.\n  In 2000 Steve became Kentucky's first African-American U.S. attorney. \nSome of his most significant work as U.S. attorney included fighting \nthe methamphetamine problem in western Kentucky. Steve quickly \nrecognized the problem and requested Federal funds to open an office in \nwestern Kentucky to combat meth production. With the new funding, he \ndirected a program that more than doubled the number of labs raided \nfrom the previous year. Through Steve's efforts and the cooperation of \nlocal law enforcement agencies, Kentucky's young people are better \nprotected and more criminals are being prosecuted.\n  In addition to serving as U.S. attorney, Steve has supported higher \neducation as a member of the University of Kentucky board of trustees \nsince 1994. In September 2002, Steve became the board's first African-\nAmerican chairman. He is dedicated to increasing the stature of \nacademics throughout the university and Commonwealth. He is working to \ncreate stronger ties between private business and the university's \nresearch programs, and Steve has pushed for more minority and financial \naid scholarships. Because of UK's prominence, Steve's efforts have not \njust affected the school but also have had a positive impact throughout \nthe rest of Kentucky's educational system.\n  Steve grew up in poverty as one of seven children raised by his \nsingle mother. His maternal grandmother, Mama Verda, expected greatness \nfrom Steve, and emphasized the importance of always doing the right \nthing. He excelled in high school and moved on to Western Kentucky \nUniversity where he tutored a fellow student. After earning a \npsychology degree, he attended UK Law School. Through his hard work and \ndiscipline, it is no surprise that Steve has achieved such success.\n  We are indebted to Steve for his service to the Commonwealth of \nKentucky in fighting drugs and supporting education. He stands as a \nmodel of hard work and discipline. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in honoring Steve Reed for his dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7923-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FRANKLIN HOTEL CELEBRATES 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the Franklin Hotel in Deadwood, SD, which \ncelebrated its 100th anniversary of service on June 4, 2003.\n  The Franklin Hotel has been a welcome destination for visitors to the \nBlack Hills region and has catered to guests since its doors opened in \n1903. For locals and tourists alike, the past several years have seen a \nresurgence and interest in history, and the setting the Franklin \nprovides to learn more about Black Hills history continues strong to \nthis day. Whether the visitor was a well-known actor from Hollywood \ntaking a break from daily shooting, noted public servants and athletes \nvisiting the area on business or personal time, or the visiting family \nfrom Anywhere, USA or the world, experiencing the professional and \nwelcoming, friendly attitudes of the Franklin Hotel staff is just \nanother reason of making a Black Hills visit one to remember.\n  In many respects, board of directors president Bill Walsh is as much \nof an institution in South Dakota as the Franklin Hotel. The two are \ninseparable when it comes to colorful personalities and both are \nfoundations in the promotion and advocacy of South Dakota and Black \nHills tourism. It would be all too easy for Bill to be just concerned \nabout the promotion of the Franklin Hotel. Instead, he has been a \nstalwart advocate for projects impacting and benefiting Deadwood, the \nentire Black Hills, and South Dakota. One of Bill's highest priorities \nis making sure as many people as possible put Deadwood, the Black \nHills, and South Dakota on their travel itinerary.\n  Over the years, I have appreciated Bill's valuable insight on \npolitics, current affairs, tourism, and the economy. I have always \nappreciated his wit, his hospitality and, most of all, his friendship. \nMany who gathered for the centennial anniversary celebration have \nspecial memories of Bill and the Franklin Hotel. Many local residents \nwill probably never forget that as the Grizzly Gulch fire tickled the \nedges of Deadwood and as people streamed out of town under evacuation \norders last summer, the doors of the Franklin stayed open with a \nconfident Bill Walsh sitting on the porch of the Franklin with a \nfreshly-lit stogie in hand.\n  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Bill and other members \nof the board of directors, Jo Roebuck-Pearson, Mike Trucano, French \nBryan, and Taffy Tucker. I also want to congratulate MacKenzie Roebuck-\nWalsh, who co-owns the hotel along with her parents, Bill and Jo. \nFinally, I want to acknowledge the Franklin Hotel staff and the \ncommunity of Deadwood on the centennial anniversary of the hotel. This \nevent is but another chapter in the living legacy of one of South \nDakota's cherished destinations.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor Bill Walsh and the \nFranklin Hotel for its 100 years of outstanding service. It is an honor \nfor me to share with my colleagues the strong commitment to history the \nFranklin Hotel has provided. I strongly commend the staff and board of \ndirectors for their years of hard work and dedication, and I am very \npleased that their substantial efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7923-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7923-S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Prince \nWilliam, VA. On November 1, 2001, a 26-year-old and his 25-year-old \nfriend were charged with a hate crime after assaulting a 46-year-old \nPakistani taxi driver. The driver had picked up the pair and, during \nthe ride to a nearby motel, the two\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\npassengers verbally accosted him. Upon their arrival, the frightened \ndriver exited his car and tried to flee, but the pair caught hold of \nhim and began beating him in the motel parking lot.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7924-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FORT KNOX GAME WARDENS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nvolunteers of the Fort Knox Game Warden Program for their longstanding \ncommitment to the community. These volunteers assist the Provost \nMarshal, the Hunt Control and the Range Control offices in maintaining \nthe hunting program's outstanding safety record by enforcing the Fort \nKnox and Kentucky Fish and Game regulations on the base's 170 square \nmiles.\n  The program's loyal volunteers have an active role in the community, \nespecially during the deer-hunting season when they operate the deer \ncheck stations and monitor hunter activities. Their efforts also have \nenhanced the natural habitat of the area's wildlife. Throughout the \nprogram's 50-year life, volunteers have planted food plots, developed \nwildlife sanctuaries and reintroduced wild quail to the environment.\n  These unsung heroes actively devote time to serving the post's six \nhunting zones consisting of 109,000 acres. They help protect both small \nand large game including squirrel, dove, rabbit, quail and turkey. In \naddition to the three weekends available each year for adult firearms \ndeer hunting, the Game Warden Program sponsors a youth gun hunt for one \nweekend each year.\n  I would like to acknowledge each of the volunteers for their time and \ncommitment protecting the community and surrounding environment: Donald \nBuhl, George Phelps, Bob Sherrard, Jack Baxter, Bill Schweiss, Alfred \nMaruszewski, Michael Dages, Charlie Flowers, Wayne Walters, Gerald \nSasser, Jr., Daniel Clifford, Tim Dages, Kenny Kine, Ron O'Bannon, \nHarold Scott, Walter Sholar, Hugh Harris, William Magruder, James \nElliott, Robbie Ammons, James Miller, Jackie Payne, Willard Campbell, \nJoseph Banks, Michael Gaddie, Richard McQuillen, Mary McQuillen, Wayne \nCreekmore, Gary Thompson, Martha Campbell, Karl Rohland, Ace Clark, \nJames Prather, Mark McNutt, Kelley Argabright, Dr. Gerald Sasser, Tony \nParsley, Crockett Banks, Dwayne Campbell, and Rodney Circle.\n  The Fort Knox Game Warden Program and its volunteers have faithfully \nserved the community for many years, and their contributions should not \nbe overlooked. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I \nthank them for their dedicated service to the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7924-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN GABRIEL GRIESS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to offer \nmy congratulations to a Nebraska native son. This gentleman is among \nthe many who honor our Nation through their service in our Armed Forces \nand I am very pleased to have this opportunity to pay tribute to him.\n  As our Nation faces threats abroad and our military men and women \nfight to keep us safe, it is important for us to never forget the \nsacrifices made in our defense. These men and women give up a great \ndeal to protect our Nation and we owe them a debt of gratitude that can \nnever be fully repaid.\n  Today, it is my honor to offer my heartfelt congratulations to one of \ntheir number, CAPT Gabriel Griess, a hometown Nebraska hero. Captain \nGriess is a proud member of the U.S. Air Force and he has recently been \nnamed the 15th Air Force Company Grade Officer of the Year for 2002. \nThis was no easy accomplishment as the criteria for the award ensures \nthat only the best of the best are eligible for consideration. To meet \nthose criteria, Captain Griess had to show clear drive, pursuit of \nself-improvement, and involvement in base and community activities. \nCaptain Griess met and exceeded all expectations.\n  He was awarded this title based on his dedication, leadership, and \nprofessionalism. Captain Griess' military history speaks volumes about \nthe confidence placed in him by his superiors. He was deployed twice in \n2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; given missions such as \ntracking down al-Qaida leaders, and evacuating critically injured \ntroops from combat zones. He provided support during Operation Anaconda \nby flying in critical supplies, destroying al-Qaida strongholds, and \nproviding air support for ground troops. He has earned three Air Medals \nand two Aerial Achievement Medals for his valiant work.\n  But perhaps more importantly, he has won the respect of his peers. As \nan instructor navigator with the 317th Airlift Group at Dyess Air Force \nBase in Texas, he is recognized as the ``go to'' guy, an officer who \nwill work as part of the team to meet the challenges ahead.\n  As our military efforts continue in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other \nregions around the world, we rely on the men and women in uniform to \nmake our Nation safe. With soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines of \nthe caliber of Captain Griess, I can say with complete confidence our \nNation is secure.\n  I congratulate Captain Griess on this recognition he has so \ndeservedly received. It is truly an honor for him and his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7924-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN RECOGNITION OF MOSAIC\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I would like to \noffer my best wishes and support for the beginning of a new \norganization--Mosaic. On July 1, 2003, Bethphage, founded in Axtell, \nNE, in 1914, and Martin Luther Home Society, founded in Sterling, NE, \nin 1925 will come together to form Mosaic. These two organizations \nbring decades' worth of experience to the field of developmental \ndisabilities, and I applaud their previous efforts while looking \nforward to a successful partnership. I have enjoyed a great working \nrelationship with Sharon Walters and Bethphage and appreciate the \npositive things they have brought to the State of Nebraska. Mosaic will \nbe supporting and advocating for more than 3,700 people in 16 States \nwith an annual budget of approximately $165 million. They also provide \nsupport in Great Britain, as well as participating in an international \nalliance called IMPACT.

Mr. President, in the recent years, there \nhave been many tributes dedicated to celebrating members of what Tom \nBrokaw so rightly called ``The Greatest Generation.'' Succeeding \ngenerations have honored the men and women who led America to victory \nduring World War II, who did nothing less than save the world. The \nevents of World War II have become a shining moment in American \nhistory, and the stories of battles and life on the home front are well \nknown by most Americans. However, many stories remain untold, and many \nheroes remain unrecognized.\n  As we count on our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast \nguardsmen to defend our Nation in today's time of war, we have a \nrenewed appreciation of the sacrifices made by our men and women in \nuniform and their families.\n  Our recent military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq provide an \nexcellent backdrop to tell a story from World War II involving a \nlittle-known Texas hero. It is my hope we can join together to honor \nthis man and those whose lives were lost on the fateful day he \nsurvived.\n  June 14 is an historic day in the life of our Nation. On this day in \n1775, the United States Army was born. Two years later, broad red \nstripes on a field of white, and bright stars on a field of blue were \nofficially adopted as our country's banner. In 1949, President Truman \nsigned an Act of Congress officially declaring June 14 as National Flag \nDay to honor our colors. June 14 also marks a somber anniversary, one \nthat few of us know.\n  Sixty years ago, on June 14, 1943, 40 Americans were killed when \ntheir B-17C airplane crashed in a field near Baker's Creek, five miles \nsouth of Mackay in Queensland, Australia. The plane belonged to the \n46th Troop Carrier Squadron, Fifth U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nThe men aboard the aircraft were returning to combat zones in New \nGuinea after their brief rest-and-recreation known as R at the \nAmerican Red Cross Center in Mackay. Wartime censorship and reasons of \nmilitary security prevented the incident from ever being reported in \nthe United States. It was classified until 1958.\n  Families of those who were killed were never informed how their loved \nones perished. Information was so closely guarded they were only told \ntheir soldier died in the Pacific while fighting for their country.\n  Little is known of the crash outside Mackay. Remarkably, one of the \n41 men aboard the aircraft survived the crash. He is Foye Kenneth \nRoberts of Wichita Falls, TX. At the time of the accident, it was the \nworst plane crash in the Southwest Pacific theater. Australians regard \nit as their worst aviation disaster.\n  In May 1992, a monument was built by local citizens at Baker's Creek \nto mark the B-17C crash site. Thousands of Americans soldiers spent \ntheir R at Mackay, and many became longtime friends of local \nfamilies. When the Baker's Creek memorial was unveiled on May 11, 1992, \nonly the names of the six aircrew and the sole survivor were known. A \ncomplete list of casualties did not exist in U.S. or Australian \narchives.\n  After extensive, painstaking research, a plague with the names of all \ncasualties was rededicated on June 14, 1995. Their names are: Sgt. Carl \nA. Cunningham, T/5 George A. Ehrmann, F/0 William C. Erb, Sgt. David E. \nTileston, Sgt. Dean H. Busse, Pfc. Jerome Abraham, S/Sgt. Frank E. \nWhelchel, S/Sgt. Lovell D. Curtis, 1/Lt. Vern J. Gidcumb, Pfc. Norman \nJ. Goetz, T/Sgt. Leo E. Fletcher, Pfc. Frederick C. Sweet, Pfc. Kenneth \nW. Mann, Pfc. Charles M. Williams, Cpl. Marlin N. Metzger, Pfc. Vernon \nJohnson, Capt. John O. Berthold, Cpl. Charles W. Sampson, Cpl. Franklin \nF. Smith, Maj. George N. Powell, Pfc. Arnold Seidel, 2/Lt. Jack A. \nOgren, Cpl. Jacob O. Skaggs, Jr., Pvt. James E. Finney, T/Sgt. Alfred \nH. Fezza, Sgt. Donald B. Kyper, Pfc. Frank S. Penska, Sgt. Anthony \nRudnick, Cpl. Raymond H. Smith, T/5 William A. Briggs, Pfc. John W. \nParker, Pvt. Charles D. Montgomery, S/Sgt. Charlie O. LaRue, Cpl. Foye \nK. Roberts (Sole Survivor) S/Sgt. Roy A. Hatlen, S/Sgt. John W. \nHilsheimer, Cpl. Edward Tenny and Pfc. Dale Van Fosson. Since the \nMemorial's unveiling, an effort has been made to locate the final \nresting places of the victims, and to trace their family relatives. The \nsearch continues today.\n  The men who lost their lives that day and the one who survived, \nregarded themselves as ordinary men. We know better. They like so many \nbefore and after them, answered our Nation's call to arms. We needed \nthem and they came. Many went, some gave all.\n  These men renewed for the ``Greatest Generation'' the cherished \nAmerican ethos of service to Nation. They came from farms and \nfactories, from city streets and country lanes. In doing so, they \ntranscended from ordinary men with common dreams to extraordinary \ncitizens with uncommon valor. Their example enabled our young men and \nwomen today to take up arms when we needed them for Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Regrettably, some of them made the ultimate sacrifice as well.\n  It is my fervent hope this June 14, along with the salute to the Army \nand our grand flag, that we also salute the men who gave their lives at \nBaker's Creek. We owe a special thanks to the Baker's Creek Memorial \nAssociation for keeping their memories alive and for helping their \nfamilies discover their loved ones' fate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7925-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SHARLA MOFFETT BEALL\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation to \nSharla Moffett Beall, my Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water Subcommittee \nstaff director, as she returns to her home State of Oregon. Sharla has \nbeen an important member of my Senate staff. Her counsel and efforts \nwill be missed.\n  There is no one in the Senate more knowledgeable on Endangered \nSpecies Act issues; issues of real significance to Idaho and the \nNation. She has been a tireless advocate for meaningful solutions to \nrecover endangered and threatened salmon species in the Pacific \nNorthwest. She has helped me to lead the fight against bad policies, \nsuch as the total maximum daily load rule proposed in 2000, and for \ngood policies, like habitat conservation plans and streamlining of the \nconsultation process.\n  When I became chairman of the subcommittee, I had little doubt about \nwho I wanted as staff director. I first worked with Sharla when she was \nprofessional staff for the House Agriculture Committee. I knew that in \nSharla, I had someone experienced, professional, effective, and with a \nkeen legislative sense. She also shared my political philosophy and \npassion for fish and wildlife issues.\n  It has also been rewarding to see Sharla start a family during her \ntime as staff director. In her first year on my staff, she married \nanother Oregon native, Jim Beall; during the second year, they had her \nfirst child, Anna-Sophia; and just last year a second daughter, \nAlexandra-Skye, was born. They are a wonderful and loving family.\n  The Senate has a tough time competing with two beautiful daughters. I \nwill miss Sharla and her family. I wish them all the best, but I know \nthis is not farewell. She will continue to be a valued friend and \nadvisor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/16/senate-section/article/S7925-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNITION OF WJJY-FM FOR RECEIVING THE NAB CRYSTAL RADIO AWARD\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a \ndistinguished Minnesota radio station, WJJY-FM, for winning 2003 \nNational Association of Broadcaster's Crystal Radio Award, commending \nits commitment to community service.\n  WJJY-FM, based in Brainerd, MN, won a National Association of \nBroadcaster's Crystal Award, recognizing its continued charitable \nefforts in the Brainerd community. This award marks the third time the \nNational Association of Broadcasters has recognized WJJY's dedication \nto service. The station also won a Crystal Award in 2001 and the \nprestigious NABEF Service to America Award in 1999.\n  WJJY-FM is active in charitable fundraising, supporting food drives, \nand providing public service announcements for the community. In 2002 \nthe station set a fundraising record for the Brainerd area by raising \n$940,500 for the community. WJJY-FM helped collect 7,500 pounds of food \nfor the Salvation Army, gathered 1,300 clothing items for needy \nfamilies, and broadcasted over 7,350 public service announcements. In \naddition, WJJY holds the annual Radiothon to End Child Abuse, which \nraised a record-setting $66,520 in 2002.\n  WJJY-FM represents a tradition of corporate dedication to community \nservice in the State of Minnesota. Since 1999, 4 Minnesota stations \nhave received the Service to American Award, and since 1987, 17 have \nreceived Crystal Awards. This tradition of service is an important \nMinnesota legacy.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe status of professional employer organizations and to promote and \nprotect the interests of professional employer organizations, their \ncustomers, and workers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the \nProfessional Employer Organization Workers Benefits Act of 2003--\nlegislation that I sponsored in the last Congress. This legislation \nclarifies certain tax rules\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nfor Professional Employer Organizations, PEOs, and will allow PEOs to \nprovide retirement and health benefits for workers at small and medium-\nsized businesses. By eliminating uncertainty in the current rules, it \nwill also improve the administration of our tax system.\n  The PEO legislation makes it clear that a PEO that is certified by \nthe IRS as meeting certain rigorous standards will be able to offer \nemployee benefits and remit Federal employment taxes for workers \nperforming services for the PEO's business customers. The bill has won \nthe support of representatives of the small business community, \nincluding the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), and \nhas been endorsed by an array of employee benefits experts, such as the \nAmerican Benefits Council, ABC, the American Society of Pension \nActuaries, ASPA, and the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation, \nECFC. The legislation also has the support of the National Association \nof Professional Employer Organizations, NAPEO--the largest organization \nrepresenting the interests of PEOs. Significantly, then-Internal \nRevenue Service Commissioner Rossotti stated last year that the IRS \nbelieves that the PEO bill could provide useful clarification of the \nfederal employment tax and employee benefits obligations of PEOs and \ntheir clients.\n  A well-run PEO provides the expertise and the economies of scale \nnecessary to provide health, retirement and other services to small \nbusinesses in an affordable and efficient manner. For many of these \nworkers, the PEO's pension or health plan represents benefits that the \nworker would not have received from the small business directly because \nthey were too costly for the small business to afford on its own.\n  We must take every opportunity to encourage businesses to provide \nretirement and health benefits to their employees through whatever \nmeans possible. PEOs offer one creative way to bridge the gap between \nwhat workers need and what small businesses can afford to provide them. \nFor example, Merit Resources, based in Iowa, is a PEO that has provided \nimportant benefits to many workers in my state. The clarifications \nprovided in the bill I am introducing today would provide PEOs like \nMerit with the certainty they need. Certainty that will ensure that \nthey can continue to serve small businesses and provide benefits to the \nworkers at those businesses.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues, \non both sides of the aisle, on these important issues. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Professional Employer \n     Organization Workers Benefits Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of medication therapy management services under \nPart B of the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will provide for important health care quality and \nmedication safety improvements in the Medicare program. The Medication \nTherapy Management\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\nServices Coverage Act of 2003 will enhance the Medicare program by \nproviding coverage of pharmacists' medication therapy management \nservices for those beneficiaries at risk for potential medication \nproblems due to the presence of multiple or complex chronic diseases. \nThese services, which are coordinated in direct collaboration with \nphysicians and other health care professionals, help patients make the \nbest possible use of their medications.\n  The members of this body know very well the vital role that today's \npowerful and effective medications play in the maintenance of health \nand well-being of our Nation's seniors. The substantial and important \ndiscussion now underway on how best to craft and implement a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries is an explicit \nrecognition of this vital role. But access to the medications, even at \nthe most affordable prices possible, is only one part of the solution \nto achieving the kinds of health care outcomes that patients and their \nhealth care providers desire. That is where today's pharmacists play a \npivotal role.\n  In addition to the important and continuing responsibility for \nassuring accurate, safe medication dispensing and counseling services, \npharmacists now provide many direct patient care, consultative, and \neducational services. Forty states, the Veterans Administration, and \nthe Indian Health Service, among others, all recognize the value of \ncollaborative medication therapy management services as a way to \nprovide optimal patient care using the specialized education and \ntraining of pharmacists. In addition, several state Medicaid programs \nhave active demonstration projects or waiver programs in place that \ndeliver these important services to their citizens.\n  More specifically, in its June 2002 report to the Congress, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission noted that it ``sees potential for \na Medicare drug therapy management benefit to facilitate access to an \nimportant health care service for some beneficiaries'' and recommended \nto Congress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services ``. . . \nassess models for collaborative drug therapy management services in \noutpatient settings.'' This is a very important recommendation, because \nthere is no more vulnerable group than our Nation's seniors when it \ncomes to the potential for medication-related problems and the presence \nof multiple chronic diseases. If other health care systems and programs \nprovide such services, Medicare must be reformed to provide them as \nwell. Indeed, Medicare should be the leader in this regard.\n  The pharmacist's specialized training in medication therapy \nmanagement has been demonstrated repeatedly to improve the quality of \ncare patients receive and to control health care costs associated with \nmedication complications. As an essential infrastructure component of \nany type of Medicare prescription drug benefit, it makes sense to take \nthis proven initial step to improve the medication use process for our \nseniors. This will serve all Medicare beneficiaries by ensuring that \neach precious dollar, regardless of who is paying the ``bills for the \npills,'' is spent wisely on a safe and effective medication regimen. \nThis is a benefit that we can all support and deliver now, as we work \nto also resolve the economic and political challenges in crafting a \ntruly effective and affordable prescription drug benefit.\n  Because pharmacists improve the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of \nmedication regimens and reduce medication-related problems and adverse \neffects, the addition of their services represents real value and \nenhances the prospects of achieving both an affordable Medicare drug \nbenefit and improved health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. In \nfact, numerous studies over the past decade have demonstrated returns \non investments of up to $17.00 for every single dollar invested in the \nprovision of pharmacists' clinical and patient care services.\n  Our legislation provides a logical and very affordable first step in \nestablishing the essential infrastructure of a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. As the 1999 Institute of Medicine report ``To Err is \nHuman: Building a Safer Health System'' stated:\n\n       Because of the immense variety and complexity of \n     medications now available, it is impossible for nurses and \n     doctors to keep up with all of the information required for \n     safe medication use. The pharmacist has become an essential \n     resource . . . and thus access to his or her expertise must \n     be possible at all times.\n\n  Our legislation will assure that the Medicare program leads, rather \nthan follows, on this important health care quality issue. Pharmacists' \ncollaborative medication therapy management services can and will make \na real difference in the lives of Medicare beneficiaries.
