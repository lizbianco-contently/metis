Instead, it is awareness of Your presence that we call \nforth, that we invoke a reminder of a plan or dream in which we might \nplay a part, a promise of a better world, better time, a time of peace \nand justice that we might help to build. May Your presence touch our \nlives, and even shape our words, so that we might find the wisdom and \nthe courage to do our part to keep our dreams and prayers alive and \nhelp make those dreams and prayers come true.

This afternoon, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 2:30 p.m. At 2:30 the Senate will begin consideration of \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill. Under the order, \namendments will not be in order to the bill until 5:30 today. Under the \nprevious order, our first rollcall vote is scheduled for 5:30 this \nafternoon, but due to a number of meetings, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote on the confirmation of the nomination of S. Maurice \nHicks, Jr., to be a United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Louisiana be moved until 5 p.m. today.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have a number of speakers \nhere now: Senator Conrad wants to speak for 15 minutes, Senator Dorgan \nfor 15 minutes, and Senator Hagel is in the Chamber and wishes to speak \nfor 5 minutes. Could we extend morning business for 15 minutes equally \ndivided?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to extend it for 15 minutes. I \nhave very few remarks to make, and then we will have the Senator go \nfirst.\n  Mr. REID. That should cover the time.\n  I ask that Senator Conrad be recognized for 15 minutes, Senator \nDorgan for 10 minutes, and Senator Hagel for 5 minutes; you go first, \nthen Senator Conrad, and then Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. FRIST. My remarks are going to be for 3 minutes; if I could have \nSenator Hagel go first and then follow with----\n  Mr. REID. If he is speaking a short time, that will be fair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Is there objection to moving the time for a vote?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me clarify, or add to that, because we are moving the \ntime up. I understand a lot of people will be coming back this \nafternoon. Since we initially scheduled it for 5:30, we will extend \nthat voting to, say, 6 p.m. So we will begin voting at 5 p.m. today, \nand the vote will be held open until 6 p.m. today since this is a \nchange from Friday.\n  Following that vote, Members may offer amendments to the DOD \nauthorization bill. The two managers will be encouraging any Senator \nwho intends to offer an amendment to stay around after the vote to \noffer and debate their amendment. Any votes ordered on amendments that \nare debated this evening will be postponed to begin tomorrow morning. \nIt is my hope that we will be able to complete Senate action on this \nbill early this week.\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\n  This week, the Senate will also consider the debt limit extension \nlegislation. We have an agreement for a limitation of amendments to \nthat bill, although it is still my hope that the list of amendments can \nbe pared down and we can pass that bill in a quick period of time.\n  Finally, I add that last week the Senate passed the jobs and economic \ngrowth package. At this point, it is unclear at what time the Houses \ncan complete working out the differences. It is my hope to complete \nthat prior to the Memorial Day recess. People have been meeting over \nthe weekend, today, and will be meeting tonight. I will keep my \ncolleagues posted. My intent is to complete that package before the \nMemorial Day recess. The language has to be worked out between both \nHouses. We will be talking about that as we go forward.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the floor, \nregarding the debt limit, we have entered into an agreement in good \nfaith with the majority. However, I think we should expect this will \ntake a day. I worked with Senator McConnell last week. We had it down \nto a finite number of amendments. That did not work out. We have a \nMemorial Day recess with people giving graduation speeches and Memorial \nDay speeches, and we are going to get jammed toward the end of this \nweek, as we do before a recess period. We are happy to work, but I \ndon't think we can plan on finishing this bill in a couple of hours.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the assistant \nminority leader. I am hopeful we can pare down the number of \namendments, but I understand from their perspective it will take more \nthan a couple of hours. In that regard, the exact timing will be \ndiscussed as to when we actually bring that to the floor. It will be \ncompleted this week.\n  In a few moments I will talk about bioshield, as well, that I would \nlike to complete this week. But absolutely for sure, DOD we are looking \nto complete, we will address the debt ceiling this week--we have to \naddress it this week--and we will address, hopefully, the jobs and \neconomic growth package in its final form as well as bioshield.\n  Putting that together will be, again, a very long week. People \nabsolutely must plan to be here on Friday, voting on Friday before we \nbegin the recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6572-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am going to make just a few comments on \nbioshield and then will yield to the Senator from Nebraska. The \ncomments I want to make are really a continuation of the statement of \nmy intentions of a few minutes ago, and that is that the bioshield \nlegislation must be addressed as soon as possible. I believe it has \nramifications for the security of this Nation.\n  Today, Israel was rocked by a fifth suicide bombing in 4 days--5 \ndead, 14 or 15 injured in a blast outside a shopping mall. Just last \nFriday we had a suicide attack in Morocco claiming 42 lives. In Saudi \nArabia last week: 3 simultaneous attacks, 34 people murdered including \n7 Americans. Meanwhile, 15 European tourists are being held hostage in \na bunker in Algeria.\n  This weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.N. Weapons \nInspector Hans Blix warns that:\n\n       Chemical and biological weapons might be within the reach \n     of terrorists--whether these are groups or individuals.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Full guarantees against research and development are hardly \n     attainable, and possible hidden stores of biological and \n     chemical weapons may also be very hard to discover.\n\n  The threat is real. Biological and other dangerous agents every day \nget closer and closer and closer to being within the grasp of those who \nwish to do us or peoples around the world mortal harm. We have made \ntremendous progress in treating many serious naturally occurring \ndiseases, but we still lag far behind where we should be in developing \nthe medical treatments and responses against biological or potential \nbiological and chemical attacks.\n  President Bush, in his State of the Union Message, proposed Project \nBioshield, which is a comprehensive effort to develop and make \navailable modern, up-to-date, effective countermeasures against such \nbiological and chemical agents. It is a major cooperative effort which \nwill be a joint activity of the new Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n  We look, in this legislation, at the next generation of \ncountermeasures. Over the next 10 years, the administration estimates \nthat about $6 billion will be available to purchase new countermeasures \nfor conditions and illnesses and microbes like smallpox or anthrax or \nbotulinum toxin or Ebola or plague.\n  Project Bioshield also expands research and development into medical \ntreatments as well as making these promising treatments available, very \nquickly, rapidly, in response to an emergency.\n  My colleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, introduced a \ncomprehensive measure which incorporated the President's bioshield \ninitiative into S. 15, the Biodefense Improvement and Treatment for \nAmerica Act. That bill was introduced on March 11. Portions of that \nlegislation incorporating the President's bioshield initiative passed \nthe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on March 25. \nA slightly modified version passed the committee with the support of \nthe ranking Democrat member, Senator Kennedy, as well as the support of \nall Republicans and all Democrats on the committee. The bill was placed \non the Senate calendar on March 25, but now it is 2 months later and \ndespite repeated attempts to pass the legislation, the minority, the \nDemocrats, have objected to passing the bill by unanimous consent or \neven to debating the bill under a time agreement.\n  We simply cannot continue to wait. Every day we wait is a day too \nlong. We cannot forget the terrible video footage of the potential of \nthese terrorist agents being used against us or other people.\n  I hope the Senate will be able to meet Democratic objections and move \nthis legislation this week before the Memorial Day recess. As I said in \nmy opening comments earlier, none of us here doubts the potential \ndanger that is out there. We need bioshield passed, and we need it \npassed as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, last week the Senate and House passed tax \nmeasures. I want to take a moment to comment on those tax measures. My \npersonal belief is that they are fundamentally flawed, that they are \nineffective as stimulus, irresponsible as tax policy, and ultimately \nunfair. In terms of stimulus, the plan that passed the Senate last week \nwill provide $45 billion of stimulus the first year; the House plan, \n$48 billion--that in an economy that is $10.5 trillion in size.\n\n  Most economists say that small a measure will do virtually nothing to \ngive a lift to the economy. The proposal by Senator Daschle, which \nprovided $125 billion of stimulus, is the minimum size most economists \nsay is necessary to give any serious lift to a $10.5 trillion economy.\n  But the bigger flaw is in the long-term cost of the proposals \nadvanced by our colleagues in both the Senate and the House. In the \nSenate, the 10-year cost of the plan is $350 billion; in the House, \n$550 billion. But that substantially understates the true cost of these \nmeasures.\n  We can look at the Wall Street Journal, which did an analysis. They \nconcluded: ``Caution: Tax Cuts Are Bigger Than They Appear In The \nBudget.'' That is because of this phony sunset\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\nthat has been adopted in both the House and the Senate to substantially \nunderstate the cost.\n  If the sunsets were not present, what we find is that the House bill, \nwhich is advertised to cost $550 billion, would actually cost $1.1 \ntrillion. So when they say they have a tax measure that costs $550 \nbillion, the true cost, without sunsets, is $1.1 trillion on the House \nside. In the Senate, they say they have a package that costs $350 \nbillion. The true cost, without the sunset gimmick, is $660 billion.\n  Some will say: Well, a sunset may be a valid thing. They may actually \nend that tax cut at the end of the time. Well, let's just look back 2 \nyears ago. Two years ago, they passed tax measures filled with sunsets, \nand now what are they saying? Now they are saying: If you allow them to \nsunset, it will be a tax increase. So they are saying, oh, no, they \ncan't be sunset, they have to be continued.\n  You know, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. \nLook, how can any of us be fooled about what is to come? It is very \nclear what they are going to do. They are going to insist on \neliminating these sunsets and the costs will explode. Well, what \ndifference does that make? The difference it makes, of course, is that \nwe are already in record deficit. With these additional tax cuts, and \nwith the increased spending provided for in the President's budget, we \nare headed for deficits that are utterly unsustainable.\n  Not only that, this policy of sunsetting means you have a come-and-go \ntax policy that is bewildering and will have an adverse effect on the \neconomy. As the chart says: ``Sunset and Phase-in Gimmicks Produce Bad \nTax Policy.'' Here is just one example. The marriage penalty comes and \ngoes, and it comes again under the policy adopted in the Senate just \nlast week. It is really quite stunning what they have done.\n  For couples who incur a marriage penalty because of the standard \ndeduction, that marriage penalty would be eliminated when the standard \ndeduction equals $9,500 for the year 2003. Under the plan passed last \nweek in the Senate--and using constant 2003 dollars--we will have \n$9,267 this year, $9,500 next year, and then it goes down to $8,265 the \nyear after that. That will mean a tax increase on married couples. And \nthen it goes up to $8,740, $8,883--all of these standard deduction \namounts over the 4 years after 2004 are below the amount necessary to \naddress the marriage penalty. It is really a giant hoax on the American \npeople. But look what happens in 2011 and 2012 and 2013. Then it goes \ndown to less than $8,000--a significant tax increase on married \ncouples.\n\n  This is consistent, unfortunately, throughout the package passed last \nweek. It is true of the dividend tax measure. What a bizarre thing that \nis. It is phased in with a 50 percent exclusion the first year, then it \ngoes up to 100 percent for a few years, and then it is eliminated. One \nprominent Republican analyst, an economist who has testified repeatedly \nbefore Congress, called it the most patently absurd tax policy offered \never. I don't know if it is the most absurd offered ever, but it is \npretty farfetched. And he is not alone in that view. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Administration sources admit that dividends will likely \n     decline relative to today under this plan between now and \n     2005. How can that be a harmless event given that increases \n     in dividend payments are viewed to be so wonderful? Clearly, \n     this proposal is one of the most patently absurd tax policies \n     ever proposed.\n\n  As I say, he is not alone in that analysis. Here are two economists \nwho say the Senate GOP dividend tax plan will not help the economy:\n\n       [Mr.] Timothy M. Koller and Susan Nolen Foushee, \n     consultants at McKinsey & Co., noted in a recent report that \n     as of last year owners of 61 percent of all common stock were \n     not subject to tax, so markets are driven by investors who \n     are not concerned with tax treatment of dividends. Thus, \n     ``the proposed tax cut'' on dividends ``seems unlikely to \n     have a significant or lasting effect on U.S. share prices,'' \n     [they] said.\n\n  That is from the Washington Post.\n  What is even more bizarre is the President went around this country \nand told people this policy was to eliminate double taxation. His \nargument was that corporate profits are first taxed at the corporate \nlevel and then taxed again when they are paid out into dividends.\n  So his initial proposal included a corporate accounting provision \nthat guaranteed that taxes on profits were paid at the corporate level \nbefore those profits could be paid out to shareholders on a tax-free \nbasis. Do you know what? Here in the Senate they took that provision \nout. So now you can have a circumstance where the money is not taxed \neither at the corporate level or when it is paid out as dividends. That \nis not a matter of eliminating double taxation, that is a matter of \neliminating all taxation on corporate earnings.\n  Now, if that isn't an utterly preposterous outcome, I don't know what \nis. That is what this Senate passed last week. I expect a lot of \nMembers who voted for it did not even know that provision was taken \nout. I expect they did not know you are going to have a circumstance in \nwhich corporations do not pay taxes at the corporate level and then get \nto pay the dividends out completely tax free--well, at least for a few \nyears until it is all restored and we face a massive tax increase on \ndividends that would do real damage to the economy of this country.\n\n  As shown on this chart, here is a Republican tax analyst who \nridicules the Senate GOP dividend tax plan:\n\n       ``I can understand the political reasons why they put it in \n     that way, but it's such an incredibly bad idea,'' said \n     Norbert Michel, a tax policy analyst at the Heritage \n     Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington.\n\n  That is from the New York Times.\n  I think Mr. Michel had it right.\n  This next chart shows that economists say the Senate GOP dividend tax \nplan makes little sense:\n\n       Many economists say a temporary reduction of the dividend \n     tax makes little economic sense, blunting the goal of \n     boosting companies' stock prices and leaving them more money \n     to invest. ``Phasing something in but letting it go away \n     doesn't have a very large economic impact,'' said Christopher \n     Wiegand, economist for Citigroup Inc.\n\n  This is according to the Associated Press.\n  The evidence is mounting that what was passed here last week makes no \nearthly sense. It does not make economic sense. It makes no fiscal \nsense because the deficits of this country are already at a record \nlevel. This year some have said it would be a small deficit. Let the \nAmerican people make the judgment if they think it is small.\n  The deficit this year, on an operating basis, is going to be between \n$500 and $600 billion on a budget of $2.2 trillion.\n  Some say that is a small deficit. What would they call a large \ndeficit? A $500 to $600 billion deficit on an operating basis on a \n$12.2 trillion budget, and you know that is just the beginning. Once \nthe President's plan is put in place, that increase is spent. That cuts \nrevenue, and when we already have record deficits, you can only have \none result; that is, deficits that multiply. It will also occur at the \nworst possible time because these deficits are coming at us right \nbefore the baby boomers retire.\n  When I talk about a tax plan that makes no sense, it is not just \npeople on our side of the aisle saying that. You have Republicans \nsaying what was passed in the Senate makes no sense. Here is another \nlawmaker who says he considers the bill a bad idea. It is the Speaker \nof the House, Dennis Hastert, who described the plan as an ``all of a \nsudden you see it, and now you don't'' idea. He went on to say:\n\n       If the dividend tax is 50 percent and then nothing, and all \n     of a sudden it is back to 100 percent or whatever it is, my \n     feeling is that it does not solve the problem.\n\n  But he did not mention that his Chamber's bill also sunsets a half-\ndozen major provisions.\n  Rarely have we seen tax bills so riddled with gimmicks and false \nassumptions.\n  This is what the Joint Committee on Taxation found when they did a \n``dynamic analysis'' of the bill passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. They concluded that the increased deficits that will \nbe created will eventually outweigh the benefits of tax cuts.\n  This is what a number of us have been saying repeatedly. These are \nnot tax cuts offset by spending reductions; these are offsets paid for \nby borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund. In fact, \nvirtually every penny of Social Security trust fund surpluses over the \nentire next decade are being taken to pay for these tax cuts. And \npeople think that is a good idea.\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\n  The President says this is the people's money. He is exactly right \nabout that. This is the people's money. But do you know what? It is \nalso the people's debt. It is also the people's Social Security. It is \nalso the people's Medicare. All of those are the people's. The policy \nhe has fashioned is taking Social Security trust fund surpluses from \nthe people in order to pay for a tax cut; taking from a circumstance in \nwhich people are paying payroll taxes--by the way, 80 percent of \nAmerican taxpayers pay more in payroll tax than they pay in income \ntax--it is going to take from their trust fund surpluses and use it to \ngive an income tax cut that flows overwhelmingly to the wealthiest \namong us. You talk about Robin Hood in reverse, this is it. It is not \ngood economic policy, it is not good tax policy, it is not good fiscal \npolicy, and it is going to put us in a deeper and deeper hole.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation said this about the plan:\n\n       This stimulus is reduced over time because the consumption, \n     labor, and investment incentives are temporary, and because \n     the positive business investment incentives arising from the \n     tax policy are eventually likely to be outweighted by the \n     reduction in national savings due to increased Federal \n     Government deficits.\n\n  That is exactly what is wrong with this plan. It is not the economic \ngrowth plan, it is a plan to borrow from the future and to take Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses and give a big tax cut to those who are \nthe wealthiest among us.\n  This plan also flunks the fairness test. The plan benefits the \nwealthiest in a way that is truly stunning. Taxpayers with income over \n$1 million will get a benefit of $73,790 in this tax year alone. The \ntypical taxpayers--those in the middle income in this country, the 20 \npercent of taxpayers who are in the middle of the income distribution--\nwill have an average benefit of $245.\n  Let me conclude by saying I hope my colleagues will take a second \nlook at what was passed. I think it is going to prove to be a serious \nmistake for our fiscal future.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Thursday and early Friday morning, \nthe Senate was in session for I believe 17 hours, and it took 36 \nrollcall votes. Many of us arrived at our homes at 1:30 or 2 in the \nmorning. I had trouble sleeping despite the hour because of what \nhappened on that day. I want to describe something that has bothered me \nall weekend.\n  In the middle of discussing the tax vote that came to us from the \nFinance Committee, the majority leader brought up the global AIDS bill. \nI guess it was about 10 o'clock at night. Those of us who prepared to \noffer amendments were told by the majority leader twice on the floor of \nthe Senate that we would be able to offer our amendments and they would \ndefeat them. Understand that this is a global AIDS bill that was done \nin committee, and none of us who do not serve on that committee had an \nopportunity to deal with that subject.\n  Yet we were told in the Senate we would be able to offer our \namendments and they would defeat them. This was about 10 o'clock at \nnight. We were, by the way, at that moment debating a $430 billion or \n$450 billion tax cut. And I proposed an amendment to the global AIDS \nbill to spend $250 million--one-fourth of a billion dollars--to address \na famine, particularly in central and sub-Saharan Africa, that \nthreatens 11 million people. But before we had a debate about the \nsubstance of that, we were told: Your amendments will be defeated. Why? \nBecause they are not a priority.\n  We had already passed the level of food aid that was proposed in my \namendment previously. That $250 million was already passed by the \nSenate in the omnibus bill and taken out by the House of \nRepresentatives in conference. But we were told we didn't have the \ncapability in the Senate to do it last Thursday. So we had a record \nvote. I lost 49 to 51.\n  Just so we understand this is not about some abstract theory, let me \nread Nicholas Kristof's piece in the New York Times of May 13.\n\n       Ladawi is a 16-month-old girl with twigs for limbs, \n     blotched skin, labored breathing, eyes that roll back and \n     skin stretched tautly over shoulder blades that look as if \n     they belong to a survivor of Auschwitz. She is so \n     malnourished that she cannot brush away the files that land \n     on her eyes, and she does not react when a medical trainee \n     injects drugs into her hip in a race to save her life.\n       ``She's concerned only with trying to breathe,'' says the \n     trainee, the closest thing to a doctor at a remote medical \n     center here in southern Ethiopia. ``Most likely she will not \n     survive.''\n\n  I don't understand this. I just do not understand. We have people \ndying, children dying, and we have substantial food in this country and \nthe most productive farmers in the world. They are told at the grain \nelevator that food has no value. If you produce it in such abundance, \nit has no value. And then a young girl in Boricha, Ethiopia, lies on \nher bed dying because she doesn't have food.\n  I served on the Hunger Committee when I served in the House. I have \ntraveled to many spots in the world to refugee camps. I have seen \ndesperate hunger. I have held in my arms children who were dying \nbecause they didn't have enough to eat. We live in a world of plenty--\nat least here in the United States. Obesity is a major problem. A \nsubstantial part of our country is on a diet. Our farmers can't make a \nliving because they are told their food has no value. Yet we have 11 \nmillion people at risk. This Senate says no to the food aid that needs \nto go to those kids, to help those kids. I just do not understand it.\n  Let me read further from the Nicholas Kristof piece:\n\n       We've all been distracted by Iraq, but an incipient famine \n     in the Horn of Africa has been drastically worsening just in \n     the last few weeks. It has garnered almost no attention in \n     the West, partly because it's not generally realized that \n     people are already dying here in significant numbers. But \n     they are. And unless the West mobilizes further assistance \n     immediately to Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the toll could \n     be catastrophic. . . .\n       ``We've been overwhelmed by this, especially in the last \n     three weeks,'' said Tigist Esatu, a nurse at the Yirba Health \n     Center, crowded with mothers carrying starving children. \n     ``Some families come and say, `We've lost two children \n     already, three children already, so you must save this one.' \n     ''\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Since weapons of mass destruction haven't turned up so far \n     in Iraq, there's been a revisionist suggestion that the \n     American invasion was worthwhile because of humanitarian \n     gains for the liberated Iraqi people. Fair enough. But as \n     long as we're willing to send hundreds of thousands of troops \n     to help Iraqis, what about offering much more modest \n     assistance to save the children dying here?\n       ``How is it that we routinely accept a level of suffering \n     and hopelessness in Africa that we would never accept in any \n     other part of the world?'' asks James Morris, the executive \n     director of the World Food Program. . . .\n       Fair enough. But as long as we're willing to send hundreds \n     of thousands of troops to help Iraqis, what about offering \n     much more modest assistance to save the children dying here?\n\n  Later in the article he quotes a mother:\n\n       ``Now I worry about my other children,'' said Tadilech \n     Yuburo, a young woman who lost one child last month and has \n     three left. In her village, Duressa, population 300, five \n     children have died in the last month. In nearby Falamu, \n     population 400, six children have died. This famine has not \n     yet registered on the world's conscience.\n\n  I offered an amendment to provide some food aid which we have in \nabundance. We have plenty of food aid to give. I offered an amendment \nat 10, 11 at night. We didn't have the time to do that, didn't have the \nwillingness to do that. We didn't have the votes to do that. We were \nway too busy providing tax cuts, the majority of which will go to upper \nincome Americans.\n  I had a friend who died of a car crash in 1981. He was a wonderful \nman, a singer, named Harry Chapin, who dedicated most of his life to \nfighting rural hunger. Harry wrote a song I want to read that describes \nwhy I feel so passionately about this. The song is called ``The \nShortest Story.''\n\n       I am born today. The sun burns its promise in my eyes. \n     Momma strikes me and I draw a breath to cry. Far above a \n     cloud tumbles softly through the sky. It is now my seventh \n     day. I taste the hunger and I cry. Brother and sister cling \n     to momma's side. She squeezes her breast, but it has nothing \n     to provide. Someone weeps. I fall asleep. It is 20\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\n     days today. Momma does not hold me anymore. I open my mouth \n     but I am too weak to cry. Far above a bird slowly crawls \n     across the sky. Why is there nothing left to do but die?\n\n  Those were lyrics by the late Harry Chapin. Harry was a terrific \nfriend. He dedicated the proceeds from one-half of his concerts every \nyear to fight world hunger. He used to say, if one night 45,000 people \ndied of hunger in New Jersey, it would make headlines around the world, \ngiant headlines in every paper in the world. But the winds of hunger \nblow every day, every hour, every minute, and 45,000 people, mostly \nchildren, die every day, and it doesn't make the newspaper.\n  Now we have a gripping famine in a part of the world that some of us \nbelieve we have a moral responsibility to address in a much more \naggressive way than we have been willing to address previously. Yet a \nrelatively small amendment I offered on Thursday was defeated by two \nvotes, and I was told before I offered it: Go ahead and offer your \namendment. We will defeat it. And this was before they knew what the \namendment was about.\n  That is not the kind of priority you would expect from the Senate. I \nregret very much that we passed this global AIDS bill and did not \nattach the $250 million in food aid to which the Senate had previously \nagreed. We don't have much time if we care about world hunger. If we \ncare about saving these children, if we care about doing what we need \nto do, what our responsibility would call us to do at this moment, then \nwe must regroup and pass legislation of the type I offered Thursday \nnight.\n  Again, it was hard to sleep, and this weekend I thought a lot about \nthat, wondering why was the Senate so much more interested in providing \ntax cuts than it was in providing assistance to those starving in other \nparts of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I advise my good friend and partner on this \nventure that I will proceed for some 10 minutes and then yield the \nfloor, on the assumption that he will proceed, and then I will resume \nwith the remainder of my statement.\n  On behalf of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased and honored \nto bring the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 to \nthe Senate for consideration. The bill was reported out of the \ncommittee with overwhelming bipartisan support. I may say, as a tribute \nto excellent staff work and excellent work by the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the subcommittees and, indeed, by the full cooperation of my \ndistinguished colleague, the ranking member, we achieved this markup in \nwhat is regarded to be record time. I didn't keep the time, but I \ncertainly recognize that we did it in a very brief period; basically \nover a 2-day period, where many times heretofore it has been 3, 4, and \n5 days for markup.\n  I think the committee, both members and staff, were aware of the \ntremendous support across this Nation by the people for the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces today and a recognition of the \nresponsibilities of the Congress of the United States--in this case the \nSenate--to provide for those men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  Having said that, I believe that contributed to the swift action we \nhad on our bill in committee markup, and I anticipate--I say this \nrespectfully--in the Chamber a number of amendments will come forth, \nbut I believe we will be able to complete this bill in a relatively \nshort period of time, owing again to the support in the Chamber for the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces and the desire to have a strong bill \nin place to go to conference with the House.\n  As we stand here beginning the debate on this bill today, over \n300,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, Active Guard and \nReserve, and countless civilians who support them, are serving bravely \nin not just the Persian Gulf region but Afghanistan.\n  It is remarkable. I want to mention the civilians. I recently said to \nthe Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, when we talked about the total \nforce concept, I remembered so well that that concept was originated \nwhen Melvin Laird was Secretary of Defense and I was privileged to \nserve as the Secretary of the Navy during the Vietnam war. I said to \nMr. Rumsfeld recently that we really ought to broaden the term ``total \nforce'' now to incorporate the many civilians who quite often are in \npositions of personal risk and other situations not unlike those of the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces, right up on the point of the spear \nof military action.\n  In my judgment, they are just as much a part of the total force as \nthe uniformed contingent, and I think the uniformed contingent would \nwant me\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nto state that. This total force is there to secure peace and freedom \nfor the people, specifically of Afghanistan and Iraq. Other men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, as we all fully recognize, are serving in \noutposts and at sea across this world. How proud we are of our forces \nwho are deployed throughout the world. Some of those personnel are \nassuming personal risks as great as those who have been fighting in \nAfghanistan and in the Persian Gulf. All Americans are proud of the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  We also want to pay recognition to the various nations that have \njoined us in these military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and \naround the world and that stand guard with us to enforce the principles \nof freedom throughout this globe.\n  We are engaged in an international war on terrorism. The principal \nbattlefronts are Afghanistan and Iraq, but indeed there is no less of a \nchallenge in many other parts of the world away. Therefore, we are very \nthankful to all those who make possible this total force in the cause \nof not only combating terrorism but other military objectives we have \nto fulfill in the cause of freedom throughout the world.\n  I will pause now a moment to reflect on perhaps the most serious \nconsequence of military life. I went back in history and gathered a few \nstatistics. We will, throughout the course of this deliberation in the \nSenate, as we go about our daily responsibilities, have in mind those \nwho paid the ultimate sacrifice with their loss of life and those who \nwere wounded in the course of serving the cause of freedom in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and other places in the world. I went back in \nhistory, and I would like to recite the following figures:\n  The total casualties in the Iraq campaign thus far have been \napproximately 612, of whom 117 were killed in direct combat and 495 \nwere wounded. A total of 151 have lost their lives as part of operation \nIraqi Freedom. In Afghanistan: Total casualties, 252, of whom 31 lost \ntheir lives and 221 suffered wounds. I think it is important to bear \nthose casualty figures in mind as we think with reference to previous \nengagements. Vietnam: 211,000 casualties, 58,000 killed, 153,000 \nwounded. Korea: 139,000 total casualties, 36,000 killed, 103,000 \nwounded. World War II: 1,077,000 casualties, 405,000 killed, 671,000 \nwounded. We still have missing. I know the Korean conflict alone has \nsome 8,000 American individuals who remain unaccounted for.\n  Whatever we do, we all join in mourning their loss and resolve to \nforever remember their service. We care for their families as best we \ncan. We are blessed truly as a nation to have this new generation of \ngreat Americans, those who have recently suffered as casualties in the \nAfghanistan and Iraq operations, and indeed many others throughout the \nworld in other actions. This new generation of great Americans is so \ncommitted to the traditions, mindful of the sacrifices of their \nforebears, and they have performed their services in exemplary fashion \nin keeping with the tradition of the military men and women who have \ngone before them--indeed, their values and their ideals and likewise \nthe suffering of the families.\n\n  I will bet all of us here in the last few days have attended \ngraduations and spoken at them. I have been privileged to do them \nmyself. Each time I look at these young graduates, I say the casualties \nin Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere around the world are young men \nand young women of the same age basically--from the years 18 through \n24. Some are older, but basically those generations graduating today, \nlooking upon the joys of their college or university careers, should \npause for a moment to reflect on those who are elsewhere in the world \nenabling them to achieve their goals and their respective graduations.\n  The stunning and very swift military success we had in Operation \nIraqi Freedom, achieving the military goals laid out in the plan \ndevised by the Commander, U.S. Central Command, General Tommy Franks \nand the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with the joint staffs of \nthe coalition nations, and in approval with that of the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense primarily, and I expect to some extent the \nSecretary of State--those achievements are a testament to the \ndedication and professionalism of the men and women in the Armed \nForces. The precision and the skill with which recent operations have \nbeen conducted are a tribute not only to their bravery and commitment, \nand indeed their sacrifice, but also to the industrial base of America, \nwhich is providing the weaponry, providing the means by which they pass \nthrough each day, and the requirements for human existence and human \nprotection. So we pay tribute to that industrial base today, for the \nAmerican technology and ingenuity, which has made a definite \ncontribution to the welfare and the survival of the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Those statistics I gave about earlier military engagements--obviously \nhigh in contrast to the current losses--tell a story of how high-tech \nweaponry can save lives--not just the smart bombs and smart ordnance \nbut indeed the very uniforms and protection devices the Armed Forces \nwear today. We had, in the course of our update briefings, a visit by \nseveral soldiers who came in and showed us the armored vests, the night \nvision, the special scopes on their weapons. It is far different from \nwhat this humble person witnessed in Korea, in World War II, and in \ntraining commands. Today's weapons bear little resemblance to the basic \nweapons that fought through the battles of World War II and Korea and, \nto a lesser extent, Vietnam, because we had a transition of the basic \nweapon in Vietnam. This is a magnificent tribute to the industrial base \nof this country that has provided this weaponry. That is what this bill \nis about: the need to have ever-changing technology to afford even \ngreater protection to the men and women of the Armed Forces as we face \nthe uncertain, unchartered, and unknown threats that face us in this \ncentury.\n\n  Military strategists and historians will study the Afghanistan and \nIraqi military campaigns for years to come and will recognize them as a \ntotal new chapter in military history in many ways. Without a doubt, \nthe U.S. military is the most capable military force in the world \ntoday, a model of excellence and the standard by which others are \nmeasured.\n  Senator Levin and I visited Afghanistan on Thanksgiving almost two \nyears ago, as those operations were just beginning to get underway. We \nwitnessed how small units, anywhere from 15 to 25 individuals, would \nget in their helicopters and go in to the darkness of night, all \nenlisted, save one officer, and perform extraordinary feats of heroism \nand professional courage in achieving their objectives.\n  We witnessed it again, just weeks before the start of military \noperations in Iraq, in its full measure, when we both visited Qatar and \nKuwait in February of this year.\n  It is precisely for this reason we must send a strong message of \nsupport to our men and women in uniform by passing this important bill \nthis week. This bill contains much deserved pay raises and benefits for \nour military personnel, for their families, needed increases in family \nhousing and quality of life projects on military installations, as well \nas prudent investments in the equipment and technology our military \nneeds to deal with the future in uncertain and ever-changing threats.\n  I urge my colleagues to participate in the debate of this bill to the \nfullest measure desired, to come forward with such amendments that they \nmay have to improve and strengthen this bill, and hopefully to gather \ntogether and support the final and swift passage of this bill.\n  The President's budget request for defense for fiscal year 2004 \ncontinues the momentum of recent years in making real increases in \ndefense spending to sustain readiness and enhance the quality of life \nfor our military personnel and their families, and to modernize and \ntransform the U.S. Armed Forces to meet current and future threats.\n  The bill before us would provide $400.5 billion for defense, an \nincrease of $17.9 billion, or 3.2 percent in real terms, over the \namount appropriated for fiscal year 2003.\n  Since the beginning of the 108th Congress, the Armed Services \nCommittee has conducted 44 hearings and received numerous policy and \noperational briefings on the President's budget request for fiscal year \n2004 and related defense\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\nissues. As a result of these deliberations, we identified six \npriorities to guide our work on the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004.\n  First, to enhance the ability of the Department of Defense to fulfill \nits homeland defense responsibilities by providing the resources and \nthe authorities necessary for the department to assist in protecting \nthis Nation against all current and anticipated forms of attack, \nprimarily terrorist attacks, at home.\n  I mention at home, and I will repeat it several times because it is \nso important, because our President has quite wisely put as his top \npriority homeland defense. The Congress, and most particularly the \nSenate, went through long debates about the creation of the Department \nof Homeland Security which is now up and running.\n\n  Homeland defense, however, in my humble judgment, does not start here \nat home. It starts on the farflung outposts of the world on land and at \nsea where the men and women of the Armed Forces are serving. To the \nextent they can deter, interdict, and defeat imminent threats to the \nU.S., especially terrorist operations, it lessens the chances of that \noperation finding its way to homeland USA--right here at home.\n  That is my definition of homeland defense, and this bill is \nconstructed to do everything we can to equip and protect those men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces in their role of homeland defense beyond our \nshores and, indeed, their role in homeland defense, those who are \nstationed in the continental limits of the United States, Hawaii, and \nAlaska.\n  Second, to continue our committee's commitment to improving the \nquality of life for the men and women of the Armed Forces--Active, \nReserve, Guard, Retired--and their families.\n  Third, to provide the men and women in uniform with the resources, \ntraining, technology, and equipment they need to safely and \nsuccessfully perform their missions both now and in the future.\n  Fourth, to sustain the readiness of our Armed Forces to conduct the \nfull spectrum of military operations against all current and \nanticipated threats.\n  Fifth, to support the Department of Defense efforts to build the \ninnovative capabilities necessary to continue the transformation of the \nArmed Forces to enable them to successfully confront future threats, \nparticularly by enhancing technological advances in areas such as \nunmanned systems. That is an initiative on which this committee has \nplaced great emphasis for some several years now.\n  Sixth, and final, to improve the efficiency of the Department's \nprograms and operations to reduce the cost and time required to develop \nand acquire the new capabilities and needed services in the entirety of \nthis bill.\n  I will yield the floor. This is a suitable point at which I can \nreturn to my opening remarks. I assume my colleague from Michigan will \nseek recognition.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. President, for all his hard work, not only \non this bill but for the now quarter of a century we have been together \nworking on this committee. How many times we have been on the floor \ntogether on our respective bills.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I look forward to many more times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I congratulate Senator Warner for \nshepherding the Defense authorization bill to the floor again. I do not \nknow how many times he has led the effort--I lost count--but each time \nhe has handled the very difficult duties with great fairness and, I \nthink, timely, perhaps with record dispatch. He is always efficient \nand, it seems to me--and I agree with Senator Warner--this may set a \nrecord in the committee, for many of the reasons our chairman \nmentioned, including the determination that we be together totally as a \nbody in support of the men and women in the Armed Forces who are in so \nmany dangerous places in the world as we speak.\n  I also join Chairman Warner in commending all of the committee \nmembers for their hard work; our staffs, for the long hours they put in \nto produce this bill. As always, it is a complicated bill, a detailed \nbill and, more than ever perhaps, a critically important bill.\n  As we begin the consideration of this bill this afternoon, our men \nand women of the U.S. Armed Forces, both Active and Reserve who are \ndeployed in harm's way in many areas of the globe, are being subjected \nalmost daily to armed attack in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Our Armed Forces have demonstrated extraordinary military prowess. \nTheir success is a tribute first and foremost to their own skill, \ndedication, and professionalism, and to the skill of their leaders. It \nis also the result of the investments in national defense that many \nadministrations and Congresses have made over the years.\n  Our success on the battlefields of the future will depend on the \ninvestments we make today to prepare, train, and equip our military. \nThe bill provides our Armed Forces with the means they need to meet \ntoday's challenges and it makes the investments that will be needed to \nrespond to the challenges of this century.\n  It also continues the increases in compensation and quality of life \nfor our service men and women and their families.\n  Chairman Warner has described in some detail what is contained in the \nbill, and I will not attempt to duplicate his summary, but I would like \nto make a few general comments and point out a couple of matters where \nthere is a divergence of view within the committee.\n  This is a good bill. It is a balanced bill. It is balanced for many \nreasons. It equips the Armed Forces to deal with today's threats and it \nmakes the investments necessary to transform our forces to meet the \nthreats of the future. It is balanced in that it does not prematurely \nseek to apply lessons some may believe have been learned from Iraq even \nbefore the Department of Defense has had an opportunity to study and \nanalyze that conflict and to report to us on what lessons they believe \nhave been learned.\n  In his briefing of Senators in S-407 on May 8, General Franks \nspecifically noted that it would take some time to identify the lessons \nlearned from Operation Iraqi Freedom, and we could do harm to our \nnational defense if we sought to apply the wrong lessons from those \noperations or if we too speedily determined what, in fact, were the \nlessons learned.\n  The bill is also balanced in that it seeks to incorporate those \nprovisions of the Department of Defense's transformation proposals that \nprovide appropriate flexibility for the operation of the Department in \na manner that preserves congressional oversight responsibilities. For \nexample, the bill contains provisions that would repeal dozens of \nreporting requirements, establishes a new defense modernization account \nto fund life cycle cost reduction initiatives. It authorizes a pilot \nprogram to test new procedures for conducting public/private \ncompetitions. It provides the Department with special pay authority to \nhelp it fill critical positions.\n  It is also balanced because of the provisions it does not include. \nThe bill before us does not include provisions that would undermine the \nability of the uniformed military to provide independent advice to the \ncivilian chain of command, and to the Congress. It does not include \nprovisions which would undermine congressional oversight by repealing \nthe requirement that the Department of Defense provide us with basic \ninformation on the costs, schedule, and performance of major weapons \nprograms.\n  The bill before us does not authorize the reorganization of the \nDepartment of Defense without regard to statutory requirements or \nestablish a foreign military assistance program to be conducted by the \nDepartment of Defense rather than by the Department of State. The bill \ndoes not authorize the Department to move money from one program to \nanother without congressional authorization.\n\n  Perhaps the most pointed evidence of the balanced nature of this bill \nis that it was reported out of committee with the unanimous support of \nall of the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a tribute to \nthe balance of the bill but also to the leadership of our chairman.\n  That does not mean there are not any provisions in the bill on which \nthere is disagreement, because there are. There are a number of areas \nthat are troublesome and on which I expect there will\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\nbe significant debate this week. For example, there are provisions in \nreport language that move us in the direction of developing new nuclear \nweapons and modifications of current nuclear weapons. Current U.S. law \nbans research and development of new nuclear weapons that could lead to \ntheir production. The specific weapons covered by the ban are so-called \nlow yield nuclear weapons which have a nuclear explosive yield of 5 \nkilotons or less. Five kilotons is roughly a third the size of the \nnuclear bomb that was used at Hiroshima which immediately killed an \nestimated 140,000 people and left many more injured. The administration \nhas asked this ban be repealed. If the ban is repealed, the purpose is \nto make nuclear weapons more usable.\n  As stated by Linton Brooks, the administrator of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, in testimony before the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces of the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n       I have a bias in favor of the lowest usable yield because I \n     have the bias in favor of something that is the minimum \n     destruction. . . . I have a bias in favor of things that \n     might be usable.\n\n  The language approved by the majority of the Armed Services Committee \nwould repeal the ban on the development of low yield nuclear weapons. \nWithout this ban, there is no impediment in law to research, \ndevelopment, testing, production, or deployment of new low yield \nnuclear weapons.\n  The bill also provides the National Nuclear Security Administration \nwith funds the administration requested to continue work on a robust \nnuclear earth penetrator. This effort would modify one of two existing \nhigh yield nuclear weapons to create a nuclear weapon that will \npenetrate rock. Both weapons being looked at for possible modification \nare high yield nuclear weapons with yields approximating 30 and 70 \ntimes the nuclear explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb.\n  Without a requirement that that nuclear earth penetrator weapon be \nauthorized by Congress, there is no legal impediment to its \ndevelopment, testing, production, or deployment.\n  At a time when the United States is trying to dissuade other \ncountries from going forward with nuclear weapons development, when we \nstrongly oppose North Korea pulling out of the nuclear nonproliferation \ntreaty, and when we suggest that indeed we may use military force to \nprevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons, when we are \nspending billions of dollars to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, \nmaterials, and technology, these proposed actions by the administration \nwould send the opposite message we are trying to give to the world. We \nare telling others not to go down the road to nuclear weapons, but \ninstead of being a leader in the effort to prevent the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons, we are recklessly driving down that same road.\n  The United States should not follow a policy that we do not tolerate \nin others.\n  In the area of ballistic missile defense, one of the problems lies in \nwhat is not in the bill rather than what is in the bill. The missile \ndefense program continues to move along, spending billions of dollars \nwithout performance criteria. Moreover, the Department of Defense has \ncancelled plans for 9 of the 20 ground-based midcourse interceptors \nthat have been planned from 2003 to 2007. Surely we have an obligation \nto test the limited ballistic missile defense and to understand the \nextent to which it will or will not work. Yet one of the key tests the \nDepartment proposed to cancel is the most significant test. It was \nscheduled before the end of the fiscal year 2004. We restored that \nfunding in committee.\n  If we want a missile defense system that actually works, rather than \none that sits on the ground and soaks up money, we should not be \ncancelling tests. The administration actually requested that \noperational testing not be required on a limited missile defense \nsystem. We refused that request and we struck the language the \nadministration had proposed. Again, thankfully, our bill restores an \nintercept test with a missile defense program in 2004. More needs to be \ndone to assure that this system is tested adequately and proven to \nreally work. The rest of the canceled tests should be restored. There \nwill be debate on these and other areas relating to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill.\n\n  I conclude by stating, again, the bill the committee has reported out \nunder the leadership of Chairman Warner is a good bill. His leadership \nmade it happen. I commend him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan for his very fine statement, for his kind reference to the \nchairman.\n  The committee's first priority was to enhance the Department of \nDefense to fulfill its homeland defense responsibilities to combat \nterrorism both at home and abroad. In these areas, this bill authorized \nan increase of $400 million over the budget request, including $88.4 \nmillion for 12 additional civil support teams. Now, these are the teams \nthat join with the first responders should we have the misfortune of a \nweapon of mass destruction, be it chemical, biological, or fissionable, \nutilized in the United States. That is a very important initiative that \nthis committee has taken over several years now and the inclusion of \nthis in the budget represents our strong unequivocal support of this \nprogram particularly by adding 12 additional teams, to get us closer to \nthe goal of a team in every State and territory.\n  Likewise, we added $181 million for the development and fielding of \nchemical and biological agent detection and protection technology. In \naddition, the committee supports the President's request of $9.1 \nbillion for missile defense, a key component of homeland defense.\n  As we all know, our most valuable military asset is our people. We \nwill always fulfill our commitment to improve the quality of life of \nthe men and women in uniform and their families. This bill authorizes a \n3.7-percent across-the-board pay increase for all uniformed service \npersonnel as well as a targeted pay raise of up to 6.25 percent for \ncertain senior noncommissioned officers and midcareer personnel. Those \nprovisions are necessary in order for the Armed Forces to compete with \nthe pay scales and the job opportunities in the private sector.\n  This bill also contains several key provisions to recognize unique \nsacrifices of the members of the Armed Forces and their families, \nincluding increases in the family separation allowance and hostile fire \npay, designation of assignment incentive pay for those stationed in \nKorea, and approval of a ``high tempo'' allowance for those service \nmembers deployed away from home for extended periods of time. We have \nexperienced this, particularly in the Navy.\n  I hope these provisions are acceptable to the Department of Defense. \nWe are still working our way through that at this particular time.\n  The services all try very hard to limit the time of deployment away \nfrom home, particularly unaccompanied tours, for our service members, \nbut there are isolated cases where you simply go beyond those times. \nOne was recent, with a carrier setting one of the longest records in \ncontemporary history for the away-from-home deployment of a carrier and \nits crew.\n  The administration requested $9 billion for military construction and \nfamily housing due to pending realignments of overseas bases. This bill \ncontains adjustments to the administration program which resulted in \nincreased investment in installations in the United States and a \nreduced but prudent investment in overseas locations that will be of \nlong-term value to the United States.\n  This bill contains an overall increase of approximately $400 million \nin military construction, including increases of over $200 million in \nquality-of-life projects such as barracks, family housing, and child \ndevelopment centers.\n\n  Over the past several years, my colleagues and I have encouraged the \nDepartment to increase procurement spending to a level that could \nsustain the timely recapitalization, modernization, and transformation \nof the Armed Forces. This year, the bill before the Senate authorizes \n$75.6 billion in procurement funding, a $1.1 billion increase over the \nbudget request. Key procurement items include over $12 billion in \nshipbuilding and conversions which will fund seven new ships just for \nthe year 2004. That is in keeping with the Chief of Naval Operations's \ncommitment to this body last year\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\nthat he, in conjunction with the whole Navy Secretariat, would increase \nthe number of ships--not a very large number, but it is an increase \nover the past.\n  Further, we have the continued investment in aircraft programs, such \nas $3.5 billion for 20 F/A-22 Raptor aircraft and over $2 billion for \n11 additional C-17 lift aircraft; and over $1 billion for the Army's \nlighter, high-mobility stryker combat vehicle.\n  Additionally, it is critical we invest in future capability. This \nbill authorizes $63.2 billion for research and development, test and \nevaluation, activities, an increase of over $1.3 billion over the \nPresident's budget request. Key R funding items include $1.7 billion \nfor the future combat system, the Army's centerpiece of transformation, \n$5.8 billion for development of various tactical aircraft, including \n$4.4 billion for the continued development of the joint strike fighter, \nand $10.7 billion for advanced science and technology initiatives, an \nincrease of over $500 million over the budget request.\n  This committee has strongly encouraged the Department to invest in \nunmanned systems. This bill fully funds the budget request of $1.7 \nbillion for major unmanned aerial vehicle programs and adds $130 \nbillion to enhance unmanned technologies.\n  Together, the investments in procurement necessary to sustain current \ncapabilities and research and development needed to transform to a more \ncapable force would give the men and women of the Armed Forces the \nequipment they need to deter threats, and if deterrence fails, to \nprevail across the full spectrum of military operations both now and in \nthe future.\n  The sustained readiness of the Armed Forces is what protects America. \nThe success of recent military operations represents the real return on \nadded investments made by the Congress in recent years in training, \nmunitions, maintenance, and spare parts. As the force reconstitutes \nafter operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, we must closely monitor \nwhether additional funds are needed for those items not covered by \nsupplemental funding to pay for these operations and to ensure the \noverall readiness of the Armed Forces.\n  Readiness accounts funds were increased to address currently \nidentified shortfalls such as equipment maintenance and testing, depot \nmaintenance, technical assistance, corrosion control, and systems \ntesting as well as additional funding for Active and Reserve Forces to \naccelerate fielding and replacing personal and field equipment.\n  Transformation of the Department of Defense will depend on effective \nmanagement and stewardship of DOD resources. This bill contains \nnumerous legislative provisions to improve the management of the \nDepartment. Some of these provisions will streamline the acquisition \nprocess, provide for greater personnel flexibility to manage the \nacquisition workforce, and ensure that joint requirements can be more \nrapidly achieved. Acquisition authorities to facilitate the war on \nterrorism, and support contingency operations were extended, and \nproposed new authorities will give State and local governments rapid \naccess to antiterrorism technologies and services available to the \nDepartment. Again, that is another very important contribution to \nhomeland defense.\n\n  The Department of Defense and the Congress have been and must \ncontinue to be good stewards of the environment. Military readiness and \nprudent conservation can and must be complementary principles. This \nbill assures access to military training ranges in a way that \nsafeguards the protection of endangered species and contributes to the \nreadiness of the Armed Forces.\n  Some will argue we have not covered all the subjects that were \nbrought before the committee. Indeed, the committee did delete a number \nof items from the President's request, but that is the judgment that \nthe committee must render. We are an independent but coequal branch of \nthe Federal Government. While we have great respect for the President's \nbudget, some of those provisions were deleted from his budget and not \nincorporated in this bill.\n  While I am proud of this legislation and the remarkable spirit of \nbipartisanship that enabled our committee to move this bill to the \nfloor, we did have areas of disagreement within the committee, which \nwill be revisited during the floor debate.\n  With our Armed Forces poised on distant battlefields and countless \nothers standing watch at home, we are committed to providing the \nresources needed for the men and women of the armed forces, and their \nfamilies. The Congress's past support for increased defense spending \nhas proven to be a wise investment. There is no greater evidence than \nthe successes witnessed on the battlefield of Iraq.\n  I strongly believe that this National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2004 builds on the advances made in recent years. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in sending a strong message of bipartisan support \nfor our troops at home and abroad: we honor your service, and we stand \nwith you now, and in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know the Senator from Massachusetts wished to speak. Is \nSenator Collins ready to go? Perhaps the Chair could recognize whoever \nis ready to go.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I was trying to defer to my more senior colleague but, \nof course, I would be delighted to have the opportunity to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nwho, as always, is extremely gracious, and the Senator from Michigan, \nfor allowing me to proceed, and the chairman of our distinguished \ncommittee.\n  Madam President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 2004 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. As a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation \nto the chairman and the ranking member for their extraordinary efforts \nin producing this bill. The mark-up of this legislation was conducted \nin a true spirit of cooperation. While certain portions of this bill \nengendered spirited debate, the points of controversy are relatively \nfew. It is tribute to both Senator Warner and Senator Levin that we \ncompleted our mark-up in a remarkably short period of time.\n  This legislation includes authorization for the vital resources that \nthe young men and women in our military require in defending our \nNation. With terrorist attacks continuing across the globe, and our \ntroops helping the Iraqi people to rebuild their country, this \nlegislation will ensure that our military has the tools necessary to \nfight, and ultimately win, the war against terrorism.\n  Since joining the Armed Services Committee, I have been a member of \nthe Personnel Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over military pay, \nhousing, and health care. In recent years, we have made tremendous \nprogress in improving the quality of life not just for our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines, but also for their families. That is \nimportant. The old saying goes: we recruit the soldier but we retain \nthe family. When our troops deploy, it's important that they have the \npeace of mind that comes from the knowledge that their families have \ngood housing, quality health care, and a support network to help \naddress any problems.\n  I am proud that the legislation before us builds on the efforts that \nwe have made in previous years to ensure that our troops are the best \npaid, best housed, and best equipped in the world. It includes a 3.7 \npercent across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed personnel, and \nincorporates a targeted pay raise ranging from 5.25 percent to 6.25 \npercent for mid-career service members. We want to make an extra effort \nto retain their expertise. It also authorizes a significant increase in \nthe rate of family separation allowance, from $100 per month to $250 \nper month.\n  There are two provisions affecting pay and benefits that I believe \nare particularly important. Last month, along with the majority leader \nand a number of my colleagues, I traveled to South Korea to meet with \nour troops at Osan Air Force Base and in the Demilitarized Zone. I was \nprivileged to speak with two of my constituents, SS Jennifer Meuth of \nThomaston and MS Jay Mason of China. As I always do when I meet with \nour troops, I asked if there was anything that the Congress could do to \nsupport them. Without hesitation, both of them asked me to support the \nestablishment of Assignment\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nPay for troops stationed in Korea. Our troops endure many hardships as \npart of their service in Korea. Most are separated from their families, \nthe housing is often substandard, and they live under the constant \nthreat of North Korean aggression.\n  I am proud to say that the legislation before us mandates the payment \nof $100 per month in assignment incentive pay to the brave men and \nwomen serving our Nation in Korea. It is a tribute to the leadership of \nSenator Saxby Chambliss and Senator Ben Nelson, who lead the Personnel \nSubcommittee. Most of all, I want to thank Sergeants Meuth and Mason \nfor bringing this important issue to my attention.\n  The second provision that I want to highlight is a bill that I \nintroduced this year calling for an increase in what is called the \nmilitary death gratuity. Currently, when a servicemember is killed \nwhile on active duty, his or her family receives a payment of $6,000, \nusually within days after the death. While other long-term financial \nassistance is provided to support the family, this payment helps the \nsurvivors cover any short term expenses.\n  The bill I introduced earlier this year, S. 704, would increase this \namount to $12,000 and make it retroactive to September 11, 2001. So the \nfamilies of those troops killed in Afghanistan will receive this \nadditional benefit. The last time the Congress raised the death \ngratuity was during that last gulf war over a decade ago. Recognizing \nthe importance of this issue, the Senate moved very quickly earlier \nthis year to pass my legislation as a free-standing bill. The House, \nhowever, has not yet acted upon it. I am grateful to the Chairman of \nthe Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Chambliss, for incorporating this \nincrease in the death gratuity in the Defense Authorization bill.\n  I would also like to express my congratulations to Senator Talent, \nthe new Chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee. The shipbuilding portion \nof this year's Defense Authorization represents a significant turning \npoint. In previous years, the budget for ship construction proposed by \nthe Department of Defense has been inadequate to sustain a large enough \nfleet to meet our Nation's requirements. The legislation before us \ntoday recognizes the challenge, and provides critically needed \nincreases in shipbuilding funds.\n  It authorizes the construction of seven new ships, including three \nDDG-51 destroyers. I am pleased to report that two of those destroyers \nwill be built at the world famous Bath Iron Works in my home State of \nMaine. Certainly, it will take more than 1 year's progress to address \nyears of funding shortfalls. But this bill surely represents \nsignificant progress.\n  The committee also recognized the importance of modernizing the DDG-\n51 destroyers currently in the fleet. At my request, $20 million has \nbeen allocated for a DDG-51 modernization program. This funding will be \nused to examine ways to improve the effectiveness of these ships, while \nat the same time reducing their manpower requirements. That in turn \nwill lead to lifetime savings for these ships. It will allow the Bath \nIron Works to explore initiatives aimed at ensuring that these \ndestroyers continue to be the backbone of our surface combatant fleet.\n  The seapower portion of the bill also includes $248 million for the \nrefueling and overhaul of the USS Jacksonville, a nuclear submarine \nthat had been scheduled to be decommissioned by the Navy. If this were \nallowed to occur, the problem is that our submarine force would fall \nbelow the levels recommended by the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review. \nToday, the requirements for submarines is increasing, especially given \nthe growing role that they play in intelligence gathering. This \nrefueling, which will take place at the Kittery-Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard, will add years of useful life to the Jacksonville. It is good \nnews for the Navy, and it is good news for the skilled workers at the \nshipyard.\n  Without question, some aspects of the bill reported from the Armed \nServices Committee are somewhat controversial, and I expect that they \nwill be debated fully here on the Senate floor. But the overwhelming \nmajority of this bill is the product of bipartisan consensus. There is \nan agreement that we should spare no resources in ensuring that the \nbrave young men and women who proudly wear the uniform have the highest \nquality training available, the most advanced equipment in the world, \nand receive the best benefits we can offer. I am proud to say this bill \naccomplishes those goals.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to our chairman and our ranking \nmember for their hard work and for their dedicated leadership. I am \nvery proud to serve with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, on behalf of the whole committee, I \nexpress appreciation to our colleague from Maine. She no longer will be \nsubcommittee chairman on our committee because she is the full chairman \nnow of one of the major subcommittees of the Senate as a whole, but she \nis very active.\n  I wonder if I might ask the distinguished Senator from Maine, the \nissue of transformation by the Secretary of Defense was addressed in \nthe House and to some extent addressed by our committee. But basically, \nthe committee over which the distinguished Senator from Maine is \nchairman has the primary oversight responsibilities. In the course of \nthe debate on the floor, I hope--if not now at some point--she will \ngive some guidance to me as to how this committee can address such \namendments as may be brought up in the context of responsibilities of \nour committee. If she could find some time to consult with me on that, \nI would be very appreciative, as will the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, if I could respond to the inquiry of \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee, during the past several \nweeks, since the Secretary sent his plan to the Hill, my staff, in \nclose cooperation with other staff members on the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, including Senator Levin's committee staff and \nothers, have been working to see if we could reach consensus on a \nproposal. Frankly, I believe the Secretary's initial proposal goes too \nfar. It is overreaching.\n  But there are certain authorities that would be extremely helpful to \nthe Secretary as he attempts to make sure we can reward civilian \nemployees with higher pay and streamline the personnel process. We came \nup with a proposal. We are still assessing the import that the proposal \nmight have. In addition, there may be some procedural barriers in our \nability to bring forward the amendments. So we are continuing to work \nclosely to see if we can come up with a consensus. I hope to have an \nanswer shortly for the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our colleague on this point. But \nbear in mind that there are some in the House bill. We will have to \ndeal with them in conference.\n  To the extent we can have any interlocking on this bill with those \nprovisions of the House bill, which the Senator's committee and our \ncommittee and the Senate as a whole feels should be incorporated into \nthe bill, it would be helpful to do that.\n  I think in general the Secretary of Defense is on the right track in \nthe sense that when you stop to think, today's military is so different \nthan it was 2 or 3 years or even a decade ago.\n  As I mentioned earlier, before the Senator from Maine joined us on \nthe floor, the total force today is not only the uniformed men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, they are very much part of the civilian \nforce. There are thousands of civilians over in the Iraqi situation and \nin Afghanistan right now taking risks commensurate with those of \nuniformed personnel and performing services to give infrastructure to \nthe military to do their missions.\n  The Secretary of Defense has to have some flexibility in how he \nassigns and reassigns civilian personnel. I hope we could achieve some \nmeasure commensurate with what the wisdom of the Congress enabled the \nSecretary of Homeland Defense to have. It seems to me that is sort of \nthe bar at which we ought to look.\n\n  Might I inquire, does the Senator share views similar to the Senator \nfrom Virginia?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I do. The Senator from Virginia has put it very well, \nand I am eager to craft legislation--and believe we have done so--that \nwould give the Secretary the flexibility he needs for the Department to \nhave an efficient,\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\neffective, and fair personnel system for the civilian employees. I \nnote, however, that the Department has some 700,000 civilian employees. \nSo we need to make sure we are doing this in an appropriate manner. \nSome of the provisions submitted by the Secretary go far beyond the \nauthority that we gave to the new Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  So we are looking at it, and we have come up with draft legislation \nlanguage that we are sharing and have been sharing with the staff of \nthe Senator from Virginia and with other interested parties. My hope--\nit may be a vague hope--is that we could have a consensus document that \nwould provide bipartisan support and the support of some of the \nemployee organizations. I don't know whether that is going to be the \ncase. But that certainly is my hope.\n  If I might make one other point, I simply point out the obvious to \nall of us--that this legislation is the train moving through at this \npoint in time. The probability of its passage by the Chamber is quite \nhigh. These provisions, as the Senator says, are of great concern to \nthose groups, whether they are union or other groups, that act on \nbehalf of the very courageous and wonderful cadre of civilians without \nwhich we couldn't have a defense.\n  The likelihood of a separate bill moving forward at a later point in \nthis session has a question mark, which is obvious to my colleague from \nMaine and my colleague from Michigan. To the extent we can reach some \nconsensus and attach it to this bill is the extent to which maybe we \ncan make some progress at this point in a timely likelihood of making \nprogress at this point in time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield before yielding \nthe floor just for a question?\n  First of all, I join my good friend from Virginia in commending the \nSenator from Maine for her great work in both our committee and also as \nchair of the Governmental Affairs Committee where she is doing an \nabsolutely superb job. Part of that job is to take a look at proposals \nthat are as far-reaching as the one that was very suddenly dropped upon \nus by the Department of Defense.\n  This is a far-reaching proposal. We have had very little time, as \nthese matters go, to look at it. This Senate is a body which \ndeliberates over these kinds of changes. I would hope that we would, \nNo. 1, try to fashion a draft for consideration which would give \ngreater flexibility--and I know Senator Collins is working extremely \nhard to do just that--but I also commend her for her caution, it seems \nto me, in saying that we are going to put together a draft and then we \nare going to propose it. Because there are some procedures which really \nshould be followed here to protect the men and women in our civilian \nforce, just the way we have those procedures for our uniformed forces.\n  The quality of life, which we talk about all the time and we try to \nprotect, is important, surely, for our uniformed men and women, but it \nis also important for the civilians, and they are entitled to have a \nproposal which they can look at, which they can comment on, and not one \nwhich is just suddenly sprung upon them by the Congress, whether it is \nthe House, which acted very quickly on this far-ranging proposal, or by \nthe Senate.\n  So I want to just suggest that we try to arrive at something which \ndoes give greater flexibility, but we do so in a way which shows the \nkind of deliberation and the kind of consideration which this body has \nbeen renowned for and which I know both my colleagues have been very \nsupportive of throughout their careers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues. But before we \nconclude this very valuable and important colloquy, I ask the Senator \nfrom Maine, who speaks with such conviction if we are going try to do \nsomething on this bill or is the thought that it is just not \nachievable? Because we have an issue with the House right now.\n  And the question is, are we going to address that issue in part--\nmaybe not all, but in part--in such a way that we can do constructive \nadvancements in this field to assist the Secretary and the \nadministration in this enormous Department with a diversity of \nresponsibilities? Can we conclude we are going to give it a try, and \nthat would move it along pretty quickly? Because hopefully this bill \nwill be voted on early this week.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nVirginia, the chairman of the committee, we have been working for many \nweeks. We do have a draft. We have had come forth from the other side \nof the aisle some additional suggestions we are looking at and eager to \nincorporate. I personally think it would be good to add something to \nthis bill because I think it would be good for the Senate to go on \nrecord with its own version which differs from what was done in the \nHouse.\n  So I think it strengthens the position of the Senate in conference \nfor us to put forth our own proposal since, as the Senator points out, \nthis issue is going to arise in conference given the House provisions. \nSo it is not as if it is going to be left to another day. We have \nlegislative language drafted. We have been meeting extensively during \nthe last few weeks. On Friday we received some additional suggestions \nwhich we are looking at right now. I cannot predict for certain--I \nrealize time is short--whether there will be bipartisan support for the \nfinal version, but there will be a version I am happy with. I do not \nknow if that will be sufficient, however.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I will have one more word, but I yield--not necessarily \nyield--to my colleague from Michigan if he wishes to reply to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think one of the important words in the question asked \nby the Senator from Virginia is the word ``constructively.'' I would \njust add the word ``fairly.'' So if we can do something that is \nconstructive and fair for the people impacted----\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It seems to me we ought to give it a try. Those are \nimportant conditions, in my book.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do you think the provisions the Congress provided for in \nthe Department of Homeland Security offer certain precedents we should \nachieve in this legislation?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There were precedents of many varieties, some good, some \nnot so good.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, as both my colleagues recognize, this will be, for \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan and myself, our 25th \nconference, and we know full well at this stage of deliberations on \nthis bill we cannot predict what is going to come out of conference, \nnor can we take a stance that not one single one of these provisions \nwhich are in the House bill will not survive the conference. So having \nsaid that, time is of the essence, I hope, in the reconciliation of \nviews.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman. And again I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments in \nthe exchange between the Senator from Maine and our chairman and \nranking member. I have heard through the outreaches of the Senator from \nMaine there has been a good-faith effort to try to deal with this \nissue. I am not carefully briefed on the various proposals, but at \nleast there has been an outreach by the Senator from Maine to try to \ndevelop some common ground in this area. So I think this is important.\n  I think the seriousness with which she is addressing this issue, as \nwell as the chairman and the ranking member, is, of course, of enormous \nimportance because basically we are talking about the 650,000 to \n700,000 civilians who work in the Defense Department. The basic concept \nwas the development of the civil service so that we were going to have \nhighly skilled, highly motivated, highly trained individuals who were \ngoing to work for all Americans and not be working for political \nparties, so to speak, not finding out, every time there is a change in \nadministration, there could be a change in the way they are compensated \nfor their work.\n  This is enormously important work. We are finding individuals who are \ngoing to be involved in the selection of various weapons systems in the \nwhole areas of the development of command and control, communication, \nand intelligence. The jobs of many of these civilians are enormously \nimportant in terms of the security interests of this country.\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\n  So the caution which has been expressed by our chairman and ranking \nmember, as well as by the Senator from Maine, is entirely appropriate. \nIt is certainly reasonable to always try to find ways of strengthening \nand improving the system. But we do come back to the question that this \nwas developed initially with all the kinds of challenges it is facing \nnow, with the concept that we would have highly motivated, highly \ntrained individuals, who would serve whatever administration was going \nto be successful at the polls. I think that basic and fundamental view \nis still a commendable one.\n  But I just want to indicate to the Senator, my friend from Maine, \nthat she has approached this as she does all issues, with an openness \nand commitment and determination to try to make a very constructive \ncontribution, and she has certainly been reaching out to the Members. \nSo I am thankful for those efforts.\n  I am also concerned about contracting out, and that we are going to \nfind those with the best lobbying opportunities are going to be able to \nget these contracts that are important and require high-quality work.\n  Mr. President, as we begin considering the fiscal year 2004 defense \nauthorization bill, I, too, congratulate Chairman Warner and Senator \nLevin for their skillful leadership in preparing this bill. It does \nreflect a thoughtful response to the ongoing and changing needs of our \nmilitary in these difficult years for our country, and it clearly \nprovides a strong national defense.\n  I also thank and commend Senator Talent for his leadership on the \nseapower portions of the bill in his first year as the chairman of the \nSeapower Subcommittee. It is a privilege to work with him on that \nsubcommittee, and I look forward to continuing that work in the years \nahead to make sure we are going to keep our Navy strong, and, of \ncourse, the Marines strong as well.\n  In particular, this legislation contains numerous provisions to give \nadditional support to the men and women who serve the Nation so well in \nthe Armed Forces. Without their courage and their commitment, we could \nnever achieve the brilliant military successes of the war in Iraq.\n  First, and most important, this bill is intended to improve the \nquality-of-life programs our soldiers and sailors and marines and \nmembers of the Air Force deserve in the areas of pay and allowance. It \nrecognizes the special sacrifice military service often requires from \nthe service members and their families.\n  For service members who are repeatedly deployed to assignments far \nfrom their home bases, including Reservists and Guard personnel, the \nbill authorizes a high deployment allowance, up to $1,000 a month in \nadditional compensation for the hardships imposed on them and their \nfamilies. The bill also continues support for the significant progress \nmade in the past 4 years in reducing out-of-pocket housing expenses by \nimproving the basic allowance for housing, and the bill also provides \nfor strong national defense in the years ahead by investing in \ntransformational technologies while ensuring that our military \ncapabilities do not suffer any gap during the needed modernization that \nmust take place in our forces.\n  My principal concern with this legislation involves the provisions \nthat authorize the fateful change of course in our longstanding policy \non nuclear weapons. Of all challenges our country has faced over the \npast half century, the prevention of nuclear war is by far the most \nimportant. It is no accident that in all the years and the half century \nsince World War II, no nuclear weapon has ever been used in any of the \nconflicts that have taken place anywhere on Earth. Few in 1945 would \nhave predicted that extraordinary success, and few today would disagree \nthat the effective world leadership of the United States under \nPresidents of both political parties on nuclear arms control throughout \nthose years has been primarily responsible for that success.\n  The danger today is that with the passing of the World War II \ngeneration in our own country and nations throughout the world, a new \ngeneration of leaders has been rising to power who did not live through \nthe dawn of the nuclear age themselves and for whom the mushroom clouds \nover Hiroshima and Nagasaki are images from history, not vivid \nrecollections from their own lives. Greater vigilance is clearly needed \nto continue the success of our nuclear arms control policy since 1945 \nand ensure that nuclear weapons are not used by any nation in the \nfuture.\n  Preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear \nmaterials to other nations and to terrorists is the most urgent aspect \nof that challenge today. We all pray the Bush administration will be \nsuccessful in the current negotiations with North Korea and that the \ntenuous progress made in recent weeks will improve so a successful \nconclusion can be achieved.\n  Many of us are increasingly concerned, however, that with Congress \nand the Nation preoccupied over the past year with the war against \nterrorism and the war in Iraq that the administration has been quietly \nlaying the groundwork for a far-reaching and highly dangerous U turn in \nour longstanding policy against the first use of nuclear weapons.\n  Because of their unique and massive destructive power, nuclear \nweapons have always been kept separate from other weapons as part of \nour strong commitment to do all we can to see they are never used \nagain. The Bush administration's proposal to veer away from that \ncommitment should have been a wake-up call for Congress and the Nation \nmany months ago.\n  In the decade after the first two nuclear bombs were used in World \nWar II and the nuclear arms race began with the Soviet Union, nations \nand peoples throughout the world began to realize both the danger posed \nby the use of nuclear weapons and the danger from the testing of \nnuclear weapons. To deal with those dangers, a remarkable series of \ninternational treaties was proposed, negotiated, and approved that had \nbroad support in the world community, restrained the nuclear arms race \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, and dramatically \nreduced the spread of nuclear weapons to other nations.\n\n  An excellent chronology of the many significant events in the history \nof nuclear weapons, beginning with the discovery of radioactivity in \n1896, is available on the Web sites of the Global Security Institute \nwhich was founded by our former colleague Senator Alan Cranston to \nenhance our understanding of these issues. I urge Members of the Senate \nto consult with it.\n  One of the landmark achievements in reducing the spread of nuclear \nweapons was the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty which came into effect \nin 1968 and under which nuclear and nonnuclear nations alike agreed to \nhalt the development of these weapons. Currently 185 nations have \nsigned the extension of the NPT. The reason the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty has been so successful is the presumption that \nnuclear weapons will not be used by the principal nuclear powers except \nin the most extreme circumstances. For 25 years Republican and \nDemocratic administrations alike have emphasized our commitment not to \nuse nuclear weapons against nonnuclear nations. This assurance to other \nnations that nuclear weapons will not be used against them has been a \nmajor factor in avoiding nuclear war, slowing the nuclear arms race, \nand preventing the proliferation of these weapons to other countries \nand to terrorists.\n  Control of current nuclear stockpiles is especially critical. The \ndanger is very real that terrorists may be able to acquire nuclear \nmaterial or even nuclear warheads. Even before 9/11, Congress and the \nadministration had recognized this significant threat and, under the \nleadership of our former colleague Senator Nunn and our colleague \nSenator Lugar, we enacted a threat reduction program in 1991 to \nsafeguard and reduce the nuclear arsenals of Russia and other former \nSoviet states. The Nunn-Lugar program has been effective in \ndeactivating or destroying literally thousands of nuclear warheads and \nintercontinental ballistic missiles and hundreds of tons of fissionable \nmaterial. Nevertheless, we have done far from enough to prevent the \nproliferation of these weapons.\n  Shortly before President Bush's inauguration, a task force reported \nthat the most urgent national security threat to the United States \ntoday is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weapons-usable \nmaterial in Russia could be stolen, sold to terrorists, or\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\nhostile nation states, and used against American troops abroad or \ncitizens at home. The 9/11 terrorists clearly demonstrated their \nwillingness and ability to cause catastrophic damage to America. Yet \nthe Bush administration continues to spend less on the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram than we did before 2001.\n  In January of 2002, the administration released a nuclear posture \nreview that could take us in a new and far more dangerous direction. \nThe review blurs the line between conventional and nuclear weapons. It \nsuggests that certain events might compel the United States to use \nnuclear weapons first, even against nonnuclear nations. It also relies \nmuch more heavily on a nuclear threat by America in dealing with the \ndifficult challenges we face in the world. The administration has even \nindicated it might use nuclear weapons in response to a chemical or \nbiological attack. There is no justification for that kind of \nescalation. Our conventional weapons are more than adequate to deal \nwith that threat. We gain no greater deterrence by threatening to go \nnuclear. It makes no sense to break down the firewall we have always \nmaintained between nuclear weapons and other weapons and that has \nsucceeded so well for so long in preventing nuclear war. Other nations \nhave complied with this basic principle, too. A nuclear weapon is not \njust another item in our arsenal, and it is wrong to treat it as if it \nwere. In fact, the Nuclear Posture Review specifically discusses \ncircumstances in which the United States might engage in the first use \nof nuclear weapons, such as a North Korean attack on South Korea, or a \nmilitary confrontation over the status of Taiwan.\n\n  The administration also appeared to be considering the use of nuclear \nweapons against Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. We reap what we sow. If \nwe brandish our own nuclear weapons, we only encourage other nations to \ndo all they can to develop their own.\n  It is ominous as well that the administration is asking the Nation's \nweapons laboratories to consider the possibility of resuming nuclear \ntesting in order to protect our current stockpile and meet new \nrequirements in the future. They want funds in the budget to be used to \nprepare for testing new nuclear weapons and to cut in half the time \nneeded to do so. They have asked the Department to consider global \nstrike capabilities with new nuclear weapons, which would have to be \ntested as well. It makes no sense to abandon our moratorium on nuclear \ntesting. That moratorium has stood for over a decade, and it has served \nus well.\n  The pending bill continues this dangerous shift in other ways as \nwell. Last year, the administration received $15 billion. The current \nbill proposes another $15 billion this year to study the feasibility of \nmodifying existing warheads to create what they call a robust nuclear \nearth penetrator, a bunker buster, with 10 times the size of the \nHiroshima blast, to be used to destroy hardened enemy targets buried \ndeeply underground. It is difficult to believe that any administration \nin its right mind would propose such a weapon. A nuclear explosion in a \nbunker could spew tons of radioactive waste into the atmosphere, with a \ndevastating plume that could poison huge areas in its path. Surely, if \nthere is any need for such a weapon, we can develop a conventional \nweapon to achieve the purpose of the bunker buster.\n  In yet another far-out nuclear proposal, the Bush administration has \nproposed to lift the current statutory ban on low-yield nuclear \nweapons, which now prevents the development of weapons with yields \nunder 5 kilotons--about half the size of the Hiroshima blast. The \nprecision-guided conventional munitions and standoff weapons we have \ntoday make these many nukes unnecessary. They would be no more \neffective than conventional munitions and would be far more dangerous \nto our troops and to our planet.\n  In the debate in recent weeks on tax policy, President Bush has \ncriticized the Senate and come out strongly against what he called \n``iddy-biddy'' tax cuts. What we should be really against is iddy-biddy \nnukes.\n  The hardliners in the Bush administration seem to believe that the \nlongstanding firewall between nuclear and conventional weapons is \nobsolete and is making us more vulnerable to nuclear blackmail. They \nclaim that lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons will make \nour own nuclear threat a stronger and more credible deterrent. That is \nthe last thing we need.\n  The clear and present danger of the administration's change in \nnuclear policy is that it will encourage other nations to develop \nnuclear deterrents of their own. The entire world will be at greater \nrisk that these weapons will be used--and used against us.\n\n  Unfortunately, the real debate on these all-important issues of \nnuclear policy is only just beginning. Certainly, these issues demand \nfar more attention than Congress and the country have been giving them. \nThey have been eclipsed for too long by the war on terrorism and the \nwar against Iraq. We can ignore them no longer. We have an obligation \nto our Nation and our people, and to all nations and all peoples, to \nsee that nuclear weapons are never used again.\n  In the debate in the coming days, I intend to offer an amendment to \nmaintain the firewall between conventional and nuclear weapons. It \nstrikes the provision repealing the prohibition on low-yield nuclear \nweapons that was put in place in the 1994 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. That act prohibits research, testing, and \ndevelopment on low-yield nuclear weapons, and there is no reason to \nweaken it.\n  Some suggest we should compromise and allow at least a little \nresearch. I say to the Senate, don't let the administration even start \ndown that road. Don't feed the nuclear addiction. It is essential to \ncontinue to prohibit even the research on any such weapons. We do not \nwant our descendents, surveying a devastated planet, to say that in \nthis legislation the United States breached this firewall and took the \ndecisive, shameful step that led to nuclear war.\n\n\n                    Unanimous Consent Request S. 923\n\n  Mr. President, our men and women in uniform are committed to \nprotecting the security of our Nation. They work hard and make \nsacrifices every day. And they are willing to give their lives for the \ncountry.\n  As many begin to return from Iraq and other places abroad, we owe it \nto them to protect their economic security and the economic security of \nour Nation.\n  These heroes are coming home to a failing economy--and for too many a \nloss of jobs. Today, more than 18,000 veterans are out of work. These \nare our Nation's fighting men and women, returning from Iraq, or who \nfought in the last gulf war. We owe it to them to protect them and \ntheir families' livelihood.\n  President Bush claims that tax cuts for the rich will create the jobs \nthese former service men and women need. But we tried the Bush \nadministration's approach in 2001, and we lost 2.5 million jobs. \nSurely, we can do better for our returning troops who are now trying to \nrejoin civilian life. We can do better for all Americans who are \nwithout jobs in this recession.\n  Today, nearly 9 million Americans are unemployed--2.8 million more \nthan when President Bush first took office. This widespread \nunemployment has touched so many American lives, and it often seems the \nbiggest in the face of those who have served their Nation in the Armed \nForces.\n  There is good news for some. The law requires employers to take back \nreservists after their deployments. Many of the men and women currently \nin or returning from Iraq will continue their service in our Armed \nForces. But too many recently discharged service members are facing the \nsame fate as millions of other Americans--they just cannot find jobs.\n\n  We have an opportunity to extend the benefits for these brave \nAmericans. We have an opportunity to make sure those ex-service members \nwho still cannot find work after 9 months--the long-suffering and long-\nterm unemployed--are not left without a safety net. They put years of \ntheir lives into serving their country. Now unemployed after only 9 \nmonths, we are going to say: Sorry, you have been out of work too long. \nWe are going to stop your unemployment checks.\n  We must not, and we cannot, do that to these workers. We must ensure \nthat those long-term unemployed continue to receive unemployment checks \nso they can meet their mortgages, put food on the table, and take care \nof their children.\n  The American people understand fairness. They understand that with\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\none hand we are providing billions of dollars to the wealthiest \nindividuals in this country, and we ought to extend the other hand to \nour hard-working men and women who played by the rules, worked all \ntheir lives, and paid into the unemployment compensation fund. They \nneed that assistance now.\n  For 80,000 workers a week, unemployment checks will stop coming at \nthe end of this month if we take no action whatsoever--80,000 who have \npaid into the unemployment compensation fund, which currently has in it \nover $20 billion.\n  Unemployment benefits are a lifeline available for millions of hard-\nworking Americans. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan politics \nand join to assist the unemployed--just as we have during recession for \nthe past 50 years. We know the extension of unemployment compensation \nhas been supported by President Reagan, President Nixon, President \nEisenhower, as well as President Kennedy, President Clinton, President \nBush, and President Ford--all of them. In the 5 years in the 1990s when \nwe extended it, it had strong bipartisan support. Four of those votes \nwere in excess of 90 votes. We want to take that same kind of action. \nWe want to take it this evening before we go off for a Memorial Day \nrecess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 923, a bill to provide for \na 6-month extension of unemployment compensation, including 13 weeks of \nbenefits for the long-term unemployed--exhaus- \ntees--and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration; \nthat the amendment that is at the desk to remove the temporary enhanced \nregular unemployment compensation provisions be considered and agreed \nto; that the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object. We have only had a few moments to consider \nthis Mr. President. We did not know the request was going to be \noffered. I register an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hear the objection on the other side. \nAction is needed in these several days. Some 80,000 of our fellow \ncitizens starting next week will begin to lose all of their coverage, \nfor which they have paid into the fund.\n  This is a deplorable situation certainly for those Americans, and I \nthink for all Americans. We are going to continue this battle \nthroughout this week and beyond. I have heard an objection voiced.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and look forward to \nmaking some comments on the Defense bill. In previous years, I have \nbeen honored to work with Senator Kennedy on the Seapower Subcommittee \nwhen he was chairman, and when I was able to chair the subcommittee. I \nwill admit, he remained on message. We are on the Defense bill and \nsomehow we segued into unemployment benefits. I think we would do well \nto stay on this Defense bill.\n  Briefly, Mr. President, we did talk about the nuclear posture of the \nUnited States. President Bush has proposed a reduction in nuclear \nweapons that is, in fact, reducing American nuclear weapons by one-\nhalf. That is a good direction.\n  Oddly, we remain the only nuclear power in the world that does not \nhave the capacity at this point to build another nuclear weapon. Other \nnations are either building nuclear weapons or have the capability and \nhave not eliminated it. First of all it would be unwise, in my view, to \nfreeze ourselves at a low number and never be able to increase it, \nwhich simply sets out a target that any nation in the world, if they \ncould reach that number, would then be a nuclear power on parity with \nthe United States. We do not need to do that.\n  I think the President is wise to not renounce unequivocally that he \nwould never use a nuclear weapon before it has been used on us, \nparticularly when people have the ability to threaten us with \nbiological and chemical weapons that could cause even more loss of life \nthan a single nuclear weapon. We need to keep our poise here. The \nPresident is reducing nuclear weapons. He is not expanding our number \nof nuclear weapons. The Defense Department and the President have not \nallowed the politically correct crowd or other groups to pressure him \ninto saying we would never use a weapon before it is used on us.\n  I believe this is a very good Defense bill. I remember when I came to \nthe Senate a little over 6 years ago, the defense budget was somewhere \naround $290 billion. In 1991, our defense budget was $329 billion. We \nwent from $329 billion to $278 billion in the mid-nineties, a huge \nreduction. We edged up only slightly in the last few years of the last \ndecade of the century. We were not where we needed to be.\n  I remember when we passed a budget a few years ago that topped $329 \nbillion, the first time we had exceeded the defense budget in the early \n1990s. During that period, we did two dramatic things; We reduced \npersonnel in the Department of Defense by 40 percent and delayed \nconfronting the bow wave of unmet recapitalization needs for our ships, \naging aircraft, and other equipment. We delayed doing that, as we \npaired down our budget after the fall of the wall. It probably went too \nfar. Not probably, we did go too far. Had we maintained just a few \npercentage points more of spending, we could have carried on the \nrecapitalization program that would have left us in a lot better \nposition than we are today.\n  One of President Clinton's Service Secretaries used that phrase, ``a \nbow wave of unmet needs,'' needs that we were pushing off, which we \nknew we had to address and we should have been addressing along the way \nbut which is building in front of us. Now we have to address those \nneeds, and I believe we are making progress.\n  This bill authorizes an expenditure of $400.5 billion in defense \nspending. It is $17.9 billion more than last year. That is in real \nterms, adjusted terms, a 3.2 percent increase. It is not a huge \nincrease, but it is a significant increase, and I think it has been \nplanned for and being managed by the Defense Department pretty well.\n  It includes some badly needed benefits for our service men and women. \nThe family separation allowance is up. Incentive pay for places such as \nKorea are going to be up. Frankly, we did not do enough on Korea. It is \na special case that is unfairly impacting the finances, the careers, \nand the lives of families when a person gets an assignment to Korea. We \ncan do better, and we need to do better. I am continuing to look at \nthat issue along with other Members such as Senator Dayton and others \nin this body.\n  There is an increase in hostile fire pay. We increase the death \nbenefit for all personnel. We double it to $12,000. We should, and I \nwill be offering legislation to do a much better job of providing a \ndeath benefit for the soldiers who represent the United States of \nAmerica in a hostile environment and who lose their lives in combat. We \nhave seen those who were victims of terrorist attacks receive a million \nor more dollars in benefits. It is embarrassing how little the families \nof our soldiers who answer the call to go into harm's way, who put \ntheir lives at risk for our freedoms, get in benefits from the Federal \nGovernment. The situation is better as far as the money.\n  We have demonstrated in the last conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthat our military has modernized itself and is capable of innovation \nand creatively utilizing advanced technologies to apply the maximum \npressure on our enemy, minimizing the risk to our own forces and \nminimizing the risk to civilians and to the basic infrastructure of the \nenemy nations that we are facing. It is a tremendous achievement.\n\n  I have pushed for transformation, and I think Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld is correct. We have to push and push to have the \ntransformation we want in our Department of Defense. It will not occur \nif it is not being pushed from the top.\n  With regard to the Army, for example, we have made some tremendous \nprogress. Part of that progress is the quality of the leadership we \nhave in the military today. Those who watched the briefings and saw the \ninterviews of our men and women, the leaders in the military, saw the \nhigh education level,\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nthe technical expertise, and the leadership skill they have.\n  Our military officers do not just have undergraduate degrees today. \nThey have masters degrees in business, engineering, and technology. \nThey have management specialties. They have Ph.D.s. They are the finest \nkind of leaders one would find in any business or any other competitive \nenterprise in the country.\n  They do things such as study what happened previously. They call it \n``lessons learned.'' That is a healthy thing in America. We are quick \nto study our mistakes, and we learn from those mistakes.\n  I recall the book ``Black Hawk Down,'' the movie that was made about \nthe Somalian conflict, the mistakes that were made and the courage that \nwas shown. That report has been studied. That event has been studied \nover and over again. It has gotten down to the most junior possible \nofficers in our entire military. They know that story. They know what \nhappened. They know the good things and they know the bad things.\n  Some might think that the author who wrote the book that was being \ncritical--I did not really think so. I thought it was truthful and \ntried to be helpful. He has been invited to lecture our military forces \ntime and again on his insights as an outsider into what happened to \nthem. So we have an open and creative military. I believe that is the \nstrength of it.\n  One of our leaders said we do not want a war; we want to resist a \nwar, we want to avoid it at all possible costs, but when it can no \nlonger be avoided, we want to fight it with violence, we want to fight \nit effectively, and we do not want it to be a fair fight. We want our \nenemies to know beforehand we do not want it to be a fair fight. We \nwant to bring that force that we have to bear to win the war decisively \nand quickly, for this is the best way to create a safe environment \nafterwards and to preserve the lives of our service men and women. So \nwe are working on that. This is not easy. We utilize the incredible \ntechnology that America develops. We utilize the management skills that \nAmericans possess, and they are utilized routinely in this country.\n  It is not easy to develop highly effective technology and, more \nimportantly, apply that technology effectively on the battlefield. We \nhave to make sure our 19-year-old Privates understand the capabilities \nthey are dealing with and be able to apply it, even though they may \nhave been in the military a year or less even. It is a tremendous \nmanagerial task.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 2 minutes to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection whatsoever. I am curious as to whether \nwe are under time limits.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is operating under time limits. The \nminority has 26 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is fine with me. I am happy to yield. How much time \ndoes my friend need?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. A couple of minutes would be fine. I did not know I was \non a time limit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That makes two of us. So I am happy to yield some \nadditional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I close by saying how proud I am of the troops and our \ndefense capability. As one writer for the British magazine, The \nEconomist, said, not only do Americans spend more money on defense than \ntheir European allies, they spend it more wisely. That is the reason \nthey are so capable in matters of defense. He also added that if the \nEuropeans were so afraid of the United States, why did they not spend \nmore on defense?\n  I will be speaking later on a few more issues such as the Airland \nSubcommittee agenda, which I chair.\n  At this time, I express my appreciation to Senator John Warner, the \nchairman of our committee, for his superb leadership, his understanding \nof this country, his understanding of the defense needs of this \ncountry, and his willingness to work for it.\n  I, likewise, express my appreciation to Senator Levin, the ranking \nmember. He is as capable, intelligent, and articulate as any Member of \nthis body. He understands these issues. Although we talk at times about \nhaving differences of opinion, overwhelmingly the matters that went \nthrough our committee went through with bipartisan support and \nunanimous support.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for allowing me the extra time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year \n2004 National Defense Authorization Act. As ranking member of the \nReadiness Subcommittee, I have greatly enjoyed working with the new \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Ensign, and I especially appreciate the \nefforts that the Senator from Nevada has made to work through some of \nthis year's very difficult issues in a balanced and fair manner.\n  The readiness subcommittee is responsible for two areas that have the \npotential to be extremely controversial, and I believe both have been \nhandled well.\n  First, we spent a fair amount of time in our committee reviewing \nDepartment of Defense outsourcing policies. I continue to be troubled \nby the administration's insistence on outsourcing quotas, arbitrary \ntimelines for conducting public-private competitions, and the use of \ndirect conversions in place of competitive processes.\n  Nonetheless, I support the provision in the bill which would \nauthorize a pilot program under which the Department of Defense could \ntest a new approach to public-private competition. The provision would \nalso require that any deadlines for public-private competitions \nconducted by the Department of Defense be based on the resources \nactually available to the department of conduct such competitions. I \nbelieve that this provision strikes an appropriate balance.\n  Second, our subcommittee held two hearings on environmental issues \nimpacting military training and readiness. The administration has \noffered a series of legislative proposals to exempt the Department of \nDefense from some of our most important environmental statutes. I \nbelieve that these proposals go much farther than is needed to address \nthe legitimate concerns of the military, and could do some real harm to \nthe environment.\n  The bill includes one provision on these issues, which would exempt \nmilitary lands from critical habitat designation if those lands are \ncovered by an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan, or INRMP. I \nam disappointed that the majority of the committee rejected my \namendment to this provision, which would have established a more \nworkable and precise test for the adequacy of INRMPs to address \nendangered species. Nonetheless, I appreciate the thoughtful manner in \nwhich Senator Ensign considered this issue and attempted to address my \nconcerns. While I do not support the provision that was included in the \nbill, I believe that it is a significant improvement over the \nadministration's proposal.\n  I also have some reservations about the reductions that we have taken \nin the operation and maintenance accounts, especially in the working \ncapital funds. I am particularly concerned about the changes we have \nmade within the Air Force working capital fund--as I understand it, the \ntransfer of funds included in the markup package may actually create \nshortfalls of spare parts and harm readiness. I obviously hope that \nthis does not come to pass, and I hope that we may be able to reverse \nsome of these reductions as the bill progresses.\n  As always, this bill continues to support military construction and \nfamily housing needs that are so critical to quality of life for our \nservice men and women. I believe that the package we have before us \ntoday is a positive step toward this goal. I am concerned, however, \nthat our actions with respect to overseas facilities in particular may \nbe out of step with ongoing initiatives by the Department of Defense. \nThe reductions in this bill, which go beyond\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\nthose that the department itself recently proposed, undermine planned \nefficiencies that would improve both quality of life and training for \nArmy forces who will remain in Germany. Currently, the department and \nthe combatant commanders are working closely to create a comprehensive, \nintegrated presence and basing strategy and to identify a new set of \nmilitary construction requirements for the next decade. Moving forward, \nwe must ensure that our decisions regarding military construction \noverseas support these future requirements so that we continue to \nsupport our servicemen and women to the best of our abilities.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the bill we have before us makes some \npositive steps toward improving the readiness of our Armed Forces, and \nI commend it to my colleagues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is my understanding that the Senate, at the hour of 5 \no'clock, will proceed to a rollcall vote and that the vote will be held \nopen for the period of 1 hour, until 6 o'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. My distinguished colleague, the ranking member, and I \nhope Members could come up to see either of us, if we are here--and if \nwe are not here, both staffs will be here--and indicate the possibility \nthat they may have amendments that will be forthcoming and the time, \nsay tomorrow, that would be convenient for them to bring up those \namendments.\n  Tonight we will be addressing some amendments after 6 o'clock. We \nwill resume with amendments in the morning. We have gotten excellent \ncooperation from those desiring to offer amendments. But by midday \ntomorrow, we should, at our respective caucuses, be able to give the \nSenate some idea during the caucuses of the progress of this bill and \nthe likelihood of when final passage could be achieved. Am I not \ncorrect on that, I ask my colleague?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Virginia is, of course, correct.\n  I join with him in asking Senators to share with us or our staffs at \nthe 5 to 6 o'clock hour what amendment they would expect to be offering \neither tonight or tomorrow.\n  I also point out, I believe--I want to make sure I am correct--the \nvote that occurs at 5 will be the only vote today. I ask the Chair, is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct--the Senator will \nsuspend for a moment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thought that had already been agreed to. Am I incorrect \non that?\n  Mr. WARNER. In any event, Mr. President, there have been some rumors \nto that effect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I withdraw that. I thought an announcement had been made \nand it would be, of course, inappropriate for anyone other than the \nmajority leader to make that announcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote will occur at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is nothing in the Record as to post-6 o'clock as to \nfurther votes tonight. That is the case until we hear from the majority \nleader; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order concerning votes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me confirm the vote that will be \nbetween 5 and 6 is the only vote tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished assistant leader.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The distinguished whip came to the floor just in time to \nsave my reputation. I very much appreciate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. With respect to amendments, I urge colleagues to look at \nthe daily calendar in which the reference is made, on the covering \npage, to the order with regard to this bill and the proviso:\n\n       Provided, That all first degree amendments be relevant and \n     that any second degree amendment be relevant to the first \n     degree amendment to which it is offered.\n\n  There are restrictions on the subject matter. We want to cooperate \nwith our colleagues. But it is very clear that this is the order that \nhas been adopted by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6586-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6586-S6587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\nNOMINATION OF S.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the President will \nbe notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise in support of S. \nMaurice Hicks, who has been confirmed to be a nominee to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Louisiana.\n  Mr. Hicks has had a distinguished legal career. Upon graduation from \nLouisiana State University Law School, he worked for the Louisiana \nLegislative Council. Soon afterwards,\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\nhe began his 25-year career in private practice as an associate in a \nShreveport law firm. He subsequently founded his own law firm and \ndeveloped an expertise in commercial and insurance-related litigation \nin State and Federal courts, including general aviation accidents, \nautomobile accidents, product liability, lender liability claims, \nconstruction disputes, intellectual property claims, and insurance \ncoverage questions, as well as oil and gas accident and contamination \nclaims. He also has a great deal of experience representing individuals \non a wide variety of personal matters including estate planning, \npersonal injury claims, contract negotiations, copyright issues, and \ngeneral legal matters. All told, he has tried an estimated 150 cases to \njudgment, acting as sole or lead counsel in the vast majority of them. \nHe has also devoted time in his legal career to pro bono work, \nincluding preparing wills for the elderly and working with adjudicated \njuveniles.\n  He is a member of the Louisiana State Bar, the American Bar \nAssociation, and the Shreveport Bar Association.\n  I am confident that Mr. Hicks's extensive litigation experience will \nmake him an excellent addition to the Federal bench.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed the nomination of \nMaurice Hicks to be a United States District Court Judge for the \nWestern District of Louisiana. Maurice Hicks has spent 25 years as a \nlitigator in Shreveport, LA, where he has appeared frequently in State \nand Federal courts. He comes to us with the support of his home State \nSenators. Mr. Hicks is the seventh nominee of President Bush to be \nconfirmed to the Federal courts in Louisiana. Just this year, the \nSenate already confirmed Dee Drell and Patricia Minaldi to the United \nStates District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. With these \nconfirmations, there are no longer any current vacancies in the Federal \ncourts in Louisiana.\n  Under my chairmanship last Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years. Judge \nEdith Brown Clement of Louisiana was promptly given a hearing in \nOctober 2001 and confirmed in November 2001, despite the fact that \nthree of President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees never received a \nhearing, including H. Alston Johnson of Louisiana. The Democrats turned \nthe other cheek on past obstruction by the Republicans in order to move \nforward. In fact, with Democratic support, the Senate recently \nconfirmed another nominee to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge \nEdward Prado, despite the fact that President Clinton's Hispanic \nnominees to that court, Enrique Moreno and Jorge Rangel, never received \na hearing or a vote.\n  With the confirmation of Mr. Hicks, the Senate will have confirmed 25 \nof President Bush's judicial nominees so far this year and 125 overall. \nSo far this year we have confirmed more judicial nominees of President \nBush than the Republican majority was willing to confirm in the entire \n1996 session when President Clinton was in the White House. That entire \nyear only 17 judges were confirmed all year and that included none to \nthe circuit courts, not one. In contrast, already this session, 5 \ncircuit court nominees, including several highly controversial \nnominees, have been confirmed among the 25 judges the Senate has \napproved to date. Those confirmations--including two that had more \nnegative votes than the required number to be filibustered but who were \nnot filibustered never get acknowledged in partisan Republican talking \npoints.\n  We are also almost 6 months ahead of the pace the Republican majority \nset in 1999 when it considered President Clinton's judicial nominees. \nIt was not until October that the Senate confirmed as many as 25 \njudicial nominees in 1999.\n  In the 17 months when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we were able \nto confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies that \nRepublicans had stored up by refusing to allow scores of judicial \nnominees of President Clinton to be considered. We were able to do so \ndespite the White House's refusal to work with Democrats on circuit \ncourt vacancies and many district court vacancies.\n  With Mr. Hicks' confirmation, the Senate will have succeeded in \nreducing the number of Federal judicial vacancies to the lowest level \nit has been in 13 years. The 110 vacancies that I inherited in the \nsummer of 2001 have been more than cut in half. In the 17 months that I \nchaired the Judiciary Committee we not only kept up with attrition, but \nreduced those vacancies from 110 to 60 and with Mr. Hicks's \nconfirmation we will only have 46 vacancies for the entire Federal \njudiciary. I congratulate Mr. Hicks and his family on his confirmation.\n  Republican talking points will likely focus on the impasse on 2 of \nthe most extreme of the President's nominations rather than the 125 \nconfirmations and the lowest judicial vacancy rate in 13 years. They \nwill ignore their own recent filibusters against President Clinton's \nexecutive and judicial nominees in so doing and their own delays in \nconsidering some of this President's judicial nominees.\n  I continue to be disappointed that the Republican leadership has not \nfound time to proceed to the nomination of Judge Consuelo Callahan to \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This is \nanother of the judicial nominees that Senate Democrats has strongly \nsupported and whose consideration we had expedited through the \nJudiciary Committee weeks ago.\n  Just as Senate Democrats cleared the nomination of Judge Edward Prado \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit without \ndelay, so, too, the nomination of Judge Callahan, another Hispanic \nnominee to another circuit court, was cleared on the Democratic side. \nAll Democratic Senators serving on the Judiciary Committee voted to \nreport this nomination favorably. All Democratic Senators had indicated \nthat they are prepared to proceed to this nomination and, after a \nreasonable period of debate, vote on the nomination. I am confident \nthis nomination will be confirmed by an extraordinary majority--maybe \nunanimously.\n  It is most unfortunate that so many partisans in this administration \nand on the other side of the aisle insist on bogging down consensus \nmatters and consensus nominees in order to focus exclusively on the \nmost divisive and controversial of this President's nominees as he \ncontinues his efforts to pack the courts. Democratic Senators have \nworked very hard to cooperate with this administration in order to fill \njudicial vacancies. What the other side seeks to obscure is that \neffort, that fairness and the progress we have been able to achieve \nwithout much help from the other side or the administration. Judge \nCallahan's nomination has been delayed on the Senate Executive Calendar \nunnecessarily in my view. It is time to act on this nomination and make \nprogress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6587-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen our \nNational Guard, our Reserve force, and our Nation by offering these \ntroops the option to receive year-round health coverage through \nTRICARE, the military health program. If approved, this would be the \nfirst fundamental change in Guard and Reserve benefits since the end of \nthe Cold War.\n  This amendment not only honors the sacrifices that our Guard and \nReserve troops have been making on our behalf for decades, but also \nrecognizes that there has been a fundamental expansion in recent years \nin their roles and missions.\n  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the military has increasingly \nrelied on the skill and sacrifice of America's Reservists. When I go \nhome to South Dakota and talk to the citizens of my State, I see and \nhear first-hand the impact this increasing reliance has on communities \nall across my State. Nearly 2,000 South Dakotan Guard and Reservists \nare currently on active duty serving their Nation. In addition to \nperforming their traditional combat roles, Guard and Reserve personnel \nhave assumed a larger share of the peacekeeping role in hot spots all \naround the world.\n  Since September 11, Guard and Reserve members have assisted in \nhomeland security, including protecting our airports, and have provided \nforce protection at bases at home and abroad. According to a recent GAO \nstudy, Guard and Reservist mobilizations increased by 700 percent in \nthe aftermath\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nof the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center.\n  So more frequently and for longer periods of time, Guard and Reserve \npersonnel from South Dakota and all over the Nation have answered their \nNation's call to duty, leaving behind their families, their jobs, and \ntheir communities.\n  While the demands we place on Reservists have grown markedly, the \nFederal Government's commitment to this dedicated group of men and \nwomen has not kept pace. As a result, leaders of the National Guard and \nReserves are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain \ntop-notch individuals. Guard leaders tell me that offering health \ncoverage would be the single most powerful tool we could give them to \nhelp with recruiting and retention.\n  This proposal offers a moderate, targeted, affordable proposal that \ndeserves the bipartisan support of the Senate.\n  This amendment is the result of 2 years of work by myself and a \nbipartisan group of my colleagues from the Senate Guard Caucus. In \n2001, we introduced S. 1119, calling for research into problems \nsurrounding health coverage for the Guard and Reserve. For 2 years, we \nhave been holding regular meetings with leaders from the guard and \nreserve community and soliciting grassroots input. We have made some \nmodifications to reflect the experiences of reservists mobilized after \nSeptember 11 and problems encountered by others mobilized for service \nin Bosnia and Iraq. Last fall, we received a helpful study on the issue \nfrom the General Accounting Office.\n  Incorporating the lessons from that report, last month we were able \nto introduce S. 852, the National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive \nHealth Benefits Act of 2003, on which this amendment is based.\n  This amendment offers Reserve and National Guard members and their \nfamilies the opportunity to participate in the same TRICARE program \navailable to active duty service members and their families.\n  Reservists and their families will share the cost of premium payments \nwith the Department of Defense, with the same cost distribution as used \nin the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan.\n  The National Guard Association of the United States reports that the \naverage cost of a family health care plan through a civilian HMO is \n$7,541 per year.\n  In contrast, the Guard Association estimates that the TRICARE cost \nper family is only $5,173 per year, even without government sharing any \nof the cost.\n  With government cost-sharing, this will be an attractively priced \noption for securing health coverage.\n  Beyond recruitment and retention, this program will improve \nreadiness. More than 20 percent of the Ready Reserve--and as much as 40 \npercent of young enlisted personnel--do not currently have health \ninsurance.\n  Providing access to quality health care during all phases of service \ncan drastically reduce the chances that a unit is unable to deploy due \nto medical reasons.\n  Maintaining a healthy force is absolutely essential to maintaining a \nprepared force.\n  Our legislation will also address another problem that invariably \noccurs during mobilization.\n  When a reservist is called to active duty, he or she must leave their \nprivate-sector health plan and enter a wholly new plan, TRICARE. In \nMarch, I worked with the Secretary of Defense to end a nationwide \nproblem among families of mobilized reservists. Simply put, they were \nbeing forced, unfairly and improperly, to join a more expensive TRICARE \nplan.\n  We did solve that problem, but many families spent weeks without \nknowing whether they should try to extend their private coverage or \nwhether they could afford TRICARE. That is simply unacceptable.\n  At a time when a reservist is preparing for deployment to a war zone, \nthe last thing he or she should have to worry about is health benefits.\n  This amendment is an affordable way to honor the commitment of our \nguard and reserve members. The bill before us provides the Defense \nDepartment with more than $400 billion in FY2004.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, my amendment costs \nabout $300 million in that same period. For .7 months of a percent of \nthe Pentagon budget, we can guarantee that all reservists have access \nto health care--either through civilian employers or TRICARE. We can \nensure that this force is ready to fight at a moment's notice.\n  We can improve the readiness of the current reserve force and improve \nour ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest men and women \nfor the National Guard and Reserves.\n  The high rate of reservist mobilizations will most likely continue. \nIndeed, with ongoing needs in Iraq and the upsurge in homeland defense \nactivities, reservists will probably continue to be mobilized at record \nlevels.\n  By providing access to quality, affordable health care for reservists \nand their families, this legislation will ensure that when we need \nthem, they will be there, healthy and ready to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask our distinguished colleague, the distinguished \nleader on the other side of the aisle, the cost implications.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I noted in my opening comments, the cost implications \nare very minimal given the extraordinary opportunities it presents for \nall of our Guard and Reserve personnel. The estimated cost for the \nfirst year is $300 million--.7 of a percent of the entire defense \nbudget.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished friend and colleague, there are \na number of provisions that will be addressed as we proceed to this \nbill to try to improve the compensation benefits for the Reserve and \nGuard. I generally recognize the need to do so, but I must say to my \ngood friend, the regulars are beginning to say, well, what is the \ndistinction between a Regular and a Guard and Reserves man? A Regular, \nthe clearest distinction is he or she is subject to 365 days of service \nto country and probably moving from base to base every third year. \nAlso, they do not have the benefit of both Reserve and Guard pay.\n  As someone said, and I hope the distinguished leader will not take \nthis the wrong way, maybe everybody will leave the Regular Forces and \njoin the Guard and Reserve because there is a little more flexibility \nand a little more pay and benefits.\n  We have to watch as we move along in this direction to not get out of \nbalance what has been in balance for many years. I recognize that the \nGuard and Reserve are pulling heavily on the oars these days and they \nhave the inconvenience of being called up at times as they have \nexperienced in Afghanistan and the Iraqi operations and having to leave \ntheir families rather abruptly and depart their businesses, employers \nconfronted with getting replacements in some instances but allowing \nthem to return to their positions, which I think is the proper thing to \ndo. We have not had any hearings. We do not know what the ramifications \nare.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague, at the moment I will have to \nindicate my intention to oppose.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could respond briefly, first of all, \nI compliment the distinguished chair and ranking member for their work, \nonce again, in producing a bill that passed out of committee, as I \nunderstand it, unanimously. That is a real tribute to their leadership \nand to the willingness that they continue to demonstrate to work in \nsuch a bipartisan and constructive manner in committee. That is \nlaudable. I congratulate the chair and ranking member for their ability \nto do it consistently--not just on this occasion.\n  First, I recognize, as the distinguished chair has noted, we have to \nbe appreciative of our active-duty personnel. They make a commitment \nsecond to none. We saw yet again a demonstration of that commitment in \nthe battle in Iraq.\n  I don't know that an issue has been studied as much as this issue \nover the course of the last couple of years. I am happy to share the \nfindings of many of the studies that have been done. One study that \nattracted me in particular was a study done by the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  I ask unanimous consent the summary of the study be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\n                               Background\n\n       Reserve components participate in military conflicts and \n     peacekeeping missions in areas such as Bosnia, Kosovo, and \n     southwest Asia, and assist in homeland security. From fiscal \n     year 1996 through fiscal year 2001, an average of about \n     11,000, or 1 percent, of the roughly 900,000 reservists were \n     mobilized each year. The length of mobilizations can be as \n     long as 2 years with the mean length of mobilizations for the \n     6-year period we reviewed being 117 days. As of April 2002, \n     about 80,000, or 8 percent, of reservists had been mobilized \n     for 1 year for operations related to September 11, 2001. At \n     the same time, additional reserve personnel continued to be \n     deployed throughout the world on various peacekeeping and \n     humanitarian missions. . . .\n       Overall, the percentage of reservists with health care \n     coverage when they are not mobilized is similar to that found \n     in the general population--and, like the general population, \n     most reservists have coverage through their employers. \n     According to DOD's 2000 Survey of Reserve Component \n     Personnel, nearly 80 percent of reservists reported having \n     health care coverage. In the general population, 81 percent \n     of 18 to 65 year olds have health care coverage. Officers and \n     senior enlisted personnel were more likely than junior \n     enlisted personnel to have coverage. Only 60 percent of \n     junior enlisted personnel, about 90 percent of whom are under \n     age 35, had coverage--lower than the similarly aged group in \n     the general population. Of reservists with dependents, about \n     86 percent reported having coverage. Of reservists without \n     dependents, about 63 percent reported having coverage.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The GAO noted since the attack on the World Trade \nCenter--\n  Mr. WARNER. Could you give the date of the publication?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The date was September of 2002, just in the last 6 \nmonths.\n  The GAO study noted that since the attacks on the Pentagon and the \nWorld Trade Center, utilization, mobilization of the Guard and Reserve \nhas gone up 700 percent. We are not only seeing an increase in \nintegration with Active-Duty Forces, but we are seeing a remarkable, \ncontinued mobilization of the Guard and Reserve for other roles having \nto do with the war on terror.\n  As these continued mobilizations arise, the disruption, the \nextraordinary pressures and demands put on the Guard and Reserve almost \nrequire that we look upon them as active-duty personnel because they \nplay far more an active-duty role.\n  As I talk to the Guard and Reserve and the recruiters, it it has \nbecome increasingly clear that is one reason recruitment and retention \nhas become much more of a challenge. We have done very well in South \nDakota. We are at 106 percent, but that is not without a great deal of \neffort. We cannot say that nationally.\n  The fundamental question is, Do we owe them the right--not for \nadditional compensation, no to be treated like Regulars--the right to \nbuy health insurance so they have the coverage for their families and \nthemselves both in war and in peace.\n  Why is it appropriate to buy coverage for war but not appropriate to \nbuy coverage for peace when they are purchasing it themselves? I don't \nknow that it takes more study. I don't know that it takes any more \nanalysis. You see the mobilization. You see the need. You see what I \nconsider to be the disparity that exists today and what I would \nconsider to be a certain extent an unfairness. I don't know that one \nhas to go beyond that.\n\n  So I hope the distinguished chairman, the manager of the bill, might \nreconsider prior to the time we vote. But I will respect his point of \nview regardless of what ultimately he decides.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could ask a further question?\n  I should examine this report. It is timely. But I am advised there is \na provision in the report indicating that 80 percent to 90 percent of \nthe Guard and Reserve have private sector health insurance. Are you \nfamiliar with that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would say, if I recall what the report \nsays, it is 80 percent or 90 percent of the Guard and Reserve who have \ncoverage at some time during the year. We have as high as 30 percent of \nour recruits in the National Guard in South Dakota who do not have \nhealth insurance because younger people, younger personnel, oftentimes \nare not in a position to buy it. It is younger personnel who are \ncurrently the subject of recruitment and retention.\n  There is a great need out there. As I say, there are a large number, \nthere is a significant percentage who are vastly underinsured, if you \nread further in the report.\n  I urge my colleague to take a good look at the report before he comes \nto any conclusions about the need.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will do that. I value the wisdom and \ninitiative of our distinguished leader. So I will do that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could add one other--I apologize to the Senator \nfrom Vermont--I will just read from page 8 of the report.\n\n       Officers and enlisted personnel are more likely than junior \n     personnel to have coverage. Only 60 percent of junior \n     enlisted personnel, about 90 percent of whom are under age \n     35, had coverage.\n\n  That means 40 percent of the junior personnel had no coverage at all.\n\n       Of reservists and dependents, about 86 percent reported \n     having coverage, but of reservists without dependents, only \n     63 percent reported having coverage. Again, about 40 percent \n     have no coverage whatsoever.\n\n  Again, this becomes a recruiting, a retention, and, I believe, a \nfairness question that I hope this Senate will address this year with \nthis bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague.\n  I would just ask I be able to consult with the majority leader as to \nthe time at which this vote should take place. He, of course, will \nconsult with you. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might interject for a moment?\n  The distinguished chairman knows the great respect I have for what I \nmany times refer to as my Senator away from home because I spend part \nof the week--seems to be the longer part of the week, with the hours we \nhave been putting in around here lately--in Northern Virginia. Of \ncourse my dear friend, the senior Senator from North Dakota, knows my \nrespect for him.\n  I think this is a good amendment. Senator DeWine of Ohio has taken a \nvery active role in this, too. I hope the distinguished chairman would \nhold off making a snap judgment. I know he doesn't do that, in any \nevent. But think about what the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nhas said.\n  The Senator from Ohio and I will speak on this matter at another time \nrather than hold the floor to do it. But there are a number--and the \nnumbers are rather shocking--of those who are without health insurance, \nespecially in the enlisted area. You have, so many times, this hiatus. \nThey are leaving their job, getting called up, and being without it. It \nleaves families in this limbo.\n  I would rather, if they were being called up, they be concentrating \non what they are going to be doing, not on whether they are covered by \nhealth care insurance. This is a matter we have raised with the health \ncare committee.\n  I am a cochair of the National Guard caucus. We raised it within our \ncaucus. We heard from Guard units all over the country of their needs. \nAs the distinguished Democratic leader has said on the floor today, \nthis is a case where we are asking they have the ability to pay into \nthis and do this. So I hope maybe during the evening, before we come \nback in tomorrow, everybody might be able to look at it.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, will also \nwant to be speaking on it. I will withhold my further comments. There \nare Senators on the floor waiting to speak on this bill.\n  I totally concur with the distinguished Democratic leader on what he \nhas said. His experiences with the brave men and women in South Dakota \nare very similar to what I hear in Vermont. I suspect most States are \nhearing it also from their Guard. So maybe we will keep our powder dry \nuntil tomorrow. We will get some of these facts and figures and see \nwhere they go.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for his kind \nremarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for a minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I point out one other fact for the consideration of my \ngood friend, the chairman. The chairman, of course, makes an important \npoint about the fact there is a distinction between Active Duty and \nReserve and there are certain benefits that people in Active Duty have \nwhich make it a little more attractive, perhaps, than it\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\notherwise might be in comparison to being in the Reserves.\n  There is a distinction in this amendment, as I read it, which \nrequires the reservists while not on active duty to pay the premium. It \nis 28 percent of the total amount determined by the Secretary. That is \na distinction between Active Duty and Reserve, where the active-duty \npersonnel, of course, do not have to pay their own share; whereas, \nunder the amendment offered by Senator Daschle, the reservists while \nnot on active duty would have to pay, as I understand it, the share of \nabout 28 percent.\n  That does retain that important distinction, while it does clearly \nconfer a benefit, which is an important benefit because of all the \nreservists we have who simply do not have health insurance. We want \nthem to be in a healthy state if and when they are called up--and we \nought to want them in a healthy state even if they are never called \nup--but surely if they are called up it is important they be in good \nhealth.\n  Having access here to what is equal to what Federal employees have, \nthat is what the Senator from South Dakota and the cosponsors are \nattempting to do, to give reservists the same kind of health care \nFederal employees have. That includes paying their own part of the \npremium but again having access to health insurance, which is so \nimportant for us to have a healthy Reserve Corps.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be in a better position tomorrow to \nreply to our distinguished colleagues. We have some material coming \nover from the Department of Defense. It has not been authenticated with \na signature yet. Until such time as it is authenticated as accurate, in \nfact, this Senator is reluctant to draw any conclusions with respect to \npoints about which he would be comfortable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a few remarks I \nmake be as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Defense \nauthorization bill that we are debating today and for the remainder of \nthis week.\n  I first want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \ncourtesy, for their thoughtfulness, and for their collegiality in the \nconduct of the committee in the preparation of this bill. They are two \nSenators I respect and admire greatly. I thank them for their help and \nparticipation.\n  This is, overall, a very good bill that meets the needs of our \nfighting men and women. I have some reservations which I will talk \nabout tonight, and during the course of the week I will suggest some \nimprovements in the bill. But overall, this represents a thorough and \nconsistent and appropriate discharge of our responsibility to ensure \nthat the men and women of our Armed Forces are the best prepared and \nbest cared for in the world.\n  Let me also say this year I had the privilege and the opportunity to \nserve as the ranking member of the Emerging Threat and Capability \nSubcommittee. I had the pleasure of working with Senator Pat Roberts of \nKansas. I also want to thank Senator Roberts for his courtesy and \nthoughtfulness and for his collegiality. He created a cooperative \nspirit on the committee which resulted in legislation that is both \nthoughtful and which I think is a vast improvement for the men and \nwomen of our military services.\n  The package supported and presented by the subcommittee dealt with a \nrange of subjects. The subcommittee itself was created 4 years ago to \ndeal with new emerging threats and our response to these threats. The \nsubcommittee looked at issues such as the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, terrorism, and information warfare, and it also \nfocused on ways in which we can respond to these threats.\n  One of the areas, for example, is the Defense Science and Technology \nProgram--providing the research and the analysis that makes our forces \nthe most technologically advanced in the world.\n  Another area we are concerned about is the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program. There is a rather simple and obvious point: If we \ncan reduce the threats, that is a better way than to respond to those \nthreats if they are poised against us.\n  We are also concerned about our special operations forces. I think we \nhave all seen in the past few months how effective and how important \nthese forces are. They really are the tip of the spear when it comes to \nour efforts on the war on terrorism.\n  Needless to say, the Emerging Threats Subcommittee is obviously \ninvolved in many issues that are of critical importance today.\n  Let me speak just briefly about some of the issues as we approach the \ncommittee markup.\n  Science and technology is a critical component of our warfighting \ncapability. This was brought home to me graphically in August of 2001. \nAbout 20-plus years ago, I commanded an infantry company--a parachute \ncompany--of the 82nd Airborne Division. And in August of 2001, I went \nback to Fort Bragg to watch a live fire demonstration by a division of \nthe 82nd Airborne Division. I was, of course, very pleased with the \ntoughness and skills of the paratroopers. But I was also impressed with \nthe technology. Each soldier had a night vision device, and each \nsoldier had a laser-aiming device on their weapon. Twenty-five years \nago, there was one star-light scope for the whole platoon. It was a \nbig, bulky device which we carried around and used sparingly. There was \nno laser-aiming device on their weapons.\n\n  These are graphic examples of the impact of science and technology on \nour ability to fight. They have made our soldiers, marines, and airmen \nthe most formidable in the world because when we couple this technology \nwith their skills and spirit and their courage, they are unstoppable.\n  I am pleased this bill includes provisions that strengthen the \ncoordination between the Science and Technology Program. We really want \nto ensure that we get the maximum value from our technological \ninvestment.\n  I am also very pleased the bill includes Senator Lieberman's \nlegislation which will increase research on technologies to help \nimprove communications and networking and to help address our bandwidth \ncrisis in the field.\n  Again, 25 years ago when I commanded troops, bandwidth was a concept \nwhich no one talked about. Today, it is an item that is critical to the \nsuccess of any military force.\n  When members of the committee go out--as I know my colleagues do--and \nvisit troops and talk to commanding officers, one of their consistent \ncomplaints is, We just do not have enough bandwidth. We don't have \nenough space on the spectrum to push out all the digital information we \nhave to all of our warfighters instantaneously.\n  So I think Senator Lieberman's proposal will give us an added impetus \nto examine these issues of bandwidth and conductivity. It is literally \nthe electronic backbone of our military forces. There are some issues \nof concern which I have with respect to science and technology. All of \nour experts looking at the appropriate level of funding for science and \ntechnology suggest that we should be investing about 3 percent of the \ndefense budget in those programs. Secretary Rumsfeld has said the \nQuadrennial Defense Review made that point, and the Defense Science \nBoard has endorsed this laudable goal of 3 percent expenditure on \nscience and technology. However, last year the final defense budget did \nnot reach 3 percent, and this year the President's request was $1 \nbillion below last year's vital defense budget.\n  While I am pleased to note that this bill adds nearly $500 million to \nthe Defense Science and Technology Program and supports significant \ninvestments in university research, advanced research to support \nspecial operations, and advanced undersea warfare technologies, the \nfunding levels fall short of this 3 percent.\n  I think we have to maintain robust investment in our science and \ntechnology. We tried to close the gap, but there is still a gap. I hope \nin the next reauthorization--indeed in the conference--we can try to \nclose this gap.\n  In the area of nonproliferation programs, we all understand that \nweapons\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nof mass destruction is one of the key threats, particularly if they get \ninto the hands of terrorists. One of the most cost-effective ways to \ndeal with this issue of nonproliferation is to support the Threat \nReduction Program. I am pleased to report again that this bill \nauthorizes full funding of these threat reduction and nonproliferation \nprograms, including the Nunn-Lugar program.\n  This full funding is critical if we are going to eliminate the \nproliferation threat and if we are going to lower the danger that these \nmaterials pose to us, particularly if they get into the hands of \nterrorists.\n  Also, the bill includes authority to use Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram funds outside the former Soviet Union under appropriate \ncircumstances, as requested by the President.\n  Again, I think we have to recognize there are many places in the \nworld, regrettably, where material could fall into the wrong hands. \nThis gives the President authority for a much wider geographic approach \non proliferation.\n  One of the problems we particularly worry about is the presence of a \nvast stockpile of lethal, chemical weapons--some of them small enough \nto fit into a briefcase--in Russia. This is the residue of years and \nyears of Soviet research.\n\n  Under the Nunn-Lugar program, we have a project to destroy all those \nweapons so they cannot be used and do not fall into the hands of \nterrorists. There is a set of conditions that requires a Presidential \ncertification before the money can be spent, but this bill provides the \nPresident a 1-year waiver of the certification so funds can be used to \ndestroy these chemical weapons. Again, I thank Chairman Roberts, \nparticularly, for his consideration of this request and for his \nwillingness to provide this 1-year waiver.\n  As I said before, our special operations community each day \ndemonstrates their incredible value in our war against terrorism. In \nrecognition of the expanded role of the special operations forces, the \nSecretary of Defense has declared that rather than simply being a \nsupporting command, special operations would be a command in itself.\n  Let me try to parse that. Before special operations command supported \nthe CINCs, CENTCOM, SOUTHCOM. Today, they not only support these CINCs, \nbut they are their own command in and of themselves with new \nresponsibilities.\n  I applaud this decision, but I believe Congress should have a better \nappreciation of the new role that special operations command is taking \non. Therefore, the committee included, at my suggestion, a \nrecommendation so the Secretary of Defense can report to us information \nregarding this new role.\n  The information would include items such as the military strategy for \nutilizing special operations troops to fight the global war on \nterrorism and how the proposal contributes to the overall national \nsecurity strategy with regard to the war on terrorism; the scope of the \nauthorities granted to the commander of the special operations command \nby the Secretary of Defense; the operational and legal parameters \nwithin which special operations forces will exercise these authorities; \nthe impact on existing special operations missions; the decisionmaking \nmechanisms, to include consultation with Congress, that will be \ninvolved in authorizing, planning, and conducting these operations; and \nfuture organizational and resource requirements for conducting the \nglobal counterterrorism mission.\n  I believe the answers to these questions will help us frame our \noversight responsibility, and I also think it will help provide the \ndetails for the special operations commander and the Department of \nDefense in relation to their responsibilities and their missions in \nthis new responsibility they have been given.\n  These are just some of the highlights with respect to the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I want my colleagues to know of \nthese threats. There are other issues I would like to comment upon in \naddition to those related to my responsibilities on the subcommittee.\n  There was, in the committee, a proposal to, in my view, change the \nMcKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. I thank my colleagues because, \nthrough collaboration with Senators Ensign, Allen, and others, we were \nable to do what I think the committee wanted to do: to provide the \nopportunity to temporarily suspend these regulations if property is \nneeded by a State for emergency purposes but not to undermine \ncompletely and irrevocably the responsibility we have to provide \nsuitable excess Government facilities for homeless purposes. I am very \npleased and proud the committee was so responsive and so cooperative in \nthat regard.\n  I also included in the bill an amendment which again was adopted \nunanimously--I thank my colleagues--that would direct the Secretary of \nDefense to provide guidelines to the Defense Policy Board. This is an \nadvisory committee consisting of distinguished Americans who provide \nadvice and insight, without compensation, to the Secretary of Defense. \nIt is a very important board but recently it has come under some \ncriticism.\n  I think in order to dispel that criticism but also to convince and \nassure the public that access to information and access to key \ndecisionmakers is not being used for profit-making purposes but solely \nis an exercise in the patriotism of the individual members of the \nboard, I ask that the Secretary of Defense provide guidelines. I hope \nthese guidelines are forthcoming. I think they will be useful. I am \npleased they are now included within the bill.\n  Let me turn to several other topics quickly because I see my \ncolleagues are also in the Chamber to speak.\n  Within the context of missile defense is an area of the bill that I \nhave some grave reservations. We have decided to pursue missile \ndefense. The President has made the decision, and it is his prerogative \nto do so, to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. The question before us today \nis, will we do this in a logical, thorough, systematic way? Will we do \nit in a way in which we can assure the American public we are \nproceeding with all deliberate speed but also in a way that we can \njustify a product that eventually will be useful to national defense? \nThese are the basic issues that come before us today.\n  The President has announced, however, that he intends to field a \nnational missile defense system by September 2004, despite the fact the \nPentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation concluded, in \nhis fiscal year 2002 annual report, that the system ``has yet to \ndemonstrate significant operational capability.'' So the plan, in \neffect, is to field the system before we even know if it will work.\n  I think that raises grave questions about the usefulness of such a \nsystem and grave questions about the level of funding that is going to \nsupport a system if we are not ready to declare it operationally useful \nyet we are ready to declare it will be deployed.\n  We also understand after 9/11 there are other ways to attack the \nhomeland of the United States and that it is not just through the use \nof long-range missiles. We have to, in our debate and our discussions \nand our decisions, be very careful with resources that could be spent \nin other ways to protect our country and our homeland, particularly.\n  One of the other aspects of the system that is proposed for \ndeployment is that the decision has been made to field this system \nwithout a radar capable of distinguishing between a warhead and a \ndecoy. The radar is a key aspect of any missile defense system.\n  Indeed, the Clinton administration was criticized very harshly for \ntheir national Missile Defense Program, yet this administration has \ndecided to deploy a system that appears, at least on the surface, to be \nfar less capable than the one proposed by President Clinton, \nparticularly when it comes to the radar architecture.\n  Another issue, with respect to missile defense, is the decision to \nsignificantly reduce the number of tests. Ironically, it seems that one \nof the byproducts of the President's decision to rapidly field a \nnational missile defense is a concomitant reduction in the amount of \ntesting. It seems to me that is sort of doing things exactly the wrong \nway; that if you are going to accelerate deployment, you would \naccelerate testing also.\n\n  I believe if we are going to have confidence in a system that we \nfield, we have to make the investment in testing now, and not just \nsimply reply upon our faith in technology that has not yet been \nadequately tested.\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\n  Originally, 20 national missile defense tests had been scheduled to \noccur between mid-2002 and 2007, but after the President's deployment \ndecision, 9 of these 20 tests were canceled without explanation. \nFurthermore, the scheduled date to complete this new, very minimal test \nplan is now 2009 instead of 2007. That is 5 years after the advertised \ndeployment of this system in 2004.\n  We have to recognize this Missile Defense Program is the largest \nsingle acquisition program in the Department of Defense, with a budget \nrequest of more than $9 billion in fiscal year 2004 alone.\n  For perspective, this funding could buy 9 DDG-51-class destroyers, 45 \nF-22 Raptor fighter aircraft, or more than 2,800 Stryker armored \nvehicles. So the decisions we make are not without cost, not without \nopportunity costs.\n  The investment we make in missiles means, quite literally, we cannot \nbuy new destroyers; today we cannot buy more F-22 Raptor fighter \naircraft; we cannot buy more Stryker armored vehicles. So again, I \nthink we have to look very carefully at the deployment, at the testing.\n  I think we are all committed to the notion of someday putting in \nplace a missile defense system that will effectively defend the United \nStates, but we cannot do it hastily, and we cannot do it simply on a \nwish that it works. I believe we have to prove it works before we \ndeploy it or simply declare it is deployed.\n  Over the last several years, we have tried to put some structure, if \nyou will, in the Missile Defense Program. For example, at the beginning \nof fiscal year 2002, Congress required that the Bush administration \nestablish cost, schedule, testing, and performance goals for missile \ndefense, and we directed the General Accounting Office to review \nwhether progress was being made toward these established goals.\n  By the end of 2002, the Bush administration had still not established \nany meaningful goals for missile defense. Consequently, in November \n2002, the Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management at the GAO \nwrote to the committee to say that since no goals had been established, \nGAO could not complete its review.\n  I think, at a minimum, there should be costs, there should be \nschedules, there should be goals, certainly at a level so the GAO can \nat least offer a preliminary assessment of whether these goals are \nbeing achieved or what effort must be expended to achieve these goals. \nThat is something that has not been done.\n  I support prudent research and development and testing on national \nmissile defense, but I think ultimately we all want to assure the \nAmerican people that when we put something in the field, it will work, \nand that we know precisely what it will do when it is in the field. I \ndon't think that is too much to ask the administration.\n\n  Finally, let me cover a topic that will receive a great deal of \nattention over the next couple days. That is the issue of nuclear \npolicy. I have grave concerns over some of the provisions in the bill. \nUnder the guise of maintaining flexibility and keeping all options \nopen, this bill approves and encourages the administration to continue \nits push to develop, test, deploy, and possibly use nuclear weapons. I \nheard my colleague Senator Levin earlier today referencing the quote by \nformer Ambassador Brooks, the head of NSSA, who said his bias is to \nsomething that can be used. For many decades, our bias was against even \nthinking about the use of nuclear weapons if we could avoid it.\n  One of the consequences of the proposal for a low-yield nuclear \nweapon, for a robust nuclear earth penetrator is, if not a fact, an \nobservation that as you make weapons such that their collateral damage \nis minimal, there is a tendency to use them. We have to ask ourselves \nin our recent conflict in Baghdad, would we have dropped dumb bombs in \nthe middle of crowded neighborhoods in an attempt to attack the \nleadership of Iraq? It would have been a much harder call. But because \nwe had precision weapons with low collateral damage, as a result the \ncall was much easier--a tough call, nevertheless, but easier.\n  I fear that as we move down this path for low-yield nuclear weapons, \nmore usable nuclear weapons, the threshold, the inhibition against use \nwill come down also. This is just not another tool in our tool kit. \nNuclear weapons have been, since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a weapon every \nnation has tried to avoid using in combat. I hope we can continue that \neffort, but I fear the language, the momentum, the incentives that have \ncreated these exceptions in the bill are driving us down the wrong \npath.\n  We should respond by amending the legislation to reflect the \ncontinuing desire to put nuclear weapons outside of use, to \ndelegitimize their use in conflict. We will have opportunity over the \nnext several days to debate in much more detail the issue of nuclear \nweapons, the issue of missile defense.\n  I believe this legislation overall is sound. If we could make \nsuccessful amendments to some of the provisions with respect to missile \ndefense and particularly the provisions with respect to nuclear \nweapons, we can send to conference a bill of which we will all be very \nproud. I hope in the next few days we can do that.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their thoughtful approach \nand for their continued efforts over the next few days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the very valued member of the \ncommittee, a graduate of West Point, served on active duty. I am not \nsure I would want to be in that company you commanded; pretty rough \ncharacter. You are too modest.\n  You referenced the $500 million added to this bill for S, and it \nsort of came out of the subcommittee. You and Senator Roberts deserve a \nlot of credit for that. That is money well invested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could ask the Senator to yield for 30 \nseconds so I could add my thanks to the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis indispensable contribution to the Armed Services Committee. He \nmentioned a few issues where he had some very strong feelings. These \nissues are just a few of the many where he has made an extraordinary \ncontribution by experience and by intellect. He is really in a position \nto add immeasurably to the work of our committee. We are all very much \nin his debt for it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nsupport for the Department of Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2004. I particularly thank Chairman Warner and ranking member Senator \nLevin for the extraordinary job they do each and every day to ensure \nour national security priorities are adequately addressed. I also thank \nthem both for continuing to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that \ndecisions are made in the best interests of the country.\n  As the new ranking member for the Personnel Subcommittee, I have \nenjoyed working with the subcommittee chairman, Senator Chambliss. I \nhope the President will take note of the complimentary remarks I am \ngoing to make about the chairman. I congratulate him for the \noutstanding leadership of this subcommittee. Together we have kept our \nfocus on doing what we can to improve the quality of life of our \nservice members, Active and Reserve, their families, our retirees, and \ncivilian employees. I particularly appreciate his personal attention \nand cooperation with me.\n  I am particularly pleased about several provisions in the \nsubcommittee mark that reflect our appreciation for the sacrifices of \nour service members and our desire to see they are adequately \ncompensated when placed in harm's way. These include a minimum pay \nraise of 3.7 percent especially for the junior service members who have \nreceived less under the administration's proposal; a change in the high \nPERSTEMPO allowance that will actually put money in the pockets of our \nservice members who deploy frequently; increases in imminent danger \npay, family separation allowances and, as Senator Collins mentioned, \nthe death gratuity; and authorization for full replacement coverage for \nlost or damaged household goods.\n  Our mark also includes provisions that address concerns and needs of \nour Reserve and National Guard service members who are serving so \nsuccessfully. These include extending survivor benefit plan annuities \nto surviving spouses of reservists who died from an injury or illness \nincurred in the line of\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nduty during inactive duty training; a requirement for specially trained \nbeneficiary counseling and assistance coordinators to help our National \nGuard and Reserve members and their families navigate the complex \nTRICARE health system; medical and dental screening and care for \nReserve component members as soon as they are alerted for deployment; \nand a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to report on the \nmobilization of the reserves that will give us the data we need to make \nneeded changes in the force mix and use of our Guard and Reserve \npersonnel.\n  I am also pleased the committee responded to legislation I introduced \nto provide a special pay incentive for Reservists, National Guard, and \nActive Duty service members who deploy for long durations. This \nincentive will help alleviate some of the hardships suffered by \nmilitary families when their loved ones are called up for lengthy or \nnumerous deployments. With the Armed Forces depending on military \nreserves for such a large percentage of troops, more and more sailors, \nsoldiers, air personnel, and marines are facing long call-ups that keep \nthem away from their regular employment. These call-ups produce a \nsevere financial hardship for the troops as their normal employment \nlives and income are disrupted, often for months, and in some cases for \nup to 2 years.\n  Finally, I fully endorse the supplemental impact aid contained in our \nmark. We simply have to ensure the schools that educate our sons and \ndaughters of military personnel have adequate funding to provide for a \nquality education. Our service members will leave, and we will be \nunable to recruit if we don't provide this for their families.\n  I greatly appreciate the bipartisan manner in which the chairman, \nSenator Chambliss, has chaired the Personnel Subcommittee, and I \nbelieve we have worked as a team and with a common goal of improving \nthe lives of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, DOD civilians, \nretirees, and the families of all these groups. I thank him for his \nexcellent leadership, and also thank his staff, Dick Walsh and Mrs. \nLewis, and Mr. Gary Leeling from the Democratic staff.\n  I again thank Chairman Warner and Senator Levin for their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his work on the \ncommittee. We value very much his contributions. He is very fair and \nopen-minded in the manner in which he makes decisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is very appropriate that our Presiding \nOfficer is the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. He and Senator \nBen Nelson have worked closely together to give us a product of which \nwe can be proud. We are very indebted to the two of you.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 696 to Amendment No. 689\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the pending \namendment, and I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 696 to amendment No. 689.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 157, line 8:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted insert the \n     following:\n       ``(f)(1) At any time after the Secretary concerned notifies \n     the commander of a unit of the Selected Reserve of the Ready \n     Reserve that all members of the unit are to be called or \n     ordered to active duty under a provision of law referred to \n     in section 101(a)(13)(B) in support of an operation mission \n     or contingency operation during a natural emergency or in \n     time of war. This shall become effective one day after \n     enactment of the bill.\n       On page 157, line 19 in lieu of the matter to be inserted \n     insert the following:\n       ``(2) A member provided medical or dental screening or care \n     under paragraph (1) may not be charged for the screening or \n     care. This section shall become effective two days after \n     enactment.\n\n     SEC. ____. EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY OF READY RESERVISTS FOR \n                   TRICARE.\n\n       (a) Eligibility.--Chapter 55 of title 10, United 5 States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1097b the \n     following new section:\n\n      ``Sec. 1097c. TRICARE program: Reserves not on active duty\n\n       ``(a) Eligibility.--A member of the Selected Reserve of the \n     Ready Reserve of the armed forces not otherwise eligible for \n     enrollment in the TRICARE program under this chapter for the \n     same benefits as a member of the armed forces eligible under \n     section 1074(a) of this title may enroll for self or for self \n     and family for the same benefits under this section.\n       ``(b) Premiums.--(1) An enlisted member of the armed forces \n     enrolled in the TRICARE program under this section shall pay \n     an annual premium of $330 for self only coverage and $560 for \n     self and family coverage for which enrolled under this \n     section.\n       ``(2) An officer of the armed forces enrolled in the \n     TRICARE program under this section shall pay an annual \n     premium of $380 for self only coverage and $610 for self and \n     family coverage for which enrolled under this section.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the \n     item relating to section 1097b the following new item:\n\n``1097c. Section 101 head.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Zell \nMiller be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I compliment Senator \nDaschle and the folks he worked with to try to come up with the \nsolution to the retention problem we are going to have. It is \ninevitable because these forces are being utilized at such rates.\n  Senator Daschle put forward an amendment that would basically allow \nGuard and Reserve personnel the benefit of health care as a condition \nof membership. I congratulate him for doing that. I have an amendment \nthat has a little bit different approach to it. We have similar \ncosponsors. The reason I am doing this is to get my amendment out so we \ncan have two looks at the same problem and see if we can address the \nconcerns that are growing in the country regarding the utilization \nrates of Guard and Reserve personnel.\n  The comment the chairman had about Senator Daschle's amendment he \nwill have about this amendment. We need to look at it. There is no \nmoney in the budget resolution for it. But I think what we are trying \nto do, in a bipartisan fashion, is put on the table for the country to \ndigest, as well as the Senate, House, and Department of Defense, what \nit is going to be like 10 or 20 years from now if we keep using Guard \nand Reserve members at the level we are doing it now.\n  The honest answer is, if you are in the Guard and Reserve, you are \ngoing to be called on more and not less because the war on terrorism \nwill go on for a while. It is not anywhere near over. Iraq has a \ncomponent to it for the Guard and Reserve. People are in Bosnia, and \nthat is a Guard function. This amendment, along with what Senator \nDaschle is trying to do, puts some new programs on the table to make it \nmore attractive to enlist in the Reserve or Guard and to stay.\n  Senator Warner's concerns are very legitimate. The force has changed. \nThe utilization rates of Guard and Reserve forces have changed. In the \nlast gulf war, I was serving at MacIntire National Guard base as a \nstaff judge advocate for the base. During that service, it was eye \nopening for me. When a Guard member is called to active duty, as our \nunits were, half of the people went over to the desert; the other half \nstayed behind. I stayed behind to provide legal services to the members \nand their families.\n  When you are called to active duty, more times than not the pay you \nreceive versus that as a civilian goes down. There are provisions under \nthe Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act to allow renegotiation of \ninterest payments, and to do some short-term things to make the burden \nof being called to active duty for a Guard or Reserve family a bit \neasier to bear. But more times than not, there is a dramatic reduction \nin income for the Guard and Reserve member called to active duty. \nSometimes these tours can last a year or more.\n  What we are trying to do is create a benefit package that is not \nbetter than the Active Forces and that complements the Guard and \nReserve forces\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nand provides an incentive that will make it more attractive to stay. If \nyou are a small business owner, as a Guard or Reserve member, sometimes \nyour business suffers greatly. As a lawyer, I was called to active duty \nfor about 100 days, so my partners had to take over my obligations. If \nI had been a sole practitioner, it would have been tough. But that is \nwhat you sign up for--to help your country.\n\n  We are suggesting to create a benefit package more like that of the \nActive Forces, and one that is more user friendly. When a Guard or \nReserve member is called to active duty, family counseling is not \nusually available at those bases. Some are at civilian airports. \nMilitary families have counseling available. They have many assets \navailable on Air Force and Army bases that provide support for the \nfamilies. Literally, the Guard and Reserve families have to make it up \nas they go.\n  Our Presiding Officer is a cosponsor of the bill. He has been a great \nadvocate of the Guard and Reserve and Active Forces.\n  We have to understand this is one big family. The Guard and Reserve \ncomponent serves in a unique way, but it is vital to the overall \nmission. What we are trying to do--Senator Daschle and myself and \nothers, in a bipartisan fashion--is address the health care problem. \nHere is what happens. If you are called to active duty and you are in \nthe civilian community, you have one set of doctors and health care \nnetwork available to you. When you are activated, you have to change \nsystems. So we are trying to create continuity of health care.\n  My main goal is to allow a Guard or Reserve member to access health \ncare in a fashion that makes health care better for the overall \nmilitary family unit. This is the difference between our approach and \nSenator Daschle's. His bill has two ways that a Guard or Reserve family \ncan have access to health care. One is that they can sign up for \nTRICARE at the same participation rate as Federal employees, and that \nwould be $420 for a single individual, $1,446 for a Guard or Reserve \nfamily.\n  Our bill allows you to be a member of TRICARE as an active-duty \nmilitary family, and your premiums would be $330 for a single enlisted \nperson, $560 for enlisted families, $380 for a single officer, $610 for \nan officer's family. Basically, we have taken what a military retiree \nwould pay in premiums to be a member of TRICARE and added $100 in \nadditional costs for an enlisted person, $150 for an officer. That is \nstill a great deal. It lowers the cost. It is cheaper to the military \nfamilies in Senator Daschle's approach.\n  The big difference between our amendments is that, under Senator \nDaschle's amendment, the Federal Government--the military could pay a \nsubsidy to the private sector health insurance company covering the \nmilitary person, the Guard or Reserve person.\n  My concern with that is the study that we have seen suggests it may \nbe that up to 90 percent Guard or Reserve people will choose an option \nwhere the Government subsidizes health care in the private sector. My \ngoal is to get more people into TRICARE to make it better for the \noverall military family, and at affordable rates.\n  It is a distinction that matters somewhat. But the point of both of \nthese amendments is to provide health care to Guard and Reserve \nfamilies that has a continuity component and that is affordable. We \nneed to address this as a nation because you have given some numbers on \nthe other side about how many Guard or Reserve families don't have \nhealth care or adequate health care. Both bills take us in that \ndirection. The key difference is, under my proposal, it would work in a \nbipartisan fashion with Senator Clinton and others. A Guard or Reserve \nfamily, or military person, would be in the TRICARE system like their \nactive-duty component, giving a boost to TRICARE overall.\n  I wanted to bring this amendment to the floor. I congratulate Senator \nDaschle and all the Republicans and Democrats, including both of my \ncolleagues from Georgia, Senators Miller and Chambliss. Senator Clinton \nappeared at a news conference when we unveiled the bill. Let me tell \nyou, she has been terrific to work with. We are probably polar \nopposites in terms of political ideology most times, but to have her \njoin this cause and help push this bill is a testament to the power of \nthis bill and of this issue.\n  With that said, I offer the amendment. I hope our colleagues will \nlook at what both amendments do. I hope colleagues will look seriously \nat this body trying to provide, as soon as possible in the future, in a \nresponsible way, health care to the entire military family unit.\n  That unit does include in a substantial way Guard and Reserve \nmembers, and they are part of the military family. We cannot do a \nmission without the Guard and Reserve. We do not want to have a better \nbenefits package. We want to have an attractive benefits package that \nwill be good for retention and recruitment. That is the spirit in which \nthis amendment is offered.\n  The chairman's concerns are legitimate. This has been scored at $1.4 \nbillion a year. Senator Daschle's amendment is $1.2 billion a year, but \nthey are not taking into account that under their proposal, many people \nwould not go into TRICARE but ask for payments for their health care in \nthe private sector.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I feel obligated to be consistent, even though there is a \nvery clear difference between Senator Graham's amendment and that of \nthe distinguished Democratic leader. There is no offset; is that my \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. That is correct. It is not paid for.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator clearly has indicated the first year may be \n$400 million to $500 million.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes, $400 million.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the event this is carried by the \nSenate, goes to conference and survives, conferees will have to search \nwithin the confines of the bill to raise that money. My understanding \nis it is about $2 billion in the outyears per year; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I think it is $1.4 billion, and Senator \nDaschle's amendment is $1.2 billion, but the points are well made.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, I have to indicate my opposition. \nRegrettably, I do that, but I wish to be consistent and fair to all \nSenators. I am fearful if we do not carefully evaluate the whole \npanoply of amendments that are likely to come forward to improve the \nbenefits for the Guard and Reserve, we are going to end up with a bill \nthat might go tilt.\n  I must say, though, I certainly share the Senator's views that the \nGuard and Reserve have done wonderful service, together with their \nfamilies. It is exceedingly hard for these families to let their loved \nones go on these missions. We shall look at it on the morrow. I thank \nthe Senator for his courtesies.\n  (Mr. ENSIGN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield--we are trying to \nfigure out the numbers on this--just for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps we can get the numbers clarified overnight. \nSenator Daschle's estimate, after the first few years, where, I guess, \nthere is a phase-in of some kind, is $1.2 billion, as the Senator from \nSouth Carolina indicated. I am trying to understand why that number \nmight be lower than the number of the Senator from South Carolina, \ngiven the fact that under Senator Daschle's approach, the service \nmembers could keep their private insurance and then have it reimbursed \nby the Defense Department, which would seem to be a better deal for the \nservice member. The service member has an option to maintain his \nprivate insurance but, on the other hand, might have a larger cost to \nthe Government. I wonder if the numbers of the two amendments come from \nthe same place and looking at the same time.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. That is a very good question. Here is \nmy understanding of how those numbers relate to each other.\n  The cost to the Government under Senator Daschle's package is $1.2 \nbillion per year. The package I am offering is $1.4 billion. So it is \nmore costly to the Government with the way it is constructed at this \npoint. To the military member, it is several hundred dollars a month \nand more advantageous with our proposal.\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\n  Senator Daschle's proposal takes a 78-percent participation rate that \nall of us pay in the Federal health care program. What I do is take the \nretiree contribution to TRICARE and add $100 for enlisted and $150 for \nofficers.\n  Here is the big difference: By having the second option where the \nFederal Government will pay an unknown amount of the premium that a \nReserve or Guard member has in the private sector and is not identified \nhow much we will pay, that changes the participation rates \ndramatically.\n  We have been told, under our proposal, it is a 70-percent \nparticipation rate. Under Senator Daschle's proposal, it is 50 percent. \nWhen you include the component of where we would pay to subsidize the \nprivate health care, it could go up to 90 percent in terms of that \ncomponent, and nobody knows what that cost is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator indicating the cost of maintaining the \nprivate care option is not included in the estimates that Senator \nDaschle received?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. The participation rates are at 80,000. \nThey are basing the current numbers on the 2002, 80,000 reservists \nmobilized. They are telling us that is not a true number; that, in \nreality, if this second option were offered, they would go from 80,000 \nto almost 350,000, and that has to be included.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the Senator is suggesting--it is important to get these \nnumbers straightened out overnight--that the cost to the Government of \nthe second option that Senator Daschle offers, which is to maintain \nprivate insurance, that cost is not included in the estimate which was \ngiven to Senator Daschle?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. It is not included in the true form. It \nhas as a cost estimate using 80,000 reservists when, in fact, they tell \nus the participation rates will be three times higher than that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In which case the estimate would not be accurate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are going to ask our staffs to take a look at this \nissue overnight. There is a real difference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1050, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004. Before \ntalking about this bill, I wish to comment on what my colleague from \nSouth Carolina just talked about with respect to his amendment on \nhealth care.\n  I commend both he and Senator Daschle for their leadership on this \nparticular issue. We are in some very difficult times in America from a \nmilitary perspective. We are calling on our Guard and Reserve more and \nmore every single day. We want to do more to provide the benefits to \nattract high-quality men and women into the Guard and Reserve and \nretain them once we get them there.\n  We are getting our fair share of America's finest into the Guard and \nReserve, and anything we can do from a benefits standpoint to make sure \nwe continue to do that and to keep them there are issues we certainly \nneed to look at.\n  I personally like the concept of Senator Graham a little better than \nSenator Daschle's, although I am not in any way critical of Senator \nDaschle's amendment. What I like about Senator Graham's amendment is \nthat we have a health care benefit within the active military that is \ncalled TRICARE. TRICARE is a fairly new health program which provides \nhealth care benefits to our active-duty personnel.\n  We have had some problems with TRICARE in getting it implemented, but \nwe have gotten most of those kinks in TRICARE worked out. What Senator \nGraham's amendment will do versus Senator Daschle's amendment is to \nstrengthen TRICARE, and I think anything we can do to strengthen \nTRICARE and have it benefit the active duty, as well as the Guard and \nReserve, is an approach we ought to use.\n  I commend both Senators. Senator Graham has particularly taken a \nleadership role with regard to this issue. I certainly have enjoyed \nworking with him on it.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel within the Armed \nServices Committee, it has been a distinct honor and privilege for this \nfreshman Senator to work with Senator Warner and Senator Levin. They \nare two men during my 8 years in the House of Representatives for whom \nI came to have great respect and great admiration, not just for their \nleadership on armed services issues, but on other matters as well, and \nto have the opportunity to work with them in the very close way I have \nhad the chance to do over the last several months since becoming a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee has been a distinct pleasure for \nme. They have certainly worked well together and worked in a bipartisan \nway within the committee to make sure we did produce a bipartisan bill.\n  America's defense is not a political issue. It is not a Republican \nissue or a Democratic issue. It is an American issue. These two \ngentlemen have provided the type of leadership America so desperately \nlikes to see when it comes to any issue, but particularly with respect \nto defense issues.\n  I commend my ranking member, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska. First of \nall, Senator Nelson is a very gracious and grand American gentleman. \nThe Senator from Nebraska has a number of military installations he \nrepresents, and to have the chance to visit with him on issues that are \nunique to Nebraska versus issues that are unique to Georgia has really \nbeen a delight for me.\n  What I have enjoyed doing most of all in working with Senator Nelson \nis talking about issues that are of concern to our men and women in the \nmilitary with respect to quality of life, educating their children, \npaying them greater benefits, whether it is pay raises or health care \nbenefits or whatever. There is no greater champion for the men and \nwomen in our military uniforms than Senator Ben Nelson. I have truly \nenjoyed working with him and am very pleased we were able to craft a \nsection of the Defense Authorization Act for 2004 together, and to do \nso in a very bipartisan way.\n  The committee recommended authorization of $99.2 billion for military \npersonnel, an increase of $4.8 billion over the fiscal year 2003 \nauthorization. It also approved several key provisions I will outline \nthat fulfill our committee's express goal of continuing our commitment \nto improving the quality of life for the men and women of the Armed \nForces--active duty, Reserve, Guard, and Retired--and their families.\n  S. 1050 authorizes an across-the-board pay raise of 3.7 percent for \nall military personnel. Additionally, targeted pay raises ranging from \n5.25 percent to 6.25 percent are authorized for warrant officers and \nthe Service's most experienced noncommissioned officers. These pay \nraises, along with existing incentive pays and bonuses, will continue \nto make careers in the military more attractive and send the message to \nall active and Reserve component personnel that their service in \nuniform is invaluable.\n  Following up on the initiative taken by the Senate in the Emergency \nWartime Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2003, the \ncommittee recommended permanent increases in the family separation \nallowance, from $100 to $250 a month, and in hostile fire, imminent \ndanger pay from $150 a month to $250 a month. The subcommittee also \nsupported legislative changes to high deployment pay proposed by DoD \nthat will require close tracking of individual deployments and \nappropriately compensate those members who are repeatedly called away \nfrom their home bases for extended periods of time. These increases \nrecognize the sacrifices made by military personnel and their loved \nones who endure separations and the harsh realities of defending the \nNation in the global war on terrorism.\n  The committee approved an incentive pay of $100 a month for military \npersonnel stationed in Korea. Arduous working conditions, substandard \nhousing, and tours of duty unaccompanied by family members are \nhallmarks of duty in Korea. As the Nation marks the fourth and final \nyear of the United States' 50th Anniversary of the Korean War \nCommemoration, and as the need for continuing vigilance on the Korean \nPeninsula becomes ever clear, thus additional compensation for service \nmembers in Korea is fully justified.\n\n  The subcommittee members were very concerned about the welfare of\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nsurvivors of all deceased military personnel--active duty, Reserve, and \nRetired. The committee accepted our recommendations to double the death \ngratuity from $6,000 to $12,000 retroactive to 9/11, 2001, and to \nextend automatic survivor benefit plan benefits to survivors of \ninactive duty Reservists who die while serving on active duty.\n  The committee responded to requests from the Department of Defense \nfor assistance in force shaping by authorizing a new incentive pay for \nmilitary personnel in overmanned ratings to encourage them to accept \nthe challenge of converting to ratings and military occupational \nspecialties that are experiencing shortages.\n  The committee responded to concerns about the operation of TRICARE \nstandard, directing the Secretary of Defense to take necessary measures \nto ensure the adequacy of this TRICARE option.\n  The committee approved a proposal that will authorize unlimited use \nof military commissaries by qualifying members of the Ready Reserve. \nThe ``citizen soldiers'' of the Guard and Reserve, who have so ably \nanswered the Nation's call, before and after the attack of September \n2001, deserve full access to this important benefit of service.\n  The committee authorized additional Army National Guard and Air \nNational Guard full-time support personnel to assist in fielding 12 \nadditional weapons of mass destruction civil support teams. Upon \nimplementation, this will raise the total number of teams nationwide to \n44.\n  The committee included a provision that will facilitate medical and \ndental screening and medical care for members of the Selected Reserve \nwho are assigned to units that have been alerted for mobilization. The \ncommittee also included a provision that will ensure that Guard and \nReserve leaders are eligible for command responsibility pay.\n  These are only a few highlights of S. 1050 which, I believe, indicate \nour sincere commitment to our troops and their families. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Personnel, I am proud to be a part of ensuring that \nwe meet that commitment.\n  I will take a minute to commend our staff. As many hours as we put \nin--it is now 7:15 tonight and we will be going later than that--staff \nput in many more hours than we did. To my committee staffers, Dick \nWalsh and Patty Lewis, we say thank you for a great job and for all of \nyour hard work and dedication to the men and women in uniform, and to \nGary Leeling, who is the Democratic staffer who has worked so closely \nwith Dick and Patty.\n  This has been a joint effort on the part of all three of these \nstaffers. The same way Senator Nelson and I have worked in a bipartisan \nway, these folks have worked in a bipartisan way.\n  Gary, we say thanks to you for a terrific job on behalf of all of our \nmen and women.\n  Again, I thank Senator Nelson for his outstanding work and his \ncooperation. It has been a pleasure to work with him. We cannot say \nenough about the great leadership Senator Warner and Senator Levin, and \ntheir service to our country, particularly their service to the men and \nwomen who serve in uniform in every branch of our military. They are \ndoing a terrific job of making sure the American military is second to \nno other military in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before our distinguished colleague departs \nthe floor, I appreciate his thoughtful comments, but I guarantee him--\nSenator Levin and I have been doing this now for 25 years, but we are \nno stronger than the members we have on the committee. When the Senator \nfrom Georgia joined us, our strength increased. I intend to get that \nwork product out of him 100 percent. I thank him for joining us, and \nfor all he does on this committee and for the men and women in the \nArmed Forces.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Members of the Senate who \nparticipated in the progress today. We have had good colloquies and \nstrong statements. We have two pending amendments. I hope the \nrespective leaders tomorrow can establish a time for voting on those \namendments. Senator Levin and myself are going to be right here from \nroughly 10 a.m. on. I am hopeful that other amendments can be brought \nforward. We are anxious--and it is a bipartisan desire--to move this \nbill at its earliest time because we have important legislative \nmeasures that must be addressed this week prior to the recess that is \nscheduled.\n\n  One more of great significance is action on the debt limit. I am \nquite sure we are not going to leave town until that is in place.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 697\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk and I ask unanimous consent \nthe pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 697.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \n service-connected disability to receive both military retired pay by \n reason of their years of military service and disability compensation \n     from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 644.

This is an amendment we have offered on a number of \noccasions.\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\nWe worked well with the two managers of the bill. This deals with \nconcurrent receipts. This amendment is offered on my behalf and that of \nSenator Dorgan. I understand, with the strict rules we are working \nunder this year, that this amendment may not be relevant according to \nthe rule now before the Senate.\n  I ask the Chair to rule on whether or not this amendment is relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nnot relevant.\n  Mr. REID. I accept the ruling of the Chair. I am disappointed. This \nis a very important issue. As I say, Senator Dorgan and I feel very \nstrongly about this, and the two managers of the bill have been most \ngenerous in their work in conference. In the past, we have gotten \nnothing in the House; everything we have done has been in the Senate.\n  I will look for another vehicle to move this forward in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished leader. For many years now the \nSenator has taken strong leadership on this issue. At some point in \ntime, the Senate and Congress as a whole will have to face this issue. \nI recognize that this is not a relevant amendment pursuant to the \nconsent agreement and we cannot proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me add my thanks to the Senator from \nNevada for two things: First, for his faithful commitment to this \nissue. Currently, we see it as an issue of the Senator from Nevada and \nthe Senator from North Dakota and a number of other Senators who have \njoined to try to bring equity in this area. We made at least some \nprogress; it is because of their energy we have made the progress we \nhave.\n  Second, I thank him for his acceptance of the ruling of the Chair. It \nis very important he does that because all Members need to accept the \nrulings of the Chair in the absence, it seems to me, of some \noverwhelming unusual precedent that would allow us to try to overrule \nthe Chair. The whip's, the Democratic whip's approach is one which I \nthink reflects the best traditions and the best instincts of this body. \nI thank him.\n  It also helped Senator Warner and I to complete this bill within the \nparameters of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 697) was withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6598-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the FY2004 budget resolution adopted last \nmonth includes a provision to uncover waste, fraud and abuse in Federal \nGovernment spending. Today marks the beginning of a transparent and \ndeliberative process that will be undertaken by Committees in the House \nand Senate to control Federal spending.\n  Specifically, the budget resolution requires the Chairman of the \nCommittee on the Budget in both the House and Senate to place in the \nCongressional Record specified levels of savings for each authorizing \ncommittee. Chairman Nussle and I have developed a joint set of targets \nthat requests each authorizing committee to report back with \nrecommended savings proposals amounting to 1 percent of the committee's \ntotal mandatory spending. I will work with Senate committees to ensure \nthat the savings target meaningfully represents the opportunities to \nfind improvements in the programs under each committee's jurisdiction.\n  Pursuant to section 301(b) of H. Con. Res. 95, I submit the following \nspecified levels of savings for Senate Committees. Given these savings \ntargets, the budget resolution further requires committees to submit, \nby September 2, 2003, to the Budget Committee their findings that \nidentify changes in law within their jurisdiction that would produce \nthe specified savings. The reports submitted by committees will guide \nus in the preparation of future budget resolutions and will help us all \nimprove program oversight.\n  It is my hope that the committees will enthusiastically join Chairman \nNussle and me in this effort to root out waste, fraud and abuse. As \ntrustees of taxpayer dollars, Members of Congress must insist that \nlimited resources not be squandered. Federal spending has been growing \nat unsustainable levels. Congress cannot become lax in its duty to \nperform the necessary oversight on Federal spending.\n  Often we find that Federal programs--ignored over time--become \nsusceptible to waste, fraud or abuse. For example, according to a \nGeneral Accounting Office report released in January of this year, \nMedicaid has been added for the first time to the GAO's high-risk list, \n``owing to the program's size, growth, diversity, and fiscal management \nweaknesses.''\n  Limited oversight has afforded States and health care providers the \nopportunity to increase Federal funding inappropriately. States are \nable to take advantage of funding schemes which supplant State Medicaid \ndollars with Federal Medicaid dollars by overpaying State-owned \nfacilities and requiring the local government to transfer the excess \nback to the State. These dollars are then siphoned away from Medicaid \npatients and often are used for other purposes. Without proper \noversight this and other program abuses can persist for years.\n  Other recent examples of abuse include a finding by the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of Education that nearly 23 percent of \nstudent loan recipients whose loans were discharged due to disability \nclaims were gainfully employed. Additionally, the Office of Management \nand Budget has estimated that more than $8 billion in erroneous earned \nincome tax payments are made each year. These situations are \nunacceptable. The work that the Senate and House will undertake will \nresult in reforms in these and other instances of misspent Federal \nresources.\n  Chairman Nussle and I have put in place a project specifically \ndesigned to draw upon the knowledge and experience of Senate experts in \nthese programs. The savings resulting from this effort will not be \narbitrary; they will be developed through sound and thoughtful \nconsiderations by those who know the programs best. I look forward to \nworking with all the committee chairmen who will be reporting their \nfindings and am committed to making this a success.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the above-mentioned spending levels be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            SAVINGS FROM 1 PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION IN MANDATORY SPENDING BY AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE\n                                     [By fiscal year in billions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Senate:                                          2004       2004-08      2004-13\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry...............................

Mr. President, many of us are increasingly concerned \nabout the unfair restrictions on non-profit legal services providers \nunder current Federal law who receive both Federal funds and private \nfunds.\n  In 1996, Congress severely weakened the ability of many legal service \nproviders to represent needy clients.\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nUnder the restrictions enacted that year, organizations that receive \nfunds from the Legal Services Corporation are no longer permitted to \nuse private funds to represent certain categories of low-income \nclients. The only way these providers now offer assistance to these \nclients is to set up a separate office that receives no Federal funds. \nTo do so has turned out to be prohibitive for many for many grantees of \nthe corporation.\n  The restrictions impose high costs on legal services providers and \nunwarranted governmental interference with their other charitable \ninitiatives, and they undermine the promise of equal justice for their \nclients.\n  Often, the results of these restrictions have been devastating. Many \nfaith-based organizations that represent the poor have decided not to \naccept funds from the corporation, so that they can continue to help \nlow-income clients to meet their basic legal needs. In fact, the \nadministration is now in court defending the law, even though it \nburdens the use of private philanthropy by grantees of the corporation. \nIf the administration prevails in court, it will have created a legal \nprecedent that jeopardizes the President's faith-based initiatives.\n  The corporation's grantees should be treated in the same way that all \nother non-profit organizations, both secular and faith-based, are \ntreated. They should be allowed to use their private funds to alleviate \nthe critical need for legal services. The restrictions are an unjust \nbarrier for the Nation's neediest individuals and families who need our \nhelp the most. I urge my colleagues to remove these restrictions and to \nreopen the doors of justice for those who are unable to afford the \nlegal representation they deserve in protecting their basic rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Chronicle of \nPhilanthropy earlier this year and an article from the Legal Times last \nfall on this issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Chronicle of Philanthropy Feb. 20, 2003]\n\n             White House Takes Opposing Views on Charities\n\n                           (By Laura K. Abel)\n\n       President Bush's Budget for fiscal 2004, submitted to \n     Congress this month, contains millions in federal dollars to \n     help religious groups. That follows his executive order in \n     December in which he commanded sweeping changes he said would \n     ``remove barriers that prevent faith-based and grass-roots \n     groups from doing more to help Americans in need.''\n       The executive order put in place many of the ideas Mr. Bush \n     has been pressing Congress to pass, but which have been \n     stalled by debate over the propriety of mixing government and \n     religion. The executive order, which allows federally \n     financed charities to display religious icons and follow the \n     tenets of their faith in selecting employees, is almost \n     certain to be challenged in federal court by people seeking \n     to protect firm separation of church and state.\n       But Mr. Bush has even more to worry about than court action \n     by his political opponents. His own administration is causing \n     plenty of potential trouble by arguing in a New York court to \n     establish a legal precedent that could lead to the unraveling \n     of Mr. Bush's efforts to help religious groups.\n       The court case at issue involves the Legal Services \n     Corporation, which uses federal funds to provide lawyers in \n     civil cases to people who cannot afford them. The corporation \n     is being sued by nonprofit legal-aid groups that hope to \n     prove that a law Congress passed in 1996, and a regulation \n     issued to carry out that law, are unconstitutional. Under the \n     law and regulation, legal aid programs that receive even a \n     dollar from the Legal Services Corporation are required to \n     separate their government-financed activities from certain \n     privately supported activities in ways that are both \n     impractical and very costly to administer. Among the \n     privately supported activities that must be kept separate: \n     helping asylum seekers who need court protection against \n     abusive spouses, helping victims of predatory lenders testify \n     before their legislatures, and representing children seeking \n     improved public schools.\n       The regulation the administration is defending requires \n     legal-aid programs to keep those activities physically \n     separate from their government-financed activities. It also \n     limits the ability of legal-aid employees to divide their \n     time between federally supported activities and activities \n     the government won't support.\n       The result is that the programs' scarce private charitable \n     donations must either be used only for programs that the \n     federal government wants to support or be diverted to \n     establishing separate facilities and employing separate \n     personnel. Though the idea of keeping federally financed and \n     charitably financed activities separate may seem appropriate \n     to some, what it has meant in practice is that for nonprofit \n     legal-aid groups to receive federal funds, they must give up \n     doing some of the things that their clients most need. And \n     foundations and other private donors that want to support \n     legal-aid groups often find that some of the projects they \n     most want to support can't be carried out.\n       For instance, when South Brooklyn Legal Services received a \n     grant from the New York Foundation to help small groups that \n     provide child care, it wanted to use some of the money to \n     take New York City to court to protect the rights of those \n     providers. The city, which reimburses the child-care \n     providers for their services, had been shortchanging them by \n     calculating the reimbursement based on a four-week month \n     rather than on the more accurate 4.3-week month. But because \n     the South Brooklyn group receives some money from the Legal \n     Services Corporation, it could not undertake such a lawsuit \n     even with its money from the New York Foundation. To do so it \n     would have had to set up two separate offices. It didn't have \n     the money to do that, so it had to drop the idea of the \n     lawsuit and instead use its foundation grant only in ways \n     that the federal government allowed.\n       That is precisely the type of roadblock to charitable \n     giving and nonprofit entrepreneurship that the Bush \n     administration seeks to remove in its efforts to help \n     religious groups. Last month, for instance, the \n     administration said that churches, synagogues, and other \n     houses of worship could obtain federal construction aid so \n     long as at least part of the building was used to provide \n     social services. To be sure, the administration said federal \n     aid couldn't be used to construct sanctuaries or other parts \n     of the building used for worship, but it did not require \n     separate staff members or other administrative approaches to \n     separating the government-subsidized activities from those \n     supported entirely by private sources. And in his executive \n     order, the president allowed organizations to conduct \n     federally financed activities in rooms with religious symbols \n     hanging on the wall, and to permit employees to split time \n     between religious and federally financed activities.\n       The president's goal is obvious: to avoid requiring \n     nonprofit groups, like the religious ones he wants to help, \n     to operate two entirely separate facilities in which to \n     conduct their federally financed activities and their \n     privately supported ones. If he wants to protect religious \n     groups from having to operate entirely separate sets of \n     facilities, even at the risk of being sued for violating the \n     separation of church and state, why is he willing to impose \n     such a requirement on legal-aid groups that serve the same \n     needy people?\n       It's not just for consistency's sake that Mr. Bush should \n     change his administration's position in the Legal Services \n     Corporation case. In that case, the legal-aid programs argue \n     that, because the activities they are forced to keep separate \n     constitute ``speech'' protected by the First Amendment to the \n     U.S. Constitution, the government is constitutionally \n     prohibited from imposing a requirement that the activities be \n     kept separate. What's more, they say the government isn't \n     allowed to make those activities more expensive and more \n     complicated unless it has sufficient justification. In its \n     court filings, the government responds that it will seem \n     to be endorsing the work of legal-aid programs unless \n     activities the government supports are clearly separated \n     from the charitably financed legal-aid activities the \n     government does not want to support.\n       If that argument is upheld by the court, then won't the \n     government be endorsing the views of religious groups unless \n     it requires completely separate operations? To comply with \n     the constitutional mandate not to endorse religion, the \n     government will have to require the same amount of separation \n     between the religious activities of charities and the \n     activities that the federal government supports as it \n     requires for legal-aid programs. Religious groups that \n     receive any federal funds will then need to conduct their \n     religious activities in separate offices, and to maintain \n     tight limits on the ability of employees to split their time \n     between federally financed and religious activities.\n       If the president really wants his faith-based plan to pass \n     constitutional muster, he should change his strategy on the \n     Legal Services Corporation case now and give legal-aid groups \n     the freedom they deserve.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Legal Times, Sept. 30, 2002]\n\n Drawing Lines for Dollars--Scientists Get Federal and Private Funding \n              Under One Roof. Why Can't Legal Aid Lawyers?\n\n                           (By Laura K. Abel)\n\n       No one has ever called the stem cell debate rational or \n     straightforward. But when it comes to understanding how the \n     government tries to control privately funded initiatives--\n     even in seemingly unrelated areas like civil legal aid for \n     the poor--the stem cell debate can be brilliantly \n     illuminating.\n       In 2001, President George W. Bush warned that ``a \n     fundamental moral line'' prevented the federal government \n     from endorsing or funding stem cell research that would \n     result in ``further destruction of human embryos.'' Based on \n     the president's directive, and on federal policy in place \n     since 1994, scientists working on stem cell research had been \n     compelled to establish two separate laboratories: one for \n     their publicly funded stem cell research, the other for the \n     privately funded stem cell research prohibited by the federal \n     government.\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\n       Such duplication is incredibly expensive. Who can afford \n     two sets of laboratory equipment? What scientist wants to \n     squander precious time moving back and forth between labs? \n     What edge in conquering disease is lost when scientists \n     operate in relative isolation from each other, without the \n     benefit of views routinely shared by colleagues occupying the \n     same office space? How many talented scientists avoid the \n     entire field of stem cell research because of these \n     bureaucratic hurdles?\n\n\n                          side-by-side dollars\n\n       Recognizing these concerns, this past spring the National \n     Institutes of Health told government-funded scientists that \n     it is OK to conduct privately funded stem cell research \n     alongside their federally funded research, so long as they \n     use rigorous bookkeeping methods to ensure that only private \n     dollars pay for the stem cell experiments. This directive \n     follows governmentwide accounting standards that have been in \n     place for more than a quarter-century.\n       Lawyers for the poor whose work is financed with both \n     federal and private funding have been paying close attention \n     to the NIH's instructions. In 1996, Congress prohibited these \n     legal aid lawyers from using private funds to engage in a \n     wide range of activities. These activities include \n     representing low-income people in class actions, representing \n     many documented immigrants, representing clients before \n     legislatures and administrative agencies, and many other \n     important activities. The Legal Services Corp., which funnels \n     the federal money to the lawyers . . . order to engage in \n     these activities they must set up physically separate offices \n     that receive no federal funding.\n       Like the federally funded scientists, lawyers representing \n     the poor have found operating out of two sets of offices to \n     be wasteful, duplicative, and bureaucratic. Ultimately, it is \n     vulnerable clients who suffer the consequences. Just as the \n     forced duplication of research drains resources from efforts \n     to cure diseases, the forced duplication of legal aid \n     programs drains resources needed by low-income women seeking \n     protection from domestic violence, children attempting to \n     secure essential medical treatment, elderly citizens fighting \n     predatory lenders, and farmers struggling to save their land.\n       Under the current rules, lawyers are forced to pay for two \n     sets of offices, computer systems, and other equipment. \n     Lawyers must spend time commuting between different offices, \n     wasting time that their clients desperately need. And, \n     perhaps most destructive of all is the effect on lawyers \n     conducting class action litigation offering the prospect of \n     relief to substantial numbers of individuals. Those lawyers \n     paid for with private money find it hard to communicate with \n     the lawyers working to meet day-to-day legal needs of \n     individual clients with federal funding, making both sets of \n     lawyers less effective.\n       Legal aid lawyers and their clients find hope in the NIH's \n     common-sense policy clarification. The federal government \n     wants neither to fund, nor to endorse, forbidden stem cell \n     research. The NIH policy, which reflects cost principles that \n     have been in place since at least the Reagan administration, \n     recognizes that physically separate facilities are not needed \n     to achieve these goals. All that is required is adherence to \n     rigorous bookkeeping practices that follow accepted \n     accounting principles, so that auditors can determine that \n     government funds were not spent on the disallowed activities.\n\n\n                           THE SAME SOLUTION\n\n       It would seem that Congress should embrace this same \n     solution for its concerns about LSC grantees, allowing the \n     duplication and inefficiencies faced by legal aid to come to \n     a stop. But instead, the government has spent the last five \n     years in federal court, relentlessly resisting a \n     constitutional challenge to the physical-separation \n     requirement for legal aid lawyers.\n       The government's inconsistent positions in the stem cell \n     research context and in the legal aid context are surprising. \n     The importance of medical research weighs . . . unimpeded \n     with private funding. There are equally strong (if not \n     stronger) policy and constitutional arguments in favor of \n     allowing legal aid lawyers to use their private funding to \n     represent low-income clients who would otherwise have no \n     access to our system of justice.\n       After all, there is no federal policy against using the \n     class action mechanism. Indeed, Congress and the courts have \n     recognized that class actions can have significant benefits \n     for litigants and for the judicial system. Nor is there a \n     federal policy against providing the representation that \n     helps protect immigrants against exploitation (and in the \n     process assists courts that would otherwise have to expend \n     resources dealing with unrepresented litigants). Nor is there \n     a federal policy against helping low-income individuals \n     educate legislatures about the problems facing their \n     communities. On the contrary, the interests of equal justice \n     for all are better served when legal aid attorneys engage in \n     each of these activities.\n       This lack of a policy justification for the physical-\n     separation requirement is particularly appalling because the \n     requirement intrudes on the constitutionally protected \n     ability of legal aid lawyers and their clients to associate \n     together in order to enforce the clients' rights. As the \n     Supreme Court has warned, ``Collective activity undertaken to \n     obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right \n     within the protection of the First Amendment.''\n       For many thousands of poor people, legal aid offices that \n     receive some federal funding offer the only avenue to \n     justice. And, for many legal aid clients, it is about even \n     more than justice. Like the patients who hope stem cell \n     research will save their lives, they are focused on basic \n     survival: a roof over their heads, escape from a batterer, \n     the ability to buy food and protect their children. By \n     requiring costly physical separation instead of the standard \n     accounting practices that can ensure that federal dollars do \n     not fund certain types of legal aid, Congress and the LSC \n     have severely hobbled legal aid advocates, undermining their \n     efficiency, interrupting their clients' lives, and impeding \n     the goal of equal justice for all. Justice demands that the \n     re-examine this decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6600-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6600-S6612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASBESTOS REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

He served as a field artillery \nfire controlman for 4 years and completed his enlistment as a corporal \nin April 1999.\n  Subsequently, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and attended the Utility \nHelicopter Maintainers Course at Fort Eustis, VA. There he earned his \nwings, and proudly became an air crewmember. Immediately afterwards, he \nwas assigned to the 5th Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment in \nGiebelstadt, Germany. In 3 years there, he deployed six times and \nlogged over 500 hours flying. In October 2002, William extended \noverseas and moved to his sister unit, B Company, of the 5th Battalion, \n158th Aviation Regiment, in Aviano, Italy. In January 2003, he departed \nfor Kuwait as part of the 11th Aviation Task Force.\n  In his U.S. Army career, he received the Army Achievement Medal, \nNational Defense Service Ribbon, and the Good Conduct Medal.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my happiness over \nthe Senate passage of the ``Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of \n2003 in the early morning hours of last Friday. I thank Senators Graham \nof South Carolina, Collins, Jeffords, Sarbanes, Schumer, Durbin, \nLandrieu, Nelson of Florida, Clinton, Snowe, Kohl, Smith, Stabenow, \nKennedy, and\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\nDayton for joining me as cosponsors of this multi-partisan legislation \nthat will improve the Department of Justice's Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits, PSOB, Program by allowing families of public safety officers \nwho suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes to qualify for federal \nsurvivor benefits. I also thank Senator Minority Leader Tom Daschle for \nhis hard work to pass our bill through the Senate last Friday at 2:30 \nAM. Without his perseverance, passage of this bill would not have \nhappened.\n  I also thank each of our Nation's brave firefighters, emergency \nmedical rescuers and law enforcement officers for the jobs they do for \nthe American public day in and day out. Our public safety officers are \noften the first to respond to any crime or emergency situation. On \nSeptember 11, the Nation saw that the first on the scene at the World \nTrade Center were the heroic firefighters, police officers and \nemergency personnel of New York City. These real-life heroes, many of \nwhom gave the ultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is to \nsupport our state and local public safety partners.\n  I commend Congressmen Etheridge, Weldon, Hoyer and Oxley for their \nleadership and fortitude during the last Congress on an identical bill \nin the House. I look forward to working with them, as well as House \nJudiciary Chairman, Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers, to pass \nour Senate bill through the House and send it to the President's desk \nfor passage into law as soon as possible.\n  Our legislation has received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order \nof Police, National Association of Police Organizations, International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, Congressional Fire Services Institute, \nInternational Association of Arson Investigators, International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire Fighters, \nNational Fire Protection Association, National Volunteer Fire Council, \nNorth American Fire Training Directors, International Fire Buff \nAssociates, National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, \nAmerican Ambulance Association, the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees, along with over 50 additional national \norganizations. I thank all of these organizations for their unwavering \nsupport for this legislation.\n  Public safety officers are our most brave and dedicated public \nservants. I applaud the efforts of all members of fire, law \nenforcement, and EMS providers nationwide who are the first to respond \nto more than 1.6 million emergency calls annually--whether those calls \ninvolve a crime, fire, medical emergency, spill of hazardous materials, \nnatural disaster, act of terrorism, or transportation accident--without \nreservation. Those men and women act with an unwavering commitment to \nthe safety and protection of their fellow citizens, and forever willing \nto selflessly sacrifice their own lives to provide safe and reliable \nemergency services to their communities.\n  Sadly, that kind of dedication can result in tragedy, which was \nreaped in abundance at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on \nSeptember 11, when scores of firefighters, police officers and medics \nraced into the jaws of danger with no other goal than to save lives. \nEvery year, hundreds of public safety officers nationwide lose their \nlives and thousands more are injured while performing duties that \nsubject them to great physical risks. And while we know that PSOB \nbenefits can never be a substitute for the loss of a loved one, the \nfamilies of all our fallen heroes deserve to collect these funds.\n  The PSOB Program was established in 1976 to authorize a one-time \nfinancial payment to the eligible survivors of Federal, State, and \nlocal public safety officers for all line of duty deaths. In 2001, \nCongress improved the PSOB Program by streamlining the process for \nfamilies of public safety officers killed or injured in connection with \nprevention, investigation, rescue or recovery efforts related to a \nterrorist attack. We also retroactively increased the total benefits \navailable by $100,000 as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. The Program now \nprovides approximately $262,000 in benefits to the families of first \nresponders killed in the line of duty.\n  Unfortunately, the issue of covering heart attack and stroke victims \nin the PSOB Program was not addressed at that time.\n  When establishing the PSOB Program, Congress placed only three \nlimitations on the payment of benefits. No award could be paid, first, \nif the death was caused by the intentional misconduct of the officer or \nby such officer's intention to bring about his own death; second, if \nvoluntary intoxication of the officer was the proximate cause of such \nofficer's death; or, third, to any person otherwise entitled to a \nbenefit if such person's action was a substantial contributing factor \nto the death of the officer.\n  In years following, however, the Justice Department began to \ninterpret the Program's guidelines to exclude from benefits the \nsurvivors of public safety officer who die of a heart attack or stroke \nwhile acting in the line of duty, arguing that the attack must be \naccompanied by a traumatic injury, such as a wound or other condition \nof the body caused by external force, including injuries by bullets, \nsmoke inhalation, explosives, sharp instruments, blunt objects or other \nphysical blows, chemicals, electricity, climatic conditions, infectious \ndiseases, radiation, and bacteria. Barred are those who suffer from \noccupational injuries, such as stress and strain.\n  Service-connected heart, lung, and hypertension conditions are silent \nkillers of public safety officers nationwide. The numerous hidden \nhealth dangers dealt with by police officers, fire fighters and \nemergency medical personnel are widely recognized, but officers face \nthese dangers in order to carry out their sworn duty to serve and \nprotect their fellow citizens.\n  Our multi-partisan bill would effectively erase any distinction \nbetween traumatic and occupational injuries. The Hometown Heroes bill \nwill fix the loophole in the PSOB Program to ensure that the survivors \nof public safety officers who die of heart attacks or strokes in the \nline of duty or within 24 hours of a triggering effect while on duty--\nregardless of whether a traumatic injury is present at the time of the \nheart attack or stroke--are eligible to receive financial assistance. I \nwas serving my first term in the Senate when the Program was \nestablished, and I firmly believe that this is what Congress meant for \nthe survivors of our nation's first responders to receive through the \nPublic Safety Officers Benefits Program.\n\n  Heart attacks and strokes are a reality of the high-pressure jobs of \npolice officers, firefighters and medics. These are killers that first \nresponders contend with in their jobs, just like speeding bullets and \nburning buildings. They put their lives on the line for us, and we owe \ntheir families our gratitude, our respect and our help. No amount of \nmoney can fill the void that is left by these losses, but ending this \ndisparity can help these families keep food on the table and shelter \nover their heads. It helps them make the transition into their new \nlives.\n  The gap hits families hard when tragedy strikes. Earlier this year, \ntwo Vermont firefighters suffered heart attacks while responding to \nemergencies. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 31 \nfirefighters died of heart attacks relating to their jobs in 2002, and \nbased on statistics from the Officer Down Memorial Page, 8 police \nofficers suffered heart attacks while carrying out their duties. Due to \nthe current loophole in the PSOB Program, though, the families of these \nindividuals will not receive federal survivor benefits without the \nHometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act. For example, in January 1978, \nspecial Deputy Sheriff Bernard Demag of the Chittenden County Sheriff's \nOffice in Vermont suffered a fatal heart attack within two hours of his \nchase and apprehension of an escaped juvenile whom he had been \ntransporting. Mr. Demag's family spent nearly two decades fighting in \ncourt for workers' compensation death benefits all to no avail. \nClearly, we should be treating surviving family members of officers who \ndie in the line of duty with more decency and respect.\n  Public safety is dangerous, exhausting, and stressful work. A first \nresponder's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke greatly \nincrease when he or she puts on heavy equipment and rushes into a \nburning building to fight a fire and save lives. The families of these \nbrave public servants deserve to participate in the PSOB Program if\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\ntheir loved ones die of a heart attack or other cardiac related \nailments while selflessly protecting us from harm.\n  First responders across the country now face a new series of \nchallenges as they respond to millions of emergency calls this year. \nThey do this with an unwavering commitment to the safety of their \nfellow citizens, and are forever willing to selflessly sacrifice their \nown lives to protect the lives and property of their fellow citizens. I \nsee no reason to hold up this important legislation--last Congress the \nHouse passed Congressman Etheridge's identical language, and only a \nsingle, anonymous Republican hold in the Senate prevented its final \npassage. I am proud that the Senate has chosen to do the right thing \nand shown its support and appreciation for these extraordinarily brave \nand heroic public safety officers by passing the Hometown Heroes \nSurvivors Benefit Act. I urge the leaders of the House to follow our \nlead and pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6614-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CLARIFICATION OF SECTION 307 OF H.R. 1298\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, earlier this week, the Americans for Gun \nSafety Foundation released a report entitled the Enforcement Gap: \nFederal Gun Laws Ignored, analyzing the Justice Department's commitment \nto enforcing and prosecuting gun laws. The report examines prosecution \ndata acquired under the Freedom of Information Act from the Justice \nDepartment for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. The AGS study reveals a \nsignificant gap between the number of Federal gun crimes committed and \nthe number of Federal prosecutions initiated.\n  The report found that 20 of the 22 major Federal gun laws are rarely \nprosecuted. The two statutes consistently enforced by Federal \nprosecutors are laws against the use of a firearm in the commission of \na Federal crime and a felon in possession of a firearm. The other 20 \nlaws address other illegal firearm activity, including gun trafficking, \nfirearm theft, lying on a criminal background check form, removing \nfirearm serial numbers, and selling guns to minors.\n  The statistics in the AGS report are startling. According to AGS, in \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, Federal prosecutors filed \n197 cases for gun trafficking, despite 100,000 guns showing signs of \ntrafficking. Only 27 cases were filed against corrupt gun dealers, even \nthough AGS reports that gun dealers are the leading source of firearms \nrecovered in gun trafficking operations. Prosecutors in 22 States filed \nno cases against individuals committing the 20 least prosecuted crimes. \nAcross the country, only seven cases for illegally selling a gun to a \nminor were filed, even though more than 30,000 gun crimes were \ncommitted by youths age 17 or under. Only 202 cases were filed for \npossessing or selling a stolen firearm, despite nearly 140,000 reported \ngun thefts that year in which the make, model, and serial number of a \nstolen gun was reported to police. And a mere 98 cases for possessing \nor selling a firearm with an obliterated serial number were prosecuted, \ndespite thousands of these guns being recovered in just a few cities in \none year.\n  I believe vigorous law enforcement is a critical step toward reducing \ngun violence. I urge the Justice Department to step up its efforts to \nprosecute not only people who commit gun crimes but those corrupt \ndealers who put guns in criminal hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6614-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ARMED FORCES DAY\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor our military \npersonnel on the occasion of Armed Forces Day.\n  As a veteran of the Marine Corps, I believe one of the most important \nthings a person can do is serve this great country through the \nmilitary. Our nation must honor those who take up the call to defend \nour freedoms and never take for granted those freedoms that all of us \nenjoy. These freedoms are only because of our veterans and military \npersonnel.\n  Our active military forces have seen a lot of action as of late. The \nGuard and Reserve components have seen an increase in their operations \nas well. The performance of our military men and women has been \noutstanding. In my home State of Montana, as many as 750 men and women, \nActive Duty, Reservists and National Guard Personnel are supporting our \nongoing operations, both in the United States and overseas. I am \nespecially proud of these folks that have stepped up to the plate and \nhave gone above and beyond the call to duty during these trying times.\n  Our military has performed honorably in the latest missions with \nwhich they have been tasked--the Global War on Terrorism, Operation \nEnduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. We have seen Americans \ncoming together to support these men and women and their families at \nhome.\n  The men and women who wear our country's uniform are the keepers of \nthe flame that has been passed down through generations. They are the \nbearers of our national memory. Each and every veteran and military \nmember understands that the cost of freedom is steep. They were willing \nto accept that cost, so that we may live in peace. Arlington National \nCemetery and veterans' cemeteries across this great land are full of \nthose who understand that ``freedom is not free.'' My thoughts and \nprayers go out to their loved ones for their loss.\n  I will continue to do my best to ensure that the United States \nmilitary has the tools, skills and support needed to maintain its \nposition as the finest fighting force in the world. I will also work to \nensure that our veterans receive the benefits that they so richly \ndeserve. It is because of their sacrifices each and every one of us are \nable to be here today.\n  God Bless our Military Personnel and God Bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6614-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6614-S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROPOSED SENATE RULES CHANGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Republican partisans are acting as if \nSenate Democrats were treating President Bush's judicial nominees the \nway Republicans treated President Clinton's. That is not the case. We \nhave worked hard to repair much of the damage of Republican \nmistreatment of President Clinton's nominees. When we led the Senate we \nmoved forward at twice the rate that Republicans had and during our \nleadership 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees were confirmed. \nThis year we have proceeded to consider and confirm another 25 lifetime \njudicial appointments. I would understand the partisanship if Democrats \nhad held up consideration of 125 judicial nominees and the Senate had \nonly confirmed two, but just the opposite is true.\n  I understand the frustration that Senator Frist feels regarding the \ncontinuing impasse over the nominations of Mr. Estrada and Judge Owen. \nI am sorry that the White House has chosen confrontation over \ncooperation with the Senate on these matters. It is too bad that this \nWhite House will not work with us, as Senator Bennett and others have \nindicated was reasonable, in order to provide access to the materials \nwe requested from Mr. Estrada and the Justice Department one year ago \ntoday. With respect to the renomination of Judge Owen, I have said that \nunprecedented renomination of a judicial nominee rejected after a \nhearing and a fair debate and vote before the Judiciary Committee was \nill advised. It remains so.\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\n  Along with the other members of the Judiciary Committee, I have voted \non the Estrada and Owen nominations. We have not taken the course of \nprior Republican leadership in which any Senator was allowed to block \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees by use of a secret, anonymous \nhold. Instead, Democrats acted over the last few years to reform the \nconfirmation process. We have added openness and accountability. What \nwe have not been able to do is obtain a fair level of consultation and \ncooperation from this White House. We made home State Senators' ``blue \nslips'' matters of public record. When Republican Senators stymied \nJudiciary Committee consideration of President Clinton's judicial \nnominations, they were permitted to do so under the cloak of \nconfidentiality. I changed that in 2001.\n  The Republican myth of a ``crisis'' in the Senate is punctured by the \nfacts, which show the lowest judicial vacancy rate in 13 years--lower \nthan the national jobless rate of 6 percent.\n  Court-packing by Presidents of either party is harmful, and I have \nspoken out often about the need to preserve the independence of our \nFederal judiciary. The world's emerging democracies envy the judicial \nindependence in the American system, and we should make every effort to \ndefend it, not to undermine it, as the escalating tactics of this \nadministration would do. Just last month the administration and \ncongressional Republicans turned a deaf ear when Chief Justice \nRehnquist warned against the assault on the independence of the \njudiciary when so-called sentencing ``reforms'' were tacked on to a \npopular bill without hearings or careful consideration.\n  The White House says it opposes judicial activism, but the President \nsends the Senate activist nominees. The White House itself pushes \nresults-oriented changes in the rules of the Senate, which is a \nseparate branch of Government. This White House is not satisfied with \nits subjugation of the House and Senate to its will and removing \nCongress as a check on the Executive. They also want to pack the \nindependent Federal courts. Republicans are not satisfied with means \nundermining the independence of the Senate, they are embarked on a \ncourse to undermine the independence of the Federal judiciary, as well. \nThey already have convinced Senate Republicans to bend and even break \nthe Judiciary Committee's rules in the handling of judicial nominees. \nNow they want to change the rules of the Senate itself in a raw bid for \nunitary government, directed by the White House. The American people \nand their representatives in the Senate should not let the Senate or \nthe Federal judiciary become mere arms of any political party or any \nPresident.\n  The President's charges about obstruction would be easier to \nunderstand if the numbers themselves did not disprove them. The \nPresident and some Republicans in the Senate seem to be suffering from \nconfirmation amnesia. The Democratic-led Senate confirmed 100 of his \njudicial nominees, acting far faster than Republicans did with \nPresident Clinton's nominees. We have confirmed another 24 this year \nfor a total so far of 125 and achieved the lowest judicial vacancy rate \nin 13 years. The vacancy rate on the Federal bench today is 5.3 \npercent, which is lower than the national jobless rate of 6 percent. \nUnemployment has soared, the deficit has soared, crime is on the rise \nfor the first time in a decade--about the only thing that has gone down \nsignificantly over the last 2 years is Federal judicial vacancies. Yet \nthe White House complains that it has not been able to bully the Senate \ninto rubber-stamping every one of the White House's ideological \nchoices. Democratic Senators have cooperated to improve the process so \nthat it has worked much more smoothly for President Bush's nominees \nthan Republicans allowed for President Clinton's nominees.\n  The fact is that 125 have been confirmed, and two have been held \nback. You would not know that by listening to the President's remarks \nlast Friday or to Republican talking points or various attack ads now \nbeing broadcast around the country in a partisan effort to intimidate \nSenators.\n  Democrats held hearings on more nominees faster than Republicans had \nand proceeded on controversial nominations. We have cooperated this \nyear in bringing many controversial nominations to the floor for votes. \nWhen Republicans controlled the Senate during the last Democratic \nadministration, they blocked more than 60 judicial nominees. And they \nwere blocked not with cloture votes in the light of day, but sometimes \nby a single, anonymous Republican objection. And yes, there were also \nRepublican filibusters of President Clinton's nominees.\n  The answer for handling the remaining controversial nominees is not \nreckless rhetoric or undermining the Senate's independence by changing \nits rules so that the independence of the Federal judiciary can become \na victim to partisan court-packing. The answer has to start with the \nPresident, where the process begins. Despite his earlier promises, the \nPresident has been a divider and not a uniter in choosing many of his \nnominees, who would roll back the hard-won rights of workers, women, \nminorities and consumers, and who would side with the big polluters \nover communities when it comes to clean air and water. Several of his \nchoices have divided the American people, and they have divided the \nSenate. We have drawn a line with a few of his most extreme choices. \nDrawing that line has been the responsible response to this \nPresident's divisive nominations for lifetime positions on the Federal \ncourts.\n\n  This President campaigned saying he wanted to change the tone in \nWashington. He has--for the worse. The White House has adopted the \nrabid partisanship of House Republicans. The President of the United \nStates has sunk to name-calling, extreme rhetoric and partisan \ncampaigning against the Senate and individual Senators, which is not \nhelpful to the process or to the institutions of our government.\n  The answer is for the administration to work with the Senate, as \nearlier Presidents have done. The process starts with the President, \nand the buck stops with the President.\n  Here on the Senate floor, when Senators have opposed the most \ndivisive of the President's nominees with whom he is seeking to pack \nthe courts and ideologically tilt them, we have done so on the record. \nWe have debated and put forth the considerations and reasons. That, \ntoo, was something all too often missing from the years in which \nRepublicans defeated judicial nominees through stealth tactics. We have \nvoted on the record in vote after vote required by Republican cloture \npetitions.\n  Unfortunately, in the case of Mr. Estrada, the administration has \nmade no effort to work with us and resolve the impasse. Instead, there \nhas been a series of votes on cloture petitions in which the opposition \nhas grown and from time to time the support has waned. Recently, there \nhave been press reports indicating that Mr. Estrada had asked the White \nHouse months ago to withdraw his nomination. I understand his \nfrustration. If this administration is not going to follow the practice \nof every other administration and share with the Senate the government \nwork papers of the nominee--the very practice this administration \nfollowed with an EPA nominee in 2001--then I can understand him not \nwanting to be used as a political pawn by the administration to score \npartisan, political points. That the administration has not acceded to \nhis reported request but has plowed ahead to force a succession of \nunsuccessful cloture votes and to foment division in our Hispanic \ncommunity for partisan gain is another example of how far this \nadministration is willing to go to politicize the process at the \nexpense of its own nominees.\n  The frustration with these two difficult nominations should not \nobscure the work that the Senate leadership has done to correct some of \nthe abuses of power earlier this year and pave the way for votes on the \nnominations of Jeffrey Sutton and Judge Cook to the Sixth Circuit and \nJohn Roberts to the DC Circuit. There were more votes against the \nSutton nomination than the number required for a filibuster, but there \nwas no filibuster of that nomination. Just as there was no filibuster \nof the controversial nomination of Mr. Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit \nor of the controversial nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to the Fourth \nCircuit. All three of these circuit court nominations were \ncontroversial and opposed by many Americans and many Senators.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n  The President's recent comments took the Republican Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee to task for, among other things, not holding a \nhearing on the nomination of Judge Terry Boyle. I understand that \nChairman Hatch is following a longstanding tradition of the Senate in \nnot proceeding with a nomination that is opposed by a home State \nSenator. After all, it was Senator Helms' opposition to Judge Beaty and \nJudge Wynn, as well as to Roger Gregory and a number of others, that \nhas led to there being numerous vacancies on the Fourth Circuit. Having \nhonored Senator Helms' objections, Chairman Hatch would be seen as \nhypocritical and partisan if he were to ignore the concerns of \nDemocratic home State Senators. Among the difficulties the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee has faced since 2001 are the high number of \njudicial nominees of this White House that do not have home State \nSenator support. So when the President attacks the Senate for not \nhaving acted on nominations that the White House knows does not have \nthe support of home State Senators, he is not being fair to the Senate, \nto the chairman or to the nominees. The White House knows that judicial \nnominations do not proceed without the support of home State Senators. \nYet this administration continues to belittle the role of home State \nSenators in the advice and consent process and ignore the important \nrole they have long played in Senate consideration of judicial \nnominees.\n  Another example is the nomination of Judge Carolyn Kuhl to the Ninth \nCircuit. This is a nomination that is opposed by both home State \nSenators. Proceeding on such a nomination is unprecedented. Yet Senate \nRepublicans have forced the nomination out of the Judiciary Committee \non a party-line vote after knowing that Senator Feinstein and Senator \nBoxer both oppose confirmation.\n  The last time the Senate voted on a nomination opposed by both home \nState Senators was only because the Republican caucus ambushed the \nnomination of Judge Ronnie White of Missouri on the Senate floor in \n1999 after one of the Missouri Senators switched from supporting the \nnomination to opposing it the day of the vote. They proceeded without \ntelling the administration, Senate Democrats or the nominee of the \nchange of position and a number of Republican Senators who had \npreviously voted in favor of the nomination changed their positions, as \nwell, and the nomination was defeated on the only party-line vote to \ndefeat a judicial nominee in Senate history of which I am aware.\n  With respect to Senator Frist's resolution, S. Res. 138, I look \nforward to the work of the Rules Committee on this proposal. Initially, \nI would observe that voting on judicial nominations is unlike Senate \nconsideration of legislation in the way that imposing capital \npunishment is unlike any other criminal sentence. It is final and \nirrevocable. A bad statute once enacted can be amended or repealed. A \nbad judge is on the bench for life and will continue to affect \nAmerican's rights, our freedoms and our environment in case after case \nfor decades to come, long after the President who appointed that judge \nis gone. Given that dimension, I believe Senator Frist got his proposal \nupside down by seeking to exempt judicial nominations from Senate \ndebate rules. It is more important that there be a higher level of \nconfidence and certainty that a judicial nomination being considered \nfor a lifetime appointment be the right person for the job, be a person \nof fairness, impartiality, judgment and someone committed to our \nconstitutional values. The rights of women, minorities, consumers, \nworkers and those concerned about the environment should not be \nsacrificed to political expediency and the independence of our federal \ncourts should not be lost to ideological court packing by this \nadministration.\n  Others will no doubt point out that Senator Frist voted against a \nproposal in 1995 to revise the Senate filibuster rules. I have pointed \nout in other statements how many Republicans supported the filibusters \nagainst President Clinton's executive calendar nominees, including the \njudicial nominations of Judge Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez, the \nlast most recent double filibuster in 2000, and the nominations of \nJudge Rosemary Barkett and Judge H. Lee Sarokin. In addition, recent \nRepublican filibusters succeeded in defeating the nominations of Dr. \nHenry Foster to be Surgeon General and Sam Brown to be an ambassador. \nRepublicans have not been shy about using filibusters to defeat the \nnominees of the most recent Democratic President or stall legislation \nsome of them oppose. Just last year, in their tributes to Senator \nThurmond, Republicans extolled his use of the filibuster and his \nsetting a record for the longest individual filibuster in Senate \nhistory. What they left out of their tributes was the fact that Senator \nThurmond had filibustered civil rights legislation.\n\n  Others may also point out how many Republicans have proposed \nsupermajority requirements. Not only have Republicans abandoned their \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility and their call for a balanced \nbudget, they have forgotten that they insisted in recent years on \nthree-fifths requirements to raise the debt ceiling or have taxes apply \nretroactively. Senator Craig and Senator Miller currently support a \nproposal, S.J. Res. 2, to require a balanced Federal budget that \nincludes a three-fifths rollcall vote of each chamber to increase the \ndebt limit. Last year Senator Sessions introduced a measure, S.J. Res. \n11, cosponsored by Senators Crapo, Kyl, Fitzgerald, Hagel, Inhofe and \nShelby to require a two-thirds vote of each House in order to increase \nany tax. Of course, in the 105th Congress, along with former Senators \nAshcroft and Abraham, who are now Cabinet secretaries in this \nadministration, Senators Allard, Bennett, Bond, Brownback, Burns, \nCampbell, Cochran, Collins, Craig, DeWine, Domenici, Enzi, Frist, \nGrassley, Gregg, Hagel, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kyl, Lott, Lugar, McCain, \nMcConnell, Nickles, Roberts, Santorum, Sessions, Shelby, Smith, Snowe, \nSpecter, Stevens, Thomas and Warner all cosponsored S.J. Res. 1 which \nwould have required a three-fifths majority requirement to raise the \ndebt ceiling.\n  The Senate was not designed by the founders or the Constitution to be \na strictly majoritarian institution. To the contrary, the genius of the \nFramers at the Constitutional Convention was to construct a House of \nRepresentatives, structured on majoritarian principles with \nrepresentatives voting on behalf of relatively equal numbers of \nconstituents, and the Senate using different principles. The Senate has \nalways had two Senators for each State regardless of size. Thus, small \nStates like Vermont and Rhode Island and less populous States like \nWyoming, Idaho and Alaska each have equal representation with \nCalifornia, Texas and New York. The Senate and the House are not the \nsame and were not intended to be the same. They were designed to be \ncomplimentary institutions of government to form a balanced \nlegislature. I understand why proposals like S. Res. 138 might appeal \nto newer Republican Senators and to former House Members who are now \nRepublican in the Senate but I fear it would represent another ill-\nadvised step to change the Senate into a second House of \nRepresentatives. The Constitution did not assign the advice and consent \nrole to the House but to our distinctive body, the Senate. The Senate \nhas many distinctive traditions including, to me, one of the most \nsignificant--that smaller States have a larger role to play in the \nSenate than in the House.\n  It is a bit ironic, to say the least, that an administration that was \nselected with less popular vote than the Democratic Presidential \ncandidate because of a court decision and the workings of the electoral \ncollege is now pressing so vociferously to change the Senate rules and \nallow judicial and executive branch confirmations approved by the \nbarest of ``majorities''--of only those Senators present and voting at \nthe time the Republican Senate majority chooses to call the vote.\n  In addition, given the Senate's structure, the administration's \npretense that somehow the votes of a majority of Senators shows that a \nmajority of Americans favor a nomination may not be factually accurate. \nFor example, Senate Republicans have complained bitterly and \nresentfully about the Senate's failure to end debate on the nomination \nof Judge Owen. But the Senators who have voted to end debate represent \nless than 50 percent of the population of the United States and the \nSenators who have voted not to end\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nthat debate represent the majority of the American population. Now, put \nthat way, the decision of the Senate on this controversial nominee \nhardly seem anti-democratic.\n  I respect the role of the Senate and the ways in which it has \ntraditionally functioned on behalf of the American people. Any rule or \npractice can be used for ill, of course. For instance, the Senate \ngrants significant authority to committees and to chairs of committees \nto determine the Senate's agenda and business. Traditionally, when a \ncommittee votes down a nominee, that nomination does not go forward. We \nhave made one recent exception for the nomination of Judge Bork to the \nSupreme Court. That led to a heated battle on the Senate floor that \nresulted in that nomination ultimately being rejected by the Senate. \nNever in our history has the Senate or an administration simply \noverridden the judgment of the Judiciary Committee. That is what this \nadministration chose to do when it renominated Judge Owen after her \nnomination had been thoroughly and fairly considered last year.\n  Finally, I am troubled that the administration and Senate Republicans \nare so intent on changing the rules and procedures and practices of the \nSenate in so many ways to gerryrig the process in favor of the \nadministration's most extreme, divisive and controversial nominees. \nThat was not the motivation behind the amendment of rule 22 in 1975 \nthat I supported. It used to be rare that judicial nominees would \nreceive so many negative votes and engender so much opposition. In \naccordance with the consultation and cooperation that prevailed between \nadministrations before this one and Senators from both parties, it was \na rarity to have a contested nomination or to have close votes. That \nthis administration is so fixated on forcing through the Senate \nnominees that do not have the support of more Senators is alarming in \nitself.\n  Consensus, mainstream, qualified nominees will get the support of not \njust a bare majority of Senators voting but the overwhelming majority \nof Senators. Thus, Judge Prado, and Judge Gregory, and Judge Raggi were \nconfirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support. So, too, I am confident \nthat Judge Consuelo Callahan will be the second Hispanic nominee of \nthis administration to a circuit court to receive the strong support of \nDemocratic Senators, when the leadership decides to schedule a vote on \nher confirmation. The 125 judicial confirmations to date are by and \nlarge conservative nominees but many enjoyed the strong bipartisan vote \nof Senators from both parties.\n  Yet Senate Republicans at the behest of the administration want to \ngrant even more power to the administration by encouraging the \nPresident to nominate more controversial nominees. I respectfully \nsuggest that the better way to proceed would be for the White House to \nwork more closely with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to \nidentify consensus nominees who will not generate a close vote and do \nnot need special rules in order to be considered.\n  I thank the majority leader for working with the Democratic leader \nand assistant leader to make what he himself recognized as progress \nover the last weeks. With some cooperation and consideration from the \nadministration we could accomplish so much more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6617-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF NATIVE AMERICAN CODE TALKERS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, throughout the military history of the \nUnited States, Native Americans have served their country above and \nbeyond the call of duty. Although they have served in many capacities, \nperhaps none has been more valuable than the services they have \nprovided as code talkers. Today, I rise to support and cosponsor S. \n540, a bill to authorize the presentation of gold medals on behalf of \nCongress to Native Americans who served as code talkers during foreign \nconflicts.\n  During World War II, the Sioux Indians volunteered their native \nlanguages, Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota Sioux, as codes. The Sioux code \ntalkers worked tirelessly around the clock to provide information, such \nas the location of enemy troops and the number of enemy guns, which \nsaved the lives of many Americans in war theaters in the Pacific and \nEurope. U.S. military commanders credit the Sioux with saving the lives \nof countless American soldiers and with being instrumental to the \nsuccess of the United States in many battles during the war.\n  Today I would like to acknowledge the following distinguished \ngentlemen: Eddie Eagle Boy, Simon Brokenleg, Iver Crow Eagle Sr., \nEdmund St. John, Walter C. John Bear King, Phillip ``Stoney'' LaBlanc, \nBaptiste Pumpkinseed, Guy Rondell, Charles Whitepipe, and Clarence \nWolfguts.\n  During the D-Day invasion and afterwards in the European theater, the \n4th Signal Division employed Comanche code talkers to help the Army \ndevelop a code, which proved to be unbreakable by the Axis powers, and \nwhich was used extensively throughout Europe. This code was \ninstrumental to winning the war in Europe and saved countless lives. \nThe time has come to honor the Comanche code talkers for their valor \nand service to the United States. Today I would like to acknowledge the \nbrave accomplishments of Charles Chibitty, Haddon Codynah, Robert \nHolder, Forrest Kassanovoid, Willington Mihecoby, Perry Noyebad, \nClifford Otitivo, Simmons Parker, Melvin Permansu, Dick Red Elk, Elgin \nRed Elk, Larry Saupitty, Morris Sunrise, and Willie Yackeschi.\n  During the first year of World War I, when Germany had deciphered all \nAllied codes, and Allied forces were suffering from heavy casualties, \n18 Choctaw Indian soldiers were recruited on the battlefield to use \ntheir native language as a new code. This code, which was never \nsuccessfully deciphered by the Germans, was thereafter used widely \nthroughout the war and was instrumental in the movement of American \nsoldiers, the protection of American supplies, and the preparation for \nassaults on German positions.\n  The Choctaw code talkers were highly successful and saved many lives \nand munitions. Their contribution is just another example of the \ncommitment of Native Americans to the defense of the United States, as \nwell as another example of the proud legacy of the Native Americans. \nThe original 18 Choctaw code talkers have already been honored by a \nmemorial bearing their names located at the entrance of the tribal \ncomplex in Durant, OK. Now I would like to continue to honor their \nlegacy by urging my colleagues to vote affirmatively for S. 540.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6617-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6617-S6618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on this year's \nMemorial Day commemorations and the importance of this holiday in \nAmerican life.\n  As I attend Memorial Day parades and commemorations, I'm struck by \nthe spirit of national unity on display because I know that across \nMichigan--and across our Nation--our fellow Americans are taking part \nin similar gatherings where we take the time to reflect on our history \nand the sacrifice that brought us to where we are today.\n  Memorial Day is unique among American holidays. On Memorial Day we do \nnot honor a particular date or event--a battle or the end of a war. On \nMemorial Day we do not honor an individual leader--a president or a \ngeneral. On Memorial Day we do not even honor ourselves--at least not \nin the present tense.\n  On Memorial Day we pay homage to the thousands and thousands of \nindividual acts of bravery and sacrifice that stretch back to the \nbattlefields of our Revolution and are on display today in the deserts \nof Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan.\n  We honor the brave men and women who answered their Nation's call to \nduty. And--making that ultimate sacrifice--never returned to their \nfamilies and loved ones.\n  As part of this year's Memorial Day commemorations, I have been \npaying special respects to our Korean war veterans because this July \nmarks the 50th Anniversary of the armistice that ended that war.\n  Notice I said Korean war. I did not say ``the Korean Conflict.'' I \ndid not call it a police action. I've met too many Korean war veterans. \nI've heard too many of their stories.\n  It was the Korean war.\n  About 2 million Americans served on active duty with the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nArmed Forces during the Korean war. And nearly 55,000 never came home.\n  The Korean war is often called ``the forgotten war.'' Well, it is not \nforgotten by me. I've met too many Korean war veterans and heard the \nstories of the hardships they endured defending--in the words of the \nplaque at the Korean War Memorial--``a country they never knew, and a \npeople they never met.''\n  So I think that one of the most fitting ways to pay homage to our \nfallen patriots is to treat their living comrades with the respect and \nhonor they deserve.\n  Michigan is home to 875,000 veterans, and in personal conversations, \nletters, phone calls and e-mails I have heard from many who are not \nbeing treated fairly by the veterans' health care system or by present \npension regulations.\n  Right now, we are underfunding veterans' health care by close to $2 \nbillion. This means it can take months to see a doctor and delays of a \nyear or longer for some surgical procedures.\n  I am cosponsoring the Veterans Health Care Funding Guarantee Act of \n2003--S. 50--that would order a 20 percent increase in funding for the \nVeteran's Health Administration by 2005, and adjust the amount upwards \nevery year after that to take into account new enrollees.\n  Also, antiquated laws have also created an unfair situation wherein a \nveteran's pension can be reduced by the amount of their disability \npayment for a service-related disability. In some cases the pension can \nbe wiped out entirely.\n  This is unfair. Pension and disability payments are two separate and \ndistinct benefits. Our veterans have earned their pensions. And if they \nalso suffered a service-related disability that has cut their ability \nto earn money outside the military, they are entitled to a separate \ndisability payment as well.\n  I am cosponsoring the Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2003--S. 392. \nThis bill would require that veterans receive their full pension plus \nall disability payments to which they are entitled. This issue is also \nknown as full concurrent receipt.\n  As we observe this holiday we call Memorial Day, let us remember the \ncenturies of sacrifice by thousands and thousands of men and women that \nthis day represents. And let's make sure that all who served with honor \nare honored in return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6618-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6618-S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATEMENT IN MEMORY OF MARY BOWERS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the \nmost extraordinary and courageous people I have ever had the privilege \nto know.\n  Mary Bowers was an integral and beloved member of my staff who sadly \npassed away on May 3 at the age of 28. My thoughts and prayers are with \nher husband, Wayne Rolland; her parents, Betty and Chris Bowers of \nHermon, ME; Mary's sister, Melissa; and her entire family who she loved \nso deeply. Mary's life was all too tragically brief, but how rich it \nwas in experience and love--and how profoundly she taught us all about \nthe art of living.\n  On a professional level, Mary was a tremendous asset to my staff, and \nI would be remiss not to recall the myriad ways in which she was the \nnucleus of the office. As my Maine scheduler and Assistant to the Chief \nof Staff, she was of extraordinary assistance, and it is no \nexaggeration to say that through her efforts the people of her home \nState of Maine--which she loved so dearly--were exceptionally well \nserved. Yet, it should be said that Mary's most significant \ncontributions sprang not from her work in my office--but instead from \nthe positive and irrepressible force of her presence.\n  I first came to know Mary as a young volunteer on my campaigns for \nCongress. She was passionate even then about politics, and the role \nthat government and elected officials could play in securing for \nAmerica the blessings and ideals upon which our Nation was founded. In \nan era when so many of our young people feel disaffected and \ndisenfranchised, Mary believed deeply that involvement in the process \ncould make a very real difference--that it was a responsibility and an \nobligation in return for the fruits of freedom and opportunity provided \nby the basic tenets of this great Nation.\n  As her high school years drew to a close, Mary sought a nomination to \nthe U.S. Military Academy at West Point. It was obvious by then she was \nnot only a bright young woman, but possessed the kind of exceptional \nqualities that would make her a success both at the Academy and--even \nmore importantly--in life--honesty, a commitment to service, an \nunassuming yet unmistakable confidence, and an intangible demeanor that \ninspired others to their better nature.\n  Indeed, even early on, Mary embodied the essence of a leader. Later, \nas a member of my staff, she always took charge without ever ``taking \nover''. She would have made a brilliant Army officer--people would have \nfollowed her anywhere, responding to the genuine persuasiveness of her \npersonality and the clarity of her vision.\n  But Mary's greatest challenge was thrust upon her while at the \nMilitary Academy--one far greater than any obstacle course. Young, \nvibrant, full of promise--she learned she had cancer. In the months and \nyears that followed, in all of the ways that truly count in this world, \nshe would meet that challenge--and in the process forever change the \nlives of all who were blessed to know her.\n  Perhaps what was most heroic about Mary is that she never allowed \nherself to be defined by her disease--yet the way in which she \ncomported herself while fighting her disease epitomized her very \nessence--and will surely be the legacy that lives on in our hearts and \nthe way in which we lead our own lives.\n  Quite simply, Mary was a diminutive dynamo. Tiny in stature, she was \na giant in her soul. Even as cancer sapped her physical strength, she \npossessed a deep, more spiritual reserve from which to draw. Certainly, \nthere appeared no rational explanation for her ability to muster \nenergy. We could no more understand how she defied the realities that \ncancer imposes on the human body and spirit than we could determine how \nshe summoned such extraordinary courage.\n  During her 4 years on my staff, she endured numerous, punishing \ntreatments--none of which were subtle in their physical impact--even \napologizing for having to go to doctor's appointments! Throughout it \nall, her attitude was unfailingly positive and gracious. Any of us \nwould most certainly have excused Mary for any moodiness or bristling \nresponse, but the opportunity never arose. Rather, she was always more \nconcerned for others than she was for herself.\n  With unfailing humor, she had a way of disarming even the most \nstressful of moments and deflating the small absurdities that creep \ninto everyday life. The treats she baked and brought into the office--\nagain, even when she was not feeling well--were a tangible gift from \nher heart. And while the rest of us would be affected by daily trials \nand tribulations of a much lesser nature, Mary was the one whose light \nshined into our lives and lifted our emotions. Indeed--her lifelong \nlove of lighthouses was entirely appropriate, as she stood most firm \nwhen the seas were at their roughest . . . she was a beacon of \nbrightness and hope . . . and her presence on the landscape of our \nlives will be enduring.\n  Particularly in our line of work, we have the opportunity to meet a \ngreat many people--some of high title, others who are the unsung heros \nof our society. But the universe of those who truly change the course \nof our own lives by their example is much, much smaller. My staff and I \nwill forever count Mary among those individuals.\n  In my own life, I have known adversity. And yet, Mary has taught me \nlessons in living I had not yet fully realized. I know it is the same \nfor my staff--who, to a man and woman loved and respected Mary and the \nexample for which she stood. All of us will now be the personal \nmessengers of her indomitable spirit and, in turn, that part of Mary \nthat lives on within all of us will continue to impact the world \nforever, for the better.\n  The measure of Mary's life will never be the crude yardstick of the \nnumber of years on earth, but rather the number of lives she touched \nwhile she was among us. In the words of the great American author Ralph \nWaldo Emerson, ``to know even one life has breathed easier because you \nhave lived--this is to have succeeded.'' I\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\ncould not agree more, and in that light Mary Bowers was most assuredly \none of the most successful people one could ever hope to know. We love \nher and we will miss her more than words have the power to convey.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a retrospective on Mary's life published \nby the Portland Press Herald be printed in the Record, as well as a \ncopy of the eulogy delivered at her funeral service by my former Chief \nof Staff, Kevin Raye.\n\n             [From the Portland Press Herald, May 6, 2003]\n\n      Mary Bowers, 28, Small Senate Staffer Who Made Giant Impact\n\n                        (By Joshua L. Weinstein)\n\n       Bangor.--Ask Mary Bowers' husband if his wife had any \n     subtle ways of letting him know she loved him, and you'll \n     hear:\n       ``There was nothing subtle about Mary. She just told me \n     that she loved me all the time.''\n       Mrs. Bowers, who died Saturday, was like a summer day in \n     Maine: clear and sunny and not with us nearly long enough. \n     She was only 28 when she died of ovarian cancer.\n       ``She was courageous, she was funny and warm'' said her \n     boss, Jane Calderwood, the chief of staff to U.S. Sen. \n     Olympia Snowe. ``She's mom to all of us . . . She was really \n     the heart of the place.''\n       Mrs. Bowers doted on people, brought homemade chocolates to \n     work, delighted in the little things.\n       But she could be fierce.\n       She was a tiny thing--maybe 5-foot-3, on her toes--but she \n     had a way about her.\n       Before she got sick, she decided on a career in the \n     military. She was accepted to the U.S. Military Academy at \n     West Point, and studied there two years before being \n     diagnosed with cancer. She rallied, and landed at the \n     University of Maine, where she graduated with high honors in \n     political science.\n       She worked briefly with Presidential Classroom, a \n     Washington-based program for high school scholars, before \n     joining Snowe's staff, where she was state scheduler and \n     assistant to the chief of staff.\n       She was beloved in Snowe's office.\n       ``You could tell by her eyes when she was up to no good,'' \n     Calderwood said. ``You could tell because there would be this \n     glint. And if she walked into the room and she had that look, \n     you'd be in trouble.''\n       Bowers's husband, Wayne Rolland, said his wife loved her \n     nieces, loved her job, loved the Republican Party, loved \n     history, loved politics.\n       ``One of the funny things that she used to say, and it \n     sounds kind of funny coming from a cancer patient, but she \n     used to always say, ``It's better to look good than to feel \n     good.' ''\n       Mrs. Bowers always looked good, Rolland said.\n       With her deep blue eyes and suits from Talbot's, maybe a \n     few white daisies on her desk, Mrs. Bowers had style.\n       She was a vegetarian who loved chocolate and the occasional \n     glass of wine.\n       She liked country music, especially Garth Brooks. She sang \n     in the church choir when she was a girl, and one of her \n     favorite gifts from her husband was a karaoke machine.\n       She always used to sing Brooks' ``Friend in Low Places.''\n       She even sang it at her wedding.\n       Mrs. Bowers loved the ocean, and collected lighthouses, \n     along with Beanie Babies and candles.\n       Lighthouses and candles made sense, Calderwood said.\n       ``She was always the bright light.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Eulogy for Mary Bowers\n\n  (Offered by Kevin Raye at All Soul's Congregational Church, Bangor, \n                                 Maine)\n\n                              May 7, 2003\n\n       Good afternoon. Over the course of my life, I have often \n     stood before a congregation to help lead services. I have \n     often been called upon to speak in public. And like everyone \n     in this sanctuary today, I have often shared in joys and \n     sorrows with family and friends. But never in my life have \n     these three things converged in such a profoundly difficult \n     way for me as they do today.\n       When Wayne called me to convey Mary's request that I speak \n     at her funeral, I was profoundly moved. And to be honest, I \n     was overwhelmed by conflicting emotions. The desire to do \n     absolutely anything in the world for Mary, crushing sadness \n     that her death was now so imminent, a sense of inadequacy to \n     do justice to her life and her courage, and the trepidation \n     that I would not be able to maintain my composure at this \n     moment.\n       But despite those swirling emotions, I embraced her \n     request. Because finally there was something I could do for \n     Mary.\n       And because it is an honor to pay tribute to this \n     remarkable young woman whose strength and optimism, whose \n     kindness and thoughtfulness, and whose happiness and loving \n     nature deeply touched so many lives--more deeply than she \n     ever knew.\n       And whose penchant for taking care of others and getting \n     things in order never wavered. Even in her final weeks, Mary \n     was firmly in charge, busy organizing, checking off her list \n     of things to do, taking care of the details. As a co-worker \n     said upon learning of her death, Mary's up there organizing \n     heaven right now.\n       But even as she took care of the details, and the strength \n     was ebbing from her body, her first thoughts were with \n     others. At every juncture, she was concerned more about her \n     family and her friends than herself. And when visitors were \n     coming, she summoned every ounce of strength to be her bubbly \n     smiling self and lift them up.\n       As she said over and over to Wayne, ``It's better to look \n     good than feel good.'' Of course Mary would think that. \n     Because how she looked affected how others felt. She could \n     deal with feeling bad herself, but she wanted others to feel \n     good when they saw her.\n       My first memories of Mary are of the little girl who tagged \n     along with her mother volunteering at Olympia's campaign \n     office. A sweet and bright and eager and energetic girl.\n       Even at a young age, she knew how to get things done. Or \n     should I say, get her own way?\n       Betty told me a great story the other day. When Mary was a \n     little girl, it seems the family pastor had tried in vain to \n     get Mary's father Chris to take on some task or another. When \n     he declined, Mary piped up and said ``You know, Dad's a push-\n     over if you flutter your eyes . . . and if that doesn't work, \n     all you have to do is give him a kiss.''\n       Well, Mary saved that little tactic for her father--and \n     later used it with great success on Wayne. But for the rest \n     of us, Mary succeeded by working hard and being determined.\n       She knew at a very young age that she loved politics. Over \n     the years, and during a succession of campaigns, Mary was \n     there. She helped us organize lit drops, she worked in the \n     office, she licked envelopes, she loved politics. In fact, \n     she once told her mother that when she became President, she \n     would have her mother dust the White House and her father \n     trim the rose bushes.\n       Well not only did Mary love politics, but everybody in \n     politics who met her, loved Mary.\n       And all of us were so proud of her--her appointment to West \n     Point, her stellar academic accomplishments there and at the \n     University of Maine, where she graduated magna cum laude--and \n     to see what a fine young woman she grew to be.\n       But we were not only proud, we were humbled and awed by her \n     grace, her dignity, her strength, her determination, her \n     unwavering optimism and her enormous courage as she battled \n     the cancer that invaded her young body. And how she never \n     skipped a beat in her continued daily devotion to her family \n     and friends, and to her work.\n       After Mary had grown up, and had survived her first bout \n     with cancer, she moved to Washington to work for Presidential \n     Classrooms. As it happened, I was also there, serving as \n     Chief of Staff to Senator Snowe. And soon after learning that \n     Mary was in town, I convinced her to leave her other job \n     behind and come to work for Olympia.\n       Now, one thing that I have often observed about bright, \n     talented and ambitious young people, college degree in hand, \n     having landed their first job on Capitol Hill, is that they \n     are sometimes disheartened to find themselves answering the \n     phone or entering data, or saddled with other decidedly \n     unglamorous responsibilities. You won't be surprised to know \n     that Mary was different.\n       She was as bright, talented and ambitious as any young \n     person I ever hired in nearly two decades with Olympia.\n       But Mary was also determined to be the best at whatever she \n     did. No matter what the task, to Mary, it was important. \n     Whether she was taking a phone call from a veteran in \n     Passadumkeag, giving a tour of the Capitol to a family from \n     Lubec, or greeting a member of the President's Cabinet, Mary \n     accorded every person her full attention and her trademark \n     kindness, genuine interest and sweet smile.\n       With her extraordinary organizational skills, and penchant \n     for details, she did her work thoroughly and then looked \n     around to see what else needed to be done.\n       As I observed her in action, I knew Mary was exactly the \n     person I needed at my side to help me fulfill my \n     responsibilities as Chief of Staff. So I made her my \n     assistant--and also put her in charge of Olympia's Maine \n     scheduling. She literally did the work of two people, and it \n     was one of the best decisions I ever made.\n       As my wife Karen can attest, Mary's competence, her quiet \n     unflappability, her uncanny ability to keep track of ten \n     thousand things at once, and her mischievous sense of humor, \n     combined to make her enormously valuable to me, to my \n     successor who also came to depend on her, to Senator Snowe, \n     and--while most of them never knew her, she was enormously \n     valuable to the people of Maine--whom she served with a \n     passion and commitment to the noble pursuit of public \n     service.\n       Mary was the epitome of the old adage ``never judge a book \n     by its cover.'' Because this diminutive young woman, who \n     appeared at first blush so small and delicate, and was in \n     truth incredibly sweet, was also as tough as nails. She had a \n     quick wit; she had her own opinions; and she could hold her \n     own in any situation. If you don't think so, you need to see \n     the photograph of her running across a field during her \n     training at West Point, covered in mud, clutching an M-16.\n       Not much bothered her. In fact, on Monday, Wayne was \n     interviewed by a reporter for the Portland Press Herald, who \n     asked him many questions about Mary. After he hung up, Wayne \n     turned to us and said ``That guy did ask one question that I \n     didn't answer.''\n       ``What was that?'' we asked.\n       ``He asked if there is anything that really drives her \n     nuts. That was a hard question.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n     And I didn't answer because the only thing I could think of \n     was ``Yes, a Democrat.'' Quickly adding, ``But even for \n     Democrats, she had a place in her heart!''\n       Yes, that was Mary. She had her opinions, and she was \n     passionate about them, but she had a heart big enough for \n     everyone . . . and the only things that really drove her nuts \n     were racism and sexism, two things for which she had zero \n     tolerance.\n       On a personal level, I will always be deeply grateful for \n     Mary's selflessness last year, when despite her illness, her \n     loyal friendship brought her home to Maine to be at my side \n     at crucial moments of my campaign for Congress--during the \n     Republican Convention a year ago last weekend, and again \n     during the hectic final weeks of the campaign last fall.\n       When it was crunch time, and everyone knew I needed someone \n     to help keep me calm amidst the storm, it was Mary we turned \n     to.\n       Knowing Mary was a joy in every respect. Her curious mind, \n     her cheerful outlook and easy laugh, her grace under \n     pressure, her steely determination and unflinching courage in \n     the face of devastating illness, all combined to make this \n     incredible young woman one of the most remarkable individuals \n     I have ever met--or hope to meet--in my lifetime. They also \n     made her much more than a co-worker. They made her a beloved \n     friend--in the truest sense of the word.\n       And one of the joys of knowing Mary was that of getting to \n     see her experience the wonder of true love. For that is what \n     she found with Wayne.\n       No two people could ever have been more right for each \n     other. And while Mary certainly made Wayne sweat it out for a \n     long time before deeming him worthy of her affections, once \n     she made up her mind, it was a true romance.\n       And it was the best decision of her life, for she got a \n     life's partner who was there for her in every way--and who \n     stayed at her side, giving her strength and support and love \n     through every day of her life, and drawing his own strength \n     and inspiration from Mary.\n       And while their days together were far too few, they \n     brought each other great happiness and fulfillment.\n       Among the things Karen and I will always be grateful to \n     Mary for is allowing us to get to know Wayne, and to share in \n     the joy of their loving relationship, and other small joys \n     like our shared passion for good food--especially Indian \n     food. Of course, Mary's had to be vegetarian, while she \n     tolerated Wayne, Karen and I indulging our basic carnivorous \n     instincts.\n       And our mutual love of movies, cook-outs by the pool, \n     enjoying special occasions together like the Inaugural Ball, \n     the celebration of their long-awaited marriage, and being at \n     their side during the up and down fight against Mary's \n     cancer, and in the bittersweet journey of these last weeks.\n       Then, of course, there was that picture-perfect summer day \n     in Bar Harbor last August, when Mary and Wayne were married \n     at last. It was the wedding of Mary's dreams, and she was \n     truly a radiant and beautiful bride.\n       Moments before the ceremony, when most brides are a nervous \n     wreck, Mary took time to play ring-around-the-rosie with \n     Alexa and another of the littlest guests.\n       At the reception, she danced, she laughed, she mingled and \n     spent precious moments with every person there, and she \n     entertained everyone by singing her trademark karaoke \n     rendition of Garth Brooks's ``I've Got Friends in Lo-o-ow \n     Places.''\n       And in keeping with the nautical theme of the reception--so \n     in keeping with Mary's love of the ocean and lighthouses, and \n     Wayne's love of the sea--Wayne thoughtfully dubbed every \n     table with the name of a ship.\n       Ours was, of course, the State of Maine. And the Bride's \n     table? What else but the Queen Mary . . .\n       For that is what Mary was to Wayne--his Queen.\n       And she was able to rely on him always. His devotion to her \n     was unwavering and it was boundless. She never made a \n     decision without him, for they were partners in every way--\n     even against cancer.\n       And through it all, in all the times we spent together, and \n     all the discussions we had, through every hopeful sign, and \n     with every setback, I never heard either one of them ask \n     ``Why me? Why us?'' They just faced every day as a team, \n     determined to get through it together.\n       That Mary found such a perfect love with Wayne was a very \n     natural thing. Because Mary has been surrounded by love her \n     entire life.\n       Especially Chris and Betty, the parents she cherished, and \n     about whom she was so concerned throughout her illness. And \n     if you have ever spent time with Chris and Betty Bowers, you \n     will understand how Mary came to be so bright and cheerful \n     and optimistic.\n       As we heard the beautiful trumpet solo of ``Rock of Ages'' \n     a few moments ago, I couldn't help but think what rocks Chris \n     and Betty have been for Mary. With their frequent journeys to \n     Washington to be at Mary's side at crucial times in her \n     battle against cancer, they were a constant source of support \n     and love for Mary and for Wayne. And I know Mary was so \n     grateful that she was able to spend her last days surrounded \n     by their love.\n       And Mary took such comfort from the reassuring presence and \n     tender care of her beloved sister Missy, with whom she was so \n     very close, Missy's husband LeRoy, and such joy from time \n     with her precious nieces Jordan and Alexa.\n       She had a very special bond with Jordan, to whom Mary \n     entrusted the secret of fluttering eyes. Jordan used to say \n     ``Auntie, can I move in with you and Wayne?'' And Mary would \n     say ``But your mother will miss you.'' And Jordan said ``But \n     we'd let her come visit!''\n       And Alexa, at a different phase in her life. So little, but \n     so precious in her Auntie's eyes. Mary adored them both . . . \n     and the feeling was mutual.\n       The circle of love that was Mary's family also included her \n     grandmother Phyllis, who is too ill to be here today, but who \n     faithfully traveled from Sherman to Bangor to spend time with \n     Mary these past weeks, and is here in spirit, as well as her \n     aunts and uncles and cousins, and Wayne's parents and \n     grandparents and other family who became her own.\n       And as her days neared their end, she told Wayne she was \n     looking forward to being reunited with her beloved \n     grandfathers who passed away before her. And we know now in \n     sure and certain faith that she is with them today, and her \n     other grandmother she never knew in this life.\n       Two summers ago, as Karen and I began building our home in \n     my hometown of Perry, Mary and Wayne and her Uncle Tony and \n     Aunt Carmel bought from us a piece of land that my aunt and \n     uncle had given me at my birth. At a beautiful place called \n     Gin Cove on the Perry shore of Passamaquoddy Bay, overlooking \n     St. Andrews, New Brunswick.\n       This spot has been near and dear to me for my entire life. \n     It represents a family legacy, a place where I played as a \n     child, learned to dig clams and experienced the joy of living \n     in Maine. And while I knew selling it would be a big help in \n     realizing the dream of building our home, I was reluctant to \n     do so. But seeing how much Mary and Wayne loved it, and \n     knowing that it would fulfill their dream of being on the \n     ocean, and provide us the bonus of bringing them regularly to \n     Perry, made it just right.\n       Now that beautiful spot represents even more. Its beauty is \n     just one more reminder of the beauty of Mary Bowers, and the \n     legacy she leaves us all.\n       On Monday, Wayne came down to Perry to his and Mary's spot \n     on Gin Cove, seeking peace and reflection at this place she \n     loved so much.\n       May each of us find peace--and joy--as we reflect on Mary, \n     and give thanks to God for sharing her with all of us these \n     past 28 years. And while we're at it, let's whisper thanks to \n     Mary for sharing her love and her spirit and her goodness \n     with us.\n       Mary, to take some liberties at paraphrasing Garth Brooks \n     in that song you loved to sing: now we know we have a friend \n     in high places.\n       Mary, we love you, we will miss you, and we will never, \n     never, never forget you, for you will be in our hearts until \n     the day each of us join you in Heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6620-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LCOAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Aloha, OR. \nOn August 26, 2001, Lorenzo ``Loni Kai'' Okaruru was found dead in an \novergrown field with her face smashed in and her fingertips cut off. A \nbiological male born 28 years before in Saipan, Okaruru, Loni began \nliving as a woman before she had migrated to Oregon. Given the savagery \nof the attack--a telltale sign of a probable hate crime--local police \ncounted Loni's murder as the first official hate crime in the county's \nhistory.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6620-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6620-S6621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING MIKE MANGEOT\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

The program promises to provide \nongoing relationships with caring adults with a healthy start for a \nstudent's future, offers safe facilities and marketable skills through \neffective education, and gives opportunities to reciprocate through \ncommunity service.

It is a \nsource of great pride to call attention to their excellence. The \nchamber's contributions have made all the difference in the lives of \nits participants.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nMayor Don Wesely of Lincoln, Nebraska who on this day will relinquish \nhis duties as leader of this great city in order to spend more time \nwith his three children. After serving the Lincoln community for the \npast 25 years as mayor and a member of the Nebraska legislature, I \nbelieve Mayor Wesely has more than earned the opportunity.\n  Don Wesely began his career in public service in 1978 at the tender \nage of 24, when he became the third youngest person ever to serve in \nthe unicameral legislature. While serving the 26th legislative district \nof northeast Lincoln for 20 years, Don sponsored or cosponsored over \n300 initiatives that eventually became State law. His accomplishments \nas the chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee for 14 years \nhave had a lasting effect on the State of Nebraska and his focus on \nthose most in need has inspired his colleagues and constituents. When \nDon retired from the legislature in 1998, he was the eighth longest \nserving State senator in Nebraska history and he was only 44 years old.\n  As mayor, Don Wesely presided over the city during troubled economic \ntimes, but managed to leave the city on solid financial footing for his \nsuccessors. Mayor Wesely is a strong supporter of the largest \ninfrastructure project in the city's history the Antelope Valley \nProject and I can attest to his persistent advocacy of Federal \nassistance for all aspects of the project, including flood control, \ntransportation improvements, and community development. Mayor Wesely \nwas also instrumental in crafting a unique and historic public-private \npartnership that resulted in the baseball-softball complex that is now \nthe home of the minor league Lincoln Salt Dogs baseball team. And in a \ntrue measurement of his success in office, Mayor Wesely was a tireless \npromoter of private investment in the Lincoln area. During his last 2 \nyears in office, over 10,000 new jobs were created.\n  I had the pleasure and honor of working with Don Wesely both when I \nwas Governor of Nebraska and now during my time in the United States \nSenate, so I can say with conviction that he has served Lincoln and the \nState with distinction. I am proud to call Don Wesely a friend, and I \njoin the Senate and all Nebraskans in wishing he and his children \nSarah, Amanda, and Andrew all the best as they begin an exciting new \nchapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6621-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n6-MONTH PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO BURMA \n    THAT WAS DECARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997--PM 33\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 2003, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 19, 2003, during the recess of the \nSenate, received the following message from the President of the United \nStates, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am providing a report \nprepared by my Administration, covering the 6-month period since \nNovember 20, 2002, on the national emergency with respect to Burma that \nwas declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the Municipal Council, \n     City of Newark, State of New Jersey relative to the Municipal \n     Council opposing any pre-emptive, unilateral United States \n     military offensive against Iraq, without United Nations \n     consensus; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       POM-115. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     California relative to the Armenian Genocide; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the Armenian people, living in their 3,000 year \n     historic homeland in eastern Asia Minor and throughout the \n     Ottoman Empire, were subject to severe persecution and brutal \n     injustice by the rulers of the Ottoman Empire before and \n     after the turn of the twentieth century, including widespread \n     massacres, usurpation of land and property, and acts of \n     wanton destruction during the period from 1894 to 1896, and \n     again in 1909; and\n       Whereas, the horrible experience of the Armenians at the \n     hands of their oppressors culminated in 1915 in what is known \n     by historians as the ``First Genocide of the Twentieth \n     Century,'' and as the prototype of modern-day mass killing; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Armenian Genocide began with the arrest, \n     exile, and murder of hundreds of Armenian intellectuals, and \n     political, religious, and business leaders, starting on April \n     24, 1915; and\n       Whereas, the regime then in control of the empire, known as \n     the ``Young Turks,'' planned and executed the unspeakable \n     atrocities committed against the Armenian people from 1915 \n     through 1923, which included the torture, starvation, and \n     murder of 1,500,000 Armenians, death marches into the Syrian \n     desert, the forced exile of more than 500,000 innocent \n     people, and the loss of the traditional Armenian homelands; \n     and\n       Whereas, while there were some Turks and others who \n     jeopardized their safety in order to protect Armenians from \n     the crimes being perpetrated by the Young Turk regime, the \n     genocide of the Armenian people constituted one of the most \n     egregious violations of human rights in the history of the \n     world; and\n       Whereas, the United States Ambassador to the Ottoman \n     Empire, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., stated ``Whatever crimes the \n     most perverted instincts of the human mind can devise, and \n     whatever refinements of persecutions and injustice the most \n     debased imagination can conceive, became the daily \n     misfortunes of this devoted people. I am confident that the \n     whole history of the human race contains no such horrible \n     episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the \n     past seem almost insignificant when compared to the \n     sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915. The killing of the \n     Armenian people was accompanied by the systematic destruction \n     of churches, schools, libraries, treasures of art, and \n     cultural monuments in an attempt to eliminate all traces of a \n     noble civilization with a history of more than 2,000 years''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Winston Churchill wrote: ``As for Turkish \n     atrocities: . . . massacring uncounted thousands of helpless \n     Armenians, men, women, and children together, whole districts \n     blotted out in one administrative holocaust--these were \n     beyond human redress''; and\n       Whereas, contemporary newspapers like the New York Times \n     commonly carried headlines such as ``tales of Armenian \n     Horrors Confirmed,'' ``Million Armenians Killed or in \n     Exile,'' and ``Wholesale Massacre of Armenians by Turks''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Adolph Hitler, in persuading his army commanders \n     on the eve of World War II that the merciless persecution and \n     killing of Poles, Jews, and other peoples would bring no \n     retribution, declared, ``Who, after all,\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\n     speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians''; and\n       Whereas, unlike other peoples and governments that have \n     admitted and denounced the abuses and crimes of predecessor \n     regimes, and despite the overwhelming weight of evidence, the \n     republic of Turkey has inexplicably and adamantly denied the \n     occurrence of the crimes against humanity committed by the \n     Young Turk rulers, and those denials compound the grief of \n     the few remaining survivors of the atrocities, desecrate the \n     memory of the victims, and cause continuing trauma and pain \n     to the descendants of the victims; and\n       Whereas, nations that have officially recognized the \n     Armenian Genocide have been subjected to retaliation and \n     condemnation by Turkey; and\n       Whereas, there have been concerted efforts to revise \n     history through the dissemination of propaganda suggesting \n     that Armenians were responsible for their fate in the period \n     from 1915 through 1923 and by the funding of programs at \n     American educational institutions for the purpose of \n     furthering the cause of this revisionism; and\n       Whereas, leaders of nations with strategic, commercial, and \n     cultural ties to the Republic of Turkey should be reminded of \n     their duty to encourage Turkish officials to desist from \n     efforts to distort facts and deny the history of events \n     surrounding the Armenian Genocide; and\n       Whereas, the accelerated level and scope of denial and \n     revisionism, coupled with the passage of time and the fact \n     that few survivors remain who serve as reminders of \n     indescribable brutality and torment, compel a sense of \n     urgency in efforts to solidify recognition and reaffirmation \n     of historical truth; and\n       Whereas, by honoring the survivors and consistently \n     remembering and forcefully condemning the atrocities \n     committed against the Armenian people as well as the \n     persecution of the Assyrian and Greek populations of the \n     Ottoman Empire, we guard against repetition of the crime of \n     genocide; and\n       Whereas, California has become home to the largest \n     population of Armenians in the United States, and those \n     citizens have enriched our state through leadership in the \n     fields of academia, medicine, business, agriculture, \n     government, and the arts and are proud and patriotic \n     practitioners of American citizenship; and\n       Whereas, the State of California has been at the forefront \n     in encouraging and promoting a curriculum relating to human \n     rights and genocide in order to empower future generations to \n     prevent recurrence of the crime of genocide: Now, therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California hereby designates April 24, 2003, as the \n     ``California Day of Remembrance for the Armenian Genocide of \n     1915-1923''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of California commends its \n     conscientious educators who teach about human rights and \n     genocide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of California respectfully \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to act \n     likewise to commemorate the Armenian Genocide; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President of the United States, \n     Members of the United States Congress, and the Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-116.

A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California relative to immigrant military personnel; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, immigrants have a long history of service in the \n     United States military, including service in major wars, \n     including, but not limited to, World War I, World War II, the \n     Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operation Desert Storm, and the \n     current war in Iraq; and\n       Whereas, the number of immigrants serving in the United \n     States military has grown from 28,000 in 2000 to more than \n     37,000 today, and to date, immigrants comprise nearly 5 \n     percent of all enlisted personnel on active duty in the \n     United States Armed Forces and more than 20 percent of \n     Congressional Medal of Honor recipients; and\n       Whereas, at least one-half of the first 10 United States \n     soldiers from California killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom \n     were not United States citizens, and California contributes \n     nearly one of every three immigrant soldiers, more than any \n     other state; and\n       Whereas, Francisco A. Martinez Flores, Jose A. Garibay, \n     Jose Gutierrez, and Joseph Menusa, who were immigrant \n     soldiers serving in the United States Marines, lost their \n     lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and service in the United \n     States military, particularly in times of conflict, is the \n     ultimate act of patriotism and duty served to the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, many immigrants on active duty are trying to \n     become naturalized citizens and are required by law to be \n     available at all times for military service but are only \n     allowed to apply for United States citizenship after \n     completing three years of service; and\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush recently, issued an \n     Executive order conferring immediate eligibility for \n     citizenship to immigrants serving on active duty in the \n     United States Armed Forces to reward immigrants serving \n     during the post-September 11 war on terrorism; and\n       Whereas, Congress should explore implementing an expedited \n     one-year naturalization process beginning on a soldier's \n     first day of service, and granting immediate citizenship to \n     those participating in a war and those who have been \n     honorably discharged from the military: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to amend federal selective service and immigration \n     laws to grant the right of citizenship to any and all \n     immigrants who honorably serve in the military; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-120. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the \n     nomination of the Miguel A. Estrada; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, on May 9, 2001, President Bush nominated Miguel A. \n     Estrada to fill a vacancy on the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; and\n       Whereas, Mr. Estrada's credentials go uncontested beginning \n     with his mastery of the English language and American culture \n     upon his arrival to the United States as an immigrant from \n     Honduras and his graduation magna cum laude from Columbia \n     University and Harvard Law School; and\n       Whereas, over a year and a half has passed without a vote \n     on the floor of the United States Senate on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination; and\n       Whereas, Mr. Estrada has received support from liberal and \n     conservative colleagues alike who attest that he is one of \n     the most brilliant and effective appellate lawyers in the \n     country; and\n       Whereas, organizations who support Mr. Estrada include the \n     League of United Latin American Citizens, the United States \n     Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic National Bar \n     Association, the Hispanic Business Roundtable, and the Latino \n     Coalition; and\n       Whereas, Mr. Estrada would be the first Hispanic in the \n     country to sit on the United States Court of Appeals District \n     of Columbia Circuit, an important and prestigious position \n     within the nation's judiciary: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Louisiana requests our United States senators in the United \n     States Congress to support a floor vote in the United States \n     Senate on the appointment of judicial nominee Miguel A. \n     Estrada and to support his appointment; and be it further\n       Resoloved, That a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent \n     to the President of the United States Senate and to Senator \n     John Breaux and Senator Mary Landrieu.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-121. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana relative to the funding for state and \n     local homeland security activities; the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, a February, 2003 report issued by the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures indicates that states, after \n     already having reduced their FY 03 budgets by forty-nine \n     billion dollars are facing additional budget cuts of twenty-\n     six billion dollars before the end of the current fiscal \n     year; and\n       Whereas, that same report indicates that states are facing \n     a sixty-eight billion five hundred million dollar shortfall \n     as they prepare their FY 04 budgets; and\n       Whereas, as states cope with this growing budget crisis \n     they must also allocate additional resources to agencies \n     engaged in homeland security activities; and\n       Whereas, local governments who are also facing budget \n     shortfalls have already spent over three billion dollars to \n     upgrade their police, fire, and emergency response agencies \n     in response to growing threats of domestic terrorism; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana and its political \n     subdivisions, in particular, must be especially vigilant and \n     prepared to combat terrorism because of Louisiana's strategic \n     importance to the national economy stemming from the \n     Mississippi River transportation corridor and its ports to \n     the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has both the responsibility \n     and the resources to help finance efforts by state and local \n     governments to secure the homeland; and\n       Whereas, federal assistance for homeland security projects \n     that was promised to state and local governments needs to be \n     made available by the federal government through supplemental \n     appropriations: Therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to appropriate for and \n     expedite funding of state and local homeland defense \n     activities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-122. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to appropriating just \n     compensation to the State of Montana for the Impact of \n     Federal Land Ownership on the State's Ability to Fund Public \n     Education; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, for many years western states have grappled with \n     the challenge of providing the best education for their \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, western states face unique challenges in achieving \n     this goal; and\n       Whereas, from 1979 to 1998, the percentage change in \n     expenditures per pupil in 13 western states was 28% compared \n     to 57% in the remaining states; and\n       Whereas, in 2002 and 2001, the pupil-to-teacher ratio in 13 \n     western states averaged 17.9 to 1 compared with 14.8 to 1 in \n     the remaining states; and\n       Whereas, the conditions in western states are exacerbated \n     by projections that enrollment will increase by an average of \n     7.1% compared to an average decrease of 2.6% in the rest of \n     the nation; and\n       Whereas, despite the wide disparities in expenditures per \n     pupil-to-teacher ratio, western states tax at a comparable \n     rate and allocate as much of their budgets to public \n     education as the rest of the nation; and\n       Whereas, the ability of western states to fund education is \n     directly related to federal ownership of state lands; and\n       Whereas, the federal government owns an average of 51.9% of \n     the land in 13 western states compared to 4.1% in the \n     remaining states; and\n       Whereas, the enablings acts of most western states promise \n     that 5% of the proceeds from the sale of federal lands will \n     go to the states for public education; and\n       Whereas, a federal policy change in 1977 ended these sales, \n     resulting in an estimated $14 billion in lost public \n     education funding for western states; and\n       Whereas, the ability of western states to fund public \n     education is further impacted by the fact that state and \n     local property taxes, which public education heavily \n     relies upon to fund education, cannot be assessed on \n     federal lands; and\n       Whereas, the estimated annual impact of this property tax \n     prohibition on western states is over $4 billion; and\n       Whereas, the federal government shares only half of its \n     royalty revenue with the states; and\n       Whereas, royalties are further reduced because federal \n     lands are less likely to be developed, and federal laws often \n     place stipulations on the use of state royalty payments; and\n       Whereas, the estimated annual impact of royalty payment \n     policies on western states is over $1.86 billion; and\n       Whereas, much of the land that the federal government \n     transferred to states upon statehood as a trust for public \n     education is difficult to administer and to make productive \n     because it is surrounded by federal land; and\n       Whereas, federal land ownership greatly hinders the ability \n     of western states to fund public education; and\n       Whereas, the federal government should compensate western \n     states for the significant impact federal land ownership has \n     on the ability of western states to educate their citizens; \n     and\n       Whereas, just compensation will allow western states to be \n     on equal footing with the rest of the nation in their efforts \n     to provide education for their citizens: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the Montana Legislature strongly \n     urge the United States Congress to appropriate just \n     compensation to the State of Montana for the impact of \n     federal land ownership on the State's ability to fund public \n     education; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State send a copy of this \n     resolution to the President of the United states, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-123. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington relative to the Bonneville Power \n     Administration rate increases; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4021\n\n       Whereas, the State of Washington's economy is constructed \n     on affordable and reliable electricity; and\n       Whereas, energy prices in the Northwest are threatening \n     businesses and industries, including aluminum companies; and\n       Whereas, the Bonneville Power Administration is proposing \n     yet anther rate increase to go into effect on October 1, \n     2003; and\n       Whereas, the proposed increase is 15% more than the current \n     rates, which are already extremely high due to the more than \n     50% increase that has already occurred in the last couple of \n     years; and\n       Whereas, this increase will cost the state's economy one \n     billion dollars over the next three years; and\n       Whereas, many industries moved to Washington to take \n     advantage of low-cost hydroelectric power. They are now \n     paying more for power in Washington than in most of their \n     other locations in the nation; and\n       Whereas, without affordable energy for these industries \n     (aluminum, pulp and paper, aerospace, agriculture, etc.), \n     thousands of family-wage jobs will be lost; and\n       Whereas, many of these jobs are in rural and economically \n     challenged areas. These industries are at the core of many \n     Northwest communities and provide the foundation for numerous \n     secondary employment opportunities and also provide \n     substantial tax revenues; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rate increase will do more than \n     jeopardize high paying jobs. The nation is suffering a severe \n     recession and the Pacific Northwest is already the hardest \n     hit region in the country; and\n       Whereas, any increase in Bonneville Power Administration \n     rates will only slow or prevent economic recovery as well as \n     exacerbate the state's budget crisis; and\n       Whereas, the Bonneville Power Administration has the tools \n     available to meet all of its legal obligations, including \n     protecting fish and wildlife, without raising rates; and\n       Whereas, as a result of its $500 million prepayments to \n     Treasury to avoid a rate increase, the Bonneville Power \n     Administration can cut costs (not just slow its rate of \n     growth) and utilize its newly acquired additional borrowing \n     authority and the flexibility it has garnered; and\n       Whereas, this region simply cannot support an additional \n     billion dollar hit to its economy over the next three years: \n     Now therefore, your Memorialists respectfully communicate \n     their request for the Bonneville Power Administration to \n     refrain from adopting rate increases at this time, unless \n     absolutely necessary to preserve its bond rating, and to use \n     other tools at its disposal to manage costs until economic \n     recovery is in sight; and be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W.

A bill to authorize construction of an education center at \nor near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Education Center Bill. I am joined by my colleagues \nand fellow Vietnam veterans, Senators McCain and Kerry, in sponsoring \nthis bill that would authorize the construction of an Education Center \nnear the site of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\n  Twenty-one years ago, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was built as a \npermanent testament to the sacrifice of over 58,000 veterans who died \nduring the Vietnam War. It is a place of remembrance for Vietnam \nveterans and their families.\n  As the Vietnam War draws further into America's past, it is important \nfor future generations to remember the sacrifices of those who gave \ntheir lives in Vietnam, and to understand the lessons learned in \nVietnam.\n  Most visitors to the Wall today were not alive during the Vietnam \nWar. The Education Center would serve as an access point for the next \ngeneration. By collecting historic documents, artifacts and the \ntestimony of Vietnam veterans, the Education Center would provide \nvisitors with a better understanding of the Memorial.\n  The Memorial was designed to accommodate expansion. Over the last two \ndecades, the Wall's reach has extended; names of fallen soldiers have \nbeen added to the black granite. Building the Education Center \nunderground would expand the memorial in a new direction--one that does \nnot distract from the natural beauty of the Mall.\n  The names on the Wall must never become simple, empty etchings. Their \nindividual and collective power must remain connected to the real human \nsacrifices of war. The Education Center would help preserve this bond. \nIt would affirm the meaning of the Wall, not just as an acknowledgment \nof a war or a date to be remembered, but as a living memorial with \nlessons to offer those who come to learn.\n  Many educators, veterans, lawmakers and organizations have voiced \nstrong support for the proposed Education Center. Like the Wall, the \nCenter would be funded entirely by private donations--evidence of its \nbroad-based public support. There would be no tax payer money involved \nin building the Center.\n  Building an Education Center at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial would \naffirm the belief that we can inspire peace by educating our young \npeople about the consequences of war. For there is no stronger advocate \nfor peace than one who knows war.\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\n  I am proud to sponsor this bill authorizing the construction of the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial Education Center. I ask my colleagues to join \nme and Senators Kerry and McCain in support of this effort.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a special \nplace on the national mall. Its design has proven moving to millions of \nvisitors, offering a place of reflection, remembrance, and healing.\n  Despite the ``Wall's'' success in honoring those who fell in Vietnam, \nthe memorial lacks an appropriate visitors center, a place where the \nbroader story of America's involvement in Vietnam can be told. The \nlegislation we introduce today would authorize the construction of such \na center to provide information on the memorial, and to perform \nappropriate educational and interpretive activities relating to the \nmemorial.\n  A Visitor's Center at the Vietnam Memorial is important, because the \nVietnam War and the men and women who fought it are important. A \nVisitor's Center can provide a lasting gift of knowledge and \nunderstanding to those who visit the memorial, including students--for \nwhom Vietnam is a passage in their history books--and their parents--\nfor whom the memories of Vietnam remain immediate.\n  Adding a new structure to the national mall is not something we \nshould do without consideration of the impact such an action will have \non the open space we so cherish there. This legislation, however, \nspecifies that the Visitor's Center be designed with those concerns in \nmind--and in fact we expect the structure to be built under-ground. In \naddition, the design, construction, and operation of this center will \nbe borne by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. In this legislation, we \nseek only to authorize their work--not pay for it.\n  Vietnam left its imprint on a generation. It remains a touchstone of \nthe American experience in the twentieth century. A Visitors Center at \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial will help educate a new generation about \nthe heros who served their country in the Vietnam War, and I am \ndelighted to introduce this legislation with my fellow Vietnam \nveterans, Senator Hagel and Senator McCain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1077. A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in southeastern \nPennsylvania; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \ndirect the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to construct a national \ncemetery in southeastern Pennsylvania. In order to facilitate the \nconstruction of a cemetery, as mandated, this bill would also require \nVA to consult with Federal State, and local government entities, and \nwith Pennsylvania's veterans' service organizations, to locate land for \na new cemetery in the Philadelphia area--a process of stakeholder \ncollaboration that worked well to identify a site for a cemetery in \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania that is currently under construction--and \nrequire VA to report, no later than six months after enactment, on the \nstatus of its efforts to construct the cemetery.\n  It is clear to a number of observers--including, as I will discuss in \na moment, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs--that Southeastern \nPennsylvania needs a national cemetery. The Philadelphia area has one \nof the largest veterans' populations in the Nation, currently estimated \nat over 350,000. The fact that Pennsylvania has the second oldest \nveterans' population in the country makes the need for a new cemetery \nparticularly acute. Yet the closest existing VA cemetery--the \nPhiladelphia National Cemetery--has been closed to in-ground, casket \nburials since 1962 and, by 2005, will even lose the capacity to inurn \nor inter cremated remains, leaving area veterans with only one \nalternative: burial at Indiantown Gap National Cemetery, as a site as \nmuch as two hours removed, by car, from their loved ones' homes. This \nis not acceptable.\n  The VA is currently reassessing its needs for cemetery construction \nnationwide, and I have every expectation that VA will conclude that the \nPhiladelphia area is a site that should be at, or near, the top if its \nlisting of priorities. I draw this expectation from a statement made by \nVA Secretary Anthony J. Principi who testified at a hearing before the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I chair, on February 26, \n2003, that ``there is clearly a need'' for a national cemetery in the \nPhiladelphia area. He stated further ``that a national cemetery is \nnecessary in that area to meet the interment needs of the veterans of \nPennsylvania.'' Why, then, the need for legislation? This legislation \nis needed to assure that the Secretary's personal commitment becomes VA \npolicy.\n  VA has compiled a list of areas where national cemeteries will be \nbuilt over the next 20 years using a methodology which I, and the \nentire southeastern Pennsylvania delegation in Congress, believe is \nseriously flawed. The first flaw of VA's methodology is its assumption \nthat a locality has a ``need'' for a cemetery if a veterans' population \nof more than 170,000 resides more than 75 miles from an open State or \nnational cemetery. This assumption gives no consideration to the fact \nthat heavily-congested areas, like southeastern Pennsylvania, may have \nthousands, or even ten of thousands, of veterans residing just under 75 \nmiles from the nearest cemetery. The second flaw of VA's methodology is \nits assumption that veterans are adequately provided a burial option if \na national cemetery is close proximity offers the option of inurning or \ninterring cremated remains. For many reasons, cremation is not an \noption. Indeed, while cremation is growing in popularity, it is not yet \nthe preferred burial method among most Americans.\n  The entire southeastern Pennsylvania delegation to Congress has \nexpressed these objections to Secretary Principi by a letter dated July \n26, 2002, which I ask be printed in the Record. It is these \nobjectionable VA policy impediments which cause me to introduce this \nbill despite Secretary Principi's statements of agreement on the need \nfor a Philadelphia area cemetery. I hope--and I expect--that the \nmandate of this legislation will not need to be triggered, though I do \nanticipate that the consultation procedures specified in my bill will, \nin any case, be useful in identifying a proper site for a Philadelphia \narea cemetery.\n  One final note on the issue of proper siting of a cemetery. During \nthe 107th Congress, I introduced a bill, S. 618, that would have \ndesignate lands within the boundaries of Valley Forge National Park as \na national cemetery. In a development that was surprising to me, some \nargued that Valley Forge lands would be an inappropriate resting place \nfor veterans. I believed then--and I believe now--that the sensitive \ndesignation of Valley Forge lands in areas, for example, north of the \nSchuylkill River that were not encampments for Washington's Army, would \nbe entirely appropriate. In any case, the legislation I have introduced \ntoday would allow for--but not compel--the location of a national \ncemetery in Valley Forge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Anthony J. Principi,\n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We recently received volume one of VA's \n     contractor-prepared ``Study on Improvements to Veterans \n     Cemeteries,'' a publication designed to guide VA and the \n     Congress in identifying where national cemeteries should be \n     constructed over the next 20 years. We understand that you \n     have directed that National Cemetery Administration \n     construction planning be guided by the study's underlying \n     assumption that locales with an ``unserved'' veterans' \n     population of 170,000 or more be given priority. The use of \n     that assumption, it appears to us, might leave Philadelphia \n     out of VA's plans. By this letter, we seek to point out flaws \n     in the study, and to inform you of the unique circumstances \n     in which Philadelphia veterans find themselves. We also seek \n     to show you why exclusion of Philadelphia from national \n     cemetery construction planning would be a mistake.\n       The study concludes--we think erroneously--that the need \n     for cemetery space in the Philadelphia area is not imminent. \n     It bases this conclusion on the observation that, until 2010, \n     space will be available in two Philadelphia-area veterans \n     cemeteries for the interment or inurnment of cremated \n     remains. We understand that cremation is\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\n     increasingly popular. But traditional, in-ground burial \n     remains the preferred option--and it is an option that \n     Philadelphia-area veterans do not now have. Moreover, \n     Philadelphia has large Roman Catholic and Jewish populations \n     whose respective faiths, at minimum, strongly encourage \n     traditional burials. To state that Philadelphia-area veterans \n     are now served by a burial option due to availability of \n     cremation services is to disregard the preferences of most \n     veterans--and the religious guidance respected by many \n     veterans.\n       The study also underestimates the size of the Philadelphia-\n     area population which is, in fact, ``unserved.'' It adopts \n     the assumption that those who live within 75 miles of an open \n     national cemetery--in this case, the Indiantown Gap National \n     Cemetery--are ``served'' without taking into account local \n     circumstances. While it may be true that some portions of \n     Phildelphia--though not the Center City--are within 75 miles \n     of Indiantown Gap, anyone who has driven from the Center City \n     though the sprawl west of Philadelphia will tell you that the \n     distance, in practical terms, far exceeds a ``normal'' 75 \n     mile drive. More fundamentally, while it may be true (as VA's \n     contractor concludes) that ``only'' 152,000 Philadelphia-area \n     veterans will be outside that 75 mile radius in 2010, over \n     173,000 veterans are outside that radius now--an it is those \n     21,000 veterans who Philadelphia will ``lose'' who will need \n     to be buried. Further, given the fact that the five PA \n     counties that comprise metropolitan Philadelphia alone \n     contain over 340,000 veterans, you will not be surprised to \n     learn that the number of currently ``unserved'' Philadelphia-\n     area veterans swells to almost 290,000 if one measures by \n     reference to a 65 mile radius from Indiantown Gap. And it is \n     wholly reasonable to assume that had a radius of 73 or 74 \n     miles from Indiantown Gap been adopted as the reference line, \n     Philadelphia would have made the arbitrary ``170,000-\n     veterans-in-2010'' cut.\n       We recognize that VA must have some standard by which to \n     measure the need for national cemeteries. But we also believe \n     that a rigid-based standard is inherently arbitrary if local \n     circumstances and population patterns are not taken into \n     account by the decision maker. We who know you understand \n     that you do not inflexibly place form over substance when it \n     would yield an absurd result. We ask that in assessing the \n     need for national cemetery space, you maintain a degree of \n     flexibility. If you do, we trust that you will conclude that, \n     whatever the merits of the VA contractor's methodology, \n     Philadelphia needs a new national cemetery.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joe Hoeffel, Chaka Fattah, Rob A. Brady, Tim Holden, \n           James Greenwood, Pat Toomey, Arlen Specter, Joseph R. \n           Pitts, Curt Weldon, John P. Murtha, Robert A.

A bill to provide for military charters between military \ninstallations and local school districts, to provide credit enhancement \ninitiatives to promote military charter school facility acquisition, \nconstruction, and renovation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\nTITLE I--STABLE TRANSITIONS IN EDUCATION FOR ARMED SERVICES' DEPENDENT \n                                 YOUTH\n\n     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Stable Transitions in \n     Education for Armed Services' Dependent Youth Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) States are establishing new and higher academic \n     standards for students in kindergarten through grade 12;\n       (2) no Federal funding streams are specifically designed to \n     help States and school districts with the costs of providing \n     military or mobile students who are struggling academically, \n     with the extended learning time and accelerated curricula \n     that the students need to meet high academic standards;\n       (3) forty-eight States now require State accountability \n     tests to determine student grade-level performance and \n     progress;\n       (4) nineteen States currently rate the performance of all \n     schools or identify low-performing schools through State \n     accountability tests;\n       (5) sixteen States now have the power to close, take over, \n     or overhaul chronically failing schools on the basis of those \n     tests;\n       (6) fourteen States provide high-performing schools with \n     monetary rewards on the basis of those tests;\n       (7) nineteen States currently require students to pass \n     State accountability tests to graduate from secondary school;\n       (8) six States currently link student promotion to results \n     on State accountability tests;\n       (9) thirty-seven States have a process in place that allows \n     charters to be a useful tool to bridge the gap created by \n     frequent school changes;\n       (10) excessive percentages of students are not meeting \n     their State standards and are failing to perform at high \n     levels on State accountability tests; and\n       (11) among mobile students, a common thread is that school \n     transcripts are not easily transferred and credits are not \n     accepted between public school districts in the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 103. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide Federal support \n     through a new demonstration program to States and local \n     educational agencies, to enable the States and local \n     educational agencies to develop models for high quality \n     military charter schools that are specifically designed to \n     help mobile military dependent students attending public \n     school make a smooth transition from one school district to \n     another, even across State lines, and achieve a symbiotic \n     relationship between military installations and these school \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. 104.

A bill to make amendments to certain antitrust penalties, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Antitrust \nImprovements Act of 2003.'' I want to thank the Ranking Democrat Member \nfrom the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for joining me in \nintroducing this measure as an original cosponsor. I hope that we can \nexpeditiously report this measure from the Judiciary Committee and \nbring it to the Senate floor.\n  The Hatch-Leahy Antitrust Improvements Act of 2003 is long overdue. \nThe bill updates the criminal penalties applicable to antitrust \ncriminal violations and repeals the archaic Title VIII of the \n``Antidumping Act of 1916,'' as requested by the administration.\n  After careful examination and study of the current penalty structure \nfor antitrust criminal offenses, Senator Leahy and I have come to \nagreement that the law needs to be modernized in a number of areas. \nUnder current law, a person who commits a criminal violation of the \nantitrust laws can be subject to maximum punishment of 3 years \nimprisonment, while a corporation can be fined a maximum of $10 \nmillion. These punishments need to be updated to reflect changes in \nmarket conditions, as well as to make them consistent with other \nchanges we enacted last year to white collar criminal offenses as part \nof the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. Under the Hatch-Leahy proposal, the maximum \npunishment for an individual would be raised to 10 years imprisonment, \nand for a corporation the maximum fine would be increased to $100 \nmillion.\n  These changes are long overdue and will eliminate the huge disparity \npresent in our laws between the treatment of criminal white collar \noffenses and antitrust criminal violations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act \npassed last year raised the criminal penalties for a number of white \ncollar offenses, but did not do so for antitrust criminal violations. \nAn antitrust price-fixer who defrauds consumers for a total of $5 \nmillion should be subject to a penalty which is more consistent with \nthe penalty scheme for other white collar offenses. There is little \ndifference, in my mind, between a market place criminal who takes \nadvantage of consumers and a white collar cheater who steals money from \nhis victims.\n  The Hatch-Leahy proposal also will raise the maximum fines applicable \nto corporations and other legal entities from $10 million to $100 \nmillion per violation. Such a change is needed to reflect the change in \nour economy and the importance of maintaining a credible deterrent \nagainst such conduct by corporations and other entities.\n  It is also essential to note that all criminal fines are paid into a \nVictims Fund, which is administered by the Justice Department, and \nultimately disbursed to support victims' advocacy groups. Criminals who \nhave assets must first pay restitution to any identifiable victims to \ncompensate them for their suffering, and then must pay\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nfines to the Victims Fund. The increased criminal fines will enhance \nthe Justice Department's ability to support advocacy groups who work so \nhard on behalf of the victims of crime across America.\n  The Antitrust Division's criminal enforcement program has been very \nsuccessful in the past years, particularly in the area of criminal \nenforcement against international cartels affecting well over $10 \nbillion in commerce. With these new tools, the Antitrust Division can \nbe even more effective in enforcing our antitrust criminal laws and \ndeterring and preventing future offenses against American consumers.\n  This bill also repeals an archaic provision of law, enacted in 1916, \nthat allows private lawsuits with potential of treble damages against \nimporters or producers for unfair pricing provided they had the intent \nto injure a U.S. industry. The World Trade Organization, WTO, has ruled \nthat this act violates the United States obligations to address unfair \npricing through the specified administrative measures of the \nAntidumping Agreement. Repealing this statute is an important and \nnecessary step in complying with our obligations under negotiated \ninternational treaties.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these important measures and support \nthe Antitrust Improvements Act of 2003.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch today in \noffering this bill to increase criminal penalties against those who \nmonopolize or restrict the market using unfair and illegal business \npractices.\n  In an age that combines robust levels of international trade with the \nthreats of Enron-style accounting, we must be increasingly vigilant to \nthe threats of white-collar crime to our economy. Legitimate business \ncan only thrive when bad actors realize that violations of antitrust \nlaw will be met with the strictest of penalties. Our bill increases the \nmaximum sentence for a violation of the Sherman antitrust laws from 3 \nto 10 years. Fines to corporations are increased tenfold to a maximum \nof $100 million per infraction. This increase will make it clear to \ncorporate wrongdoers that no antitrust violation is affordable. These \nchanges bring antitrust penalties in line with other white-collar \ncrimes and send a clear message that the United States will not allow \nany company to abuse its consumers by misusing market power.\n  Our bill also repeals an old and rarely used provision, the \nAntidumping Act of 1916. Congress must eliminate this provision in \norder to come into compliance with a ruling by the World Trade \nOrganization. The U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of \nJustice both support the repeal of this act, and indeed have made a \njoint request for such legislation to the Congress.\n  I am pleased to have worked with the chairman on this important \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the joint request by \nthe U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Justice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Executive Office of the President, the United States \n           Trade Representative,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting the enclosed draft \n     bill to repeal a provision of law enacted on September 8, \n     1916, regarding prevention of unfair methods of competition \n     (15 U.S.C. Sec. 72, c. 463, Title VIII, Sec. 801, 39 Stat. \n     798). That provision provides for a private right of action \n     for treble damages, as well as for criminal penalties in an \n     action brought by the U.S. government, for international \n     price discrimination.\n       The Administration proposes repeal of this provision \n     because it is redundant of other U.S. laws providing remedies \n     for international price discrimination. To our knowledge, \n     during the past 85 years no plaintiff has obtained a final \n     judgment on the merits under this rarely-invoked law and no \n     government enforcement action has been taken. Furthermore, \n     this provision is inconsistent with the obligations of the \n     United States under the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement).\n       We would appreciate it if you would lay the draft bill \n     before the Senate. An identical proposal is being transmitted \n     to the Speaker of the House.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this proposal to \n     Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Ashcroft,\n       Attorney General.\n     Robert B. Zoellick,\n       United States Trade Representative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1081. A bill to amend section 504(a) of the Higher Education Act \nof 1965 to eliminate the 2-year wait out period for grant recipients; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill amend Title V of the Higher Education Act. Specifically, this bill \nwill eliminate the 2-year wait-out period now required between \napplications by eligible Hispanic Serving Institutions for grants under \nTitle V of the Higher Education Act.\n  Title V of the Higher Education Act is the primary vehicle used to \ntarget urgently needed funds to Hispanic Serving Institutions. Grants \nunder this section can be used by higher education institutions to \nstrengthen academic quality, institutional management, and financial \nstability. These grants are essential to institutions that provide and \nincrease the number of educational opportunities available to Hispanic \nstudents.\n  Under current guidelines, in order to qualify for a grant under Title \nV, an institution must have at least 25 percent full time, Hispanic \nundergraduate student enrollment, and not less than 50 percent of its \nHispanic student population must be low income. Title V grants are \nawarded for 5 years, with a minimum 2-year wait-out period after the \ntermination of a grant period before eligibility to apply for another \ngrant. During Fiscal Year 2002, 191 institutions were awarded grants.\n  Title V's 2-year wait-out period impedes Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions' efforts to implement continuing programs with long range \nsolutions to Hispanic higher education challenges. Eliminating the 2-\nyear wait-out period will be of great importance to equipping our \nNation's Hispanic Serving Institutions with the continuous funding that \nthey need to best answer complex challenges. In 2000, Congress \neliminated the wait-out period for Tribally Controlled Colleges and \nUniversities, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions. \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities also do not have a wait-\nout period. It is now time for us to eliminate the wait-out period for \nHispanic Serving Institutions.\n  Hispanic Serving Institutions provide the quality education essential \nto full participation in today's society. Many students in my home \nState of New Mexico have benefited from the academic excellence that \nHispanic Serving Institutions seek to provide. Title V grants are \nintended to provide assistance to these less advantaged, developing \ninstitutions, and preventing these institutions from reapplying for \ngrants for 2 successive years is obstructing their development.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF THE 2-YEAR WAIT OUT PERIOD FOR \n                   GRANT RECIPIENTS.\n\n       Section 504(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1101c(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Period.--'' and all that follows through \n     ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``Period.--The Secretary''; \n     and\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6632-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6632-S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 145--DESIGNATING JUNE 2003 AS ``NATIONAL SAFETY \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 145\n\n       Whereas the mission of the National Safety Council is to \n     educate and influence society to adopt safety, health, and \n     environmental policies, practices, and procedures\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\n     that prevent and mitigate human suffering and economic losses \n     arising from preventable causes;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council works to protect lives \n     and promote health with innovative programs;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council, founded in 1913, is \n     celebrating its 90th anniversary in 2003 as the premier \n     source of safety and health information, education, and \n     training in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council was congressionally \n     chartered in 1953, and is celebrating its 50th anniversary in \n     2003 as a congressionally chartered organization;\n       Whereas, even with advancements in safety that create a \n     safer environment for Americans, such as improvements in \n     technology and new legislation, the unintentional-injury \n     death toll is still unacceptable;\n       Whereas citizens deserve a solution to nationwide safety \n     and health threats;\n       Whereas such a solution requires the cooperation of all \n     levels of government, as well as the general public; and\n       Whereas the summer season, traditionally a time of \n     increased unintentional-injury fatalities, is an appropriate \n     time to focus attention on both the problem and the solution: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2003, as ``National Safety Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     month with appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote \n     acknowledgement, gratitude, and respect for the advances of \n     the National Safety Council and its mission.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nthat would designate June 2003 as National Safety Month.\n  National Safety Month is not just a tribute to our Nation's advances \nin health and safety and our never-ending efforts to protect lives. It \nrepresents a standard of excellence in safety to which we as a Nation \nmust continue to aspire. While our Nation has enjoyed great advances in \nsafety, we must continue to work to reduce the number of unintentional \nand preventable injuries and deaths. As summer is traditionally a time \nin which the number of unintentional deaths increases, it is \nappropriate to dedicate a month at the beginning of the season to the \nimprovement of safety and health in our country.\n  During National Safety Month, the National Safety Council will \nprovide tips, articles and information to raise awareness and promote \nsafe driving, home and community safety, general preparedness, and \nworkplace safety.\n  I would like to commend the National Safety Council for the \ncontributions that it has made to public safety. I am proud that the \nNational Safety Council is headquartered in my home State of Illinois. \nThe National Safety Council is celebrating its 90th anniversary as an \norganization this year, and its 50th anniversary as a federally \nchartered organization. Congress chartered the National Safety Council \nin 1953 to educate and influence society to adopt safety, health, and \nenvironmental policies, practices, and procedures that prevent and \nmitigate human suffering and economic loss arising from preventable \ncauses. The National Safety Council fulfills its mission through a \nnetwork of approximately 50 local and regional chapters that provide \nsafety and health programs and services to communities across the \nUnited States. The Council currently has 37,500 members.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for joining me to submit this resolution \nthat declares June 2003 National Safety Month and recognizes the \nNational Safety Council for its important work. During a time when \nhomeland security is foremost on the minds of Americans, this month \nwill continue to heighten public awareness of the ongoing quest to save \nand protect lives. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6633-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 45--EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO THE \n  GOVERNMENT OF KUWAIT FOR THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IT PROVIDED TO ALI \n    ISMAEEL ABBAS AND OTHER CHILDREN OF IRAQ AND FOR THE ADDITIONAL \n HUMANITARIAN AID PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF KUWAIT, AND \n                           FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of S. 1079, Senator Murkowski's bill to \nextend the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002; \nprovided further the Senate proceed to its consideration, the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a step in the right direction. We \nare very fortunate there has been movement by the majority toward doing \nsomething about unemployment insurance benefits. The problem with this \nas it now stands is with those people who have been so long unemployed \nthat they are no longer on the unemployment rolls. They have been off \nso long that under statute and regulation they are no longer part of \nthe unemployed of this country.\n  We want to make sure they are helped also. They are in dire need of \nhelp. Everyone needs help. We hope in the next few days we could work \nsomething out so these people can also be covered.\n  As that is the case, I hope the two leaders can get together, as I \nhave indicated, in the near future and work to have a bill both sides \ncan agree on.\n  As a result of this statement, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/19/senate-section/article/S6638-5", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 20, 2003\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

It is my understanding the two leaders are going to attempt \nto arrange votes on the two matters now pending before the Senate; that \nis, the Daschle amendment and the amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, and we would like to see if that be can be arranged \nprior to the recess Tuesday. That is not done yet, but Members should \ncontemplate two votes before our noon recess.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand the representation is accurate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
