Mr. President, today the Senate will be conducting morning \nbusiness to allow Senators to speak and to introduce legislation. Under \nthe previous order, at 12:30 p.m., the Senate will recess until 2:15 \np.m. for the weekly party lunches. As previously announced, there will \nbe no rollcall votes today.\n  This evening, the President will deliver his State of the Union \nAddress. I ask all Members to be in the Senate Chamber by 8:30 p.m. so \nwe can proceed as a body to the House Chamber for the President's \nspeech which will begin promptly at 9 p.m.\n  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will consider any \nlegislative or executive matters that become available. There may be \nsome additional nominations that are reported by the committees of \njurisdiction, and it is my hope that the Senate will be able to act on \nthose nominations in a timely way.\n  In addition, it will be necessary to act on a further continuing \nresolution this week. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible this week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the morning business time \nordered for today be divided as follows: The time from 10:30 a.m. to \n11:30 a.m. be under Republican control; the time from 11:30 a.m. to \n12:30 p.m. be under Democratic control. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat upon reconvening from the party lunches recess, the time from 2:15 \np.m. to 3:15 p.m. be under Democratic control; the time from 3:15 p.m. \nto 4:15 p.m. be under Republican control; finally, that the time from \n4:15 p.m. to 5 p.m. be equally divided between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, can we modify the request so that we lock in \nwhich Democrats expect to be here? Some of the times are more than 10 \nminutes, so we will need to ask unanimous consent to do that. I will go \nover that now with the consent of the Republican leader: From 11:30 \na.m. to 11:45 a.m., Senator Durbin; 11:45 a.m. to 12 noon, Senator \nBoxer; from 12 noon to 12:15 p.m., Senator Stabenow; from 12:15 p.m. to \n12:30 p.m., Senator Biden; from 2:15 p.m. to 2:45 p.m., Senator Kennedy \nwill be in control of the time. There will be some other Senators who \nwill speak, but Senator Kennedy will allot the time. From 2:45 p.m. to \n3:05 p.m., Senators Boxer and Jeffords; from 3:05 p.m. to 3:15 p.m., \nSenator Schumer.\n  This throws morning business off by 15 minutes. If the leader wants \nto take 15 minutes for the Republicans at 5 o'clock, that will be \nappropriate, but from 4:15 p.m. to 5 p.m., Senators Dayton and Dorgan \ncontrol that time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the reason there is some discussion is that \nwe do need to be out of the Chamber by 5 o'clock to prepare for this \nevening; so if we can have some modification of the time----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the note I was given had the wrong time. It \nwill be from 4:45 p.m. to 5 p.m., Senator Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. FRIST. I so modify my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of the week, as I \nmentioned, we will likely have votes. We will be dealing with the \ncontinuing resolution and, I am very hopeful, nominations as they come \nforward.\n  With respect to Friday, I expect there to be no rollcall votes, and \nwe\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nlikely will not be in session on Friday out of consideration for the \nDemocratic gathering and planned meeting. That will be similar to the \nfollowing Friday as well. We will have further announcements on that \nschedule during the course of the week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may say before the leader leaves the \nfloor, I believe we had a productive week last week. It was extremely \ndifficult and contentious at times. When it ended, I think it was good. \nI hope the leader will use whatever influence he has, which is \nsignificant, to have the conference move forward. We need to get this \nbill done. I hope the leader will do whatever he can to have the House \nand the Senate begin meeting immediately, and, of course, the way it \nworks is the administration is heavily involved in those conferences. \nThis is so important. I hope we start that ``yesterday.''\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I, too, will encourage our colleagues in \nthe Senate and in the House of Representatives and the administration \nwith regard to having an expeditious process. We all did work very \nhard. We had a recess that had been initially planned, and with the \ngoal of being able to accomplish what we all set out to accomplish--and \nthat is completion of these appropriations bills--all of us came back \nfrom that recess, worked together hand in hand, and accomplished a lot. \nSo over the course of today, we will be talking to our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, and bicamerally, so we can expeditiously bring \nthis legislation to a conclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1500-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight our President comes to Capitol \nHill, as Presidents historically do, to deliver a State of the Union \nMessage both to us here in Congress and to the country at large. I \nwould have to say that this State of the Union probably, in his \nPresidency, is one of the most critical.\n  We have a very bold President who has not ducked from any of his \nresponsibilities, and in so he has been a very dynamic, forceful leader \nfor our country. Tonight I believe he comes to Capitol Hill to \nchallenge us here in the Congress on a variety of fronts, to challenge \nus to do our work in a bipartisan way, not only for our country and for \nthe citizens of our country but for the world at large. This is a \nPresident who tonight will speak on a variety of topics. Let me talk \nabout four areas I think he will dwell on for much of his time.\n  First of all is growing our economy and creating jobs. There is no \nquestion that we are in, and have come through, a recession. We have \nmen and women in our country who are out of work. The economy has \nslowed. The revenues to government have frustrated our States. \nCertainly we have to recognize and deal with that here, as revenues \nhave declined. But most important, clearly it is an issue of men and \nwomen out of work. He will challenge us to grow our economy and to \ncreate new jobs, and he will do so by the dynamic approach of the \nstimulus package that will have tax reduction in it, to get money back \ninto the economy and out to not only the job creator but middle-income \nAmericans themselves, those who are the hard-working men and women of \nour country.\n  It will be argued from the other side, with oftentimes the gnashing \nof teeth and the wringing of hands, that somehow the President is going \nto take money away from Government. Somehow, it is Government, if you \nleave the money in Government, that will create all of these jobs and \nwill provide the safety net and the security for the American people. \nYet just last week we saw our colleagues on the other side offer \namendment after amendment that would have driven up our deficit by \nnearly $450 billion to $500 billion over the next several years. They \nclearly demonstrated that their intent is to keep all the money they \ncan get and spend it, instead of in any way trying to create a package \nthat will not take money out of the pockets of the working men and \nwomen of our country but will also generate the incentives that will \ncause the economy of this country to reinvest and to create jobs.\n  Over the next several months--and I hope it will only be a couple of \nmonths--the Finance Committee here in the Senate, and hopefully the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, will come forth with a budget and a \nbudget proposal that will include within it, I trust, many of the \nincentives that our President is proposing in his economic stimulus \npackage that he will talk about tonight. We can be a positive force in \nthe economy by rewarding and recognizing both investment and hard work, \ninstead of penalizing them by taking more and more, or by creating the \nkinds of hurdles or obstacles that the investment community has to take \nto reinvest in the economy. So I hope we listen closely to that \nproposal tonight, as our President visits with us about it.\n  He has obviously talked about--and I think will talk again tonight--\nstrengthening and improving health care in this country. We worked at \nit a long while last year. We were at the threshold of dealing with \nMedicare reform and prescription drugs. Those probably are some of the \nmost difficult areas with which to deal, but the most important. \nPrescription drugs have become a dynamic part of health care delivery \nin this country, yet we still deal with an old Medicare model that is \nnot paying its way to the provider and the caregiver. As a result, many \nof our senior citizens are having difficulty finding a primary care \nprovider, and are paying $300, $400, $500, $600 a month oftentimes, and \nmore, for prescription drugs. We can deal with that this year and we \ncan deal with it in a bipartisan way. The President has supported us in \nthat.\n\n  But last year, struggle as we might, somehow some of my colleagues \nthought it was an issue better left unaddressed until after the \nelection. Why? I suspect they thought they could take it to the people \nand somehow gain political favor by arguing that one side or the other \nhad denied the senior citizens of this country access to a viable \nmodern Medicare program with prescription drugs. I believe that \nargument fell hollow. What was heard by all of us who were out running \nfor reelection last year was: Congress, do your work. Do it on a timely \nbasis. Do it on a responsible basis. Yes, and do it in a bipartisan \nway. But don't drag your feet, don't argue, and, most important, don't \nin every way avoid getting your work done, failing to address the \nproblem with the argument that somehow you will gain political favor by \ndoing so; that will not work.\n  I think the President may also talk about something else that is \nreshaping American health care, and that is, of course, excessive \nlawsuits that are causing doctors literally to pack their bags and move \nto other States that have been bold enough to do tort reform over the \nlast several years and where, as a result, the cost of insurance for \ncare providers is not as great as it is in other areas of our country. \nThis is something we have to deal with here. Yes, we have to look at a \ncertain segment of our economy right in the eye and say fair is fair. A \nreward for malpractice suit should not make both the patient and his \nattorney multimillionaires in a single act. Clearly, a person injured \nby malpractice should be rewarded for that injury. None of us argue \nthat. But the fact that in some instances predator lawyers can make a \nmillion dollars or more a case doesn't make a lot of sense to me, and I \ndon't think it makes a lot of sense to the consumers, who now find they \nhave to pick up the bill because of malpractice insurance that some \ndoctors are now paying that is in the $200,000 to $300,000\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nto $400,000 a year range. That is, by any definition, excessive. I \nthink our President will speak to that this evening, will talk about \ntort reform, and charge us, this Congress, in a bipartisan way to deal \nwith that responsibly.\n  It is obvious to me, at least, that many Americans will be tuning in \ntonight to listen to the President on those issues. But obviously there \nis now another issue on which he will spend, I would guess, a good deal \nof time. That is the issue of defending peace and security at home and \nabroad. The President came to us last year in a post-9/11 environment \nwith a very bold reform package. In the waning days of the last \nCongress, we produced a new agency of our Government entitled the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That was a bold step on the part of \nour President. Anyone on the other side who says that we are less \nsecure today as a country than we were before 9/11, or that we are not \nas secure as we ought to be, fails to recognize the significant amount \nof money and the major steps that have been and are now being taken to \nbuild greater security for the citizens of our country.\n  I was chuckling a little bit the other day when a Member of this \nSenate talked about not having accomplished anything. I thought, my \ngoodness, that Senator must never travel on the airlines anymore, must \nnever go through security checks that sometimes take 20, 30, and 40 \nminutes, that sometimes require all of your bags to be inspected, your \nshoes taken off, your coat and jacket to be taken off.\n  I have seen, and I am sure the Presiding Officer has seen, 4- and 5-\nyear-old kids almost strip-searched and wanded at the airports. \nArguably, that is security. Frustrating? Yes. But I think our airlines \ntoday are substantially more secure than they have been. They will \nbecome increasingly secure as we refine security, and the people at \nthose checkpoints become all the more efficient in their jobs. That is \npart of what this Congress has accomplished.\n  Certainly border security has become increasingly tight. The ability \nto identify illegal aliens who may be here for a purpose of doing us \nharm is now an aggressive process, well underway. Our Department of \nJustice has moved very aggressively to find, apprehend, and prosecute \nthose where cases can be effectively built that they are, in one form \nor another, here with a purpose other than finding work and providing \nbeneficial service to this economy.\n\n  For anyone to say we are less secure today is a surprise to me. Does \nit say we are as secure as we ought to be? Certainly not. But it also \nsuggests, in light of the threat of terrorism, that we, as a country, \nlive differently today and must think differently in a post-9/11 \nenvironment, that we must be constantly vigilant and, yes, our agencies \nof government--whether it be Federal, State, or local--must improve \ntheir abilities. And they are being given the resources to do just \nthat, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Certainly, that \nis a challenge. I think it is a challenge that the President will speak \nabout this evening.\n  Lastly, and certainly as important, will be the issue of security \nabroad. Our Nation is a humane and civil nation. We are a peace-loving \nnation. We have always taken war as a very serious undertaking and one \nfrom which--while we do not enjoy it in any way when it comes to our \nown citizens' security and the security of freedom-loving citizens and \nallies around the world--we have not stepped back. Certainly, in a \npost-cold-war environment, we recognize, as the world's superpower, \nthat awesome responsibility and force we have.\n  This President--and I have heard him, as have all of us--speaks very \nclearly to that, recognizing not only his responsibilities as our \nPresident and Commander in Chief, but it is a responsibility he does \nnot take lightly nor does he take casually. He sees it as a huge \nresponsibility and one that he and his Cabinet treat most seriously.\n  In doing so, he has operated both in a bold and cautious fashion. For \nanyone to suggest anything less than that did not hear our President's \nspeech at the United Nations and his willingness to challenge them to \ndo their job with the passage of the U.N. resolution that, in fact, \nfinally put inspectors back into Iraq to do just that, to inspect and \nto find if Saddam Hussein had lived up to the original U.N. resolution, \nfirst and foremost, and, secondly, to see if, in fact, he was \ncontinuing to build weapons of mass destruction and if he had gained \nany kind of nuclear capability.\n  It has already been well established that he has both chemical and \nbiological weapons. Those were found. Those were recorded. Yet somehow \ntoday the world is cautiously saying: Well, that doesn't seem to count \nanymore. It is what you find today or tomorrow that will cause this \ncountry and our allies to disarm Saddam Hussein.\n  I do not think the President or his people see it that way. And while \nthey have been willing to give the United Nations ample time to \nrespond, this President does have a responsibility, and that \nresponsibility is, yes, to the world at large and the freedom-loving \npeople around the world, but his responsibility is to us, here at home, \nto make sure the actions we take in foreign policy increasingly reflect \non our security and our stability.\n  I think the President will talk about that this evening, as certainly \nhe and his Cabinet have been involved in that over the last good number \nof weeks and months. It has been one of his primary missions, along \nwith bringing this economy back to life and moving us forward as a \ncountry.\n  This is a critical speech for our country, both here and abroad, as \nthis President speaks to us and to the American people about his vision \nof leadership and responsibility, to move our economy, to create jobs, \nto put people back to work and, at the same time, to strengthen and \nimprove health care and the general well-being of the citizens.\n  He will, by his proposal of faith-based approaches, encourage us to \ndeal with acts of compassion. The President wants to apply compassion \nto some of the deepest problems in America. That is a side of our \nPresident that has been badly underestimated by some. He will urge \nCongress to pass both his faith-based and citizen service initiatives. \nWhy? Because it is in the best interest of this country to do so. For \ngood people to be helping good people who are in need of help, with \nsome assistance from our Government, at a tremendously lower cost and \nin a considerably more compassionate way, is exactly what this \nPresident will speak to in that initiative.\n  Lastly, of course, as I have mentioned, is defending the peace and \nthe security at home and abroad. September 11, nearly 2 years ago now, \nwas a time of awakening under an attack and a loss of our fellow \ncitizens' lives that we didn't think could happen. While some experts \nhad studied the issue over the years and had told us that someday it \nwould happen, I don't believe there was ever a true belief that it \ncould happen here. Now we know it can.\n  For us to think it will never happen again would be to dramatically \nunderestimate not only the ability of the human mind to figure a new \napproach but the intent of terrorists to do our citizens and our \ncountry wrong.\n  We have made some great steps forward in reshaping Government and its \nagencies to be more sensitive, to be able to connect the dots of \nintelligence and information and, out of that, to make an assessment as \nto the security of our country.\n  Also, this President has gone much beyond that. He has reached out to \nthe world at large and challenged people not to in any way encourage or \nignore a risk of terrorism and to deal with terrorists as if they were \nenemies of the world and enemies of the state. Clearly, we have a role, \nas a very powerful country, in working with our allies to make sure \nterrorism and terrorists have no safe haven anywhere in the world. That \nis why our President insisted that U.N. resolutions be enforced and \nthat we go back into Iraq, as the United Nations inspections team has \nover the last several months, to determine whether Saddam Hussein was \nliving up to U.N. resolutions that largely were to disarm and \nneutralize him after the Desert Storm war over a decade ago.\n  That will be another important part of his speech this evening, as he \nassesses that for us and challenges us, both as a country and as a \nCongress, to work with him in the days to come.\n  Trade and jobs and the economy on one hand, security on another, \nthese are issues that Congresses in the past\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nhave faced and this Congress will face. Our challenge is to be able to \nwork together, not for one side to gain political advantage over the \nother but to see how we can best solve these problems. Many of them, if \nnot most, will have to be dealt with in a bipartisan way so that our \ncountry truly does come together not only to make ourselves more \nsecure, but in that security to be able to live in a good life, to be \nable to have the resources and the wherewithal to sustain life in both \na livable and enjoyable fashion. That is the American dream. Most \nimportant, that is the American responsibility, be it here at home or \nto the world at large. That is our challenge.\n  I believe our President will once again challenge us this evening to \ngreatness.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is one of those big days in \nWashington. It happens every year with the President's State of the \nUnion Address. We look forward to it. It is an opportunity for the \nentire membership of the Senate and House to gather on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives and bring in the Members of the Cabinet, \nSupreme Court Justices, the diplomatic corps, and Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. The President of the United States comes before us in a well-\npublicized event to speak from his heart about the State of the Union, \nour Nation.\n  For about an hour--some Presidents take a little longer than others--\nthe President has center stage, as he should; he is our leader, our \nCommander in Chief. There is an air of anticipation during this lead-up \ntime to the State of the Union Address because, until he speaks the \nwords, we are never quite sure what he is going to say. The White \nHouse, whether it is under a Democrat or Republican, will tantalize us \nwith hints and little notions, but I have found in the time I have \nserved in Congress that sometimes they are misleading and they don't \ntell you the whole story. It is not until you go into the House Chamber \nand sit in the chair and listen to the President that you hear \nfirsthand what is on his mind.\n  You are not certain, as well, about the people he will honor and pick \nout. It has become a standing tradition, I think since President \nReagan, for the President to invite people to sit in the gallery, \nusually with the First Lady. They are pointed to with pride as great \nAmericans who have done extraordinary deeds. There is a lot of \nspeculation who will be up there. Will it be the family of a Reservist \nwho has been activated for a potential war in Iraq, a firefighter, a \npoliceman, or a member of the health professions who has distinguished \nhimself or herself in our homeland security? You are never sure. It is \nthis uncertainty which leads to the excitement about the State of the \nUnion Address.\n  But we learned today in a story published in the Chicago Tribune that \nsome people living here in Washington, some who work on Capitol Hill, \nhave no uncertainty about what the President is going to say. This \nmorning, in the Chicago Tribune, in an article written by Jeff Zeleny, \nit was disclosed that the White House has invited a select audience of \nRepublican lobbyists and political executives down to the White House \ntoday to hear the State of the Union Address. I think that is \nunprecedented. I don't think there has been a time before when a \nPresident has invited in lobbyists, special interest groups, to hear \nthe State of the Union Address in advance.\n  These top strategists and opinion leaders are going to attend a \n``closed-door State of the Union briefing inside the White House \ncomplex.'' Who will be included? We are not sure of all of them. There \nwill be about 70 top strategists, pollsters, and conservative groups, \nsuch as American Cause, founded by Pat Buchanan; Americans For Tax \nReform, whose leader is Grover Norquist, someone who is well known in \npolitical circles in Washington. Then, of course, the lobbyists for the \nbiggest corporations are going to be there in advance for the sneak \npreview, including personnel from AT and Eli Lilly, which is a major \npharmaceutical company. They get a chance, before the American people, \nto hear the State of the Union Address.\n  Why would the White House want to open the doors for these special \ninterest groups to hear the State of the Union Address before the \nPresident speaks to the American people? Well, it is certainly a \nspecial privilege he has granted to them. But it also reflects on what \nhe is going to say in that State of the Union Address. He is certainly \nnot bringing in these Republican strategists and business leaders and \nspecial interest groups to hear something they are going to find \nunsettling. He is really assembling a chorus of praise for those who \nwill say after the speech that it is the best ever.\n\n  When the President really speaks to America and its issues, I just \nwonder, will we witness the same level of moral outrage from the \nconservative cable commandos as we heard in years gone by when special \ninterest groups were invited to the White House? For this President to \nmake history by bringing in lobbyists to hear the address before the \npeople of the Nation, I am anxious to hear all of the people you see on \ncable channels and the reaction they will have.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed. I think this is a special moment for all \nof America. It is really not a special treat for lobbyists. \nTraditionally, this has been a moment for all America, to hear the \nPresident speak from his heart. When I reflect on what the President \nmight say this evening, I know for certain he will speak about \nsecurity, terrorism, North Korea and Iraq. That goes without saying. \nThose will be the issues that certainly will draw together many in \nCongress, Democrats and Republicans, on a bipartisan basis to stand \nbehind our fighting troops and behind America as a leader in the world.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I also read that article in the Senator's hometown \nnewspaper, and I am wondering, if this is a closed hearing, is this a \nfocus group? And I wonder if the lobbyists don't like certain lines of \nthat speech, or certain paragraphs or phrases, do you think he will \nchange the speech?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know. Someone said this morning the White House \nsaid it is baked and he is not going to change a word of it. I cannot \nsay if they are being called in as a focus group to see if there is \nanything they find objectionable. I think it is probably more likely \nthat they already know in advance they are going to have a warm \nreception from the special interest groups for the State of the Union \nAddress.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator, also, based on what was reported in the \nSenator's home State newspaper, it appears to me, in answering my own \nquestion, that maybe they had a lot more to do with writing that speech \nthan one would necessarily think. I think these people already know \nwhat is going to be in the speech, if you represent Eli Lilly. You can \ntell about that from what went on on the floor last week.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Eli Lilly is a special case. You will remember when we \npassed the homeland security bill to keep America safe from terrorism, \nsomeone stuck in a special provision that helped that drug company, \nwhich is based out of Indianapolis, IN. There was, I guess, \nembarrassment all around when it was discovered. Many times, these \nprovisions are stuck in a bill in the hopes nobody will find them. \nWell, they were found and many people objected to that on the floor. If \nthe Senator will remember, we had a vote on this issue. Several \nRepublican Senators said they were embarrassed that a drug company \nwould get a special break in the homeland security bill, which had \nnothing to do with homeland security, and it was going to come out \nsoon. Despite that momentary embarrassment, the fact is that Eli Lilly \nis front and center in the White House when special interest groups are \ncalled in to have a preview of the President's State of the Union \nAddress. That is troubling. I hope the press will ask those who made \nthis decision whether they have not compromised the integrity of that \ninstitution as relates to the State of the\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nUnion Address. Why in the world is the President letting this happen?\n\n  I know what is going to be said tonight. The President is going to \nspeak to us about Iraq. I think it bears repeating, as I said last \nweek, America's future is about more than Baghdad. It is about the \nchallenges that moms and dads across America worry about every single \nday. It is about more than Iraq. It is about the rock and the hard \nplace which millions of Americans find themselves between when they \ndeal with the Bush-burdened economy. How bad is this economy? How \nlikely is it that this President will do something now at the end of 2 \nyears to turn it around? The numbers are staggering. The numbers I give \nyou are not cooked by Democratic strategists. These are numbers \nreported by President Bush's own agencies of Government.\n  We have had the first back-to-back years of job loss in America in 50 \nyears; the worst job creation record of any President in 58 years, with \n2.3 million private sector jobs lost since the beginning of this \nadministration; a 43 percent increase in unemployment rates since \nPresident Bush took office--43 percent; the loss of $4.9 trillion in \nthe stock market. Did my colleagues notice what happened yesterday in \nthe stock market? People who follow this, as they should, know the Dow \nJones hit 8,000. It lost 141 points in 1 day. What does it mean? It \nmeans for people who have stocks that they own directly or through \nmutual funds for their savings or their retirement, as the people say \non the late night talk shows, they have seen their 401(k)s turn into \n201(k)s--and maybe 101(k)s, if we are not careful. It is hard to even \nsmile at that suggestion because a lot of people who counted on the \nstock market for their future have seen it disappear over the last 2 \nyears during the Bush administration.\n  We have seen the elimination of a surplus in our budget. When \nPresident Clinton left office--and these are indisputable facts--we \nwere generating a surplus each year to pay off the debt of America. \nWell, we are back in debt again. We are back in deficit. The projection \nis that this next year, the deficit we will face in America will be the \nworst deficit in 20 years, worse than any deficit under President \nRonald Reagan, President Bush's father, or the early years of the \nClinton administration. We are back in the deficit world.\n  What will the President say about that tonight? Will he remind us \nthat his response to the deficit is a $676 billion tax break primarily \nfor the wealthiest people in America? Think about that for a moment. At \na time when we are in recession, at a time when we are most certainly \nto be involved in war in the Middle East--I pray that does not happen, \nbut most certainly we are going to see that, with added expense to the \ntaxpayers--at a time when we should be funding the security of America, \nour homeland security, instead of meeting those obligations, the \nPresident has said give a tax break to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica--a $90,000-a-year tax break to people who make $1 million a \nyear in income.\n\n  Because of our deficits and because of the President's tax cuts, he \nis unable to fund things which are critically important to America. \nPresident Bush's plan is no stimulus to our economy. It is, in fact, a \ndebt burden that we are passing on to our children and grandchildren. \nWe have classrooms that assemble with us regularly in Washington to \ntalk about what is going on in Washington. The sad news for those young \nstudents is that this administration, with the cooperation of this \nRepublican Congress, is running up the balance on America's mortgage \nfor our kids to pay. That mortgage, incidentally, is money taken \ndirectly out of the Social Security trust fund to fund the tax breaks \nfor the wealthy people in America. That is not fair.\n  I think the President should address the real challenges facing \nAmerica, real job creation, a stimulus plan that will put people back \nto work, not one that is going to help the folks who sit around the \ncountry club and try to figure out what to do with their portfolios but \nthe people on Main Street who are trying to keep their small businesses \nopen and the folks who are struggling to keep their jobs.\n  One million American workers who have run out of unemployment have \nbeen left behind by this administration. There will be more to follow \nunless the President changes his approach.\n  Secondly, this President should address the costs of health care in \nAmerica. Health insurance expenses have become a crippling liability on \nbusinesses and families who cannot afford to buy protection. Instead, \nthe President is going to talk about tort reform, an important issue \nbut one that does not bear directly on the cost of health insurance and \nthe run-up we have seen there. He is going to talk about privatizing \nMedicare. So we are going to say to senior citizens, for the first time \nthey have a choice: They can pick their doctor or they can have their \nprescription bills paid, but they cannot have both. Boy, is that the \nfuture of health care in America?\n  We also need to give a helping hand to middle-income families. Would \nit not be great to have the President say tonight: We are going to \nprovide a tax deduction for college education expenses for middle-\nincome families? Think about families worried whether their kids can \nafford to graduate from college because of all the debts they are going \nto have. Would it not be great for the President to say, ``I believe in \neducation''; instead of this being a tax break for millionaires, this \nwill be a tax break for working families. Unfortunately, we should not \nhold our breath.\n  The President should also promise to fund his program of No Child \nLeft Behind. He has created a mandate on every State and school \ndistrict in America to do certain things, but he has refused to fund \nit. It is an unfunded mandate when the States are deep in debt. That is \nnot fair, and the President should rise to that challenge.\n  Senator Boxer of California will speak to protecting the environment, \nso I will not dwell on that, but this President in 2 years has a dismal \nrecord. When it comes to the polluter pays for Superfund sites, the \nPresident says, no, the taxpayers should pay, not the polluting \nindustries. That is plain wrong.\n  The President should commit himself to protecting Social Security. We \nknow the baby boom generation is coming along in big numbers and they \nwill be needing Social Security and Medicare. This President ignores \nthat and instead increases the deficit and the debt of America at the \nexpense of Social Security.\n  Finally, as to homeland security, listen carefully to see if we hear \nthe following words tonight in the State of the Union Address: Osama \nbin Laden. Let's see if the President even mentions the name of the \nperson we believe was responsible for September 11 who has disappeared \nfrom the headlines, disappeared from the news stories, because our \npursuit of him has, frankly, not ended as we wanted. Let's see if the \nPresident mentions that effort. Let's see if he mentions investing in \npolice and firefighters and health care across America to provide real \nsecurity to the people of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1503-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1503-S1505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AN ANXIOUS NATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Illinois I always \nappreciate his remarks both on the floor and when he is out meeting \nwith people via the media. He puts his finger on a lot of important \nissues. He mentioned that I was going to speak about the environment. \nThis afternoon, I will take on that issue. I will mention it this \nmorning, but my idea this morning, in the few hours before the State of \nthe Union, is to basically address the President of the United States \nfrom this Chamber in a way to urge him to address the anxiety of the \nAmerican people because I think the state of the Union, if it can be \nsummed up in one word, is anxious.\n  I want to go through why I think that is the case. So as we get ready \nto take part in a wonderful ritual where the Members of the Senate will \ngather in this Chamber--and I know the Chair, as a new Member, will \nexperience this amazing feeling of patriotism and excitement as we \ngather here to make that march across the Capitol to join our \ncolleagues in the House--we think very seriously about the state of our \nUnion and what we hope the President will say.\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n  In the spirit of great respect, I want to tell the President, through \nthis short talk of mine today, what I am hearing from my constituents \nabout the state of our Nation.\n  When I say ``Mr. President'' in my talk, it is directed at President \nBush.\n  Mr. President Bush, I must tell you that the state of the Union today \nis anxious--anxious about the twin threats of war and terrorism, about \nthe health of our economy and our environment; anxious about our \nchildren's education and our family's health care; anxious about our \nbasic civil rights, including our right to privacy and the right to \nmake personal decisions without Government interference.\n  Mr. President, the people are anxious and they are worried that you \nare leading us prematurely down a lonely path to war while ignoring \nother serious threats to peace and that you have lost your focus on \nterrorism.\n  As Senator Durbin said, the people have not heard a word about Osama \nbin Laden, whom you placed at the top of your terrorist list. We have \nnot heard a word about him in months.\n  Many believe that you are heading down the wrong path on the economy; \nthat you are leaving too many children behind; that you are sacrificing \nour environment at the altar of the special interests; and that you are \nfailing to address the health care issue.\n  People worry that you are actively seeking to reverse the \nconstitutionally protected right to privacy. Two examples of this are \nyour attacks on the right to choose and your selection of Admiral \nPoindexter, who was convicted of lying to Congress, to lead the Total \nInformation Awareness Program, collecting vast amounts of personal \ninformation and intelligence about ordinary American citizens.\n  I am very pleased there was an amendment which passed to essentially \ndo away with that program, but we do not know what the House of \nRepresentatives will do in conference.\n  Mr. President, you have not stated at all that you are for getting \nrid of this agency which will know everything there is to know about \nany citizen they decide to follow around via their use of computers.\n  Here is the stark contrast to where we were a year ago, when the \nentire world stood with the President and with all the American people \nas we struggled to recover from the terrorist attacks and prevent their \nrecurrence.\n\n  I saw Senator Biden on a talk show yesterday. He reminded us that a \nheadline in a French newspaper said: We are all Americans. What a \nmoment that was in history; the world was united behind us. Somehow we \nhave lost that leadership. We need to get it back. Today America stands \nfar too alone when it comes to foreign policy challenges.\n  Many thoughtful Californians of both political parties are saying \nU.N. inspectors must have more time to do their work. I hope the \nPresident will state that tonight. Three weeks ago, Colin Powell said \nthe inspectors were gaining momentum. We also know we have yet to give \nthe inspectors a lot of information we have about what has been going \non in Iraq. Information is power. The inspectors need that information, \nfirst, to find out what happened to the weapons; second, so we can make \na case that we do not have to deal with Saddam Hussein alone. I don't \nwant to see us deal with Saddam Hussein alone. Could we beat him \nmilitarily? Absolutely. But what happens after when we are alone? What \nhappens to sharing the costs of human life? We need our allies with us, \nand more than Great Britain.\n  Yes, Iraq must disarm. After all, Saddam Hussein said he would; he \nhas to. He agreed to the resolutions. We have to keep in mind more arms \nwere destroyed by the weapons inspectors in Iraq after the first \nPersian Gulf war than we destroyed by our bombs. That is a very \nimportant point reiterated by Madeleine Albright and by others. We have \na great deal of information to give the inspectors. Let's give it to \nthem. As long as Iraq is the focus of worldwide attention, as long as \nthe inspectors are there, as long as we are having the no-fly zones \npatrolled by our planes and our allies in the north and the south, this \nman is boxed in. He cannot put a big toe outside of that country. He \ncannot do anything to harm us.\n  I believe, therefore, we have time to avoid the devastation of war \nand, once again, to build the case and keep the international community \nwith us. I worry with this focus on Iraq that we have a foreign policy \nelsewhere in the world that is one of deliberate negligence. As a \nmatter of fact, if I had to put a word or two to the Bush doctrine, it \nappears to be a policy of designed neglect, except for Iraq. We ignore \nthe problems. We wait for the crisis to hit us. This modus operandi is \ncausing serious trouble in North Korea because North Korea was ignored \nand now it has complicated a crisis that grew out of this neglect.\n  Closer to home in Latin America we see unrest. I ask, why do we see \nunrest? We have ignored the countries in our own hemisphere. We ignored \nMexico. You promised there would be a new day. Yet we see the Foreign \nMinister of Mexico resigning out of frustration that he cannot even get \na meeting with anyone in America who has any power. To have control \nover what goes on, that is foreign policy.\n  At home, people are anxious and worried. They are worried about \nterrorist attacks. I am introducing a bill that will enable us to have \ncountermeasures placed on our commercial airlines so if someone held a \nshoulder-fired missile aimed at one of our commercial airlines, at a \ntakeoff or landing period, when they are most vulnerable, there would \nbe countermeasures on that plane. The President has been studying this \nissue. The President is spending tens of billions on missile defense \nfor long-range intercontinental missiles. Perhaps it is up to $60 \nbillion. A fraction of that would retrofit all of our planes.\n\n  And, by the way, when we take care of homeland security in such a \nmanner, we create jobs, good-paying jobs, as well. Yet we will be \nprepared for what will come.\n  We have to fund homeland security. I know Senator Schumer is going to \ntalk about that later today.\n  Let me finish by discussing the economy. We have watched this economy \nspiral downward for 2 years. We have seen this economy in a free fall. \nWe have seen the stock market in a free fall. We have seen people in \nthe country say: My God, I cannot retire. I was planning to retire. I \nwill have to work 5 or 6 years because my retirement nest egg is \nessentially gone or so greatly reduced people cannot imagine.\n  The unemployment rate, which was 4.2 percent when President Bush took \noffice, now stands at 6 percent nationwide. In my home State, it is at \na 5-year high of 6.6 percent. This is bringing anxiety and angst to the \npeople. More than 2.4 million private sector jobs have disappeared. \nMortgage foreclosures have reached record levels. The stock market has \nlost trillions of dollars. We have gone from surpluses in our Federal \nbudget to deficits as far as the eye can see. We are headed to a path \nof the worst economy in 50 long years.\n  In California last month alone the State lost 25,800 jobs. That is \nreal people. What is your answer? Give tax breaks to the people who \nhave jobs, who have earned millions of dollars, who are earning $1 \nmillion a year? You want to give them back $87,000, while my middle-\nclass people are going to get back $87 a year. Where is that fair?\n  More than that, what kind of stimulus is that? Think about it. \nSomeone who earns $1 million a year is going to take that $87,000-a-\nyear tax cut. What are they going to do with it? They already have a \nnew refrigerator in every home they own. They already have a new car or \ntwo parked at every home they own. They already have their vacations \nprepaid. What are they going to do? They are not going to do anything \nwith that money that is going to stimulate the economy. The greatest \nsecret of America is that our middle class is what makes the country \ngreat. It is our working families who will go out and spend that money \nin this economy, buying a new car. My friend from Michigan knows that \nis important. The millionaires have their cars. It is the middle-class \nworking people, if they get a good deal on a car, who will go out, if \nthey feel a little more economically secure, and purchase that car. \nMore of the same of the trickle down to the rich, which never gets down \nto this country, will not get us out of the economic nightmare in which \nwe find ourselves.\n  What the President wants to do to Medicare sends shivers up and down \nmy\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\nspine. My friend from Michigan will talk about health care. I hope she \ntalks about the fact that the so-called Medicare reform is the end of \nhaving a chance to pick your own doctor. They are blackmailing Medicare \npatients into thinking if they stay in that plan where they can choose \ntheir own doctor, they will not get any prescription drugs. This \nPresident wants them all in the HMOs. I say to my friend, and to the \nPresident of the United States, if the HMOs did a good job, that would \nbe one thing. If we could pass a Patients' Bill of Rights giving people \nrights in an HMO, giving them the treatment they need, giving them the \npreventive care they need, giving them the quality doctors they \ndeserve, it would be a different story. But pushing people into HMOs \nbefore we have solved the HMO abuse problem, and then saying, well, if \nyou do not do that you do not get your medicine, I hope people in this \ncountry will rise up against that plan.\n  Mr. President, you have another 9 hours. I hope you take that plan \nout of your speech. I hope you will take that tax cut plan out of your \nspeech and rewrite it and give the tax cuts to the middle class and \ngive the tax cuts to the working poor. That will stimulate this economy \nand make it a 1-year stimulus that doesn't drain the revenues of \nGovernment in the outyears so that we are in deficits for as far as the \neye can see. Give those tax breaks to the small business people. They \nare going to spend it on plant equipment.\n  Mr. President, go back to your speech and take a look at what you are \ndoing on education. Fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Mr. President, if you continue with your ``leave no millionaire \nbehind'' plan, you will have no money for your Leave No Child Behind \nplan. You can't have it both ways. You can't go to war, promise people \neducation, promise them this, promise them that, promise them homeland \nsecurity, and then give away all the money to the millionaires and have \nnothing to fulfill your promises.\n  People are on to this. They see it. You are doing it over and over \nagain--with homeland security, not spending the money we need. The \nburden is falling on the cities and the States and the localities. I \nmet with the mayors. Do you know what they said? Senator, when \nsomething goes wrong and, God forbid, there is a terrorist attack, \nsomeone is going to call 911. They are not going to call the White \nHouse, with all due respect. And they are not going to call me either.\n  I used to be in local government. I respect those people. We are \nhanging out local government to dry--the local police, the local fire \ndepartments, and the rest. That is wrong. It is all in the name of \ngiving tax breaks to millionaires who don't need it and won't spend it. \nIt is unfair and it is hurtful.\n  I will close, because my friend, Senator Stabenow, is here, on one of \nthe topics I will speak more about later, and that is the state of our \nenvironment. If you look back at the progress we have made in the last \n50 years and more, you will see a wonderful story emerging on the \nenvironment. You will see Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents who stood up and had great plans for this environment. Teddy \nRoosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton--they all \nmade the environment stronger. Everywhere you turn, Mr. President, you \nare rolling back that progress.\n  So the state of the Union is anxious. They are anxious on all of \nthese issues. Millions of Americans are waiting to feel less anxious. I \nhope, Mr. President, you will think about that before delivering your \nspeech tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order the \nSenator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1505-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1505-S1506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first thank my friend from California \nfor her usual eloquence. I agree totally with her sense of what our \npeople are feeling in terms of the anxiousness about possible war, the \nanxiousness about education for our children, about health care, about \njobs, about homeland security. I thank Senator Boxer for her comments \nthis morning.\n  I will follow up talking about an area that is so important to each \nof our families and is a growing concern to businesses in the country \nand to workers in the country; that is the whole question of health \ncare.\n  We know there is a growing sense of anxiousness. When I sit down with \nsmall businesses across Michigan, they tell me their fastest growing \ncost is their health care premiums. In some cases they are doubling. \nWhen I talk to the big three automakers and the other manufacturers in \nMichigan, I hear the same thing. When I hear from Chrysler that they \nare spending more on health care than on the raw materials for the \nvehicles--I am concerned. This shows me we have a serious, serious \ncrisis, a health care crisis.\n  At the same time, we all have spoken about the seniors of our country \nwho are choosing between their food and their medicine. This is real. \nPeople are asking us to act. Words are not enough. Rhetoric is not \nenough. We have to act in a way that provides opportunity for quality, \naffordable, accessible health care.\n  On the eve of the State of the Union Address, I rise to ask the \nPresident of the United States what he intends to do. Will he, in fact, \nchange his record and work with us on issues of health care in a \nbipartisan way, to actually get something done? I worry, myself, \nbecause of the record I have seen in the last 2 years. We have a record \nof this administration on health care that, unfortunately, is bad \nmedicine for the American people. We have attempted on several \noccasions to move forward policies and proposals that are in the best \ninterests of the American people. This administration continues to \noppose those.\n  I am talking about a Medicare benefit for all seniors for \nprescription drugs under Medicare that is affordable, that is \ndependable, that is available to all of our seniors--this President has \nconsistently opposed that approach. Whether it is also making \nprescription drugs affordable for all Americans and lowering the prices \nfor our businesses--the President has opposed efforts to open the doors \nto Canada to drop prices immediately, and he has opposed efforts to \nmake sure we have more competition in the system by closing the generic \ndrug law loopholes. Generic drugs are made by those companies that do \nnot do research but take the formulas after the patents expire and are \nable to develop and put on the market lower cost prescription drugs, \noftentimes exactly like the brand-name drugs. We know they can drop the \nprices up to 70 percent by just having the generic drug laws work.\n  We have business coalitions formed across the country urging us to \npass laws to shut down the loopholes so competition can work to bring \nprices down. Unfortunately, even after we passed a bill in this body, \nin the Senate, the administration has opposed it.\n  We have innovative State solutions like what has been done in Maine \nwhere the State wants to come in and use its bulk purchasing power and \nleverage that to negotiate lower prices on behalf of the uninsured who \npay the top prices in the world right now for their prescriptions. Our \nState governments understand that. Our Governors want the flexibility \nto be able to bulk purchase and lower prices. This administration has \nopposed it.\n\n  We need fair prices for Medicare providers. While we have seen some \nwillingness, and I appreciate that, to focus on the cuts that have been \nput into place for our physicians--that certainly needs to be done--\nwhat about the home health agencies that are closing? What about our \nnursing homes? What about our hospitals, our teaching facilities? We \nhave a crisis in health care, and the last thing we need to do is to be \nmaking more cuts to Medicare or Medicaid. Yet the administration has, \nto date, opposed fixing the Medicare problem.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, a real Patients' Bill of Rights so that \nthose who are in HMOs have the opportunity to have the physician of \ntheir choice and to have the rights available to them they wish to have \nto protect their families, a strong Patients' Bill of Rights--this \nadministration has consistently opposed that, as well.\n  And what about assistance to States for Medicaid? Right now 25 \npercent of Michigan's State budget is Medicaid. We have a $2 billion \ndeficit in Michigan out of a $9 billion budget. Our new Governor is \ndoing a wonderful job of trying to make the numbers add up, but without \nFederal support and help they will\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nnot add up and people will be hurt and doctors and health facilities \nwill be hurt. Yet, consistently, when we have tried to put forward \nplans on this floor, even plans that have passed the Senate have not \nmade it all the way because this administration will not support \nefforts to help our States and to help Medicaid.\n  Finally, there was a commitment made to double the National \nInstitutes of Health funding by 2003. The administration supports \nfunding cuts that will not meet that goal.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush record on health care to date has been bad \nmedicine for the American people. I ask the President today, rather \nthan moving forward with the proposals we are hearing about attempting, \nessentially, to privatize Medicare, this evening I urge him to reassess \nand to join us in bipartisan efforts to make sure our citizens have the \nhealth care they need and our businesses can afford.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator two brief questions, but \nfirst I salute her for her leadership. Since she has arrived in the \nSenate, she has been the most outspoken advocate for making health care \naffordable and accessible for Americans.\n  Let me make certain I understand. As you describe it, President \nBush's proposed Medicare reform will say to seniors: If you want \nprescription drug coverage, you have to leave the Medicare Program and \ngo into an HMO.\n  Because we have not passed the law giving people in an HMO the right \nto pick their own doctor, what he is saying to seniors is: If you want \nto have your choice of prescription drugs, then you have to give up \nyour choice of a personal doctor.\n  Is that what the choice is?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is absolutely correct. I thank my friend from \nIllinois, who is always in the Chamber fighting on behalf of the people \nof his State and the country.\n\n  There is no doubt about it, while the President is talking about \nincreased choices, what he is really saying is, if you want to get help \nwith your exploding prescription drug costs, if you want to stop having \nto pick between meals and your medicine, then you are going to have to \ngo into a private insurance company, an HMO, where they will decide \nabout your doctor. In fact, he is not willing to support a Patients' \nBill of Rights to make sure they get what they need while they are in \nthe HMO.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One last question. I know the Senator has more to add. Is \nthere anything you heard about what the President is going to suggest \nthat will lower the cost of health insurance for families and \nbusinesses across America, an exploding item in terms of their expenses \nwhich is pushing more and more people into the situation of being \nuninsured, underinsured, or putting more and more of their paycheck, \nevery week, into the cost of their health insurance? Has the President \nsuggested anything that will address that?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Unfortunately, no. We have seen a consistent effort to \nput forward plans that are supported by the brand name pharmaceutical \nindustry itself or by the insurance companies, but not those things \nthat will lower prices and make health care more affordable and more \navailable.\n  Last summer, with a very rigorous debate on the Senate floor and a \nstrong bipartisan vote, we passed a bill that would create more \ncompetition to lower prescription drug prices; it went to the House of \nRepresentatives where it did not see the light of day. Unfortunately, \nwithout the President's support and leadership, it will continue to be \nthat way. We need the President to step up and say that the fact that \nprescription drug prices are going up three times the rate of inflation \nevery year and that is too much.\n  It is too much. Our businesses cannot sustain that. They cannot \nsustain seeing their health care premiums double. At the same time, if \nyou are an uninsured senior in this country, you are paying top dollar. \nIsn't it ironic that of all of those who pay for prescription drugs \naround the world, the people who pay literally the most for their \nmedicine are uninsured people, most of whom are seniors, because they \ndo not have anybody negotiating on their behalf. They do not have \nMedicare right now coming in and saying: We are going to negotiate a \ngroup price. So they pay the highest price.\n  Why wouldn't it make sense to have Medicare coverage? The brand name \ncompanies do not want Medicare negotiating on behalf of 40 million \nseniors and the disabled to lower prices. So what they have come up \nwith is this scheme that would essentially not allow the clout of \nbuying power because Medicare would not directly be providing the \nprescription drug coverage. But they want to act as if they would like \nto have prescription drug coverage for seniors, so they come up with \nthis plan that would say: We will help you with your medicine if you go \ninto a private-sector HMO.\n  By the way, in Michigan, now we have seen, since the inception of \nwhat is really Medicare+Choice--which is the plan that has already been \nout there for private sector Medicare HMO coverage--more than 51,000 \nseniors in Michigan have been disenrolled because plans have withdrawn \nfrom Michigan. In fact, we do not have any HMOs in the Upper Peninsula. \nWe have very few plans in Michigan.\n  In fact, my own mother, who was in an HMO and enjoying the coverage \nunder Medicare+Choice, was dropped because the plan withdrew from \nMichigan. So we only have four private sector HMO plans in Medicare \nleft in Michigan, and they only serve 2 percent of the eligible \nMedicare beneficiaries in the State--2 percent--and the majority are in \nnine counties in southeastern Michigan, with the rest of the State not \nbeing covered. By the way, none of those plans are accepting new people \nor new enrollees.\n\n  So the President says: Let's take this plan that covers very few \npeople, where it is not working, and let's say if you want Medicare \nprescription drug coverage, you have to go through this failed plan. I, \nfor the life of me, cannot understand why this approach is being put \nforward except for the fact that certainly from the prescription drug \nindustry's standpoint, it is better than going under Medicare.\n  So, Mr. President, I would ask this evening for you to please speak \nto the anxiety, the anxiousness that we all feel, that Americans feel \nfor our families, for our businesses, that workers feel when they now \nfind their pay being frozen so their employers can afford the explosion \nin the health care crisis. I would like you to speak to those issues in \nvery real ways. Do not offer failed plans just to be able to speak \nabout this issue. Join with us in bipartisan efforts that we know will \nwork, efforts that have been supported by the private sector as well as \nthe public sector, efforts that are supported by workers, by seniors, \nby all of those who have a stake in making sure that health care is \naffordable and available.\n  We had a plan. We had a bill, S. 812, that passed this Senate last \nsummer. I commend all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nvoted for that legislation. We can cut prices that lower premiums for \nour businesses. We can provide Medicare coverage. And we can do it in a \nreal way.\n  I urge, tonight, that the President speak to us. And I invite him to \njoin with us in a plan that will work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as President Bush prepares to address the \nNation on the state of the Union, we stand, to state the obvious, at a \nprecipice of a momentous decision: War, war with Iraq.\n  The American people, and the world, for that matter, are waiting to \nhear what the President's decision is and his rationale for it. They \nare waiting to hear a clear explanation of why war may be the only \nremaining alternative and what will be expected of them not only in \nwinning the war but what will be expected of the American people for us \nto win the peace.\n  A generation ago, I and my entire generation learned a very important \nlesson. That lesson was: No matter how brilliant or how well thought \nout a foreign policy may be, it cannot be sustained without the \ninformed consent of the American people.\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\n  To date, there has been no informed consent. That is not a criticism; \nit is just an objective observation. For the President, to date, has \nnot had the requirement, in the hope of avoiding war, to inform the \nAmerican people in detail of what the consequences of war will be and \nwhat will be expected of them.\n  To date, the American people only know that Saddam Hussein is a \nbrutal dictator, who has used weapons of mass destruction against his \nown people, and that he is the man who invaded Kuwait, and we expelled \nhim. They are not sure as to whether or not he is an imminent threat; \nthat is, a threat to those security moms, not soccer moms, who are in \ntheir living rooms and are worried about the health of their children \nand the safety of their homes.\n  The American people are confused, I would respectfully suggest, by \nthe President's talk and the administration's talk of a new doctrine of \npreemption, and whether or not this is the basis upon which we are \narguing we should act, or that we are acting to enforce, essentially, a \npeace agreement, a peace agreement signed by Saddam Hussein at the end \nof the Kuwaiti war that said: In return for me being able to stay in \npower, I commit to do the following things.\n  They are under the impression--the American people--because of the \nsignals being sent by the Secretary of Defense and his civilian \nsubordinates, that this war will be short, essentially bloodless, and, \njust as in 1991, Johnny will come marching home again in several weeks, \nif not several months, after a decisive, bloodless military victory.\n  The American people are assuming we will lead a very broad coalition \nof other nations and have the world behind us in our effort. They \nfurther assume, contrary very much to the hard evidence, that the \ndefeat of Saddam Hussein will be a major setback for Osama bin Laden \nand al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations.\n  In short, they are under the assumption that one of the reasons we \nare moving against Saddam is that we will literally make terrorists' \nactions much less probable in the United States of America than they \nare today. For why else would we use all this power we have assembled \nin the gulf to go after Iraq rather than using all this power to go \nafter Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and in northwestern Pakistan where \nhe most probably is according to our intelligence community?\n  They put it together. Obviously, the President would not take 250,000 \nforces, invade, if we must, Iraq, if he didn't think that would \nmaterially affect what I, as an American man, or woman thinks is the \ngreatest threat to me, another 9/11. They also assume, contrary to any \nhard evidence, that Saddam Hussein is months away from developing a \nnuclear weapon that could strike American soil, for which he has no \ncapacity, nor in any reasonable prospect in the future would he have \nany capacity to send a nuclear weapon airborne from Iraq to the United \nStates.\n  Lastly, they seem to think the financial cost of this war will be \nmanageable and not cause any further economic disruption, for why else \nfor the first time in American history is the President of the United \nStates calling for war, the possibility of war involving 250,000 \nAmerican troops, at the very same time he is going to call, tonight, \nfor a $650 billion tax cut? That has never been done in the history of \nthe United States of America. Obviously, they think the President \nwouldn't do that unless this was going to be pretty costless, this war.\n  In short, I don't think the American people have been told honestly \nwhat will be expected of them and what additionally may be asked of \nthem if things don't go so well. I think they will go well. I am one \nwho has not been happy in the way we have proceeded, who thinks this \nwar will be prosecuted in a way that will absolutely, to use the \nexpression younger people use, blow the mind of the world in terms of \nour military prowess. But it may not.\n  Why is it so critical to inform the American people? Why, beyond \ntheir democratic right to know, is it so vital? I will answer that by \ntelling you a story.\n  On December 8, 2002, I was in Qatar being briefed by General Franks, \nwitnessing the preparation for war, and the war games were being \ncarried on. There were assembled in this secure room--a gigantic hangar \nwith a movie screen literally larger than the size of the wall behind \nthe Presiding Officer, probably somewhere around 30 feet high and 40 \nfeet wide--200 generals. I have never seen so many stars in my life, \nother than when I was a little kid lying on my back looking up on a \ncrystal clear night in the middle of the summer.\n  I was asked, after being briefed by these warriors, whether or not I \nwould address the assembled crowd, all active military personnel \nplanning this war. These men and women to a person were ready to go and \nwere secure in their knowledge that they would successfully complete \ntheir mission if asked to by defeating Saddam Hussein, if ordered to do \nso. What they were unsure of was us, the politicians, and whether we \nwere willing to tell the American people exactly what was likely to be \nasked of them and were the American people willing to continue to give \nthem the support they were going to need over a long haul, not the \nshort haul? And it will be a long haul, regardless of how quickly and \nsuccessfully we wage this war.\n  For those fighting men and women in this room know it is going to be \nnecessary to stay in Iraq for a long time, to have tens of thousands--I \npredict over 75,000 American forces remaining in Iraq a minimum of a \nyear and a half and, I predict, 5 years after we secure victory. And \nthey wanted to know whether or not the American people knew that, for \nthey don't want to be over there a year from now when the debate comes \nup and it is between another $20 billion to stay in Iraq and $20 \nbillion for education or for a tax cut. We have no right to put them in \nthat squeeze again, as happened a generation ago.\n  They also wanted to know if Saddam, as some suggest--and I am \nrevealing nothing; I am not speaking from classified reports--and his \n120 to 150,000 Republican Guard, the only ones we are really worried \nabout, their capacity, if they retreat to Baghdad, a city, a city of 5 \nmillion people, are the American people prepared to continue to support \nour military when they see the inevitable happen? Innocent women and \nchildren being killed. We know what will happen. We know if they \nretreat to Baghdad they will retreat to hospitals, apartment complexes, \nand our fighting women and men, if this happens--and it is not sure it \nwill--would have to go door to door. They were worried that the \nresponse would be the same response that occurs seeing Israelis \nknocking down a building or seeing a child killed in the crossfire.\n\n  They are worried they will become the bad guys, particularly, as I \nsaid, if the Republican Guard falls back to a city of 5 million people. \nImagine going house to house in Philadelphia or Houston, routing out 2, \n5, 10, 20, 50, 70,000 fighters. I told them that I believed this \ngeneration and the American people would pay whatever price and pledge \nits support to them, but only if they had informed consent. But that \nhas not been done yet, and it must be done.\n  For while it is reasonable to expect the best, it would be \nirresponsible not to prepare for the worst. Iraq could lash out against \nIsrael, Saudi Arabia and/or Kuwait in an effort to start a wider war. \nIt could use weapons of mass destruction against our troops or its \nneighbors. It could destroy its oil fields and those of its neighbors. \nIt could start giving away its weapons of mass destruction to \nterrorists.\n  It could create a humanitarian nightmare among the Kurds in the north \nand the Shia in the south, denying them food or medicine, even using \nchemical weapons against them, as Saddam has done in the past, and as I \nsaw for myself when I met the survivors a month ago in northern Iraq.\n  Maybe none of these unintended consequences will occur, but there is \na decent chance that one or more will. We must put every chance on our \nside and prepare the American people for what is bad as well as what is \ngood. Hopefully that will be done tonight or sometime soon by the \nPresident, but not after the fact. The world, our allies, also are \nwaiting for a clearer explanation of why war.\n  I just returned from the World Economic Forum and found myself \nconfronted with the most uniform and significant anti-American \nsentiment I\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nhave ever encountered in my career of 30 years dealing with foreign \nleaders abroad. Not a single American diplomat, elected official, \nAmerican journalist, businessman or labor leader would disagree with \nthe assessment I just gave you.\n  It raises several questions that need to be answered. Why do they \nfeel this way? Why should it matter? And if it does matter, what should \nwe do about it? Why? There are multiple reasons, and my pointing them \nout to a predominantly non-American audience of hundreds if not \nthousands of world leaders was not always appreciated the last 4 days, \nlet alone agreed with. Let me give you some of the reasons why they \nfeel the way they do, not all of which are legitimate, by any means.\n  There is a lack of strong leadership in the respective countries that \nhas been unwilling to tell their people the truth about Saddam Hussein \nand the commitment their country and the world made to deal with him \nwhen he sued for peace over 10 years ago. There are selfish economic \nmotives on the part of some of our allies with regard to their favored \nposition with regard to oil or telecom and scores of other areas.\n  Another reason is the resentment of America's predominant position as \nthe world's most powerful military and economic nation as well as our \ncultural dominance, from Coca-Cola to rap music to English on the \nInternet, all of which they resent in the same way we would all resent \nif tomorrow our States predominantly said, we are going to switch to a \ndifferent language because a predominant number of people in our State \nspeak that language. This is compounded by the belief that the \nPresident is being pushed by the right wing of his administration to \nfurther leverage this predominant position into an even more dominant \nposition relative to the rest of the world. It is also compounded by an \ninability to contribute much in the way of a fight, either by \naugmenting our military strength or their own, as well as a seething \nresentment at our unwillingness to use the forces they offered us in \nAfghanistan after declaring that an article 5 breach had occurred under \nour NATO treaty.\n\n  With regard to Iraq specifically, many don't see Saddam as a credible \nthreat to them. Their people don't believe our assertions. They say he \nno longer has the weapons of mass destruction that we know he has. They \nbelieve in the aftermath of victory, we will not stay until there is a \nstable Government in Iraq--as we have not stayed in Afghanistan \nsufficiently--and they believe the resulting power struggle within \nIraq, in their region, will have disastrous consequences for their \nGovernments because they have all heard this administration say it will \nnot be engaged in nation building. And they all know, and everyone \nknows, we are going to have to be engaged in nation building after we \nwin the war.\n  All of this is compounded by the obvious discussion within the \nadministration: The announcement of a new doctrine of preemption that \nhas yet to be explained to us, let alone them; the appearance of a \ngreat power being petulant when a President stands before the world and \nsays ``I am growing impatient, I am getting tired''; the apparent \ncontradiction in the rest of the world's mind of the treatment of the \nthreat from North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding nuclear, has a record of proliferation, and has violated \ninternational agreements, and we are talking to them; whereas, Iraq, \nwhich has no nuclear weapons--we cannot find the weapons of mass \ndestruction, and there is scant evidence of similar proliferation--they \nsay we speak with two different voices--the feeling that the \nadministration has acted, without serious consultation, unilaterally in \nunceremoniously withdrawing from further negotiations, from \ninternational structures, such as climate control, criminal courts, \nABM, and others.\n  Isn't the only thing that matters whether we make it work in the long \nrun, which is what they hear from some in this administration? Won't it \nall disappear when we succeed, as we hear some in this administration \nsay, because everybody loves a winner, right? Wrong. It matters what \nother nations think because our most basic immediate interests cannot \nbe fully secured without a longer term cooperation with these other \nnations because we must convince them and not coerce them.\n  Let me give a few examples of what our most immediate vital interests \nare. Crushing international terror: How can you do that without \ncooperation from the intelligence services from Jakarta to Berlin, from \nParis to Beijing, from Moscow to Rio? Preventing North Korea from \nescalating its nuclear programs and proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and doing so without a war: How can we succeed without the \ncooperation of Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea, other than \nthrough war? All of this leads to the perception that some within the \nadministration argue that it is better to go it alone. They have a \nbelief that is the President's position. I don't believe it is his \nposition, but what do they hear? They hear the theories proffered by \nsome in the civilian Defense Department saying, if we move in the face \nof world public opinion, the rest of the world knows we will mean \nbusiness and the more we do it alone, the more we will impress upon the \nrogue nations that they better change or they are next. They also hear \nus saying that Europe is tired, indecisive, and ultimately unwilling to \ndo what is necessary to keep the peace and commands too much of our \nresources and attention, particularly, as the Secretary of Defense \nsaid, ``old Europe,'' France, and Germany. They keenly resent these \ncharacterizations.\n\n  I think this is an inaccurate description of where President Bush is, \nbut I do believe, though, that his choice of words and failure to \nclearly explain his choices and basis for action when we do act has \nbeen dangerous to our standing in the world, which leads me to a second \nquestion.\n  Why should it matter what our standing is--what the rest of the world \nthinks of us? I believe it matters a lot. Preventing a nuclear war on \nthe subcontinent between India and Pakistan matters. But as we \nannounced a unilateral pronouncement of a ``new'' doctrine of \npreemption--whatever that means is yet to be explained--that leads to \nthe conclusion in India and Pakistan that if we can act preemptively, \nwhy can they not act preemptively against one another? Conveying our \nvalues to the rest of the world so as to diminish the misunderstanding \nof our motives runs constantly into some of the assertions that come \nfrom some in this administration.\n  Let me get right to it, Mr. President. It matters what other nations \nthink, and it matters that although we can force other nations to do \nthings, it matters how we do it. Here is an example. There is a new \nGovernment in Turkey--newly elected represented by an Islamic Party. \nThat Islamic Party recently won the election, and the Prime Minister is \na guy named Gul. The real operator is a guy named Erdogan. They were \nleading this Islamic Party and they have decided they want to have \nTurkey remain a secular state and they want to be integrated into \nEurope with regard to the EU. It is very much in the interest of the \nUnited States of America--very much--that that happens. We do not want \nan Islamic state; we want a secular state looking west.\n  So what is the problem? We can offer $5 billion and essentially buy \nthe support to allow us to launch from Turkey. But if we do that in the \nabsence of a worldwide consensus that what we are doing is right, we \nmay meet our immediate goal and lose a heck of a lot. Here is an \nexample. Right now, in Turkey--which I recently visited and I know the \nPresiding Officer knows this--over 85 percent of the Turkish people are \nunalterably opposed to a war with Iraq and unalterably opposed to \nTurkey cooperating with us in being able to successfully prosecute that \nwar. So what happens if we go to war and we launch from Turkey with the \nsupport of the new Islamic leadership without having changed the minds \nof the people in Turkey and/or the world, to suggest that this is not \nmerely us, but that it is sanctioned by the world that we do this? \nWell, the roughly 35 to 40 percent of this Islamic Party that is \nradical Islamic will play to its populist instincts and cause \nincredible trouble for the existing administration in Turkey and, I \nbelieve, force them to move away from their commitment to a secular \nstate.\n  So that old biblical proverb, what does it profit a man if he gains \nthe world and loses his soul--paraphrasing\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nit--what does it profit us to move prematurely on Iraq from Turkey if \nthe end result is that we radicalize a government that is represented \nby the Islamic Party.\n  What have we gained?\n  I will answer the third question, and then conclude. So what should \nwe do? I have argued that out of our self-interest it matters what \nother nations think. So what should we be doing? I begin by saying, \ngiven where we are now, coupled with Saddam Hussein being in material \nbreach--that is a fancy phrase for saying not explaining what he has \ndone with the weapons of mass destruction we know he has--those two \nthings may force us to choose between the better of two not-so-pleasant \noptions.\n  The option I would choose in this circumstance, if we do not get \nworld support, is that Saddam is in material breach of the latest U.N. \nresolution. Yesterday's damning report by the U.N. inspectors makes \nclear again Saddam's contempt for the world and it has vindicated the \nPresident's decision last fall to go to the U.N.\n  The legitimacy of the Security Council is at stake, as well as the \nintegrity of the U.N. So if Saddam does not give up those weapons of \nmass destruction and the Security Council does not call for the use of \nforce, I think we have little option but to act with a larger group of \nwilling nations, if possible, and alone if we must. Make no mistake \nabout it, we will pay a price if that is the way we go. We will have no \noption, but we will pay a price, a price that could be significantly \nreduced if from this moment on we act, in my humble opinion, more \nwisely.\n  What should we be doing from this point on? I will be very brief now \nand expand on this later. One, we should lower the rhetoric. We should \nnot appear to be the petulant nation, wondering why the rest of the \nrecalcitrant world will not act with us, showing our impatience. It \ndoes not suit a great nation well. It would not suit my father well, \nwere he alive. It does not suit someone of stature well--and we are a \nnation of stature.\n  Two, we should make the case not only privately to our partners by \nsharing more proof of Saddam's crimes and possessions, but also to our \npeople and in turn to the whole world. Legally, he is in breach, but \ngoing to war based on that legal breach will cost us in ways we would \nnot have to pay if we go to war with the rest of the world \nunderstanding that there is something there beyond the failure to \naccount.\n  The third thing we should do is give inspectors more time, for their \nvery presence in Iraq diminishes the possibility of sharing weapons of \nmass destruction with terrorists or continuing their quest for nuclear \nweapons. Inspectors are not a permanent solution. We know from our \nexperience of the last decade that Iraq will try to make their mission \nimpossible. We also know that sustaining a massive deployment of troops \nis expensive and hard on our men and women in uniform. But right now \nthe inspectors are helping us build support for our policy, both at \nhome and abroad, and we should let them keep working in the near term.\n  The fourth thing we should do is articulate clearly and repeatedly \nnot only the legal basis for our action, if we must move, but our \ncommitment to stay until we have a stable Iraq, and that means the \nfollowing: The President should state clearly tonight, we are not \nacting on a doctrine of preemption, if we act. We are acting on \nenforcement of a U.N. resolution that is the equivalent of a peace \ntreaty which is being violated by the signatory of that treaty, and we \nhave a right to do that and it is the world's problem. It is not what \nwe hear out of the civilian Defense Department, this cockamamie notion \nof a new doctrine of preemption which no one understands.\n  Two, our objective has to be clearly stated as eliminating weapons of \nmass destruction and not the destruction of Iraq, for that is the \nPresident's purpose.\n  Thirdly, we will in fact participate in nation building; we will seek \nU.N. support and we will tell the American people what we are asking of \nthem and why, for they have no idea now what is expected of them. They \ndo not know what the costs will be to remove Saddam and they should. \nThey do not know how many troops will have to stay in Iraq to secure \nthe country, and we have estimates, and what it will take to get a \nrepresentative government that lives up to its international \nobligations.\n  Can we count on our friends and allies to share the burden? Can we \nafford to attack Iraq, fully fund homeland security, cut taxes for the \nwealthiest Americans, and finish the unfinished war on terrorism in \nAfghanistan and other places?\n  These questions should never be excuses for inaction, but they must \nbe answered if we want the American people's support and we want to \navoid the mistakes of the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1509-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1509-S1512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.J.

Mr. President, as a brief explanation for the necessity \nfor these modifications, in the case of amendment No. 139, the \ninstruction line needed to be corrected. For amendment No. 166, in the \nversion the Senate adopted, two pages were missing. With respect to \namendment No. 172, there is a word change. And, finally, with respect \nto amendment No. 186, language which was supposed to be stricken was \nnot in the version adopted by the Senate. These modifications are \nsolely to correct these inadvertent errors.\n  The amendments, as further modified, are as follows:\n\n\n                 amendment no. 139, as further modified\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Corps of Engineers to construct a portion of \n      the modified water delivery project in the State of Florida)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . MODIFIED WATER DELIVERY PROJECT IN THE STATE OF \n                   FLORIDA.\n\n       The Corps of Engineers, using funds made available for \n     modifications authorized by section 104 of the Everglades \n     National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 (16 U.S.C. \n     410r-8), may immediately carry out alternative 6D (including \n     paying 100 percent of the cost of acquiring land or an \n     interest in land) for the purpose of providing a flood \n     protection system for the 8.5 square mile area described in \n     the report entitled ``Central and South Florida Project, \n     Modified Water Deliveries to Everglades National Park, \n     Florida, 8.5 Square Mile Area, General Reevaluation Report \n     and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement'' and \n     dated July 2000.\n\n\n                 amendment no. 166 as further modified\n\n(Purpose: To rename the United States-China Security Review Commission \nas the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       On page 713, strike line 23 and all that follows through \n     page 714, line 3, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 209.

MISSOURI RIVER.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the member states and \n     tribes of the Missouri River Basin Association are strongly \n     encouraged to reach agreement on a flow schedule for the \n     Missouri River as soon as practicable for 2003.\n\n\n                             s-chip program\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have been working for the last several months with a \nbipartisan group of Members from both the House and Senate to protect \nfunding for the S-CHIP program, which provides critical health care to \nmillions of our children. In my State, over 12,000 children participate \nin this program. There is strong, bipartisan support for a 2-year S-\nCHIP proposal developed last fall that would preserve $2.7 billion in \nFederal S-CHIP funds that either expired at the end of fiscal year 2002 \nor will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. Our proposal also \nestablishes a redistribution formula for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to use to quickly redistribute unspent fiscal year \n2000 funds to those States that have exhausted their allotments and \nneed additional funds.\n  Under Federal law, CMS is required to redistribute all unspent 2000 \nfunds this year, but there is no Federal requirement on what formula it \nis to use. CMS is currently holding off redistributing unspent 2000 \nfunds because it is awaiting congressional action. However, a few \nStates, including my own State of Rhode Island, need the redistribution \nof 2000 funds as soon as possible so they have sufficient funds for the \nrest of the year to maintain services to the children currently on S-\nCHIP.\n  This S-CHIP issue is very time sensitive. State are beginning to plan \ntheir upcoming budgets for fiscal year 2004, which starts July 1 in \nmost States. We do not want to distort State S-CHIP spending decisions \nby making it impossible for States to plan, in determining how much in \nFederal S-CHIP funds they will have and for how long those funds will \nbe available. Some States may unnecessarily scale back S-CHIP \neligibility as a result because they will assume they will have far \nless in Federal funds available than previously expected.\n  It now appears that we cannot address this issue in the omnibus \nappropriations bill. I appreciate the willingness of the chairman of \nthe Finance and Budget Committees, Senators Grassley and Nickles, to \nwork with me and the other Senators involved to address this issue in \nboth the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution and then to move this \nlegislation quickly in the Finance Committee.\n  Having said this, I think it is imperative for us to work with CMS so \nthat they can move forward to begin to distribute some of the unspent \n2000 funds to States like mine that are facing a serious S-CHIP funding \nproblem.\n\n  There is a way to move forward to address the immediate \nredistribution issue of the unexpended fiscal year 2000 funds. CMS can \nredistribute some of\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nthe unexpended fiscal year 2000 funds immediately to those States that \nface shortfalls in the coming months. This can be done \nadministratively. We certainly want CMS to begin to redistribute at \nleast some part of these funds to those States that are relying on this \nredistribution to maintain their child caseloads. For example, CMS \ncould redistribute 100 percent of half of the unexpended funds now \nleaving the rest to be redistributed once Congress has acted on this \nlegislation. As we in Congress move ahead to complete action on this \nfull proposal, CMS should move forward on the immediate redistribution \nissue.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am pleased to join my colleagues today in \nhighlighting the need for timely congressional action to secure funding \nnecessary to protect children on the S-CHIP health program. Nearly \n21,000 children benefit from this program in my State of West Virginia. \nThe S-CHIP program was created in 1997 with a bipartisan group of \nmembers to provide $40 billion over a 10-year period to extend health \ninsurance to some uninsured children.\n  Senator Chafee and I, along with other Senators, worked last year to \ndevelop a proposal that would address the long-term funding shortfall \nconfronting the S-CHIP program over the next several years. While this \nwas not considered last year, in the end, we were able to develop this \n2-year compromise with the authorizers in both the House and Senate as \na first step towards a long-term solution for S-CHIP's funding issues. \nThe compromise is a very reasonable one, providing assistance both to \nthose States that have spent their allocations and need additional \nresources to serve their S-CHIP children as well as States that need a \nbit more time to utilize their S-CHIP allocations.\n  I share my colleagues' concerns that this issue is a very timely one, \nand demands fast action on our part. I recognize that the first step is \nto include the necessary funds for this bipartisan 2-year proposal in \nthe fiscal year 04 budget resolution, and then to consider the specific \nlegislation in the Finance Committee. I would hope that Chairman \nGrassley and Senator Baucus would work to schedule a markup of this \nproposal as quickly as possible after the budget resolution is \napproved. We cannot wait to act on this until later this year when it \nis expected that we would consider broader health care measures. \nContrary to what some have said, this is an emergency for our States \nand uninsured children. I look forward to working with my chairman on \nthe Finance Committee, who deserves credit along with Senator Baucus \nfor developing this 2-year approach, to move this proposal through the \nCongress as quickly as possible.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to thank my colleagues for their willingness \nto work with me on restoring funding to the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program that is essential to ensuring continued health \ncare coverage for America's children.\n\n  For the past week, I have worked with my colleagues to secure this \nagreement that will restore $2.7 billion in expired--or soon to \nexpire--S-CHIP funding. This compromise that has been endorsed by our \nNation's Governors would ensure that this funding remains in the \nprogram and continues to provide children with access to the care that \nis vital to their healthy development.\n  I appreciate the willingness of Majority Leader Frist, Finance \nCommittee Chairman Grassley and Budget Committee Chairman Nickles to \nwork with us in developing this agreement. Because of their commitment \nto finding a solution, we are able to move forward with this important \npolicy.\n  I believe this agreement is the most appropriate way to restore the \nS-CHIP funding. Because the budget resolution adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives does not include adequate budget authority to restore \nthis funding, the floor amendment that I filed to the omnibus \nappropriations bill would be subject to a budget point of order in the \nHouse. Given that this point of order would lie against the provision, \nthe likelihood that the House would strip this during conference is \ngreat. In light of these circumstances, I believe this agreement is the \nmost appropriate way to ensure that this funding is restored.\n  The agreement that was struck would--in exchange for withdrawing the \namendments that my colleagues and I filed to the omnibus appropriations \nbill to restore S-CHIP funding--provide the support of the majority \nleader and Chairmen Grassley and Nickels to make necessary changes that \nwill remove the budget hurdles that have prevented this legislation \nfrom being enacted.\n  Specifically, Senator Nickles has provided his commitment to \nreallocate through the fiscal year 04 budget process additional budget \nauthority for S-CHIP in fiscal year 03 and fiscal year 04. Senator \nNickles, I am confident that under your leadership, the budget process \nwill move smoothly and expeditiously and that we will be able to speed \nthe adoption of this proposal in both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Further, Chairman Grassley has agreed to move this policy through his \ncommittee as soon as the necessary changes are made to the budget \nallocations. Again, under his strong leadership I am confident that we \nwill get this done.\n  Finally, Majority Leader Frist has agreed to place the legislation on \nthe Senate Calendar as soon as it is reported from the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I might add that while I am aware that this agreement was forged in \nthe Senate, the underlying policy proposal was developed through a \nbipartisan, bicameral process led by Senators Grassley and Baucus last \nfall. I hope the House of Representatives will work with us to make the \nnecessary changes to the fiscal year 03 and fiscal year 04 budget \nallocations and to see this vital policy enacted in a timely manner.\n  Since 1977, States have made historic progress in their effort to \ninsure low-income children under S-CHIP. In fact, the National Center \nfor Health Statistics just released data this month showing that the \npercentage of children 17 years of age and younger with health \ninsurance has increased from 86.1 percent in 1997 to 91.2 percent \nduring the first half of 2002. During this same period of time, \nstatistics show the percentage of children insured by Government \nprograms, such as S-CHIP, also increased to 27.2 percent. While these \nstatistics are encouraging, a great deal of work remains if we are to \naddress the critical issues of affordability and accessibility of \nhealth insurance, especially as they relate to health care for our \nchildren.\n  These compelling statistics reinforce the necessity that Congress \nmust act to restore the expiring S-CHIP funds. If we delay, we could \njeopardize the substantial progress that has been made since 1997 in \nincreasing the number of insured children in America. It is estimated \nthat without restoration of this funding, almost 1 million children \ncould lose health insurance coverage.\n  How it works is this--once passed, the policy would restore $2.7 \nbillion in S-CHIP funding that has either reverted to the Treasury or \nis scheduled to revert to HHS for redistribution. On October 1, 2002, \n$1.2 billion reverted to the Treasury in unspent S-CHIP funding from \n1998 and 1999. If we do not recapture this funding, it will be lost to \nthe program. Our agreement allows the States to reclaim this unspent \nmoney and provides until the end of Fiscal Year 04 to spend it on \nhealth insurance provided by S-CHIP.\n  It also strikes a compromise between States that have spent all of \ntheir 2000 and 2001 allotments, and those that have not, by dividing \nthe funding evenly between them. Those States that have not spent all \nof their allocations would be able to retain half of their funding, \nwhile the remaining States would receive additional allotments from the \nredistributed funding.\n  It also rewards those States that used Medicaid to expand access to \nhealth care for low-income children prior to the creation of S-CHIP, by \nallowing them to access some of their S-CHIP funding to serve this \npopulation. This compromise has the endorsement of the National \nGovernors Association and children's health advocates from across the \ncountry.\n  In my home State of Maine this proposal would allow the State to keep \n$13.24 million in S-CHIP funding and would provide until the end of \nFiscal Year 04 to spend it. I don't know about your State, but in Maine \n$13.24 million will help provide health care assistance\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nto a lot of children--children who otherwise would not have access to \nimmunizations, well-baby visits, and yearly checkups.\n  While my colleagues and I have agreed to forgo the appropriations \nprocess as the vehicle to move this package, we certainly have not \nabandoned our effort to restore the funding. In fact, we are more \ncommitted than ever to seeing the S-CHIP funding restored and have \nadded the support of the majority leader and chairs of the Finance and \nBudget Committees. Adding their endorsement to this effort, which \nalready has garnered strong bipartisan support, will help to speed its \npassage.\n  In closing, I would like to highlight a quote from Secretary Thompson \nwhen his agency released the positive new data I referenced earlier \nregarding the level of health insurance for children in our country. He \nsaid, ``More and more children are getting the health care they need, \nthanks in large measure to our success in working with States to expand \nhealth coverage through the S-CHIP program. We are giving Governors the \nflexibility they need to continue to expand coverage to more children, \nand our strategy is paying off for children and parents alike.''\n  This strong endorsement of S-CHIP should act as an impetus to getting \nthis policy enacted and ensuring that we do so in a timely fashion. \nAgain, I appreciate the support of my colleagues and look forward to \nworking with you as we move forward to enact this policy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this \nimportant children's care policy. They are correct that something must \nbe done to address the funds that have and will revert to the Treasury \nin the near future. They are also correct to the constraints within the \nomnibus bill. I strongly support the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. It is a program that provides health care for over 16,000 low-\nincome children in my State.\n  Senators Chafee, Snowe, and Rockefeller are looking to address a \nnecessary maintenance issue within S-CHIP. As Senator Snowe noted, I \nworked very closely with Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, Senator \nRockefeller, Chairman Tauzin, and Representative Dingell on a \nbipartisan, bicameral proposal that would have addressed expired S-CHIP \nfunds.\n  The proposal reflected a balanced approach to redistributing S-CHIP \nfunding taking into account that some States are spending through their \nexisting allotments and other States are ramping up their programs and \nwill need additional funding in the years to come.\n  This proposal did not pass the Senate last year, but it is a fair \napproach to redistributing S-CHIP funds. Unfortunately, I cannot \nsupport including this policy at this time. The omnibus is a poor \nvehicle for this necessary maintenance.\n  I am sympathetic to the intent of this policy, although this is \nneither the time nor the place to address this issue. The Senate and \nthe House have an agreement with the administration to keep the omnibus \nappropriations bill under $750 billion. The S-CHIP policy costs over \n$1.2 billion in budget authority in 2003. An amendment of this nature \nwould break that agreement and that is simply not acceptable. I \nappreciate the willingness of Senators Snowe, Chafee, and Rockefeller \nto accept this reality.\n  I assure my colleagues that I will work with them in the near future \nto update the S-CHIP redistribution policy in the near future as \nchairman of the Finance Committee. It is my understanding that Senator \nNickles, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is also interested in a \nregular order approach and that he is interested in putting money aside \nin the budget to address the needs of S-CHIP.\n  With this in mind, I believe the most appropriate way to address this \nissue is to work with the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nNickles, to secure sufficient funding for this bipartisan S-CHIP \nproposal and then to address it in the Finance Committee. I will also \ncontinue my work with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Tauzin, so \nthe Senate and the House can move forward in a coordinated fashion.\n  I assure my colleagues that I will work with them once the Budget \nResolution for fiscal year 2004 has been adopted to move legislation \nquickly through the Finance Committee that reflects a bipartisan, \nbicameral 2-year agreement on S-CHIP.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank Chairman Grassley for bringing this issue to the \nattention of Senators today. I appreciate the work of Senator Snowe, \nSenator Chafee, and Senator Rockefeller to resolve this, however I \nagree that the omnibus appropriations bill is not the appropriate \nvehicle to address the issue of the S-CHIP redistribution system. The \nlegislation does affect spending for the next fiscal year and, as such \nmust be addressed within the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution. I have \nspoken with Senator Snowe and would be happy to work with her to \naddress this issue. I will work closely with Senator Grassley and \nothers as we craft that resolution to secure the funds necessary for \nthe Finance Committee to consider this S-CHIP proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1512-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1512-S1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003\n\n  On January 23, 2003, the Senate amended and passed H.J.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``total \n     annual revenue'' means the revenue earned in a single year \n     from such stocks. The Secretary shall accept each qualified \n     bid in rank order of bid score from the lowest to the highest \n     until acceptance of the next qualified bid with the next \n     lowest bid score would cause the reduction cost to exceed the \n     reduction loan's maximum amount. Acceptance of a bid by the \n     Secretary shall create a binding reduction contract between \n     the United States and the person whose bid is accepted, the \n     performance of which shall be subject only to the conclusion \n     of a successful referendum, except that a person whose bid is \n     accepted by the Secretary under this section shall relinquish \n     all permits in the reduction fishery and any Dungeness crab \n     and Pink shrimp permits issued by Washington, Oregon, or \n     California; except that the Secretary shall revoke the \n     Pacific groundfish permit, as well as all Federal fishery \n     licenses, fishery permits, area, and species endorsements, \n     and any other fishery privileges issued to a vessel or \n     vessels (or to persons on the basis of their operation or \n     ownership of that vessel or vessels) removed under the \n     program.\n       (g) The Secretary shall establish separate reduction loan \n     sub-amounts and repayment fees for fish sellers in the \n     reduction fishery and for fish sellers in each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by dividing the total ex-vessel dollar value \n     during the bid scoring period of all reduction vessel \n     landings from the reduction fishery and from each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by the total such value of all such landings \n     for all such fisheries; and multiplying the reduction loan \n     amount by each of the quotients resulting from each of the \n     divisions above. Each of the resulting products shall be the \n     reduction loan sub-amount for the reduction fishery and for \n     each of the fee-share fisheries to which each of such \n     products pertains; except that, each fish seller in the \n     reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     shall pay the fees required by the reduction loan sub-amounts \n     allocated to it under this paragraph; except that, the \n     Secretary may enter into agreements with Washington, Oregon, \n     and California to collect any fees established under this \n     paragraph.\n       (h) Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. App. 1279(b)(4), the \n     reduction loan's term shall not be less than 30 years.\n       (i) It is the sense of the Congress that the States of \n     Washington, Oregon, and California should revoke all \n     relinquishment permits in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     immediately after reduction payment, and otherwise to \n     implement appropriate State fisheries management and \n     conservation provisions in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     that establishes a program that meets the requirements of 16 \n     U.S.C. 141861a(b)(1)(B) as if it were applicable to fee-share \n     fisheries.\n       (j) The term ``fee-share fishery'' means a fishery, other \n     than the reduction fishery, whose members are eligible to \n     vote in a referendum for an industry fee system under \n     paragraph (c). The term ``reduction fishery'' means that \n     portion of a fishery holding limited entry fishing permits \n     endorsed for the operation of trawl gear and issued under the \n     Federal Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Department of Commerce and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003''.\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\n                        TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY\n\n                   Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For expenses necessary for the operation of the Supreme \n     Court, excluding care of the building and grounds;

on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow on July 1, 1968 (21 \n     UST 483);\n       (4) the Agreed Framework is, as a result of North Korea's \n     own actions over several years and recent declaration, null \n     and void;\n       (5) North Korea's pursuit and development of nuclear \n     weapons is of grave concern and represents a serious threat \n     to the security of the United States, its regional allies, \n     and friends;\n       (6) North Korea must immediately come into compliance with \n     its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons and other commitments to the international \n     community;\n       (7) any diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis must \n     achieve the total dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons and nuclear production capability, including \n     effective and comprehensive verification requirements, on-\n     site monitoring, and

The projects shall emphasize reducing \n     risks to human safety and public health and property and \n     enhancing ecological functions, long-term forest \n     productivity, and biological integrity. The projects may be \n     completed in a subsequent fiscal year. Funds shall not be \n     expended under this section to replace funds which would \n     otherwise appropriately be expended from the timber salvage \n     sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     exempt any project from any environmental law.\n       Sec. 319. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based \n     on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from \n     those sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, shall be made available to domestic \n     processors in the contiguous 48 United States at prevailing \n     domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan \n     in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, the volume of western redcedar timber \n     available to domestic processors at prevailing domestic \n     prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that \n     volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, and (ii) is that percent of the surplus \n     western redcedar volume determined by calculating the ratio \n     of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass \n     to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a \n     rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this \n     amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the \n     determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for \n     sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale \n     is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber \n     sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation \n     of the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given \n     sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or \n     greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. \n     All additional western redcedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 320. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under \n     the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by \n     section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, \n     shall not result in--\n       (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to \n     provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. \n     Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult \n     with potentially affected holders to determine what impacts \n     the project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 321. Revision of Forest Plans. Prior to October 1, \n     2003, the Secretary of Agriculture shall not be considered to \n     be in violation of subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and \n     Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. \n     1604(f)(5)(A)) solely because more than 15 years have passed \n     without revision of the plan for a unit of the National \n     Forest System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary \n     from any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland \n     Renewable Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or \n     any other law: Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting \n     expeditiously and in good faith, within the funding \n     available, to revise a plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System, this section shall be void with respect to such plan \n     and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of \n     the plan on an accelerated basis.\n       Sec. 322. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to \n     conduct preleasing, leasing and related activities under \n     either the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) \n     within the boundaries of a National Monument established \n     pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) \n     as such boundary existed on January 20, 2001, except where \n     such activities are allowed under the Presidential \n     proclamation establishing such monument.\n       Sec. 323.

Employees of the foundations established by Acts \n     of Congress to solicit private sector funds on behalf of \n     Federal land management agencies shall, beginning in fiscal \n     year 2004, qualify for General Service Administration \n     contract airfares.\n       Sec. 325. In entering into agreements with foreign \n     countries pursuant to the Wildfire Suppression Assistance Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1856m) the Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Secretary of the Interior are authorized to enter into \n     reciprocal agreements in which the individuals furnished \n     under said agreements to provide wildfire services are \n     considered, for purposes of tort liability, employees of the \n     country receiving said services when the individuals are \n     fighting fires. The Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall not enter into any agreement under this \n     provision unless the foreign country (either directly or \n     through its fire organization) agrees to assume any and all \n     liability for the acts or omissions of American firefighters \n     engaged in firefighting in a foreign country. When an \n     agreement is reached for furnishing fire fighting services, \n     the only remedies for acts or omissions committed while \n     fighting fires shall be those provided under the laws of the \n     host country and those remedies shall be the exclusive \n     remedies for any claim arising out of fighting fires in a \n     foreign country. Neither the sending country nor any \n     organization associated with the firefighter shall be subject \n     to any action whatsoever pertaining to or arising out of \n     fighting fires.\n       Sec. 326.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``total \n     annual revenue'' means the revenue earned in a single year \n     from such stocks. The Secretary shall accept each qualified \n     bid in rank order of bid score from the lowest to the highest \n     until acceptance of the next qualified bid with the next \n     lowest bid score would cause the reduction cost to exceed the \n     reduction loan's maximum amount. Acceptance of a bid by the \n     Secretary shall create a binding reduction contract between \n     the United States and the person whose bid is accepted, the \n     performance of which shall be subject only to the conclusion \n     of a successful referendum, except that a person whose bid is \n     accepted by the Secretary under this section shall relinquish \n     all permits in the reduction fishery and any Dungeness crab \n     and Pink shrimp permits issued by Washington, Oregon, or \n     California; except that the Secretary shall revoke the \n     Pacific groundfish permit, as well as all Federal fishery \n     licenses, fishery permits, area, and species endorsements, \n     and any other fishery privileges issued to a vessel or \n     vessels (or to persons on the basis of their operation or \n     ownership of that vessel or vessels) removed under the \n     program.\n       (g) The Secretary shall establish separate reduction loan \n     sub-amounts and repayment fees for fish sellers in the \n     reduction fishery and for fish sellers in each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by dividing the total ex-vessel dollar value \n     during the bid scoring period of all reduction vessel \n     landings from the reduction fishery and from each of the fee-\n     share fisheries by the total such value of all such landings \n     for all such fisheries; and multiplying the reduction loan \n     amount by each of the quotients resulting from each of the \n     divisions above. Each of the resulting products shall be the \n     reduction loan sub-amount for the reduction fishery and for \n     each of the fee-share fisheries to which each of such \n     products pertains; except that, each fish seller in the \n     reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     shall pay the fees required by the reduction loan sub-amounts \n     allocated to it under this paragraph; except that, the \n     Secretary may enter into agreements with Washington, Oregon, \n     and California to collect any fees established under this \n     paragraph.\n       (h) Notwithstanding 46 U.S.C. App. 1279(b)(4), the \n     reduction loan's term shall not be less than 30 years.\n       (i) It is the sense of the Congress that the States of \n     Washington, Oregon, and California should revoke all \n     relinquishment permits in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     immediately after reduction payment, and otherwise to \n     implement appropriate State fisheries management and \n     conservation provisions in each of the fee-share fisheries \n     that establishes a program that meets the requirements of 16 \n     U.S.C. 141861a(b)(1)(B) as if it were applicable to fee-share \n     fisheries.\n       (j) The term ``fee-share fishery'' means a fishery, other \n     than the reduction fishery, whose members are eligible to \n     vote in a referendum for an industry fee system under \n     paragraph (c). The term ``reduction fishery'' means that \n     portion of a fishery holding limited entry fishing permits \n     endorsed for the operation of trawl gear and issued under the \n     Federal Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Department of Commerce and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003''.\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\n                        TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY\n\n                   Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For expenses necessary for the operation of the Supreme \n     Court, excluding care of the building and grounds;

on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow on July 1, 1968 (21 \n     UST 483);\n       (4) the Agreed Framework is, as a result of North Korea's \n     own actions over several years and recent declaration, null \n     and void;\n       (5) North Korea's pursuit and development of nuclear \n     weapons is of grave concern and represents a serious threat \n     to the security of the United States, its regional allies, \n     and friends;\n       (6) North Korea must immediately come into compliance with \n     its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons and other commitments to the international \n     community;\n       (7) any diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis must \n     achieve the total dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons and nuclear production capability, including \n     effective and comprehensive verification requirements, on-\n     site monitoring, and

The projects shall emphasize reducing \n     risks to human safety and public health and property and \n     enhancing ecological functions, long-term forest \n     productivity, and biological integrity. The projects may be \n     completed in a subsequent fiscal year. Funds shall not be \n     expended under this section to replace funds which would \n     otherwise appropriately be expended from the timber salvage \n     sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     exempt any project from any environmental law.\n       Sec. 319. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based \n     on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from \n     those sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, shall be made available to domestic \n     processors in the contiguous 48 United States at prevailing \n     domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan \n     in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, the volume of western redcedar timber \n     available to domestic processors at prevailing domestic \n     prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that \n     volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, and (ii) is that percent of the surplus \n     western redcedar volume determined by calculating the ratio \n     of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass \n     to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a \n     rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this \n     amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the \n     determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for \n     sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale \n     is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber \n     sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation \n     of the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given \n     sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or \n     greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. \n     All additional western redcedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 320. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under \n     the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by \n     section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, \n     shall not result in--\n       (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to \n     provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. \n     Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult \n     with potentially affected holders to determine what impacts \n     the project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n\n     In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 321. Revision of Forest Plans. Prior to October 1, \n     2003, the Secretary of Agriculture shall not be considered to \n     be in violation of subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and \n     Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. \n     1604(f)(5)(A)) solely because more than 15 years have passed \n     without revision of the plan for a unit of the National \n     Forest System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary \n     from any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland \n     Renewable Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or \n     any other law: Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting \n     expeditiously and in good faith, within the funding \n     available, to revise a plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System, this section shall be void with respect to such plan \n     and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of \n     the plan on an accelerated basis.\n       Sec. 322. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to \n     conduct preleasing, leasing and related activities under \n     either the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) \n     within the boundaries of a National Monument established \n     pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) \n     as such boundary existed on January 20, 2001, except where \n     such activities are allowed under the Presidential \n     proclamation establishing such monument.\n       Sec. 323.

Employees of the foundations established by Acts \n     of Congress to solicit private sector funds on behalf of \n     Federal land management agencies shall, beginning in fiscal \n     year 2004, qualify for General Service Administration \n     contract airfares.\n       Sec. 325. In entering into agreements with foreign \n     countries pursuant to the Wildfire Suppression Assistance Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1856m) the Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Secretary of the Interior are authorized to enter into \n     reciprocal agreements in which the individuals furnished \n     under said agreements to provide wildfire services are \n     considered, for purposes of tort liability, employees of the \n     country receiving said services when the individuals are \n     fighting fires. The Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall not enter into any agreement under this \n     provision unless the foreign country (either directly or \n     through its fire organization) agrees to assume any and all \n     liability for the acts or omissions of American firefighters \n     engaged in firefighting in a foreign country. When an \n     agreement is reached for furnishing fire fighting services, \n     the only remedies for acts or omissions committed while \n     fighting fires shall be those provided under the laws of the \n     host country and those remedies shall be the exclusive \n     remedies for any claim arising out of fighting fires in a \n     foreign country. Neither the sending country nor any \n     organization associated with the firefighter shall be subject \n     to any action whatsoever pertaining to or arising out of \n     fighting fires.\n       Sec. 326.

Madam President, I welcome the fact that the leadership \nhas given this time to express our strong views on a very important \nissue, the whole issue, the quality of education for the children of \nthis country.\n  It was just about a year ago, Members--I see Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Senator Dodd from our committee--remember clearly this Nation \ncame together, Republican and Democrat, to sign the No Child Left \nBehind Act, the gateway of opportunity, of progress, for academic \nachievement and accomplishment.\n  We all looked forward to smaller classes, better trained teachers, \nafterschool programs. We looked forward to this with great hope and \ngreat anticipation. We looked forward to parental involvement so \nparents could understand how their children were learning in local \nschools, with greater accountability for students, for schools, for \nteachers and parents, and also for the Congress of the United States.\n  As we come to the time of the President of the United States \nspeaking, if we listen carefully to what is happening all across this \ncountry, we will hear we have failed in our understanding and \ncommitment to education and the administration has failed in giving \nlife to our promises in the form of resources to make sure those \npromises are kept.\n  Listen to what the Governor of Delaware, Ruth Ann Minner, said \nrecently: Delaware has asked local school districts to return $10 \nmillion from current year budgets. The impact of those kinds of budget-\ncutting measures takes a tremendous toll in providing enough teachers \nto continue progress to reduce class size, which is so important to the \nquality of education. Federal programs, such as No Child Left Behind or \nIDEA, implemented without adequate Federal funding--no matter that we \nshare the goal and the vision--represent an empty promise.\n  We have had debates here on whether we have provided the resources or \nnot. Let's listen to what is happening across the country.\n  In a Washington Post article today, it says Oregon today is on the \nverge of cutting 15 days, potentially 24 days, from its school year. \nThe United States ranks 18th among the industrial nations in school \nyear length. How can we expect American schoolchildren to learn in 180 \ndays as much as Korean children learn in 220? And now Oregon may cut \nback to 165 days of the school year.\n  The New York Times reported on the impact on the children. Linda \nPattison, a fourth grade teacher here uses her fingers to check off the \nlessons that she usually teaches but will skip. Her pupils will not \nstudy the metric system, arithmetic, electricity and science, nor \nOregon's history and social studies. ``I can only compare this to my \ndivorce,'' said the teacher.\n  More than 100 school districts in 8 States have moved to 4-day weeks \nto cut costs. Oklahoma City has cut bus service entirely for 1,000 \nstudents. In Barnstable, MA, they are charging an additional $200 for \nmusic education, $200 for busing, and $1,800 now for all-day \nkindergarten. In Centennial, MN, schools have upwards of 30 students \nper class. Class sizes have grown significantly in the last year. In \nColton, OR, academic classes in the junior high have as many as 41 \nstudents per teacher. That's not education; that's crowd control.\n\n  I don't fault these communities. They are in a bind. Local schools \ncannot meet the high standards on a tin-cup budget.\n  I see my colleagues here. I think they would share with me the hope \nthat tonight the President of the United States will make it clear that \nhelp is on its way to those families, to those teachers, to those \nparents; that we believe the investment in those children will make a \nreal difference, in terms of our economy and in their ability to \nacquire skills. It will make a difference in terms of young people \nbeing able to make a difference for our society and for our democracy \nand for our leadership. This is something I hope, on the one hand, he \nwill explain, why we have not been able to do it and, second, that he \nwill have a change of mind and he will say--again, what I believe this \nPresident understands--what we have failed to follow through with, and \nthat is that we are going to invest in our children and our children's \neducation.\n  I thank our colleagues who are here. I see my friends from Rhode \nIsland and Connecticut. I know they want to say a word on the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to respond and echo the comments of \nSenator Kennedy. A year ago, with much hope and great fanfare, we all \nlooked at the signing of the No Child Left Behind Act as a positive \nstep forward, a recognition that we could not simply sit back and let \neducation in the United States continue on its then-current course.\n  We also hoped the great rhetoric would be matched with real \nresources. Sadly, those resources have not materialized. The President, \nonly a few weeks after signing the bill, released his budget numbers \nfor fiscal year 2003 which significantly reduced funding for the No \nChild Left Behind Act. In fact, the President's budget contained the \nsmallest increase overall for education funding in years. A small \nincrease, but nothing commensurate with the kind of expectations that \nwere generated by the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  We fear--I fear--that that same reality will be visited upon us this \nevening in the State of the Union speech, and next week when the \nPresident releases this year's budget. There will be no significant \nincrease overall in education spending.\n  The President may point to an increase in title I that he has \nadvertised, a $1 billion increase. That would raise title I funding to \n$12.3 billion. But let me remind all who are listening, that $12.3 \nbillion is about $6 billion less than the authorized figure in the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  I can remember the discussions, the debate when we were urging a \nlevel of title I funding that would be adequate to deal with the \nchallenges we have placed on all the school districts in this country, \nto be accountable and to perform at a level that is equal to the \nchallenges of this new and very demanding world we face. So the title I \nmoney is an increase, but it is insignificant compared to the target we \nestablished, agreed on, and fought for in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seeing the Senator from Connecticut here, does my friend \nfrom Rhode Island remember that we had a specific vote? I believe it \nwas a vote on a Dodd-Collins amendment, which ended up with 79 votes, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. Seventy-nine Senators voted for that \nfull funding here on the floor of the Senate. Yet we were unable to get \nthat kind of support from the administration. Republicans, Democrats \nalike here on the floor of the Senate said this is a priority for us. \nDoes the Senator remember? This is not a partisan issue. We were \njoined, were we not, by Republican colleagues?\n  Mr. REED. Indeed, you are correct, I say to the Senator. We were \njoined by practically every Member of the Senate regardless of party \nand region. They believed, as we did, in the need for real resources, \nparticularly for the title I program. What the President is proposing \nis more of a cosmetic increase in title I, rather than the kind of \nincrease we need to do the job.\n  I was listening to Senator Kennedy, my colleague from Massachusetts. \nHe laid out the current dilemma of local school districts, where they \nare cutting class days, they are charging for transportation, they are \ncharging for music education. That is in response to the current \ndistressed economy. Don't forget, school districts are now required to \ndo much more, by the Federal Government, by the No Child Left Behind\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\nAct. They are in a situation where they have to cut costs. At the same \ntime, they have to respond to more challenges, more mandates from the \nFederal Government. It is getting worse.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for another point?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see we are joined by another member of the committee, \nthe Senator from New York.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me, and I hope my colleagues would \ncomment, one of the very sad aspects of this is, not only are they \nhaving the cuts, but where there are percentage cuts--which have taken \nplace and which were initially proposed in my own State of \nMassachusetts--in the wealthier communities, they are making up the \ndifference.\n  I have several illustrations which show how communities that have \ngreater affluence are making up the difference of what they are getting \nshortchanged, but the poorer districts are once again left high and \ndry. In well-off Manhattan Beach, CA, parents and the district raised \n$1.4 million in private funding to pay for music and art staff and \nteacher aides. The average home in this district is worth $900,000. \nAlso, in a wealthy Kansas City suburb, the Belinder Elementary School \nbrought in proceeds from parent donations earlier this year to help pay \nthe salaries of a nurse, counselor, and foreign language teacher. The \nefforts raised $78,000 in two weeks to pay for positions that would \nhave been cut as the district faced a $6 million shortfall. But in poor \ncommunities, parental philanthropy is not an option--and the children \nin those communities will be left behind. In Boston, Massachusetts, \nprincipals were told to brace for a $60 million cut--and there is no \nhope for making up that money from somewhere else. According to \nBoston's Chief Operating Officer, Michael Contompasis, this means, ``. \n. . humongous layoffs. Everything is on the table.'' So, again, those \nchildren who come from particularly trying and difficult or \ndisadvantaged circumstances are paying even a higher price.\n  Mr. REED. I think that is absolutely right. I think the Senator from \nConnecticut might have a comment also, and I yield to him for a \ncomment.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank our colleagues from Massachusetts, \nNew York, and Rhode Island who are here to talk about this issue. In \njust a few short hours from now we are going to hear the President \naddress the Nation on the State of the Union. If you were to ask the \nquestion, what is the state of the union, to the average person, if the \nquestion were to be asked, I suppose, of the average family, you may \nget this sort of analysis: How secure is my family economically? \nPersonally? What does our future look like? That is not a bad question, \nwhen you ask how are you doing.\n  When it comes to the issue of education, I think the answer has to \nbe: Worried about how I see the future for my family and our children. \nI am relying on the Federal Government to be a supporter of basic needs \nin education.\n  You have to be able to listen to the rhetoric. You will hear a speech \ntonight. I presume it will be a good one. Presidents normally give \npretty good speeches on the State of the Union. But I also think, as my \ncolleagues pointed out, matching up the rhetoric, the language, with \nthe action is critically important. It is the same as we would ask of \nanyone else. It is nice to hear words about diversity of higher \neducation, nice to hear about making college more affordable, and \nleaving no child behind. But then you quickly have to ask, Now, what \nhave you done to increase the diversity of our populations in higher \neducation? What have you done or what are you doing to make higher \neducation more affordable? And what, in fact, are you doing to see to \nit that no child is left behind in our elementary and secondary public \nschool education system?\n  If you look at those three issues alone--as our colleagues already \npointed out here, but it deserves being repeated--in the area of \ndiversity, of course, we find the President attacking the affirmative \naction programs in the country.\n  My friend from Rhode Island is maybe in a unique position to talk \nabout the United States military, the United States military academies, \nand what a remarkable job they have done. He is a graduate of West \nPoint and was a distinguished officer in the United States Army for \nmany years, as a professor at West Point. Certainly our military \nacademies have demonstrated how having affirmative action perhaps has \ncontributed significantly to the strength and well-being and diversity \nof our officer corps in the United States.\n  In fact, I would argue that the affirmative action programs in our \nmilitary academies are exactly the affirmative action programs the \nPresident has attacked at the University of Michigan and elsewhere.\n  Second, I ask my colleagues from Rhode Island, New York, or \nMassachusetts, what has happened to make college more affordable? We \nhave asked that Pell grants be supported. Yet the administration has \nsaid already--maybe they will change their mind tonight; I hope they \ndo. Nothing would please me more than to have the President announce in \nthe State of the Union tonight that he is supporting the full funding \nof the Pell grant program. I hope this evening he will talk about that.\n  Third, of course, our colleagues have already spoken out about the \nLeave No Child Behind legislation, with special education, where we are \nabysmally short. The White House did not stand up last year in support \nof special education and still continues to oppose the $4.6 billion \nnecessary to meet the goals.\n  But my colleague may want to comment on the diversity issue, since he \nis a graduate of the West Point Academy and knows how important those \nprograms have been to strengthening the United States military. I ask \nhim whether or not that is the case.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, whatever is left, I believe in fact \nthat it is a model for the kind of program that recognizes talent, \neffort and initiative, but also considers that we want not just a \nstudent body at West Point, but also an officer corps in the Army that \nrepresents every segment of society. I also serve currently as Chairman \nof the Board of Visitors at West Point. We have the opportunity to \nreview the admissions process every year.\n\n  Frankly, it is a success. The admissions policy at West Point \nprovides an opportunity to broaden, diversify, and make better the \ninstitution with some very talented individuals.\n  Let me put it in perspective. I graduated in 1971. We had two \nAfrican-Americans in my class. Today, African-Americans make up 8 \npercent of the student body. Frankly, the military has a larger \nrepresentation of minorities than that 8 percent, but it represents an \nofficer corps that is both diverse and, let me emphasize, talented. \nThere is no sacrificing standards. There is no sacrificing ability. \nThere is no sacrificing patriotism or anything else. We get wonderful \npeople.\n  To me, affirmative action is not about quotas. It is about looking \nbeyond just the people who want to show up in the front ranks because \nthey have gone to good high schools, they have parents helping them \nalong, and all the other things that lead them to even apply to West \nPoint. It is about looking beyond that. It has been very successful.\n  I also suggest that it has been represented by the success of those \nyoung men and women in our military forces who are now general \nofficers. The Commandant of Cadets of West Point today is an African-\nAmerican officer, a graduate of West Point. That would have been \nexceptional 30 years ago.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I asked someone once to define \nor describe affirmative action. They said: Senator, affirmative action \nis when someone tells you they can't find somebody, try again. If they \nstill can't, try again.\n  What my colleague from Rhode Island is saying, when we talk about the \nsuccess and the wisdom of affirmative action, it has been because of \nplaces such as West Point Academy and other of our military academies, \nwhere they have tried again to identify and find qualified students and \nconsider them as enrollees to these universities where, in fact, they \nmay have looked into a lot of issues other than just the simple \ncriteria that you might apply to everyone else. As a result of that, \nthey have been able to bring people into our academies. It is not a \ndetermining factor, but a factor, in considering the admissions to \nthese academies. Is that not true?\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n  Mr. REED. That is exactly correct.\n  Frankly, the other argument that is made against affirmative action \nprograms is that they stigmatize the beneficiaries. That could not be \nfurther from the truth when it comes to the wonderful officers who have \ngraduated from West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy. They \nwalk out well qualified, well prepared, well trained. There is no \nstigma. It is with pride that they serve their country.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have several Members who want to \nspeak. Our time runs out at a quarter of the hour. I am told, because \nof the extraordinary circumstances that took place on Sunday afternoon, \nwe would yield from 18 minutes to 15 minutes of the hour to our friend \nfrom Florida to make some comments about the world champion team. But I \nask unanimous consent that the remaining time be divided between the \nSenators from New York, Maryland, and Vermont.\n  Mr. SARBANES. May I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I just want to say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, in this chart about the \nPresident breaking his promise to the Nation's children about No Child \nLeft Behind, and the budget, which fails to fund the No Child Left \nBehind legislation, that is being done in order to have a tax cut that \nwill assure that no millionaire is left behind. That is exactly what \nhas happened.\n  The President's commitment, with respect to budget priorities, is to \ngive this huge tax break on dividends so that no millionaire will be \nleft behind. Meanwhile, we are leaving behind tens of thousands of \nschoolchildren all across America.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct.\n  Madam President, the time up to 18 minutes before the hour I ask be \ndivided between the Senator from New York and the Senator from Vermont. \nI hope the Senator from New York will comment about the increase in \ntuition. At the New York state universities, I understand it has \nincreased 41 percent. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect. As is his custom, he has done his homework. He knows we are \nfacing dire circumstances in New York. I know many other places around \nthe country are as well.\n  But I want to focus, for my limited time, on what is going to happen \nin my State. News reports tell me that when the Governor addresses the \nbudget--probably tomorrow--he will be announcing drastic cuts in \neducation, totaling as much as $1.2 billion.\n  This is the first time in a decade that the New York education system \nwill face an absolute cut in its budget. This is not that we are \ndecreasing the amount of the increase; this is an absolute cut.\n  New York City, which I am sure you know, has a million children in \nthe school system--some of the best kids you will ever meet, and also \nsome of the poorest kids from some of the toughest circumstances.\n  New York City, which receives 40 percent of the State education \nfunds, stands to lose almost $500 million. How will that be dealt with? \nYou know how it is going to be dealt with. We are going to be laying \noff teachers. We are going to be putting more children into already \ncrowded classrooms. We are going to be limiting opportunities for \nadvanced placement classes, for lab classes, for the extra kinds of \ncredits in classes that particularly needy children need.\n\n  We are going to be looking at delays and actually the stopping of \nmaintenance and other repairs, so that we are going to have not only \novercrowded classrooms, overcrowded schools, with very few of the \nteachers who are needed, but we are going to be basically sending a \nmessage to our kids that: You remember that rhetoric. Remember that \nbill that was signed about Leave No Child Behind? Well, you are not in \nthat group. We don't know how we define that group anymore because we \nsure are not talking about the million kids in the New York City school \nsystem or the hundreds of thousands of kids in Buffalo and Rochester, \nand Syracuse, and Albany, and Binghampton, and Elmira, and out on Long \nIsland--kids who are going to get left behind.\n  What is the alternative to all these drastic cuts? It is to try to \nraise the local taxes to make up for both the Federal and State cuts. I \nhave to tell you, first of all, many parts of New York already do a \ntremendous job in trying to provide the best quality education for the \nchildren in their schools. I live in a community that proudly pays very \nhigh property taxes because of what we then can provide to the children \nfrom this community. But many places will not be able to do that. At a \ncertain point, the kind of disconnect between bold pronouncements about \ncutting Federal taxes--which have the impact of forcing States to make \nvery difficult decisions, which have the further impact of forcing \nlocal communities either to do without essential services or to raise \ntheir taxes--somehow that old shell game is going to get exposed; and \nso it should.\n  We were promised, when we passed Leave No Child Behind, that the \nresources would be there. That promise is being broken. Yes, it is. It \nis being broken. By breaking it, we are leaving millions and millions \nof children behind. And as the Senator from Massachusetts so well \nknows, we are leaving many children in New York behind.\n  So I hope we will try to redress this extraordinary decision and, \nsimilarly, that we will look at what is going to happen in \npostsecondary education where the Pell grant has lost its purchasing \npower, where in a State such as ours we are slashing tuition assistance \nprograms plus increasing tuition at the same time.\n  Something has to give. And what will give is that thousands of \nstudents will leave our institutions of higher learning because they \nwill not be able to afford to stay. I think that is a bad bargain for \nNew York and a bad bargain for America.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts allowing me \nto express specifically the concerns I have about my State.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, in about 2 minutes the Senator from \nFlorida will be recognized, and after that the Senator from Vermont.\n  There are just two items I want to mention and repeat. One is that in \nOregon we have now about 180 days of education. Some districts are \nthinking of going to 165 days. If all of the school districts in our \ncountry were to follow this example, that would put us as 23rd in the \nworld in terms of the amount of time children are studying in school--\nwhere we talk about being No. 1. We talk about being No. 1? We are \npenalizing our children.\n  But a second point. And the Senator spoke very eloquently about the \nincrease in tuition.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that today the indebtedness of \nstudents who come primarily from working families, who have the \nability, the academic desire to succeed and excel, are now indebting \nthemselves three times what they were just 10 years ago because of the \nescalation in tuitions? And therefore, we are saying to a whole group \nof sons and daughters of working families, that in effect, the \nopportunity for education, even though you have the ability and the \nacademic success, you will effectively be denied continuing education?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator is absolutely accurate. The problem is made \neven worse by a phenomenon that has occurred over the last several \nyears where much of the aid that the colleges themselves have provided \nhas gone away from need-based aid to so-called merit-based aid. So \nstudents who come from families such as mine are meritorious--and I am \nvery proud of that--but then they are taking those dollars, those very \nscarce collegiate scholarship dollars, they are taking them, when they \ndon't need them, and thereby depriving other students who do need them \nfrom that access. So it is both the Federal and State programs and even \nthe colleges' own programs which, combined, are leaving hundreds of \nthousands of worthy, meritorious, needy students behind.\n  We are doing it on both ends of the education spectrum. As the \nSenator so well knows, we are setting ourselves up for a very \nunfortunate set of circumstances.\n  If you ask the question: How does this country become richer, safer,\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nsmarter, and stronger?--any list of answers that has any basis in \nevidence, fact, or logic will tell you, investing in education. We know \ninvesting in education increases the lifelong earnings of college \ngraduates by $600,000. Every year of postsecondary education will \nprovide between 5 to 15 percent more in annual earnings. Yet here we \nare closing the door to college education, basically telling a lot of \nkids who depend on loans, depend on grants, depend upon increasing \nstudent debt: I am sorry; you are not in our plans for the future.\n  That is a terrible mistake for this country to make.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think we had an agreement that the Senator from \nFlorida was yielded my time so he can make an important statement about \nthe Buccaneers.\n  Mr. DODD. Who are the Buccaneers?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in the midst of these deadly \nserious subjects that we are talking about, I want to bring a little \nbit of levity and a bright spot from an extraordinary football game \nthat has now caused the world champions to have the sun especially \nshining brightly in the State of Florida and, in particular, in the \nTampa Bay region.\n  This resolution commends the Tampa Bay fans because they have been so \nfaithful over the years. This is a miracle. It is a miracle that it has \nfinally happened to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and, oh, do they deserve \nit--the most valuable player of the game, the best NFL defensive \nplayer, the best defensive record in the whole league, the quarterback \nhimself being from Florida.\n  I could go on and on. But just to cap off my statement of offering a \nlittle lightheartedness to an otherwise very serious day is to point \nout that I went to the junior Senator from California, as the junior \nSenator from Florida, to say: Is it worth it to you before the game to \nhave a little friendly wager?\n  We had a crate of Florida oranges versus a 25-pound box of California \nalmonds. I said: Why don't you throw in a little Napa Valley chardonnay \nas well.\n  I am going to be enjoying that. Our staff will be enjoying it, for \nthe sake of all of our people in Florida who have a big smile on their \nface.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the Senator from \nMassachusetts has expired. The next 20 minutes will be controlled by \nthe Senator from Vermont and the Senator from California.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1646-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT\n\n  Mr. DODD. I want to address a question to our colleague from New York \nand also my colleague from Vermont. What I am about to say is also \nsomething he has talked about in the past. We are often told we are now \nin a period of international crisis and that resources cannot really be \nallocated as much as we would like for education given these other \ndemands.\n  Certainly my colleagues are aware, historically, some of the most \nsignificant investments we have made as a nation in terms of education \nhave occurred right in the midst of some of our most significant crises \nas a country.\n  In 1787, shortly after the American Revolution, at a time when there \nwas great demand for resources, we insisted that land be set aside in \nnew territories, specifically the Federal Government did, for \ninstitutions of higher learning. Right in the middle of the Civil War, \nthere was the Morrill Act, authored by a Senator from Vermont, that \ncreated the land grant colleges. Here we were in the greatest crisis in \nthe history of the United States, and yet the Congress and the \nPresident in the midst of all of that believed we ought to be doing \neverything we could to establish land grant colleges.\n  Then, of course, prior to the end of World War II, the GI bill is \nanother example. Here is a nation at war and demand for resources are \ngreat; our Nation is in peril, although it was toward the end of the \nwar. Yet the Congress and the President thought it was so critically \nimportant that we allocated resources for furthering the advancement of \nhigher education.\n  I don't know if my colleagues would like to briefly respond to that \npoint.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would respond in support of the observations that the \nSenator from Connecticut has made. It is deeply troubling to me that in \nthe current atmosphere in which we find ourselves, the first victim \nseems to be the future.\n  We are shortchanging the future and, in particular, we are \nshortchanging our children. I don't believe any previous generation of \nAmericans, as the Senator has illustrated, has ever done this before. \nWe are about to become the first generation that deliberately, \nintentionally, will leave our children worse off than we were.\n  I find that absolutely mind-boggling. I cannot even grasp it. We talk \nabout our parents, the greatest generation, who sacrificed, who planned \nfor the future, who made big investments in education, in highways, in \nresearch and development, in infrastructure, in health care, and here \nwe are about to dismantle the work they so carefully put into place, \nstarting with education but by no means ending there.\n  It is a moment of real concern and should be talked about, not just \nin this Chamber but throughout our country. What is it exactly we \nintend to leave our children besides a more dangerous world and a pile \nof debt?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for her answer. She is absolutely \ncorrect. It would be a unique and historic tragedy if we were the first \ngeneration to not fulfill its obligations to the coming generation.\n  I said the Homestead Act. It was the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 that \nwas an example of a country in crisis that still found time to invest \nin its educational needs. I don't know if my colleague from Vermont \nwanted to comment on that as well. It was Senator Morrill from Vermont \nwho created the land grant colleges. The University of Connecticut was \none of the beneficiaries of that idea. Right in the middle of the Civil \nWar, Abraham Lincoln and the Congress said: We ought to be investing in \nthe educational needs of the Nation, and authored that legislation. I \nknow my colleague from Vermont has spoken eloquently for and fought for \nhigher education. I thought he might want to comment on those \ndecisions.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Vermont is proud of the fact that it has provided \nleadership throughout the centuries, and the Morrill Act did more for \nexpanding the ability of education for our young people to strengthen \nthis Nation than any other action that has been taken since.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing up the history, especially relative \nto my own State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1646-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1646-S1647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STATE OF THE UNION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the President prepares to address the \nNation, I hope he will remember that homeland security starts here at \nhome, and that he addresses the critical domestic priorities facing our \nNation at this time. Today, very briefly, I want to discuss a few of \nthose priorities.\n  In last year's State of the Union Address, the President highlighted \nhis and Congress's bipartisan efforts on education. He discussed how \neducation was integral to having a secure Nation with a well-educated \nand trained workforce that would grow and strengthen our economy.\n  President Bush said:\n\n       Good jobs begin with good schools, and we've made a fine \n     start.\n\n  But you cannot educate our children on the cheap, and I am afraid \nthat is what the President is asking our Nation's educational system to \ndo. Last year's Bush administration budget was the worst education \nbudget in 7 years.\n  The Bush budget fell $7 billion short of the resources promised in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, and it cut funding for the legislation's \ninitiatives by $90 million. It also proposed less than half of the \nFederal commitment to special education. This $11 billion shortfall \nnegatively affects all of our public school students and shifts \nbillions of dollars more to local property taxes.\n  At the same time, our communities are being forced to make decisions \non defraying education budget shortfalls. Some schools are having to \ncut days off of their years and time off for the students. That is a \ncrisis that should not\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\nhappen. Some school districts are considering shortening the school \nyear in order to be able to live within their budget. Some schools no \nlonger have money to hire substitute teachers for the remainder of the \nschool year.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure that every individual has the \nopportunity to receive a high-quality education, from prekindergarten \nto elementary and secondary, to special education, to technical and \nhigher education and beyond. Unfortunately, any gains that have been \nmade in education achievement are currently in jeopardy due to the lack \nof funds at the local, State, and Federal levels.\n  There is nothing more important to our Nation's future, to our \nhomeland security, and to our economy than ensuring we have a top-notch \neducational system that is the envy of the world.\n  I call on the Bush administration to make education funding and our \nchildren's future a higher national priority.\n\n\n                            The Environment\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to briefly discuss the Bush \nadministration's record on environmental issues.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I am sorry to report that the Bush administration continues \nto move us backward instead of forward in our efforts to protect our \nenvironment.\n  Weekly, usually on Friday afternoons, when the press is all asleep, \nor whatever, the Bush administration stages the below-radar attacks on \npublic health and the environment. The administration ignores the \nabundant proof of imminent and long-term threats from pollution that \nendanger our lives and our ecosystems.\n  Today and every day since the administration took office, \napproximately 82 people will have died prematurely due to sickness and \nlung disease caused by fine particulate matter from powerplant \npollution, which could and should be prevented.\n  Today and every day since the administration took office, up to 160 \nacres of vital wetlands have been converted for development or paved \nover. Instead of trying to slow the rate of wetlands destruction, the \nadministration is seeking to ease existing wetlands protection.\n  Today and every day since the administration took office, the Nation \nadds around 16 million tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, each \nyear contributing 25 percent of the world's total carbon. This raises \nthe risk and threat of global warming.\n  Shortly after being sworn in, the President reversed his commitment \nto control greenhouse gases and has not looked back once. I am afraid \nthe Bush administration's environmental policies have been more focused \non protecting the special interests than protecting the air and water \nand land that we all share.\n  In closing, on the issues of education funding and the environment, I \nam afraid our Nation has taken two steps back rather than one step \nforward. I can only hope that for the good of this Nation we can come \ntogether and once again move this Nation in the right direction.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have 10 minutes of their 20 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, Senator Reid asked if I could extend \nthis time until 3:30. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in my capacity as a Senator from \nAlaska, objects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1647-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1647-S1649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONCERNS OF CALIFORNIANS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Madam President, I was here earlier to discuss \nthe State of the Union as I saw it in California, and I reported that \nmy constituents--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, young, and old--\nare very anxious about where we are. They are anxious when they see \nthat we had a surplus that, in 2 short years, has turned into a raging \ndeficit. They are anxious that we are on the brink of war without a lot \nof our allies coming along. They are anxious about their pension plans. \nMany are having to work longer and harder because of what happened with \nthe stock market losing trillions of dollars in value. They are anxious \nabout seeing a Nation that has lost its way on foreign policy and \ndomestic policy. They have asked me to address some of these issues in \nevery way that I can.\n  This afternoon, I am here to address the issue of the environment. I \nam very proud that Senator Jeffords is here on the floor, because he is \nfighting very hard for clean air. He has introduced legislation--the \nClean Power Act--to take on the challenges we face with 2 billion tons \nof carbon dioxide, which causes global warming; 45 million tons of \nmercury, which poisons fish and endangers the health of children and \npregnant women; 6 million tons of nitrogen oxide, which creates smog \nand causes asthma; and 13 million tons of sulfur dioxide, which causes \nacid rain, premature death, and lung disease. He has authored a very \ngood bill to cure this problem.\n  The administration is not supporting his bill. They have written \ntheir own bill called ``Clear Skies.'' Many I know are calling it \n``dirty skies.'' If we would just leave the Clean Air Act intact, as it \nis, we would clean up the air far faster than this administration \nrollback. That is just one more example of a series of rollbacks that \nwe are seeing done by this administration.\n  Frankly, the people of California, from both political parties, who \ncherish their environment, love to see the ocean, the forests, the \nlakes, and the rivers, and they cherish clean air. We have made so much \nprogress and we want the Clean Water Act to stand intact. They are \nanxious, they are concerned, and they are puzzled as to why this \nadministration is turning its back on Presidents--Republicans and \nDemocrats, starting with Teddy Roosevelt who made the environment a \nnonpartisan issue, and President Eisenhower who said the Alaskan \nWildlife Refuge should be left intact, and President Nixon who created \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, and President Clinton who did so \nmany far-reaching things on the environment, protecting acres of land \nof roadless, beautiful areas, and used his executive pen to make sure \nthat beautiful areas of our country are off limits to special interests \nbecause we believe when we got this land from God that it is our \nresponsibility to preserve it and leave it in better condition than we \nfound it.\n\n  We take this very seriously in California. This is not a partisan \nissue. I have people who voted for President Bush coming up to me and \ntugging at my sleeve: What is the matter with this administration?\n  Every Friday, late at night, when the press operations have shut \ndown, they are making yet another rollback. The people in my State want \nme to fight against it, and I intend to do so.\n  Let's talk about this attack in specifics. One in every four \nAmericans lives within 4 miles of a Superfund site. This chart has \nlittle dots that represent Superfund sites. Seventy million Americans \nlive within 4 miles of a Superfund site. Ten million of those are \nchildren who are at risk of cancer and other health problems.\n  My State happens to have the second highest number of sites after New \nJersey, but as we can see, there are sites in almost every State in the \nUnion. These Superfund sites are dangerous. They include chemicals such \nas arsenic, benzene, DDT, and brain-damaging toxins like lead and \nmercury.\n  In 1980, Congress enacted the Superfund law. During the last 4 years \nof the Clinton administration, an average of 87 final cleanups occurred \neach year. Let's look at what is happening under George Bush. Half of \nthose sites are being cleaned up. Worse than that, who is now paying? \nUnder Bill Clinton and under Republican Presidents before him, \nincluding George Bush's father, we taxed the polluters. The polluters \npaid to clean up their mess.\n  When I was growing up, my mother always said: Clean up your mess. She \ndid not want to hear me say: It is somebody else's responsibility, mom. \nIt is not mine.\n  Wrong. If you make a mess, you clean it up. Simple. That goes for \npolluters. That is why we set up the Superfund. The polluter pays was \nthe rule of the day.\n  Now what is happening? This President does not support the Superfund \nfee on the biggest polluters. We see where the taxpayers used to pay \nonly\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n18 percent of the cleanup costs, in this year are going to pay 50 to 54 \npercent of the cleanup costs. After this year, there will be almost \nnothing left in the Superfund, and this will be 100-percent paid for by \ntaxpayers at a time when this President is depleting the money we \nalready have by giving tax cuts to the people who earn over a million \ndollars a year, who do not need it.\n  So what is wrong with this picture? This President refuses to stand \nbehind a bipartisan effort to reinstate the Superfund fee. I have \nintroduced the bill with Senator Chafee, a Republican. This President \nwill not support that and instead supports using general taxpayer funds \nto clean up Superfund sites.\n  Polluter pays is a principle that has worked. It has been supported \nby people of both parties and Presidents of both parties. It seems to \nme our people are in danger, and this administration is walking away \nfrom the Superfund.\n  I want to talk a little bit about clean water because this is very \nimportant. The Bush administration is working to remove Federal \nprotection from many waters, including many creeks, streams, small \nponds, and wetlands. These bodies of water have long been protected by \nthe Clean Water Act. There was a rule published late in the day, and \nthe effect of the rule is that 20 to 30 percent of our bodies of water \ncould be exempted from the Clean Water Act. Why on earth would anyone \nwant to do that when we see the results of the Federal Government's now \nsaying that 20 to 30 percent of our water bodies no longer are covered \nby the Clean Water Act will be more polluted waterways? We already know \nthe Nation's waters are getting dirtier, and almost half of our lakes, \nstreams, rivers, and coastal estuaries are not safe for fishing, for \nswimming, or for boating.\n  How many people have taken their children on a vacation only to go \ndown to a lake, go down to an ocean and find the sign, ``Polluted. You \nmay not enter this body of water''?\n  We will kill off the remaining populations of 43 percent of \nendangered or threatened species that rely on wetlands for survival. We \nwill deplete drinking water sources.\n  Mr. President, I ask about the time. My understanding from Senator \nHarry Reid was we had time until 3:15. He asked me if I could then \nextend that to 3:30. No one is on the floor from the other side. \nBecause there is no one on the other side, I ask unanimous consent--and \nI think if I do not get that unanimous consent, it says to me that \npeople on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, are not \ninterested in allowing free speech to move forward. There is no one in \nthe Chamber. I am happy to cease and desist when the next speaker \ncomes. I ask unanimous consent that until another speaker comes that I \nbe able to complete my remarks on the war on the environment that is \ngoing on each and every day, that is hurting our air, hurting our \nwater, hurting our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). I have been advised by the \nleadership of the majority that they do intend to use their time, and \nso in my capacity as a Senator from Idaho, I object to the request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I once more ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak \nuntil the next speaker comes to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous rules, the Senator from \nCalifornia's time has expired. However, her side has until 3:15. She \nmay ask unanimous consent to use that time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is what I have been doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has until the hour of 3:15 or until a Senator from her side \nwants to claim that time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have been asked to take that time. That is what I was \ntrying to convey to my friend. I ask for an additional 2 minutes \nbecause it took 2 minutes for the Chair to figure out that I actually \ncould take Harry Reid's time. Would that be all right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am very feisty today because I see an attack on our \nenvironment. I want to make the case, and I am going to try to do it in \nthe remaining 7, 8, or 9 minutes I have.\n  If we move away from the Clean Water Act, what we will see is more \npolluted waters, more waterborne illness, higher drinking water \nfiltration costs, more flooding, fish kills, and impaired sports \nfishing--that is why we have so many sports fishermen with us--fewer \nwaterfowl and less recreational hunting. That is why we have so many \nrecreational hunters with us as we try to resist this move to remove \nbodies of water from the Clean Water Act.\n  We will see reduced tourism, less spending on bird watching, \necotourism, and wildlife photography. I know my colleague understands \nthe importance of tourism to our States. People come to see the \nbeautiful wildlife, have a hunting or fishing trip, to take \nphotographs, to show their children what wildlife really is. It is a \nhard time for those of us who believe so much that protecting the \nenvironment is a bipartisan issue.\n  I want to talk about something that is very near and dear to my heart \nbecause when I came to the House of Representatives in the 1980s, we \nlearned that 100,000 dolphin were being killed every year because of \ndestructive fishing practices, including Purse-Seining on dolphin. Many \npeople now know what that is because Greenpeace called it to the \nworld's attention. When tuna swim, they swim underneath the dolphin, \nand so unless one is really careful, they are going to throw their nets \nover the dolphin, and the dolphin are going to be killed or harmed. \nThis practice was occurring in the 1980s. One hundred thousand dolphin \nwere being killed each and every year because of dolphin deadly methods \nof fishing.\n  I have to say the young people of America turned the tide because \nkids would say to their parents: This is wrong to do to the dolphin, \nand if it means we are not going to take a tuna sandwich in our lunch, \nfine. We will boycott tuna until the tuna fishermen catch the tuna in a \nway that does not harm the dolphin.\n  Happily, the Congress passed the law I wrote. All the law said was we \nshould create a label called a ``dolphin safe'' label, and if the tuna \nin that can was caught in a way that did not harm the dolphin, the \nmanufacturer could, in fact, put that on the can.\n  What happened as a result of that legislation? By the way, it costs \nno money at all. It was just letting the consumer know the truth. The \ndolphin kill went down to 2,000 a year from 100,000 a year. That was \nbecause of the ``dolphin safe'' label of 1990.\n  The label was not that well respected. In about 1997, there were \nmoves to weaken it. Basically, we held firm. Now the Commerce \nDepartment under George Bush has decided, forget all that, you can use \nthe ``dolphin safe'' label even if you go back to purse seining on \ndolphin--as long as no one saw any dolphin die.\n  Scientific studies say that just does not work. When you harass the \ndolphin and you use the helicopters and you chase the dolphin and you \ntorment the dolphin, we know what happens. They are not reproducing and \nthey are not healthy. Yet this Bush administration wants to change the \nlabel. Now, fortunately, groups have gone to court and gotten the \nadministration to guarantee that it will not change the meaning of \n``dolphin safe'' until the court has examined this issue. For the \nmoment, the ``dolphin safe'' label stands.\n  I put the administration on notice: If they persist in this, we will \nstart another boycott. Americans do not agree with the administration \nputting free trade ahead of the dolphin. I can state that 75 percent of \nAmericans want to make sure that label means something.\n  I have been in public life having first been elected in the 1970s, \nand I have always been a fighter for a clean and healthy environment. \nIn all the years I have been in office, I have never seen such an \nattack on the environment. I have a list of every single attack on the \nenvironment this administration has made. It is published. We did it in \nchart form. We have four charts. Each shows repeals or rollbacks of an \nenvironmental law or regulation. It can be found on the NRDC Web site. \nIf I were to have it on a piece of paper, it would roll out 32 feet.\n  Two hundred rules and regulations have been rolled back by this \nadministration against the will of the American people, many of them on \nFriday afternoon. I am here to say on behalf of\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nmany on this side of the aisle--and some on the other--we believe \nprotecting the environment is an American value.\n  It is not a Democratic value or a Republican value, it is an American \nvalue. We cherish our God-given environment. We cherish our forests, \nour streams, our lakes, our oceans. We believe it is important we keep \nthe air clean, the water clean.\n  We will continue to come to the floor and make the case that this is \nthe most anti-environmental administration in recent history. It is \namazing when we compare contributions of a Republican President, Teddy \nRoosevelt, a Republican President, Richard Nixon, a Republican \nPresident, George Bush 1--who, by the way, said we should test poor \nchildren for lead in their blood. That is important to find out if they \nare sick or healthy. If they have lead in their blood, we should take \naction. This President tried to repeal that rule until we called him on \nit and pointed out it costs $13 a child and he stopped it. He tried to \nsay we should not try to take arsenic out of water. We called him on \nit.\n  Mr. President, the state of the Union is anxious--anxious about the \neconomy, it is anxious about jobs. It is anxious about a number of \nthings: The possibility of war; it is anxious about a foreign policy \nthat is in totally different directions where one country has \ninspections going on and we don't trust the leader of that country, we \nare ready to go against him, and another country has nuclear weapons \nand we are going to resolve that diplomatically. The country is \nanxious. They are anxious about the state of their environment. They do \nnot want to have another Friday come and find out their rules for clean \nair, clean water, beautiful forests, are under attack.\n  I am here to say to the President: I know you are doing the last-\nminute rewriting of your speech. Think about what we are saying today. \nDemocrats have come here in good faith to point out their differences. \nReach out to us. Have a plan for the economy that is going to work. Say \nyou will follow in the bipartisan traditions of environmental \nprotection. Work with us on a foreign policy that is consistent and \ndoes not wait until a crisis hits but actually is proactive. Work with \nus on prescription drugs. Work with us so that people can get health \ninsurance. We are ready, we are willing, and able to work with you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my understanding we now have 1 \nhour from this minute under our control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1649-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1649-S1651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE PRESIDENTIAL BURDEN\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the President of the United States has \nan awesome responsibility. I don't think anyone in America would say \nthat he does not realize what his responsibility is and that he is not \nworking as hard as any person could to try to do the right thing for \nour country, in both our domestic agenda, our homeland security, and, \nof course, our national defense.\n  He has a heavy burden. He must do something that stimulates the \neconomy, that puts people back to work, and at the same time he must \nspend everything that is necessary to secure the people in our country \nwho live here and to make sure that our young men and women who are \nfighting the war on terrorism, who are fighting for our freedom and our \ncountry, wherever they may be in the world, have everything they need \nto do the job we are asking them to do.\n  I have been listening to a lot of the comments that have been made on \nthe floor today. I would like to take each of the areas that have been \nmentioned and try to talk about what the President's agenda is and why \nhe is trying so hard to beef up our economy, at the same time fighting \na very long and, frankly, iconoclastic war on terrorism.\n  This is a new kind of enemy. It is not the kind of enemy that is one \ncountry or two countries. It is no particular country. It is not the \nkind of enemy we always have had one which wanted to kill or harm us \nbut didn't want to hurt themselves. No, this is an enemy that is \nwilling to blow itself up in order to harm Americans. It is even an \nenemy that would tell their children, teach their children, educate \ntheir children, that suicide, in order to harm Americans and freedom-\nloving people, is a good thing.\n  This is a difficult kind of war. Our President knows we are fighting \non every front, that we are trying to find the enemy, no matter where \nthey are. If they are in the caves in Afghanistan or if they are in \nIraq or if they are in North Korea or if they are in our own country, \nthe President is doing everything he can to execute this war and to \ntell the people of the United States we must stand together. We must \nstand together and keep the spirit of our country if we are going to \nhave the patience and the resolve to beat this new kind of enemy.\n\n  That is what our President is trying to do. He doesn't want to make \nwar. He doesn't want to make war on Iraq or anyone else. But he also \nknows that if we are going to keep another 9/11 from happening--God \nforbid a 9/11 with a nuclear weapon or biological or chemical weapon--\nif he is going to prevent that from happening in our country, he is \ngoing to have to have the full support of the American people. That is \nexactly what he is trying to get, by talking about the problems in \nIraq, talking about what Saddam Hussein is doing.\n  The people who have seen Saddam Hussein, who have seen the treachery \nof this despot, know he is someone we must not have in control of a \ncountry and with the potential of having a weapon of mass destruction.\n  I know the President tonight is going to talk about the war on \nterrorism and all the things he is doing and all the young men and \nwomen who are on their way to the Middle East to make sure we are \nnegotiating from a position of strength. But I know this President's \nvery last resort is war. It is not the 1st resort, nor the 2nd resort, \nnor the 3rd resort, nor the 100th resort. But he knows that unless \nSaddam Hussein knows we mean business--we will do what we say we are \ngoing to do--we are going to lose this war on terrorism. That is the \nleadership the President of the United States is showing.\n  The President, in addition to the burden of having to prosecute a \nwar, also has the burden of having to make sure our domestic economy \nstays strong, because it will be very difficult to prosecute a war if \nour domestic economy continues to erode.\n  We passed a tax cut 2 years ago under the leadership of President \nBush and with strong support from Congress. That tax cut has helped a \nlot of people. I believe that tax cut kept us from going into a deeper \nrecession. Now the President is trying to stimulate the economy, and \nthe President is looking at history, and what has happened when we have \nhad tax cuts in history has been phenomenal.\n  In 1964, President Kennedy led the fight for tax cuts. In 1965--1 \nyear later--the gross domestic product rose 8 percent. Over the next 5 \nyears, it rose 48 percent. Unemployment fell from 5.2 percent in 1965 \nto 3.5 percent in 1969. Five years later, revenues had risen for the \nU.S. Government by 66 percent. There was a $5.9 billion deficit in 1965 \nbut a $3.2 billion surplus in 1969. That was the effect of the tax cuts \nof 1964.\n  After the Reagan tax cut of 1981, the gross domestic product rose 4 \npercent the next year, 1982; 42 percent over the next 5 years; \nunemployment fell from 7.6 percent to 7 percent in 1986. Five years \nlater, revenues had risen by 28 percent.\n  So it has been proven that tax cuts will give the economy the boost \nit needs.\n  We have seen a situation in America where corporations have been \ndissuaded, because of double taxation of dividends, from giving \ndividends. So people who are saving and investing in order to have \nretirement security have been getting fewer and fewer dividends because \ncompanies get nothing for paying the dividend. They have to pay taxes \non the money first before they would issue a dividend. It is cheaper to \ngo into debt. So we have seen debt financing rise, and dividends that \ngo to shareholders that can help secure retirement have been going \ndown.\n  Today in America, 50 percent of the people own stock and 50 percent \nof the people who get dividends are our senior citizens. These are \npeople who have tried to provide for their retirement security, not \nlooking to their Government but looking to themselves. That is what we \nwant to encourage. That is\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nwhy the President is trying to eliminate the dividends' taxes.\n  So we are trying very hard to stimulate the economy.\n  How are we doing it? We are doing it, of course, by trying to \neliminate the double taxation of dividends, trying to encourage \ncorporations to give dividends and help people who want to have that \nincome to live on, who need that income. But we are also doing \nsomething else. We are trying to lessen the burden of the marriage \npenalty. Why would we have a marriage penalty in our country? We don't \nneed to tax marriage, but that is what we do. And the President is \ntrying to eliminate that. I have introduced the bill in the Senate to \neliminate the marriage tax penalty.\n  We are also trying to bring down the tax rate for every bracket--yes, \nevery bracket. Mr. President, 35 percent of the small businesses in our \ncountry will get relief if we lower the upper bracket. Everyone will \nget relief under the President's plan--everyone who pays taxes will get \nrelief, and especially the small businesspeople in our country who \ndesperately need this tax relief and are trying very hard to make ends \nmeet in these tough times. We want to help them.\n  I think the President is doing a great job. I am very proud that he \nis trying to stimulate the economy. He is very concerned about people \nwho have lost their jobs, people who are worried about their retirement \nsecurity, and he is trying to do something about it. At the same time, \nhe is taking on a massive war on terrorism, to make sure that freedom \nreigns in the world, to make sure that our way of life--democracy, \nfreedom, free enterprise, self-reliance--lasts in the world--not a way \nof life that says that suicide is a good thing if you can kill other \npeople at the same time, not a way of life that says people will never \nhave a chance to have a role in their own government. There will be no \nself-government in a world of terrorism. We cannot allow that kind of \npower to take over the world. That is what the President is trying to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment our distinguished Senator from \nTexas for the excellent remarks she has made about really what is going \non right now and what the President is trying to do.\n  I, for one, want to help the President. I want to help him to help \nthis economy. So I rise today in support of President Bush's growth and \njobs plan, and I would like to take a few minutes today to tell you why \nI believe this is the right prescription for America at this time.\n  I know from talking to people in my own home State of Utah, and \nacross the country, that our current economy is not meeting its full \npotential. This is crystal clear. The nationwide unemployment rate \nstands at 6 percent. And while that is better than usual after a \nrecession, it is still far too high. Thousands of people in Utah and \nmillions of people across the country are out there looking for work. \nYes, most of them are finding jobs eventually, but jobs are far too \nscarce still. As long as there are people who want to work but cannot \nget work, we have a problem in our country.\n  The President's plan starts off by speeding up the tax reductions \nthis body has already passed by a significant margin. This is just \nplain common sense. A big part of the tax cut we passed in 2001 was \ndesigned to be phased in over the following 10 years, with rate cuts, \nmarriage penalty relief, and child tax credits increasing every few \nyears. But since our economy is below its potential right now, then \nright now is the time to make the full amount of these tax cuts \neffective. Doing so would put money in people's pockets immediately. \nThe IRS would change their withholding tables immediately after the \naccelerated tax cuts become law, so more money would show up \nimmediately in workers' paychecks.\n  The President's plan to speed up the tax cuts now, right when we need \nthem, will have an immediate, visible impact on practically every \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  A key part of the President's plan is to accelerate marriage penalty \nrelief and speed up the $1,000-per-child tax credit. Phasing in these \nfamily-friendly tax provisions slowly might have made some political \nsense 2 years ago, but today, when young families are wondering whether \nMom and Dad will have a job next week, cutting the tax man's share of \nthe pie will be a big help.\n  Waiting 3 to 5 years for family tax relief makes no sense in the \nmiddle of a slow economic recovery. Let's do it now. Let's provide a \ntremendous boost to millions of American families.\n  As to some of the media reports that the President's plan unfairly \nbenefits the wealthiest people in the country and does little or \nnothing for low- or middle-income taxpayers, let me set the record \nstraight.\n  According to the Treasury Department, a married couple with two \nchildren and an annual income of $40,000 would see their taxes decline, \nunder the President's plan, by $1,133--from $1,178 to $45--in 2003.\n  In other words, under today's taxes, they would pay $1,178. That \nwould be reduced $1,133 to where they have a tax bill of $45. That is \nfor people who make $40,000 a year. For this family, there is not much \nmore tax relief that can be given.\n  Under the Bush plan, 92 million taxpayers would receive, on average, \na tax cut of $1,083 in the year 2003 and thereafter. Forty-six million \nmarried couples would receive an average tax cut of $1,716. Thirty-four \nmillion families with children would benefit from an average tax \nbenefit of $1,473. Six million single women with children would receive \nan average tax cut of $1,384. Twenty-three million small business \nowners would receive tax cuts averaging $2,042. Talk about helping \nthe middle class.\n\n  In my home State of Utah, over 646,000 taxpayers would get tax relief \nfrom the President's package. That is important to me. That is \nimportant to almost 650,000 people in the State of Utah.\n  Under our ultra-progressive income tax, the top 50 percent of income \nearners--those who made $27,682 in the year 2000 or more--that upper 50 \npercent, from $27,000 and up, paid over 96 percent of all the income \ntaxes paid in this Nation.\n  Therefore, those who are paying most of the income taxes are \nnaturally going to get much of the benefit of a tax cut. In fact, it is \nalmost impossible to cut any tax without making the people who pay that \ntax better off.\n  Projections prepared by the Treasury Department show that 40 percent \nof the President's proposed tax cut would go to people with income over \n$200,000 per year. But it is important to note that this same group is \npaying 44.8 percent--almost 45 percent--of the total income tax.\n  If we enact the President's plan, people making over $200,000 a year \nwill end up paying even a larger fraction of the Nation's income tax \nbill, 45.4 percent. On the other hand, people making less than $50,000 \nwould pay less of the total share than they do now.\n  Further, the President's plan contains an important provision to \nincrease the incentive for small business investment. I might have made \nthis provision even stronger than the President chose to make it. But \neven as it stands, the increase to $75,000 per year of business \nexpensing will be a boon to companies struggling to grow. It will \nincrease the demand for business equipment and software, sectors that \nhave been hit especially hard in this downturn. This proposal can help \nto revive business spending and create new jobs in industries that make \nmachines, computers, and software.\n  I would like to debunk one particular false notion that is making the \nrounds here on Capitol Hill and in the media; the idea that lower \nincome people spend all of their tax cut but the middle and higher \nincome people will just save them.\n  It turns out that how much you earn does not have a night-and-day \nimpact on the people's decision to spend. A recent study by the \nnonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research concluded--and I \nquote--\n\n       Low-income households are not more likely to spend the \n     rebate.\n\n  In fact, as this chart shows, it looks as though families with lower \nincomes actually tended to spend a smaller fraction of their rebate.\n  I will just point to this chart now. The modest income earners spent \nlittle of their rebates. Americans who earned\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nup to $50,000 per year spent less than 20 percent of their 2001 tax \nrebate. But Americans who earned more than $50,000 a year spent over 25 \npercent of their rebate checks.\n  It would appear to me rebates are not the way to go if we want to \nstimulate the economy. Yet that is what our colleagues on the other \nside seem to think is the gold standard to help get the economy going.\n  I would now like to address the part of the President's package that \nhas drawn the most attention, the plan to end the double taxation of \ndividends. Ending the double taxation of dividends will make stocks \nmore valuable, it will make businesses more financially sound, and it \nwill make it harder for a few wrongdoers to hide their corporate \nshenanigans.\n  Why do America's corporations load up on debt financing despite the \nfact that the higher debt levels increase the risk of bankruptcy? I \nwill tell you why. Because our Nation's tax laws have always given them \nmassive financial incentives to do just exactly that.\n\n  The reason is simple. When a corporation pays interest to \nbondholders, that payment is taxed only once. That is at the bondholder \nlevel. But, in contrast, when it pays dividends to stockholders, that \npayment is taxed twice--to both the corporation and the shareholder.\n  President Bush's economic growth plan contains a proposal to end this \nabsurd incentive and, by doing so, his plan will strengthen the \nfoundations of our economy and help ensure growth and new jobs for \nyears to come.\n  This chart--``How the Double Taxation of Dividends Harms Our \nNation''--shows that bankruptcies go up, corporate accountability goes \ndown, and investment in capital formation also goes down. And that is \nwhere jobs are thrown to the wind.\n  Our Tax Code's harsh and unfair treatment of dividend payments harms \nthe foundation of our economy in those three ways. It increases the \nnumber of bankruptcies, it weakens corporate accountability, and it \nslows the formation of capital.\n  By loading up on tax-deductible bonds and bank loans rather than \nissuing new shares of stock, corporations increase their chance of \ngoing bankrupt.\n  Our Tax Code should not encourage this behavior. When corporations \nload up on debt, they commit too much of their cash flow to making \ninterest payments, and the danger of bankruptcy becomes all too real. \nOnce we change this policy, businesses will find they have people lined \nup out the door to buy stocks that pay dividends. When companies hear \nof the clamor for dividend-paying stocks, they will have a much \nstronger incentive to pay for new projects and new factories by issuing \nnew shares of stock rather than running to the bank or the bond market \nfor a loan.\n  And then, if times get tough, businesses will not be as likely to \ndeclare bankruptcy and head to Federal court for a painful \nreorganization, as we are seeing today. Instead, many companies will be \nable to cut their dividend to shareholders, and continue business more \nor less as usual.\n  This is not speculation on my part. Just open up any textbook on \ncorporate finance--books that are on the shelves of many an MBA--and \nyou will see it yourself in black and white: Business managers are \ntaught to weigh the benefits of tax-favored debt finance against the \nincreased risk of bankruptcy. They even have a name for it. They call \nit the Trade-off Theory of Capital Structure. And it is caused by the \ndouble taxation of dividends.\n  Our Tax Code's inequitable treatment of equity also weakens corporate \naccountability. Dividend payments are cash-on-the-barrelhead evidence \nthat a company is profitable.\n  While not a perfect measure by any means, it can be an important \nsignal that a firm is solvent. As they say on Wall Street, ``Profit is \nan opinion, but cash is a fact.''\n  The Wall Street Journal reported recently that only about 30 percent \nof S 500 corporations pay any dividends at all. A crucial reason for \nthis dividend drought is our Tax Code, which requires corporations to \npay 35 cents in taxes for every dollar in profit and then, on top of \nthat, requires taxpayers who get those profits in the form of dividends \nto pay personal income tax. The total government take, when state taxes \nare added, can exceed 70 percent. So what is the incentive to pay \ndividends--something we ought to be encouraging, rather than \ndestroying.\n  Finally, our inequitable treatment of equity slows innovation and the \nformation of capital. The double taxation of dividend income cuts the \nflow of equity funding to all but the most promising investments. Good \nideas go unexplored and promising investments go unfunded because they \ncannot guarantee enough after-tax profit to investors.\n  I believe it is important for Congress to eliminate the double \ntaxation of dividends. It is important for our country and the \nstability of our business community. That is why I support President \nBush's plan. By making shares a more attractive investment, his plan \nwill boost demand for stocks and push up their value. By reducing the \nlong-run risk of bankruptcy and encouraging companies to take on \npromising projects, it will be good for employees. And most \nimportantly, ending the double taxation of dividends will make American \ncorporations stronger, much more accountable, than they are today and \nmore innovative in the years to come.\n  I am proud to be able to support the President's growth and jobs \npackage, and I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee, both Democrats and Republicans, to pass out a bill \nthat give tax cuts to America's families, that gives small businesses \nan opportunity to grow, and that end the double taxation of dividends \nto strengthen both our stock market and the financial foundations of \nAmerican business. This is an economic agenda that addresses the needs \nof today as well as the challenges of the future. The American people \ndeserve no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are in morning business, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 32 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1651-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1651-S1654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the \nconversation that has gone on. Obviously, much of it has been pointed \ntoward this evening's speech that we all look forward to from the \nPresident, the State of the Union, at which time he will outline at \nleast some of his plans for the direction this country will take.\n  I am looking forward to it. The President has committed himself to \ngoing in certain directions. All of us understand that. All of us are \nin favor of the things the President wants to do. I suppose we have \ndifferent views of how that might be done. That is the way it ought to \nbe.\n  I do hope we don't spend all of our time simply criticizing; that we \nnot use this as a sort of political fulcrum, but we really talk about \nthe issues. No one could disagree with the notion that we are looking \nfor ways to grow the economy and create jobs. Who can argue with that? \nNo one. How you do it, yes, I suppose there are different views.\n  To strengthen and improve health care, certainly that is one of the \nissues all of us are faced with, whether it be Medicare, Medicaid, the \nCHIP program, or just general health care. We are all very much \ninterested in it.\n  In my State of Wyoming, a rural State, we have a little different \nproblem, but interestingly enough, we have problems the same as they do \nin Chicago or New York City. The cost, for instance, of liability \ninsurance is higher in our State than it is some others, which is kind \nof strange. Nevertheless, we would all agree with the fact that we need \nto do something about that.\n  Obviously, the defense of our country against terrorism, the defense \nof our country against challenges overseas and security at home, no one \ndisagrees. Again, we have different ways of doing it.\n\n  I would like to deviate from the issue for a moment to talk a little \nbit about--I guess, philosophically or in a broader sense--the notion \nof dealing\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nwith these issues in terms of a longer term view. We have held in my \nState of Wyoming over the last couple years several meetings; in fact, \nabout 26 meetings in 23 counties. We call them Vision 20/20. We met \nwith the people in the community, all of whom would come--some invited \nfor special reasons--to talk about what they wanted their community and \ntheir family and their business to be in 20 years or 10 years or 15 \nyears, how they envisioned the way things should be. Of course, as you \nmight imagine, we found out there are different views from different \npeople, but pretty much some of the same consistency in terms of \nwanting better jobs, better security, having health care, having \nfreedom.\n  We find ourselves in this body, as in many bodies, as a matter of \nfact, dealing almost exclusively with those issues that are right now \nupon us, fixing what is going to happen tomorrow.\n  Of course, that is necessary. But it seems to me we would help \nourselves a great deal and help our country a great deal if we could \nlook a little further out into the future and say: What do we want this \nGovernment to look like in 15 years, what kind of a system would we \nthink would be best for health care in 15 or 20 years, and then begin \nto get some kind of a general conception of where we want to be and \nwhere we think it is best to be for our country and for the people who \nlive here. And then as we move through the daily issues and as we move \ntoward the issues that we have to resolve, we can measure those against \nwhere we want to be and see if in fact they are contributing to the \nattainment of the goals we have set.\n  One of them certainly is the role of Government. We haven't talked \nabout this as much lately as we used to. What is the role of the \nFederal Government? How much Federal Government do we want in our lives \nover a period of time? This, after all, is the United States of \nAmerica. This is a federation of States. Most of us would agree that \nthe Government that rules best is the one closest to the people. \nObviously, there are roles for the national organization, there are \nroles for the Federal Government. But there are also limits that ought \nto be there, if we don't want the Federal Government to be the end-all \nof governmental activity.\n  What do we see there? How do we want to do that? Most people would \nbelieve there are some constitutional limits to the role of the Federal \nGovernment. We seem to have dismissed those to a large extent and find \nGovernment involved in nearly every aspect of our life.\n  That becomes kind of a political thing that we talk about. We talked \nabout that last week--what can we do this week for somebody? We ended \nup with the other side of the aisle, in that week we spent trying to \ncatch up with the appropriations, having proposals of $500 billion \nworth of spending that would grow Government over 10 years, at the same \ntime complaining about a deficit. So we didn't have a good concept of \nwhere we wanted to go and measure against balancing spending and \nbalancing the budget. Of course, we want to deviate from that from time \nto time, and the circumstances now require that we do something \nunusual, I am sure, about defense and terrorism and about the economy.\n  So we are obviously going to spend more money now than we would \nnormally spend because it is not a normal situation. We hear all the \ntime ``back in 1998 we didn't have a lot of the problems that we have \nnow.'' We have to deal with them. Overall, what do we want? We want a \nbalanced budget. I think we want to be able to hold down spending, not \nincrease it, which is what we hear about, frankly, all the time.\n  We need to take a look at terminating activities that are out of \ndate. It seems when we get something going in the Federal Government, \nit is there forever. In the private sector, when you have a company or \nan operation of your own and you find something is not contributing to \nthat, you have to change it. Not so in the Government. But that ought \nto be one of the directions we want to take.\n  Certainly, we ought to be able to do health care. What do we want \nover time with health care? We have already indicated pretty clearly \nover the past number of years, when it was tried in the last \nadministration to have a Government-run program, we didn't accept that \nand most of us do not now. Obviously, some work needs to be done to \nhelp people who need help. But where do we want to be? Do we want this \nhealth care to be primarily in the private sector? I think so. Most \npeople do. So these are things we need to talk about and think about \nand have a good deal of attention paid to. What is the role of the \nFederal Government on these issues?\n  I noticed the other day a quotation from President Clinton that \nGovernment's responsibility is to create more opportunities, and the \npeople's responsibility is to make the most of it. I agree with that. I \ndon't think his policies were in line with that, but I agree with that \nstatement. So what we are talking about here primarily tonight--and I \nam sure for several months--is about strengthening America's economy. \nThe President's economic agenda has two main goals: To encourage \nconsumer spending that will boost economic recovery, and promote \ninvestment by individuals and businesses that will lead to the economic \ngrowth and job creation. Those are two different points of view, and I \nrespect that. Their point of view is to distribute money to everybody. \nOver here, it is to create incentive to create jobs so you have a long-\nterm, positive impact. We need to do that.\n  So we will have great discussions, of course, on all of these issues. \nThat is the way it ought to be and, indeed, that is the way it is.\n  I see my friend from New Mexico here. I hope we can address ourselves \non these issues and do it in a way that we can disagree without making \na total political issue of each of them--talk about them on their \nmerits, on what they will do for the country, and not the impact they \nwill have in 2004. Frankly, we have had an awful lot of that. We need \nto move beyond that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I thought I was \nto have 10 minutes. Am I too late for that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 and a half minutes available on \nthe Republican side at this point. The Senator can take that time if he \nchooses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 10 at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is rather amazing, in the United \nStates we only have one country, we have one people, we have one \nPresident, and he gives one State of the Union Address. Today we began \nto see how difficult partisan politics has made the idea of having one \nPresident, because before our President--the one President we have--\ntakes the one opportunity to address the American people as to what he \nwould like to do and what he would like help from the Congress and the \npeople on, we have an array of Democratic Senators come to the floor, \nall of whom have today set their own standard for what he ought to do, \nall of whom have criticisms of what he might say, all of whom suggest \nif he doesn't do this, it will not work.\n  Well, I submit the President will have a myriad of healthy ideas for \nthe American economy, and I would like to discuss one major one for a \nfew minutes with the Senate and the American people--that is, the \nconcern we have in the United States about our economy not producing \njobs as it should and, thus, creating worry among our people beyond the \nunemployed. Many Americans who are employed will not spend money, \npurchase, or build a new house because their fear causes restraint. The \nAmerican economy is not producing jobs. The business investors don't \nwant to invest because they are not sure what is going to happen, so \nthey too are withholding. They are being investigated and have all \nkinds of pressures so they are holding back. Even with this \ncombination, the American economy, when you add it all together, is \nmoving ahead quite well. That piece of the economy or that element that \nwe call the gross domestic product is increasing.\n  Normally, when it is increasing, you produce more jobs. The gross \nproduct is not going down, which is negative, meaning a recession; it \nis going up. In fact, sometimes in history, if it went up this amount, \njobs would be increasing in large numbers. This time it is\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nnot happening. That is why we call it a ``jobless'' recovery.\n  Our President isn't laying blame on the Bill Clinton Presidency, when \nthis recession started. I don't believe he has uttered a word about who \ncaused it. I hope he does not tonight. As a matter of fact, on that \nscore, we can all waste America's time talking about 3 years ago, what \nwas going on--was the American economy on the downturn, and was \nPresident Clinton to blame or the Democrats?\n  The truth of the matter is a series of phenomena have occurred, \nincluding a huge terrorist strike that occurred in New York, and a huge \ndrop in the stock market of the United States. You cannot blame that on \nthis President.\n  All of those things, and others, have combined with a 10 or 11-year \ngrowth cycle that had to come down, bringing the American economy into \na nongrowth era for a while. Now it is starting up, and we want our \nPresident to tell us how we can improve that situation for America. \nThat is what it means to speak about the economy and jobs.\n  Our President says: You all may have a lot of good ways, but I \nbelieve we ought to cut taxes. Most economists suggest cutting taxes, \nif you cut them right, will stimulate economic growth. The more money \nthat is put into the economy--that means into the pockets of people and \nthe pockets of business so they can spend it--the more you do that, the \nmore you have a chance of moving the American economy.\n  I understand the Democrats, with Senator Daschle as their leader, \nhave a $141 billion package, a portion of which is giving money to the \nStates because their treasuries are broke. If you want to do that, \ndon't call it a stimulus package. We may do that in another event in \nthe Senate, but our President, rightfully, is not including that in a \nstimulus package. That is not a stimulus, to help our States. At one \ntime, we had a countercyclical problem. I don't know if Don Nickles \nremembers, but Senator Muskie started it, and every time the economy \nwould go down, you give the States money. Well, the President doesn't \nhave that in this budget, in this proposal on taxes; but it may be \nconsidered separately if we have to help. What he does is look at \naccelerated expansion of the 10 percent bracket, accelerated reduction \nin income tax rates, accelerated elimination of the marriage penalty, \nwith some refund of money, and an accelerated increase in the tax \ncredits. It has the exclusion of dividends from individual taxable \nincome and increases in small business expensing. That means if they \ncan expense more, they keep more, which I just said you must do. Let \nthem keep more so they can buy more equipment, spend more on jobs. The \nPresident has a hold harmless provision under the alternative minimum \ntax, a very necessary provision, and the cost of the plan is $98 \nbillion in the first calendar year and $670 billion over 10 years.\n  The Democrat plan is so small I think we ought to nickname it. I \nthink we ought to call it ``the mouse.''\n  The American economy is $10 trillion. If we are talking about 5 \nyears, it is $50 trillion. That means the sum of the transactions going \non, paychecks, car purchases, house purchases, financing, equals $10 \ntrillion a year.\n  When my colleagues say let's accelerate it, that means let's put \nmoney into the economy that stirs that up enough and shakes up all \nthose transactions where a little bit more fever is put in each one of \nthem so some action is occurring which we would equate with growth and \njobs.\n  Clearly, that cannot be done unless enough is put in to move the \ngiant battleship called the American economy. So how can that be moved \nwith a mouse? It cannot. If a mouse is put out there to do it, the \nmouse will die and nothing will happen.\n  If my colleagues don't want to throw away taxpayers' money, then \nproduce a plan that purports to create jobs and is so small it does \nnothing. Otherwise, that money will have been thrown away and my \ncolleagues would be back in 18 months or 2 years asking the American \npeople to give them another shot at it because we did not do enough.\n  So I submit that the President's proposal, which he has already given \nus a glimpse of, which he will tell the American people about tonight \nin detail, is the right one for America. Am I alone? Of course I am not \nalone in thinking this. There are 110 economists. One would think from \nwhat some on the other side say that the President called on a few \npeople and they gave him ideas and he picked this one and said: Oh, \nhere is a new idea. Let's not tax dividends on the individuals who \nreceive them.\n  That idea has been around. I have been in Congress 30 years. It was \naround when I arrived. This is what 110 economists, with three Nobel \nprize winners, said. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a summary of their approach.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n110 Economists Back Bush Tax Plan; 3 Nobel Laureates Join Group Urging \n                           Congress' Support\n\n                          (By James G. Lakely)\n\n       The Washington Times--January 18, 2003.--A letter signed by \n     100 economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, urges \n     Congress to support the main elements of President Bush's \n     $647 billion tax-cut plan, make his 2001 tax cut permanent \n     and restrain federal spending to spur the sluggish economy.\n       ``As a rule, government cannot create wealth or expand the \n     economy. Only the private sector can do that,'' said the \n     letter this week to all members of Congress.'' Government \n     can, however, hinder economic growth through excessive taxes, \n     high marginal tax rates, over-regulation, or unnecessary \n     spending.'' The economists, including Nobel laureates Milton \n     Friedman, James Buchanan and 2002 winner Vernon Smith, said \n     increased spending to combat terrorism is warranted but that \n     ``excessive federal spending has a dampening effect on the \n     American economy.''\n       To remedy that, Congress should ``end programs that outlive \n     their usefulness and roll back government's share of the \n     Gross Domestic Product.''\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, government \n     spending represented 19 percent of the GDP in 2002, a level \n     that has remained roughly stable during the past 15 years but \n     threatens to explode to 40 percent because of entitlement \n     spending by 2075.\n       The ``wobbly'' financial markets can gain solid footing \n     again, said the economists, if Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax \n     cut in 2001 is made permanent.\n       ``Investors and individual taxpayers will be able to make \n     better decisions on their finances if they have greater \n     confidence about what tax laws they will be facing in coming \n     years,'' the letter said. ``It is imperative for Congress to \n     make the entire 2001 tax cut permanent.''\n       The economists also applauded Mr. Bush's proposal to \n     eliminate the double-taxation on corporate dividends, a \n     policy they said is ``especially harmful to economic \n     growth.''\n       Support for Mr. Bush's tax plan largely follows party \n     lines. House Democratic leaders have scheduled an event \n     Tuesday on Capitol Hill to argue that the president's plan is \n     neither fair nor fiscally responsible and would leave state \n     governments starving for money.\n       The various Democratic tax-cut proposals are dramatically \n     smaller, short-term, targeted more narrowly and feature \n     payments of at least $300 to all families, including those \n     who pay no federal income tax.\n       A spokesman for the Democrats on the House Appropriations \n     Committee criticized the president's plan for being too \n     skewed toward ``the superwealthy.''\n       ``The White House needs to wake up and realize that giving \n     their rich cronies another tax break is not going to halt the \n     Bush recession,'' the Democratic aide said.\n       ``We need to put money in the hands of people who are \n     having trouble putting food on their table, not people who \n     want to buy a second yacht.''\n       But Sen. Evan Bayh, Indiana Democrat, said he is ``keeping \n     an open mind'' on supporting a pro-growth tax bill that has \n     many of the features of the president's package. ``I'm not \n     someone who has an allergic reaction to the dividend proposal \n     as some do,'' Mr. Bayh said.\n       ``I think you'll see a great many elements of the \n     president's proposal [in the final bill]. I think, frankly, \n     we'll improve it to make it even more growth-oriented for the \n     economy today.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They suggest that only the private sector can do what \nis required. Government cannot create wealth or expand the economy. \nFriedman, Buchanan, and Vernon Smith, all Nobel laureates, said \nincreased spending to combat terrorism must be done, but to the extent \nthat it is a lot of money, it will not help the American economy.

Mr. President, I have listened to some of the \nconversation that has gone on. Obviously, much of it has been pointed \ntoward this evening's speech that we all look forward to from the \nPresident, the State of the Union, at which time he will outline at \nleast some of his plans for the direction this country will take.\n  I am looking forward to it. The President has committed himself to \ngoing in certain directions. All of us understand that. All of us are \nin favor of the things the President wants to do. I suppose we have \ndifferent views of how that might be done. That is the way it ought to \nbe.\n  I do hope we don't spend all of our time simply criticizing; that we \nnot use this as a sort of political fulcrum, but we really talk about \nthe issues. No one could disagree with the notion that we are looking \nfor ways to grow the economy and create jobs. Who can argue with that? \nNo one. How you do it, yes, I suppose there are different views.\n  To strengthen and improve health care, certainly that is one of the \nissues all of us are faced with, whether it be Medicare, Medicaid, the \nCHIP program, or just general health care. We are all very much \ninterested in it.\n  In my State of Wyoming, a rural State, we have a little different \nproblem, but interestingly enough, we have problems the same as they do \nin Chicago or New York City. The cost, for instance, of liability \ninsurance is higher in our State than it is some others, which is kind \nof strange. Nevertheless, we would all agree with the fact that we need \nto do something about that.\n  Obviously, the defense of our country against terrorism, the defense \nof our country against challenges overseas and security at home, no one \ndisagrees. Again, we have different ways of doing it.\n\n  I would like to deviate from the issue for a moment to talk a little \nbit about--I guess, philosophically or in a broader sense--the notion \nof dealing\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\nwith these issues in terms of a longer term view. We have held in my \nState of Wyoming over the last couple years several meetings; in fact, \nabout 26 meetings in 23 counties. We call them Vision 20/20. We met \nwith the people in the community, all of whom would come--some invited \nfor special reasons--to talk about what they wanted their community and \ntheir family and their business to be in 20 years or 10 years or 15 \nyears, how they envisioned the way things should be. Of course, as you \nmight imagine, we found out there are different views from different \npeople, but pretty much some of the same consistency in terms of \nwanting better jobs, better security, having health care, having \nfreedom.\n  We find ourselves in this body, as in many bodies, as a matter of \nfact, dealing almost exclusively with those issues that are right now \nupon us, fixing what is going to happen tomorrow.\n  Of course, that is necessary. But it seems to me we would help \nourselves a great deal and help our country a great deal if we could \nlook a little further out into the future and say: What do we want this \nGovernment to look like in 15 years, what kind of a system would we \nthink would be best for health care in 15 or 20 years, and then begin \nto get some kind of a general conception of where we want to be and \nwhere we think it is best to be for our country and for the people who \nlive here. And then as we move through the daily issues and as we move \ntoward the issues that we have to resolve, we can measure those against \nwhere we want to be and see if in fact they are contributing to the \nattainment of the goals we have set.\n  One of them certainly is the role of Government. We haven't talked \nabout this as much lately as we used to. What is the role of the \nFederal Government? How much Federal Government do we want in our lives \nover a period of time? This, after all, is the United States of \nAmerica. This is a federation of States. Most of us would agree that \nthe Government that rules best is the one closest to the people. \nObviously, there are roles for the national organization, there are \nroles for the Federal Government. But there are also limits that ought \nto be there, if we don't want the Federal Government to be the end-all \nof governmental activity.\n  What do we see there? How do we want to do that? Most people would \nbelieve there are some constitutional limits to the role of the Federal \nGovernment. We seem to have dismissed those to a large extent and find \nGovernment involved in nearly every aspect of our life.\n  That becomes kind of a political thing that we talk about. We talked \nabout that last week--what can we do this week for somebody? We ended \nup with the other side of the aisle, in that week we spent trying to \ncatch up with the appropriations, having proposals of $500 billion \nworth of spending that would grow Government over 10 years, at the same \ntime complaining about a deficit. So we didn't have a good concept of \nwhere we wanted to go and measure against balancing spending and \nbalancing the budget. Of course, we want to deviate from that from time \nto time, and the circumstances now require that we do something \nunusual, I am sure, about defense and terrorism and about the economy.\n  So we are obviously going to spend more money now than we would \nnormally spend because it is not a normal situation. We hear all the \ntime ``back in 1998 we didn't have a lot of the problems that we have \nnow.'' We have to deal with them. Overall, what do we want? We want a \nbalanced budget. I think we want to be able to hold down spending, not \nincrease it, which is what we hear about, frankly, all the time.\n  We need to take a look at terminating activities that are out of \ndate. It seems when we get something going in the Federal Government, \nit is there forever. In the private sector, when you have a company or \nan operation of your own and you find something is not contributing to \nthat, you have to change it. Not so in the Government. But that ought \nto be one of the directions we want to take.\n  Certainly, we ought to be able to do health care. What do we want \nover time with health care? We have already indicated pretty clearly \nover the past number of years, when it was tried in the last \nadministration to have a Government-run program, we didn't accept that \nand most of us do not now. Obviously, some work needs to be done to \nhelp people who need help. But where do we want to be? Do we want this \nhealth care to be primarily in the private sector? I think so. Most \npeople do. So these are things we need to talk about and think about \nand have a good deal of attention paid to. What is the role of the \nFederal Government on these issues?\n  I noticed the other day a quotation from President Clinton that \nGovernment's responsibility is to create more opportunities, and the \npeople's responsibility is to make the most of it. I agree with that. I \ndon't think his policies were in line with that, but I agree with that \nstatement. So what we are talking about here primarily tonight--and I \nam sure for several months--is about strengthening America's economy. \nThe President's economic agenda has two main goals: To encourage \nconsumer spending that will boost economic recovery, and promote \ninvestment by individuals and businesses that will lead to the economic \ngrowth and job creation. Those are two different points of view, and I \nrespect that. Their point of view is to distribute money to everybody. \nOver here, it is to create incentive to create jobs so you have a long-\nterm, positive impact. We need to do that.\n  So we will have great discussions, of course, on all of these issues. \nThat is the way it ought to be and, indeed, that is the way it is.\n  I see my friend from New Mexico here. I hope we can address ourselves \non these issues and do it in a way that we can disagree without making \na total political issue of each of them--talk about them on their \nmerits, on what they will do for the country, and not the impact they \nwill have in 2004. Frankly, we have had an awful lot of that. We need \nto move beyond that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I thought I was \nto have 10 minutes. Am I too late for that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 and a half minutes available on \nthe Republican side at this point. The Senator can take that time if he \nchooses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 10 at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is rather amazing, in the United \nStates we only have one country, we have one people, we have one \nPresident, and he gives one State of the Union Address. Today we began \nto see how difficult partisan politics has made the idea of having one \nPresident, because before our President--the one President we have--\ntakes the one opportunity to address the American people as to what he \nwould like to do and what he would like help from the Congress and the \npeople on, we have an array of Democratic Senators come to the floor, \nall of whom have today set their own standard for what he ought to do, \nall of whom have criticisms of what he might say, all of whom suggest \nif he doesn't do this, it will not work.\n  Well, I submit the President will have a myriad of healthy ideas for \nthe American economy, and I would like to discuss one major one for a \nfew minutes with the Senate and the American people--that is, the \nconcern we have in the United States about our economy not producing \njobs as it should and, thus, creating worry among our people beyond the \nunemployed. Many Americans who are employed will not spend money, \npurchase, or build a new house because their fear causes restraint. The \nAmerican economy is not producing jobs. The business investors don't \nwant to invest because they are not sure what is going to happen, so \nthey too are withholding. They are being investigated and have all \nkinds of pressures so they are holding back. Even with this \ncombination, the American economy, when you add it all together, is \nmoving ahead quite well. That piece of the economy or that element that \nwe call the gross domestic product is increasing.\n  Normally, when it is increasing, you produce more jobs. The gross \nproduct is not going down, which is negative, meaning a recession; it \nis going up. In fact, sometimes in history, if it went up this amount, \njobs would be increasing in large numbers. This time it is\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nnot happening. That is why we call it a ``jobless'' recovery.\n  Our President isn't laying blame on the Bill Clinton Presidency, when \nthis recession started. I don't believe he has uttered a word about who \ncaused it. I hope he does not tonight. As a matter of fact, on that \nscore, we can all waste America's time talking about 3 years ago, what \nwas going on--was the American economy on the downturn, and was \nPresident Clinton to blame or the Democrats?\n  The truth of the matter is a series of phenomena have occurred, \nincluding a huge terrorist strike that occurred in New York, and a huge \ndrop in the stock market of the United States. You cannot blame that on \nthis President.\n  All of those things, and others, have combined with a 10 or 11-year \ngrowth cycle that had to come down, bringing the American economy into \na nongrowth era for a while. Now it is starting up, and we want our \nPresident to tell us how we can improve that situation for America. \nThat is what it means to speak about the economy and jobs.\n  Our President says: You all may have a lot of good ways, but I \nbelieve we ought to cut taxes. Most economists suggest cutting taxes, \nif you cut them right, will stimulate economic growth. The more money \nthat is put into the economy--that means into the pockets of people and \nthe pockets of business so they can spend it--the more you do that, the \nmore you have a chance of moving the American economy.\n  I understand the Democrats, with Senator Daschle as their leader, \nhave a $141 billion package, a portion of which is giving money to the \nStates because their treasuries are broke. If you want to do that, \ndon't call it a stimulus package. We may do that in another event in \nthe Senate, but our President, rightfully, is not including that in a \nstimulus package. That is not a stimulus, to help our States. At one \ntime, we had a countercyclical problem. I don't know if Don Nickles \nremembers, but Senator Muskie started it, and every time the economy \nwould go down, you give the States money. Well, the President doesn't \nhave that in this budget, in this proposal on taxes; but it may be \nconsidered separately if we have to help. What he does is look at \naccelerated expansion of the 10 percent bracket, accelerated reduction \nin income tax rates, accelerated elimination of the marriage penalty, \nwith some refund of money, and an accelerated increase in the tax \ncredits. It has the exclusion of dividends from individual taxable \nincome and increases in small business expensing. That means if they \ncan expense more, they keep more, which I just said you must do. Let \nthem keep more so they can buy more equipment, spend more on jobs. The \nPresident has a hold harmless provision under the alternative minimum \ntax, a very necessary provision, and the cost of the plan is $98 \nbillion in the first calendar year and $670 billion over 10 years.\n  The Democrat plan is so small I think we ought to nickname it. I \nthink we ought to call it ``the mouse.''\n  The American economy is $10 trillion. If we are talking about 5 \nyears, it is $50 trillion. That means the sum of the transactions going \non, paychecks, car purchases, house purchases, financing, equals $10 \ntrillion a year.\n  When my colleagues say let's accelerate it, that means let's put \nmoney into the economy that stirs that up enough and shakes up all \nthose transactions where a little bit more fever is put in each one of \nthem so some action is occurring which we would equate with growth and \njobs.\n  Clearly, that cannot be done unless enough is put in to move the \ngiant battleship called the American economy. So how can that be moved \nwith a mouse? It cannot. If a mouse is put out there to do it, the \nmouse will die and nothing will happen.\n  If my colleagues don't want to throw away taxpayers' money, then \nproduce a plan that purports to create jobs and is so small it does \nnothing. Otherwise, that money will have been thrown away and my \ncolleagues would be back in 18 months or 2 years asking the American \npeople to give them another shot at it because we did not do enough.\n  So I submit that the President's proposal, which he has already given \nus a glimpse of, which he will tell the American people about tonight \nin detail, is the right one for America. Am I alone? Of course I am not \nalone in thinking this. There are 110 economists. One would think from \nwhat some on the other side say that the President called on a few \npeople and they gave him ideas and he picked this one and said: Oh, \nhere is a new idea. Let's not tax dividends on the individuals who \nreceive them.\n  That idea has been around. I have been in Congress 30 years. It was \naround when I arrived. This is what 110 economists, with three Nobel \nprize winners, said. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a summary of their approach.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n110 Economists Back Bush Tax Plan; 3 Nobel Laureates Join Group Urging \n                           Congress' Support\n\n                          (By James G. Lakely)\n\n       The Washington Times--January 18, 2003.--A letter signed by \n     100 economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, urges \n     Congress to support the main elements of President Bush's \n     $647 billion tax-cut plan, make his 2001 tax cut permanent \n     and restrain federal spending to spur the sluggish economy.\n       ``As a rule, government cannot create wealth or expand the \n     economy. Only the private sector can do that,'' said the \n     letter this week to all members of Congress.'' Government \n     can, however, hinder economic growth through excessive taxes, \n     high marginal tax rates, over-regulation, or unnecessary \n     spending.'' The economists, including Nobel laureates Milton \n     Friedman, James Buchanan and 2002 winner Vernon Smith, said \n     increased spending to combat terrorism is warranted but that \n     ``excessive federal spending has a dampening effect on the \n     American economy.''\n       To remedy that, Congress should ``end programs that outlive \n     their usefulness and roll back government's share of the \n     Gross Domestic Product.''\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, government \n     spending represented 19 percent of the GDP in 2002, a level \n     that has remained roughly stable during the past 15 years but \n     threatens to explode to 40 percent because of entitlement \n     spending by 2075.\n       The ``wobbly'' financial markets can gain solid footing \n     again, said the economists, if Mr. Bush's $1.35 trillion tax \n     cut in 2001 is made permanent.\n       ``Investors and individual taxpayers will be able to make \n     better decisions on their finances if they have greater \n     confidence about what tax laws they will be facing in coming \n     years,'' the letter said. ``It is imperative for Congress to \n     make the entire 2001 tax cut permanent.''\n       The economists also applauded Mr. Bush's proposal to \n     eliminate the double-taxation on corporate dividends, a \n     policy they said is ``especially harmful to economic \n     growth.''\n       Support for Mr. Bush's tax plan largely follows party \n     lines. House Democratic leaders have scheduled an event \n     Tuesday on Capitol Hill to argue that the president's plan is \n     neither fair nor fiscally responsible and would leave state \n     governments starving for money.\n       The various Democratic tax-cut proposals are dramatically \n     smaller, short-term, targeted more narrowly and feature \n     payments of at least $300 to all families, including those \n     who pay no federal income tax.\n       A spokesman for the Democrats on the House Appropriations \n     Committee criticized the president's plan for being too \n     skewed toward ``the superwealthy.''\n       ``The White House needs to wake up and realize that giving \n     their rich cronies another tax break is not going to halt the \n     Bush recession,'' the Democratic aide said.\n       ``We need to put money in the hands of people who are \n     having trouble putting food on their table, not people who \n     want to buy a second yacht.''\n       But Sen. Evan Bayh, Indiana Democrat, said he is ``keeping \n     an open mind'' on supporting a pro-growth tax bill that has \n     many of the features of the president's package. ``I'm not \n     someone who has an allergic reaction to the dividend proposal \n     as some do,'' Mr. Bayh said.\n       ``I think you'll see a great many elements of the \n     president's proposal [in the final bill]. I think, frankly, \n     we'll improve it to make it even more growth-oriented for the \n     economy today.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They suggest that only the private sector can do what \nis required. Government cannot create wealth or expand the economy. \nFriedman, Buchanan, and Vernon Smith, all Nobel laureates, said \nincreased spending to combat terrorism must be done, but to the extent \nthat it is a lot of money, it will not help the American economy. They \ngo on to say we need what the President is suggesting in his plan.\n  This summary I have before me, News World Communications, from the \nWashington Times quotes this series of communications.\n  I see Mr. Nickles, the Senator from Oklahoma. I was going to speak \nabout Iraq for a few minutes but I think I will not because I assume he \nwill speak on the economy and taxes. I think it would be good today to \nhave my speech and his back to back.\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1654-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I conclude with some comments on Iraq. I hope that \ntonight our President will tell our people the issue in Iraq is why has \nSaddam Hussein not destroyed the weapons of mass destruction that are \nin his country; not that we did not find them, not that we did not find \na smoking gun.\n  The United Nations verified that he had thousands of weapons in his \ncountry, thousands of weapons of biological and chemical makeup that \ncan kill millions of people.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Some 9 or 10 years ago, the United Nations said Saddam \nmust get rid of them, and then we pulled out. The United Nations sat \naround, Iraq started selling oil again, and Saddam started being \nSaddam. Then we decided we will go in and see if he has gotten rid of \nthem. Noncompliance by him means he has not shown what happened to the \nweapons.\n  The 12,000-page document, which was all over the press as if they had \nsubmitted 12,000 pages of real explanation, was presented some days ago \nas though it explained where these thousands of weapons went. The \nUnited States and its agents of absolute integrity have read every \nsingle page, every single line. The conclusion is that the 12,000-page \ndocument is a farce. It does not explain what happened to all of those \nweapons. It is a joke.\n  They put in those pages what they wanted, and they described what \nthey wanted. The sum total is, where are they?\n  He continues to say: I am showing them everything. And we continue to \nsay: It is your responsibility to show us what you did with them. After \nall, it is not like every country in the world would accept thousands \nof these chemical weapons. Some nation that is crazy enough to take \nthem would have to be found. So we have to be told they are not here. \nBut where are they? If they are dumped in the ocean, somebody would \nfind out. They cannot easily be gotten rid of so he has not gotten rid \nof them. He hid them.\n  Now we are telling the world there is noncompliance. I hope the world \nsees it our way, but more importantly I hope Saddam sees it our way. I \nhope he understands there are a lot of us that understand what is going \non and that it is like I just said: He better come clean or, in fact, \nsomething will happen. I hope he does it himself and I hope our friends \nrealize they better join us in putting him on the spot or he will put \nthe world on the spot, and he will do it very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1654-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1654-S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IRAQ, THE ECONOMY, AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, for his speech and also for many of the comments he made \nrelating to the economy, the budget, and Iraq. I think the Senator from \nNew Mexico is exactly right. The issue with Iraq is not whether the \narms control inspectors can find a few weapons. It is whether or not \nSaddam Hussein is going to disarm and whether he is going to comply \nwith the United Nations and whether the United Nations is going to \nenforce compliance.\n  We can pass 17 resolutions, all of which say the international \ncommunity says he must disarm, but if we do not compel him to disarm, \nit makes the United Nations somewhat irrelevant to the whole proposal. \nDo those resolutions mean anything besides rhetoric or are we going to \nenforce them?\n  The previous administration did not enforce them. As a result, we did \nnot even have arms control inspectors, much less enforcing the existing \nresolutions. Now we have a President who is going to lead the world, \nwho says we should enforce these resolutions, and we should compel his \ndisarmament.\n  When we think of the dangerousness of these weapons, I mentioned \nearlier today that two envelopes with anthrax that unfortunately were \ndestined to the Senate killed a few people. They were not even opened \nin the post office. Yet they still killed people. They are very deadly \nmaterials. He happens to have tons of similar-type weapons, some even \nmore dangerous such as VX.\n  I think the President is right in drawing a line in the sand and \nsaying he must comply. The world community, the United Nations, agreed \nwith the President last year. I hope they continue to support \ncompelling Saddam Hussein to comply with existing U.N. resolutions.\n  I will submit for the Record a table which summarizes the Senate's \naction on H.J. Res. 2, the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations \nresolution. This table was prepared by my staff based upon estimates of \nthe Congressional Budget Office. I also wish to congratulate the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for working \nto limit the total fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills to amounts \nrequested by the President.\n  As adopted by the Senate, H.J. Res. 2 contains $386.864 billion in \ndiscretionary spending when added to the amounts in the defense and \nmilitary construction appropriations bills already enacted, which total \n$752.193 billion in fiscal year 2003 discretionary spending. These \ntotals include a 1.6 percent across-the-board reduction amounting to \n$6.4 billion from all accounts funded in the other 11 appropriations \nbills, plus amounts for classified defense programs, $3.9 billion in \nfire and management, $825 million for which the President submitted \nseparate requests.\n\n  Compared to fiscal year 2002, total discretionary spending under H.J. \nRes. 2 would grow by 2.4 percent, defense discretionary spending would \ngrow by 6.9 percent, and domestic discretionary spending would decrease \nby 1.9 percent; compared to fiscal year 2002, less spending for one-\ntime nonrecurring projects. Total discretionary spending under H.J. \nRes. 2 would grow by 4.7 percent, defense discretionary spending would \ngrow by 7.3 percent, and domestic discretionary spending would grow by \n2.1 percent. H.J. Res. 2 also includes several changes in mandatory \nprograms not counted on the discretionary side of the budget.\n  The increased spending, which would total $4.221 billion in 2003, \nincludes changes in agriculture payments for drought, payments to \nphysicians in rural hospitals, and TANF payments to States.\n  I ask unanimous consent a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of H.J. Res. 2 and enacted appropriations with comparison to \n2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   CBO

Budget Office; Senate Budget Committee Republican\n  Staff.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is more fiscally responsible than \nany appropriations bills we have passed in the last many years. I \ncompliment the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman \nStevens, as well as Senator Frist and all of our colleagues who worked \naggressively to contain the growth of these bills. That was not easy. \nWe had a lot of votes. We voted down over half a trillion in additional \nspending amendments. I compliment my colleagues for showing some fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  In order to show fiscal discipline in the future, we have to pass a \nbudget. Last year we did not pass a budget and we did not pass 11 of 13 \nappropriations bills. I hope this year we will be able to pass a \nbudget; that we will be able to pass it on time; and that it will also \nallow for us to pass a growth package in addition to a package that \nwould improve and enhance Medicare. Passing a budget makes it possible \nto do all those things. Without passing a budget we may not do any. We \nmay not get appropriations done; we may not do a growth package; we may \nnot do a prescription drug proposal or a Medicare enhancement proposal.\n  I speak just for a moment now on the President's proposal for \neconomic growth and job creation. I have heard some colleagues coming \nto the floor criticizing it. I am also bewildered by statements they \nare making. Many have criticized the President's effort to eliminate \ndouble taxation on dividends, saying it benefits one group or another. \nI have not heard anyone say this is really good tax policy. Let's tax \ndividends twice. Let's tax it on the corporate level and tax it on the \nindividual level so the net effective rate of taxation is anywhere from \n65 percent to 73 percent, maybe 73.6 percent.\n  Now, with tax rates as high as two thirds or more, we more than \ndiscourage dividends. Dividends are basically rewarding the owners of \nthe company with the fruits or profits of the company. With the double \ntaxation, we are telling companies not to do this. I used to run a \ncompany. It makes no sense to do it. For corporations, particularly \nprivately held corporations--I used to run one--why pay dividends if \nthe Government is going to take, at least in present law, 35 percent \nautomatically; and then individuals who may be paying rates of 28 \npercent or 27 percent, or maybe they are paying rates of 32 percent or \n35 percent or 38 percent. If you add 35 percent and 35 percent, that is \n70 percent. If a corporation makes $1,000 in earnings and they want to \ndistribute it to their employees, the government gets $700 and the \nstock owner gets 30 percent.\n  That is absurd. It makes no sense.\n  Corporations are greatly discouraged from distributing their earnings \nto their owners. That is bad tax policy. And the present Tax Code \nencourages corporations to go into debt. We encourage corporations to \npile up the debt because they get to expense it, but we do not tell \nthem if they go the equity route, to build financing, to obtain \nfinancing, they can expense dividends. I hope we would do it. I would \nthink expensing dividends from a corporate side would be the better way \nto eliminate double taxation. There are two or three different ways it \ncan be done. I mention that to my colleagues.\n  The President has good tax policy--one that will help grow the \neconomy, one that will encourage investment, one that would eliminate \nsome of the gross distortions we have in the present Tax Code.\n  I make a couple of other comments concerning the President's tax \nproposal. I have heard a few people allude to the fact that it only \nbenefits the wealthy. They have not read the President's proposal. The \nPresident's proposal is that we would have a $1,000 tax credit per \nchild. Part of that was passed in 2001 and earlier where he said we \nwill increase it. Right now the Tax Code has a $600 tax credit per \nchild. He wants to make it $1,000. I have four kids. They are grown now \nso they will not qualify unless we include grandkids and maybe we \nshould do that, too. One thousand dollars per child is $4,000 for four \nkids, $1,600 more than present law. One does not have to be wealthy to \nget it. If you have four kids, you get $1,600 more, a tax credit, where \nyou do not have to pay taxes. That will take a lot of taxpayers to a \nzero tax bracket.\n  The President says, let's eliminate the marriage penalties by \ndoubling the 15 percent tax bracket for an individual or a couple. The \nnet impact of that, if a couple has a combined income of $55,000, they \nget to save about $1,000 per couple. If you want to do something to \nhelp middle income taxpayers, married couples, families, the President \nhas it. He has a child tax credit, and he also has elimination of the \nmarriage penalties. That is in his proposal. He also says individuals \nshould not pay taxes at rates higher than corporations. I agree. Let's \naccelerate the tax cuts now for 2004 and 2006. And when you finish with \nthat, the maximum income tax bracket, personal income taxes, is 35 \npercent. It just so happens 70 or 80 percent of the people who are \npaying that highest tax bracket are sole proprietorships, \nentrepreneurs, self-employed. Why should they pay a tax rate higher \nthan General Motors? Presently, they do. General Motors pays a tax rate \nof 35 percent right now. Those individuals pay a tax rate of 38.6 \npercent. I don't think they should have to pay a tax rate higher than \nGeneral Motors. They have a smaller business. Let's have a little \nequity.\n  Some say this is not doing enough for low-income. We have helped \nindividuals and families. We have reduced tax rates for taxpayers in \nincome tax brackets. The President expands the 10 percent tax bracket \nwhich he created 2 years ago. There was 15 percent tax brackets and the \nPresident made it retroactive on lowest income people. He took a lot of \nindividuals in the 15 percent tax bracket and made their rate 10 \npercent. That was a 33 percent reduction in their tax bracket. We made \nit retroactive. That was equal to a benefit of about $600 for a couple. \nNow the President says let's expand the 10 percent bracket further. I \ncompliment him for that, as well.\n  There is a lot of benefit in here for all income groups. A lot of \npeople are throwing rocks at this without looking at the substance of \nit. I hope maybe they would look a little closer and maybe we should \nwork a little more together and have a little bipartisan cooperation \nand see if we cannot do something to help grow the economy. It is \nvitally important we grow the economy. The President has a good \nproposal, a good package, one that will be, I am sure, thoroughly \nscrutinized by the Ways and Means Committee, by the Finance Committee.\n  We have a tradition in the Finance Committee reporting out bipartisan \npackages, whether in taxes or whether it be in the health care. I hope \nwe will do both this year. We can. The President has given us a good \nproposal to do so. I look forward to working with my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to pass a budget and to pass a growth \npackage that will help grow the economy. It is important that Congress \nenact both this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand that under the previous \norder, at 4:15 we start going back and forth. I ask the Senator from \nNew York, who is prepared under that order, if I might proceed for 5 to \n7 minutes prior to his taking it? I do not wish to be discourteous to \nmy colleague because I know he came over for the 4:15 slot.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no objection. The Senator is always a gentleman, \nand it is a pleasure to let him speak for his time first.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator and appreciate the opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1654-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1654-S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IRAQ, THE ECONOMY, AND THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, for his speech and also for many of the comments he made \nrelating to the economy, the budget, and Iraq. I think the Senator from \nNew Mexico is exactly right. The issue with Iraq is not whether the \narms control inspectors can find a few weapons. It is whether or not \nSaddam Hussein is going to disarm and whether he is going to comply \nwith the United Nations and whether the United Nations is going to \nenforce compliance.\n  We can pass 17 resolutions, all of which say the international \ncommunity says he must disarm, but if we do not compel him to disarm, \nit makes the United Nations somewhat irrelevant to the whole proposal. \nDo those resolutions mean anything besides rhetoric or are we going to \nenforce them?\n  The previous administration did not enforce them. As a result, we did \nnot even have arms control inspectors, much less enforcing the existing \nresolutions. Now we have a President who is going to lead the world, \nwho says we should enforce these resolutions, and we should compel his \ndisarmament.\n  When we think of the dangerousness of these weapons, I mentioned \nearlier today that two envelopes with anthrax that unfortunately were \ndestined to the Senate killed a few people. They were not even opened \nin the post office. Yet they still killed people. They are very deadly \nmaterials. He happens to have tons of similar-type weapons, some even \nmore dangerous such as VX.\n  I think the President is right in drawing a line in the sand and \nsaying he must comply. The world community, the United Nations, agreed \nwith the President last year. I hope they continue to support \ncompelling Saddam Hussein to comply with existing U.N. resolutions.\n  I will submit for the Record a table which summarizes the Senate's \naction on H.J. Res. 2, the fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations \nresolution. This table was prepared by my staff based upon estimates of \nthe Congressional Budget Office. I also wish to congratulate the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for working \nto limit the total fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills to amounts \nrequested by the President.\n  As adopted by the Senate, H.J. Res. 2 contains $386.864 billion in \ndiscretionary spending when added to the amounts in the defense and \nmilitary construction appropriations bills already enacted, which total \n$752.193 billion in fiscal year 2003 discretionary spending. These \ntotals include a 1.6 percent across-the-board reduction amounting to \n$6.4 billion from all accounts funded in the other 11 appropriations \nbills, plus amounts for classified defense programs, $3.9 billion in \nfire and management, $825 million for which the President submitted \nseparate requests.\n\n  Compared to fiscal year 2002, total discretionary spending under H.J. \nRes. 2 would grow by 2.4 percent, defense discretionary spending would \ngrow by 6.9 percent, and domestic discretionary spending would decrease \nby 1.9 percent; compared to fiscal year 2002, less spending for one-\ntime nonrecurring projects. Total discretionary spending under H.J. \nRes. 2 would grow by 4.7 percent, defense discretionary spending would \ngrow by 7.3 percent, and domestic discretionary spending would grow by \n2.1 percent. H.J. Res. 2 also includes several changes in mandatory \nprograms not counted on the discretionary side of the budget.\n  The increased spending, which would total $4.221 billion in 2003, \nincludes changes in agriculture payments for drought, payments to \nphysicians in rural hospitals, and TANF payments to States.\n  I ask unanimous consent a table displaying the Budget Committee \nscoring of H.J. Res. 2 and enacted appropriations with comparison to \n2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   CBO

Budget Office; Senate Budget Committee Republican\n  Staff.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is more fiscally responsible than \nany appropriations bills we have passed in the last many years. I \ncompliment the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman \nStevens, as well as Senator Frist and all of our colleagues who worked \naggressively to contain the growth of these bills. That was not easy. \nWe had a lot of votes. We voted down over half a trillion in additional \nspending amendments. I compliment my colleagues for showing some fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  In order to show fiscal discipline in the future, we have to pass a \nbudget. Last year we did not pass a budget and we did not pass 11 of 13 \nappropriations bills. I hope this year we will be able to pass a \nbudget; that we will be able to pass it on time; and that it will also \nallow for us to pass a growth package in addition to a package that \nwould improve and enhance Medicare. Passing a budget makes it possible \nto do all those things. Without passing a budget we may not do any. We \nmay not get appropriations done; we may not do a growth package; we may \nnot do a prescription drug proposal or a Medicare enhancement proposal.\n  I speak just for a moment now on the President's proposal for \neconomic growth and job creation. I have heard some colleagues coming \nto the floor criticizing it. I am also bewildered by statements they \nare making. Many have criticized the President's effort to eliminate \ndouble taxation on dividends, saying it benefits one group or another. \nI have not heard anyone say this is really good tax policy. Let's tax \ndividends twice. Let's tax it on the corporate level and tax it on the \nindividual level so the net effective rate of taxation is anywhere from \n65 percent to 73 percent, maybe 73.6 percent.\n  Now, with tax rates as high as two thirds or more, we more than \ndiscourage dividends. Dividends are basically rewarding the owners of \nthe company with the fruits or profits of the company. With the double \ntaxation, we are telling companies not to do this. I used to run a \ncompany. It makes no sense to do it. For corporations, particularly \nprivately held corporations--I used to run one--why pay dividends if \nthe Government is going to take, at least in present law, 35 percent \nautomatically; and then individuals who may be paying rates of 28 \npercent or 27 percent, or maybe they are paying rates of 32 percent or \n35 percent or 38 percent. If you add 35 percent and 35 percent, that is \n70 percent. If a corporation makes $1,000 in earnings and they want to \ndistribute it to their employees, the government gets $700 and the \nstock owner gets 30 percent.\n  That is absurd. It makes no sense.\n  Corporations are greatly discouraged from distributing their earnings \nto their owners. That is bad tax policy. And the present Tax Code \nencourages corporations to go into debt. We encourage corporations to \npile up the debt because they get to expense it, but we do not tell \nthem if they go the equity route, to build financing, to obtain \nfinancing, they can expense dividends. I hope we would do it. I would \nthink expensing dividends from a corporate side would be the better way \nto eliminate double taxation. There are two or three different ways it \ncan be done. I mention that to my colleagues.\n  The President has good tax policy--one that will help grow the \neconomy, one that will encourage investment, one that would eliminate \nsome of the gross distortions we have in the present Tax Code.\n  I make a couple of other comments concerning the President's tax \nproposal. I have heard a few people allude to the fact that it only \nbenefits the wealthy. They have not read the President's proposal. The \nPresident's proposal is that we would have a $1,000 tax credit per \nchild. Part of that was passed in 2001 and earlier where he said we \nwill increase it. Right now the Tax Code has a $600 tax credit per \nchild. He wants to make it $1,000. I have four kids. They are grown now \nso they will not qualify unless we include grandkids and maybe we \nshould do that, too. One thousand dollars per child is $4,000 for four \nkids, $1,600 more than present law. One does not have to be wealthy to \nget it. If you have four kids, you get $1,600 more, a tax credit, where \nyou do not have to pay taxes. That will take a lot of taxpayers to a \nzero tax bracket.\n  The President says, let's eliminate the marriage penalties by \ndoubling the 15 percent tax bracket for an individual or a couple. The \nnet impact of that, if a couple has a combined income of $55,000, they \nget to save about $1,000 per couple. If you want to do something to \nhelp middle income taxpayers, married couples, families, the President \nhas it. He has a child tax credit, and he also has elimination of the \nmarriage penalties. That is in his proposal. He also says individuals \nshould not pay taxes at rates higher than corporations. I agree. Let's \naccelerate the tax cuts now for 2004 and 2006. And when you finish with \nthat, the maximum income tax bracket, personal income taxes, is 35 \npercent. It just so happens 70 or 80 percent of the people who are \npaying that highest tax bracket are sole proprietorships, \nentrepreneurs, self-employed. Why should they pay a tax rate higher \nthan General Motors? Presently, they do. General Motors pays a tax rate \nof 35 percent right now. Those individuals pay a tax rate of 38.6 \npercent. I don't think they should have to pay a tax rate higher than \nGeneral Motors. They have a smaller business. Let's have a little \nequity.\n  Some say this is not doing enough for low-income. We have helped \nindividuals and families. We have reduced tax rates for taxpayers in \nincome tax brackets. The President expands the 10 percent tax bracket \nwhich he created 2 years ago. There was 15 percent tax brackets and the \nPresident made it retroactive on lowest income people. He took a lot of \nindividuals in the 15 percent tax bracket and made their rate 10 \npercent. That was a 33 percent reduction in their tax bracket. We made \nit retroactive. That was equal to a benefit of about $600 for a couple. \nNow the President says let's expand the 10 percent bracket further. I \ncompliment him for that, as well.\n  There is a lot of benefit in here for all income groups. A lot of \npeople are throwing rocks at this without looking at the substance of \nit. I hope maybe they would look a little closer and maybe we should \nwork a little more together and have a little bipartisan cooperation \nand see if we cannot do something to help grow the economy. It is \nvitally important we grow the economy. The President has a good \nproposal, a good package, one that will be, I am sure, thoroughly \nscrutinized by the Ways and Means Committee, by the Finance Committee.\n  We have a tradition in the Finance Committee reporting out bipartisan \npackages, whether in taxes or whether it be in the health care. I hope \nwe will do both this year. We can. The President has given us a good \nproposal to do so. I look forward to working with my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to pass a budget and to pass a growth \npackage that will help grow the economy. It is important that Congress \nenact both this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand that under the previous \norder, at 4:15 we start going back and forth. I ask the Senator from \nNew York, who is prepared under that order, if I might proceed for 5 to \n7 minutes prior to his taking it? I do not wish to be discourteous to \nmy colleague because I know he came over for the 4:15 slot.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no objection. The Senator is always a gentleman, \nand it is a pleasure to let him speak for his time first.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator and appreciate the opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1656-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1656-S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             WAR WITH IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I go out among my constituents, the \none question I always get asked in these present times is: Are we going \nto go to war with Iraq?\n  For a while my answer was, that is up to Saddam Hussein. It depends \non how he acts and what he does, as to whether or not we are going to \ngo to war with Iraq.\n  But what he does now is fairly clear. The position he has taken is \nfairly clear. He made the comment to an Egyptian journalist, that has \nbeen repeated now around the world:\n\n       Time is working for us.\n\n  He has made it clear that he is not going to change. There will be no \ndisarmament of Iraq from within. There will be no genuine cooperation \nwith the inspectors. So I think my earlier answer probably is no longer \ncorrect. The decision now lies with President Bush: Will we go to war \nor won't we?\n  In that circumstance, the President is being bombarded on all sides \nwith editorial comment and punditry, with firm, solid recommendations, \nyes and no, depending on the ideological status of the particular \npundit. They can make those firm recommendations from the safe, secure \nposition of knowing that they will not have to be acted upon and that \nthey will not be held accountable if their recommendation is followed \nand the result is not successful.\n  The President faces what is clearly the most agonizing and difficult \ndecision of his Presidency. I pray for him and urge other Americans to \npray for him as he makes this decision.\n  I want to lay down what I see as the challenge here. I do not think \nit is an easy question. I do not think it is clear, one way or the \nother. The truly Presidential decisions never are. If the decisions \nwere easy, they would be made before they got to the level of the \nPresident. If the action was clear, smart people at lower levels of \nGovernment would take it. It is only when the decision is agonizingly \nclose and the options not clear on either side that it ends up \nultimately on the President's desk in the Oval Office and becomes his \ndecision and his decision alone.\n\n  This is what I see. Saddam Hussein is going through the motions of \ncooperating with the inspectors, and there are those who say: Let that \nprocess play out. We have him contained. As long as there are \ninspectors in the country, there will not be any effort to use weapons \nof mass destruction. Let's just let that play out.\n  Then there are those who say: He has violated the resolution of the \nUnited Nations. The legal position is absolutely clear. If the United \nNations and the United States are going to be taken seriously around \nthe world, we must now take military action and we cannot wait any \nlonger.\n  I am sure those legal arguments with respect to Resolution 1441 in \nthe United Nations are valid. I don't argue with them. But they don't \nchange the practicality of the situation, that an attack on Iraq--even \nif it is justified under the legality of the United Nations \nresolution--might still prove to be a mistake. The solidity of the \nlegal position with respect to Resolution 1441 is a legitimate question \nfor Colin Powell to raise with his fellow diplomats, but it does not \nease the agony of the necessity of making the final decision in the \nOval Office.\n  I believe that Saddam Hussein is cooperating with the investigators \nfor one reason and one reason only; that is that American troops are \nmassing on the border. He knows American military power is sufficient, \nif unleashed, to bring his regime down and probably end his life. He is \ntaking every step he can to try prevent that.\n  Those who say let this play out, leave the status quo and let it go \nforward, don't appreciate the difficulty of America keeping those \ntroops on line, keeping those troops on the border, keeping those \nairplanes on alert so that he will continue to try to satisfy the \ninspectors. We cannot continue to do that for an extended period of \ntime. It is not fair. It is not possible, given the lives and other \nchallenges faced by these young people. At some point and at some point \nrelatively soon, the President is going to have to make a decision to \neither move in or stand down. And the ultimate question here is not \nwhat is the legality of U.N. Resolution 1441 or what is the relevance \nof the United Nations in the world community. The ultimate question \nhere is, What will be the result if he moves forward, and what will be \nthe result if he stands down, he, in this case, of course, being \nPresident Bush.\n  We have heard a lot of talk. That is not the right term. That implies \nsomething less than seriousness. We have heard a lot of analysis about \nwhat could happen if he moves forward. Some of the scenarios are very \nencouraging; some are frightening. We don't know in advance which ones \nwould come true. We have had less analysis placed on the question of \nwhat would happen if the President orders the troops to stand down and \nstart to come home. We do have some historic precedent for this. I \nremember going to the room in the Capitol on the fourth floor and \nhearing Madeleine Albright describe the situation in Iraq, in terms \neerily familiar to the terms we are currently hearing from Secretary \nPowell. I remember walking out of that briefing in room 407 and saying \nto myself: We will be at war with Iraq within 3 days.\n  Then President Clinton made the decision that we would stand down. \nAmerican troops were not at the forward edge they are now, so that \ndecision was not as difficult in terms of the logistics, as it would be \nfor President Bush now. But at the same time, the progress being made \nthen was not as good as it is now. President Clinton, for whatever \nreasons--good, bad, or indifferent--decided to stand down and the \nresult has not been one with which the world is pleased.\n  Now, if we stand down, the result ultimately, in my opinion, would be \nmore devastating for world peace, long term, than if we move forward.\n  I know how agonizing that decision must be for the President. I will \nlook forward to listening to him discuss it with us tonight. I hope he \nwill outline for us what would be the consequences if we stand down, in \nterms of American credibility--credibility that is not just saving face \nin some kind of psychological way, credibility that is essential to \nkeeping the peace in the world. What would happen to those countries \nthat are urging, hoping, praying for Saddam Hussein to be gone, if they \nsaid the Americans got this far, they came this close, and then they \nturned around and left? That means we cannot depend on the Americans \never again. We can't trust their word ever again. What would be the \nconsequences of that? I think they would be serious.\n  I remember a couplet I learned as a child. I never quite understood \nwhat it meant until someone in my later years explained the historic \ncontext. It is just a child's rhyme, but it was based on a historic \nevent. It said:\n\n     The King of France went up the hill\n     With twenty thousand men;\n     The King of France came down the hill,\n     And ne'er went up again.\n\n  There was even a tune that went to it. I will not duplicate Senator \nD'Amato and sing on the Senate floor. But that is where we are.\n\n     The King of France went up the hill\n     With twenty thousand men;\n     The king of France came down the hill,\n     And ne'er went up again.\n\n  The United States of America, acting on a 15-to-nothing resolution \nout of the Security Council of the United Nations, as well as an \noverwhelming vote in this Chamber and in the other body, has marched up \nthe hill and told Saddam Hussein he must disarm. Now there are those \nwho say because he has stopped producing these weapons, as long as \nthese troops are at his border we can afford to turn around and march \ndown again.\n  It is, as I said, an agonizing decision. It will be made by the \nPresident of the United States. He will not ask my advice, for I have \nno expertise in these matters. But my constituents do ask me about it \nbecause I represent them in this body.\n  I think having marched up the hill, having taken the United Nations \nResolution 1441 at its face value, and having stood the troops there, \nthat has produced the results we have had so far. We cannot now back \ndown.\n  I wish the President well. As I said, he is in my prayers, and I hope \nthat of all Americans, as he makes this most momentous decision. The \nconsequence is: What happens if we do? And what happens if we do not?\n  I wish the President well as he makes that analysis. I have \nconfidence in this\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nPresident and his instincts that he will, in fact, ultimately make the \ncorrect decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1657-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROVIDING FOR A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, my reason for coming to the Chamber today \nis similar to those of many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. \nWe are discussing what we hope the President will speak about tonight, \nwhat we want him to speak about, what we expect him to speak about.\n  Some of my colleagues have talked about areas such as the economy, \nthe environment, education, and health care. I am going to address the \nissue of homeland security because, as much as we do overseas, we have \nto make sure our homeland is secure as well.\n  If, God willing, we were able to just eliminate all of al-Qaida and \nall of Saddam and his supporters, we would still face a danger from \nterrorism. Terrorists can strike almost at will in different ways, and \nour country is not yet secure against them, although I will say we have \nmade some progress, particularly in the areas of air safety and in \nbioterrorism, since 9/11.\n  But we have so much more to do. What worries me is that the focus of \nthis administration is almost exclusively on fighting the war on \nterrorism overseas. To beat the terrorists we need a one-two punch--\none, fighting that war overseas, dealing with terrorism overseas; but, \ntwo, making our homeland more secure. And there seems to be a rather \nquaint and quirky notion among many of those in the administration that \nwe can successfully fight the war here at home without spending a \nnickel. That is just wrong.\n  The bottom line is if someone were to say to the Commander in Chief \nof the Armed Forces, go fight the war in Iraq without any new \nresources, without any new dollars, he would say: I can't. But that is \nbasically what we are saying to Mr. Tom Ridge and those who work under \nhim.\n  Time and time again, when Members on both sides of the aisle have \ndone a lot of research and proposed measures that would increase our \nsecurity here at home, we are told: Well, that's a good idea, but we \ncan't spend any money on it.\n  That just cannot be. There are so many areas where we lie naked, \npossible prey, God forbid, to terrorists.\n  Take our ports. We are far, far behind where we should be in \nmonitoring what comes in on our ships. As we all know, those ships \ncould be filled with deadly devices.\n  Take our borders. On the northern border, my State has a long and \npeaceful border with Canada. But, right now, if we pass the budget that \nwas passed in the Senate, there will be fewer Customs inspectors on \nthat northern border than there were on 9/11.\n  As to the FBI, this new budget that we passed, unfortunately, cuts \nthe number of FBI agents. While the counterterrorism parts of the FBI \nare increasing, all the other parts are decreasing. It makes no sense \nto say we are going to make our citizens more secure from a foreign \nthreat and leave them prey to a domestic threat. Bank robberies in my \ncommunity are going up. It seems logical to assume that one of the \nreasons for that is that the FBI is not able to do its function under \nthe strained budget that we have given it--to do both functions: \nfighting terrorism and fighting crime here at home.\n  As to cyberterrorism, unfortunately, Richard Clark, a brilliant man--\nthe administration's point man on cyber-security--is leaving. But I am \nsure, as he has told many of you, we are again doing virtually nothing \nto make ourselves more secure from a deadly virus that might invade one \nof the very important technological systems that secure our country. \nAnd the list goes on and on and on.\n\n  As to truck safety, trucks that carry hazardous material, Brazil is \ndoing a far better job in dealing with terrorism there than we are, \neven though they have not been the focus of terrorist attacks.\n  As to the rails, in my City of New York, Penn Station has a 1\\1/2\\-\nmile tunnel that has no egress. God forbid if something terrible \nhappened there. What we have to do is look at all of our weak pressure \npoints in terms of where terrorists would strike and strengthen them.\n  But this administration, in part because they do not want to spend \nthe dollars necessary--as eager as they are to spend the dollars \noverseas that are necessary--is not doing the job.\n  So today we are going to look, as the President speaks, as to what \nspecifically he is going to do to bolster our case in terms of homeland \nsecurity. We are going to see if the promise that was made--for \ninstance, in the USA Patriot Act, that we triple the number of Border \nPatrol and Customs agents and immigration authorities at the northern \nborder--will be fulfilled.\n  We are going to look and see if there are the dollars necessary to \nupdate the INS computers, which are notoriously bad, so terrorists \ncannot slip into the country, and the FBI computers that, again, were \nso bad that all the signals we had about a plot that was hatched for 9/\n11 were missed, mainly because the FBI computers were less \nsophisticated, frankly, than the one my eighth grade, 14-year-old \ndaughter has at our home.\n  The list goes on and on. And no one expects this administration will \nclean up every single problem we have in 6 months. But in terms of \neffort, in terms of focus, in terms of allocation of resources, they \nare woefully behind.\n  My good colleague from West Virginia, who has done so much to lead \nthis fight, made a very good point on the homeland security bill. That \nbill, as you all know, rearranged agencies but did not change what \nhappens within them.\n  Rearranging agencies does not change things. Moving the Coast Guard \nover to this new agency is not going to help it patrol 200 miles off \nthe coast as it must do in our post 9/11 world.\n  When our President tonight gives his speech, we are all going to be \nlooking to see what specifically he will say and\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nwhat resources he will devote to protect our domestic security. Up \nuntil now the administration's voice has been all too quiet and all too \nsilent. We hope tonight's speech indicates a large change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there have been a lot of representations \nmade on the floor today by Members of the other side of the aisle \nrelative to funding and lack of funding. It is interesting because, as \nwe went through the last budget exercise in the Senate last week, when \nthe appropriations bills were passed, we heard from the other side that \nthey needed more and more money. And although the President tried to \nhold the line on fiscal discipline by setting a number of $750 billion \nof discretionary spending, which was the agreed-to amount signed off on \nby the Senator from West Virginia and members of the Democratic Party \nback when they controlled the Senate in the last Congress, suddenly we \nfound that money was not enough.\n  There was over a half a trillion dollars of new spending proposed \nfrom the other side of the aisle that was not offset, not paid for, \nthat would have been put on top of the spending which the President had \ncommitted to. That irresponsible explosion in proposals in spending is \nan example of the lack of discipline which we are seeing in the area of \nfiscal policy from the other side of the aisle.\n  It has to be put in the context not only of the fact that it is an \nexplosive attempt to expand the Federal deficit through new spending, \nbut also in the context of the fact that this President has made \nstronger commitments in the area of education and national defense than \nany President in recent times and certainly than the President who \npreceded him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  It is very hard for me to understand how with a straight face, \nMembers from the other side of the aisle can come down here and attack \nthis President for failing to fund education. When we look at what this \nPresident has done in the area of funding education, we need to look at \nsome pretty simple and obvious charts. In his first year, President \nBush increased funding for education over President Clinton's budget by \n$20 billion. That is $20 billion of new money this President put \ndirectly into education in his first year as President.\n  An example of that commitment was in the area of special education, \nwhere President Clinton basically zero funded, relative to increases, \nthe issue of special education, while President Bush dramatically \nincreased it, by $1 billion a year, year in and year out, since he has \nbeen President the first 3 years--$1 billion each year, so that he has \nradically increased funding for special education.\n  It is pretty hard for the other side to come down here and make the \nrepresentation that this President has not significantly increased \nfunding. In fact, if you look at the spending this President has \ncommitted to funding and done in the context of fiscal responsibility, \nnot exploding the budget with spending as was proposed from the other \nside of the aisle when they proposed over half a trillion dollars of \nnew spending last week without offsets, this President, in the area of \neducation, has increased funding by $2.5 billion in the area of title \nI, for example, in his first 2 years in office. That is a greater \nincrease, by 25 percent, than President Clinton gave in his 7 years in \noffice. So the commitment for funding for education has been dramatic.\n  We heard earlier that the President hasn't funded up to the \nauthorization levels. That is not unusual in this Congress or in this \nGovernment not to fund to the authorization levels. I will point out \nthat if you are going to compare funding up to the authorization levels \nof this Presidency versus President Clinton, under President Clinton's \nPresidency, the gap between funding, the difference between funding to \nappropriation levels and authorization levels was about twice what this \nPresident's gap is in that area. President Bush has done even a better \njob in coming close to funding at authorization levels than President \nClinton did.\n  It is really inconsistent and a touch hypocritical to come down here \nand attack President Bush for failing to fund education when, in fact, \nhe has done more to fund education than any President in recent times \nand certainly dramatically more than his predecessor during a time when \nthe Democratic Party controlled both the Senate and the Presidency.\n  There have been other representations that he has not funded \nadequately homeland security. That is an incredible representation. \nWhen I hear the Senator from New York come down here and say that \nhomeland security has not been adequately funded, when you think of the \nbillions, tens of billions of dollars the Congress has voted to assist \nthe City of New York, very appropriately, under the leadership of this \nPresident, I find it difficult to understand how that argument can be \nmade.\n  If you look at the funding in the area of the FBI, we have heard this \nrepresentation: This number of agencies is going to have to be cut.\n  That is a total fabrication. FBI funding under this President has \ngone up every year. It is going up significantly this year. It went up \nsignificantly last year. And more agents are being added. The same is \ntrue of the INS, the same is true of the Marshals Service, of DEA. All \nof these accounts come under the jurisdiction of a committee which I \nhad the good fortune to be ranking member of and now am chairman of, \nthe Commerce, State, Justice Committee. The representation that we are \nactually reducing manpower or reducing the accounts in these areas is \nsimply wrong. It is inaccurate, and it is a gross misstatement. It \nshould not be made on the floor of the Senate because people should \nknow the facts before they come down here and make these \nrepresentations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1658-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1658-S1661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a most interesting discussion we \nare having. I guess two and two equals five here in the Senate. We are \ntold repeatedly that this Senate and Congress should increase defense \nspending, and it does; increase spending on homeland security, and it \ndoes. And then cut other domestic discretionary spending. But now we \nare told, we don't really cut other domestic discretionary spending.\n  The President apparently wants to increase defense spending, increase \nhomeland security spending, increase other spending, and then have tax \ncuts, as if somehow that all adds up. I don't know where you get that \nkind of schooling. Does two and two equal five? I don't think so.\n  Either there are cuts in domestic discretionary spending or there are \nno cuts. We all know the truth. I will bring charts down here and talk \nabout these areas of the Government where they will be spending less \nthis year than they did last year. With respect to homeland security, I \nwonder if my colleagues really make the case that the President has not \nin any way ignored the needs of homeland security when in fact we \nappropriated $2.5 billion for homeland security that the President \nwould not spend, in spite of the fact that, for example, with port \nsecurity, that is the security of America's seaports, we have 5.7 \nmillion containers coming in every year to the seaports, and 100,000 of \nthem are inspected and 5.6 million are not.\n  Everyone in this country understands, all law enforcement \nunderstands, that that is a very difficult problem. The homeland \nsecurity issue with respect to seaports is a very serious issue. It is \nunaddressed.\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\n  It is interesting to come here and listen to this, but there are \neither cuts in spending or there are not. We will have some discussion \nabout that in the future. Let me talk about a couple of other things, \nif I might.\n  We are going to hear the State of the Union speech tonight. The fact \nis, I want this President to succeed. I want this country to succeed. I \nwish no ill will towards anyone because of partisanship. We are of \ndifferent parties, but we serve the same interest. We serve the common \ninterest of this country. All of us want this President to succeed, \nwant his administration to succeed, and we want this country to do \nwell.\n  But I want to tell you, there are some days when I wonder about what \nis going on around here. Today is one of those days. I don't know when \nin all the years I have served in the House and Senate that I have been \nmore disturbed than I was in reading this article I will describe. It \nappeared in yesterday's Washington Times. A similar story ran in the \nLos Angeles Times the day before yesterday.\n  Let me read the first paragraph:\n\n       Top White House officials warned yesterday the Bush \n     administration has not ruled out using nuclear weapons \n     against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if he deploys weapons \n     of mass destruction against the United States.\n\n  Now, I don't understand this at all. We are told in the Los Angeles \nTimes, and in this story, that they are talking about using designer \nbunker buster nuclear weapons, something that has been discussed \npreviously in the administration. Do you know that India and Pakistan \nwere shooting at each other yesterday over Kashmir? Both of them have \nnuclear weapons, and the leadership of this country must be exhorted to \ntell these countries you cannot use the nuclear option? We are the \ncountry that must exercise restraint.\n  We have people in this administration who, in my judgment, make the \nmost reckless, dangerous statements I have heard in some 2 decades in \nthis town when they talk about the potential of using nuclear weapons. \nThat is not what this country ought to be talking about. There are some \n30,000 nuclear weapons, give or take a couple thousand, that exist on \nthis Earth. It ought to be our responsibility to try to make sure that \nnever again is a nuclear weapon exploded in anger on the face of this \nEarth. If one, just one, is exploded, others will explode. This country \nought not talk about the use of nuclear weapons. We ought not be \nreckless to talk about designing a new type of bunker buster nuclear \nweapon. This lowers the threshold of other countries who aspire to \nhaving nuclear weapons about when they might consider using them. It is \nreckless, dangerous, and irresponsible. I cannot believe I am reading \nthis sort of thing. The nuclear option in Iraq--the L.A. Times says:\n\n       The United States has lowered the bar for using the \n     ultimate weapon. The United States is thinking about the \n     unthinkable, preparing for the possible use of nuclear \n     weapons against Iraq.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 27, 2003]\n\n            Administration Won't Bar Use of Nuclear Weapons\n\n                           (By Ellen Sorokin)\n\n       Two top White House officials warned yesterday the Bush \n     administration has not ruled out using nuclear weapons \n     against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if he deploys weapons \n     of mass destruction against the United States or its allies.\n       White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. said on \n     Sunday morning talk shows that the United States will use \n     ``whatever means necessary'' to protect its citizens and the \n     world from a ``holocaust.''\n       ``I'm not going to put anything on the table or off the \n     table,'' Mr. Card said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``But we \n     have a responsibility to make sure Saddam Hussein and his \n     generals do not use weapons of mass destruction.''\n       Dan Bartlett, White House communications director, echoed \n     Mr. Card's sentiments.\n       ``What is clear--and the message that President Bush has \n     sent unequivocally--is that if the Iraqi regime, if Saddam \n     Hussein and his generals decide for one second to use weapons \n     of mass destruction against allied forces of the United \n     States of America and our allies, we will make sure it \n     doesn't happen,'' Mr. Bartlett said on CNN's ``Late \n     Edition.''\n       Their comments came two days after an article published in \n     the Los Angeles Times claimed the United States was \n     considering using nuclear weapons in a possible war against \n     Iraq to destroy underground command posts and stop Iraqi \n     forces from using weapons of mass destruction.\n       The story cited top U.S. private military expert William M. \n     Arkin. According to the story, he said plans for using \n     nuclear weapons against Iraq were being fleshed out at the \n     U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, Neb., at the Pentagon and at \n     an ``undisclosed location'' in Pennsylvania where Vice \n     President Richard B. Cheney spent time during terrorism \n     alerts.\n       Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld signed in December \n     2001 a classified nuclear posture review that opened the \n     possibility for nuclear weapons to be used against targets \n     able to withstand most non-nuclear attacks. Countries such as \n     Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya and Syria were added to the \n     list of possible targets.\n       Defense Department spokesman Maj. Ted Wadsworth refused to \n     confirm or deny the report, saying: ``That's something that \n     policy-makers have to talk about.''\n       Yesterday, several lawmakers and policy analysts said they \n     hoped the administration would not resort to using nuclear \n     weapons to deal with the situation in Iraq.\n       Sen. Richard G. Lugar, Indiana Republican and chairman of \n     the Foreign Relations Committee, said he hasn't heard any \n     discussion on using nuclear weapons on Iraq.\n       ``Our policy is negotiation,'' Mr. Lugar told ``Late \n     Edition.'' ``[Secretary of State Colin L.] Powell at the \n     United Nations, bringing together the U.N., trying to get \n     Saddam to declare, hoping the inspectors against hope will \n     find something. All we're saying . . . Saddam has to realize \n     he will be disarmed. He doesn't understand that. I don't \n     think he believes it. And that's the critical point.''\n       Sen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat and a member of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee, said the real test of the \n     country's leadership is bringing the world together and \n     resolving the issues in a way that results with the least \n     loss of life.\n       ``It's very chilling to talk about first use of nuclear \n     weapons,'' Mrs. Boxer said on ``Late Edition.''\n       ``And I wish we didn't go down the path. The whole world \n     knows that we are the superpower, we are for sure the only \n     superpower, we have an arsenal that could destroy every man, \n     woman and child in the world 10 times over. We don't have to \n     go around beating the drums of war,'' she said.\n       Pentagon adviser Richard Perle said on ``Fox News Sunday'' \n     he couldn't think of a ``target of interest'' in a conflict \n     with Iraq that couldn't be addressed with non-nuclear \n     weapons.\n       ``We have extraordinary military technology, weapons of \n     great precision that have the enormous benefit of destroying \n     the target almost all of the time without doing unintended \n     damage to civilians,'' said Mr. Perle, a resident fellow at \n     the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public \n     Policy Research in Washington.\n       ``I can't see why we would wish to use a nuclear weapon,'' \n     he said.\n       Several lawmakers said they would first want Mr. Bush to \n     present evidence as to why military force against Iraq is \n     needed.\n       Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, South Dakota Democrat, \n     said Mr. Bush has yet to make a ``compelling case'' that \n     military force against Iraq is necessary right now.\n       ``He hasn't done that,'' Mr. Daschle said on CBS' ``Face \n     the Nation.''\n       ``The President needs to make a compelling case that Iraq \n     poses a very imminent threat to the United States and, \n     secondly, that he has worked through the international \n     community and exhausted all other options. Only if those two \n     criteria are met does he have the authority, the license to \n     take military action.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope those who are in closed rooms \nthinking in this kind of a dangerous way are not part of the Government \nfor long, or part of this administration for long. That is not what we \nought to be doing in this country.\n  Let me describe one other piece of information about this issue of \nforeign policy. One year ago in the State of the Union Address, the \nPresident said--correctly, in my judgment--that the greatest threat to \nthis country is the network of terrorists around the globe that wish \nthis country harm. They are the ones who murdered thousands of innocent \nAmericans. One year ago now, I was in Afghanistan. Flying into that \ncountry over the mountains, you looked down and you understood that \ndeep inside caves in the mountains were Osama bin Laden and his key \nplanners, planning the murder of innocent Americans. That network of \nterrorists and others around the world represent a serious threat to \nthis country.\n  But we have not heard about Osama bin Laden for a long while. I read \nyesterday that the President himself mentioned Osama bin Laden six \ntimes in the last year. It appears that these days it is ``Osama been \nforgotten,'' rather than Osama bin Laden.\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\n  Osama bin Laden is a very serious threat to this country. He is \napparently alive, according to our intelligence services. His chief \ndeputy has not been found. Key leadership of the al-Qaida has not been \ndiscovered. The head of the CIA says we are at as great a risk today \nfor terrorism as we were the day before September 11. It is now Iraq, \nall Iraq, all the time.\n  But the President was right last year. This country, in my judgment, \nsuffers grave danger from the acts of terrorists who are still there, \nstill active, and still wish to harm this country and kill innocent \nAmericans.\n  My hope is that we could have some balance in the concerns we express \nabout what is going on around the world between North Korea, Iraq, al-\nQaida, and more.\n  Mr. President, I assume President Bush will talk a great deal about \nforeign policy tonight, but I think he will also talk about economic \npolicy.\n  Saddam Hussein is a bad, evil guy, no question about that. North \nKorea is a threat. Terrorists, especially, are a very serious \ncontinuing threat. All of that, to be sure, exists. It is also the case \nthat here at home we have an economy that is not doing very well. A \ngreat many people are out of work. Some people say, well, let's brush \nall that aside, things are just fine. They are not fine. The \nadministration, for some while, has said this is just fine. The economy \nhas hit a little speed bump, I think they called it, but things will be \nfine.\n  In the last 2 months, the administration fired their economic team, \nbrought in some new people, and now they are saying we need a stimulus \nprogram, despite what they have provided us is not a stimulus at all. \nIt will provide no jump start to the economy. If that is what we want, \nthis is like hooking a flashlight battery to a car and hoping to start \nit. It will not work.\n  The question for all of us is: What will really work to give this \neconomy some boost? First and foremost, part of what is weighing down \non the neck of this economy is every morning every American wakes up \nand tunes in the news and the top story every day, every month, is the \npotential of war. That means unpredictability, uncertainty, and great \nconcern. When that exists, the American people don't have the \nconfidence in the future that we need. Confidence is what this economy \nis about. Our economic foundation is confidence by the American \npeople. When they are confident, they do things that manifest that \nconfidence. They take a trip, buy a car, buy a home, make a purchase, \nand the country expands. That is the expansionary side of the business \ncycle. When they are not confident about the future, they do the exact \nopposite. They defer the trip, don't buy the car, don't make the \npurchase, and the economy then contracts.\n\n  First and foremost, people are concerned about this talk every day, \nevery week, every month regarding the specter of war. We have to find a \nway to move through this period and give people confidence about the \nfuture. But the economy also needs a boost, a fiscal policy that gives \nit a boost, a jump start.\n  The principles are very simple. They have nothing at all to do with \nwhat the President suggested. The principles are that a jump start of \nthe economy ought to be immediate, temporary, and effective. I regret \nto say that the President proposes none of that. I wish he would have \nproposed something that was consistent with those principles. I would \nsay sign me up, I am for it. But that is not the case.\n  We have lost a great many jobs--2.4 million private sector jobs--\nsince President Bush took over. Now, it is not the role of Government \nto create jobs. That is not what Government does. The private sector \nand businesses create jobs. But the Government creates conditions under \nwhich jobs are created, economic conditions in which the economy \nexpands or contracts. When it contracts, people lay their employees \noff, entrepreneurs and businesses lay off employees because they don't \nsee a better future. When the economy expands, people are hired and \nmore people are put to work as employees.\n  The fact is that, at the moment, we have exploding deficits, high \nunemployment, a lack of confidence in the future, and we need, it seems \nto me--all of us--to be serious about what we do in putting the economy \nback on track. We are finally talking about ``how'' rather than \n``whether.'' Three months ago, the question was ``whether.'' The \nPresident's economic team was saying that things are fine. We are all \nsaying they are not fine, we have to fix what is wrong with the \neconomy, and the sooner the better.\n  My hope is that this evening the President will recognize all of us \nwant to work with him on national economic policy and on foreign \npolicy. It is very important that we do the right thing. The \nPresident's plan, regrettably, is not near the right thing for what \nails this economy.\n  Providing exemptions for dividend payments, the bulk of which are \nowned by upper income people, the wealthiest Americans, and borrowing \nmoney to do it so we can have tax cuts for 10 years into the future of \n$670 billion makes no sense at all.\n  If someone were to say let's have a debate on reforming the tax \nsystem, we could debate all of these things, but if we are talking \nabout how to stimulate this economy, how to jump-start the American \neconomy, the President has provided exactly the wrong set of \nrecommendations. They are not immediate, temporary or effective. He \nwill be stuck, we will be stuck, and the American people will be stuck \nwith an economy that is sluggish and is not doing what it needs to do \nto expand and help businesses create jobs. That is not what I want. It \nis not what any of my colleagues want. We had an economy that works, \none that gave hope and opportunity to the American people, and we want \nthat back.\n  I am going to come to the Chamber in the next couple of days and show \nsome charts. I was going to show them today. The Office of Management \nand Budget, which tells us how the economy is doing, is so wildly off \nthe mark they might as well be throwing darts at some chart to find out \nwhat the surplus, deficit, and fiscal policy ought to be. They predict, \nand promise from time to time, that the fiscal condition of this \ncountry is going to be incredibly good with big surpluses. Then a few \nmonths later, they say it is going to be an economy in big trouble and \nbig deficits. It seems to me one could probably get as close as they \nare getting by throwing darts at a board. We really need a plan that \nworks, one that is predictable, one we can count on, one that restores \neconomic health to this country and puts the economy back on track.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator explain what this chart means?\n  Mr. DORGAN. This chart shows the predictions of the Office of \nManagement and Budget. In the year 2002, they predicted we would have a \n$283 billion surplus.\n  Mr. REID. How did that turn out?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It turned out we had a $159 billion deficit.\n  Mr. REID. How far were they off? It is $283 billion, plus $159 \nbillion, that's how far they were off?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is very good. They were off over $400 billion. For \n2003 they said we were going to have a $41 billion surplus. Now we are \ngoing to have over a $300 billion surplus.\n  Mr. REID. That is easy: $341 billion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is right. The Senator took advanced math in \nSearchlight, NV, I can see.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend, wouldn't this $300 billion surplus \nthat is the revised estimate be one of the largest deficits in more \nthan 2 decades?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, absolutely.\n  Now we have some people saying deficits really are not so bad. Where \ndid that start? It seems to me if children are saddled with the debt \nfrom our spending, or our tax cuts, the kids are being told, by the \nway, here is our policy and you pay for it.\n  Is that good or bad? Where I come from, that is not the kind of value \nsystem that one wants to express in fiscal policy.\n\n  I am going to have more to say on this, but this is not the time. I \nknow we want to be out soon and the President is going to be giving his \nState of the Union Address this evening.\n  I want to make the point that both in foreign policy and fiscal \npolicy, this country is significantly challenged. These are very tricky \ntimes. It requires a very steady hand and good policies.\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\n  Let me finish where I started. I am very concerned about people, on \nthe eve of a State of the Union Address by a President of the United \nStates, talking about the potential use of nuclear weapons by our \ncountry. I cannot believe that is what is happening. Just after India \nand Pakistan, who possess nuclear weapons and do not like each other \nmuch, have been shooting at each other, this country is saying, by the \nway, there might be circumstances in which we could use nuclear \nweapons. Whoever these two top White House officials are who said this, \nshame on them.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader is not in the Chamber to close the \nSenate, and I have a couple of questions I would like to ask. Mitch \nDaniels, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, said on \nJanuary 16 this year we ought not to hyperventilate about this new \ndeficit estimate. Are you aware that the Senate majority leader said on \nJanuary 5, 1996: ``We have a moral obligation to balance the budget; I \nam very hopeful that we are going to see to that''? Are you aware he \nsaid that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is not surprising. I think the value system for most \nof us has been we ought to try to have fiscal responsibility and \nbalance the budget.\n  I say to the head of the Office of Management and Budget, he ought to \nstart hyperventilating. If he does not hyperventilate over this, I \nguess there is nothing that gets his heart rate or breathing up.\n  When we talk about the issue of projected surpluses and then huge, \nsuffocating budget deficits as far out as the eye can see, one better \nhyperventilate a little bit about that.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that on February 1, 1998, the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire said: ``As long as we have a Republican \nCongress we are going to have a balanced budget, and if we can get a \nRepublican President we can start paying down the debt on the Federal \nGovernment''?\n  That really has not proven to be true, has it?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is not true that we have at this point a balanced \nbudget. What is true is the budget is seriously out of balance and \nheaded south. It is going to get worse and we need to fix it. Ignoring \nit is not going to solve the problem. We need to jump-start this \neconomy with something that is effective and that is a stimulus plan of \nsome type that gives something to the American people to work with, and \ngives them some confidence.\n  I happen to believe that Senator Daschle, myself, and others who have \ntalked about rebates make a lot of sense. Incentivizing consumption in \nthe short term and incentivizing business investment in the short term, \nin an immediate and temporary way, is what I think will give some boost \nto this American economy.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that on November 15, 1995, the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, now a part of the Senate leadership in the \nmajority, said: ``The American people are sick and tired of excuses for \ninaction to balance the budget. The public wants us to stay the course \ntoward a balanced budget, and we take that obligation quite \nseriously''?\n\n  That really is not the way it is. Is it not true that during the last \n4 years of the Clinton administration we spent less money than we took \nin?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true we had a surplus?\n  Mr. DORGAN. We had very significant and increasing surpluses in the \nFederal budget. As a result of those surpluses, we began to actually \neliminate Federal indebtedness, which relieved some of that burden off \nthe shoulders of our children and their children.\n  Mr. REID. Is it not true we were even warned the last year of the \nClinton administration to be careful, the debt is being paid down too \nquickly, slow it down or it may have some short-term impact on the \neconomy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is true is when we got to a new fiscal policy \nproposal by the administration, they said let's cut $1.7 trillion in \ntaxes because we have surpluses as far as the eye can see. Some of us \nsaid--I certainly did--maybe we ought to be a little bit conservative. \nWhat if we do not have surpluses forever? What if we run into some \ntough times? What if the economy runs into trouble? Then guess what \nhappened. Without my vote, Congress passed a very large, permanent tax \ncut. We quickly discovered we were in a recession. Then we had a \nterrorist attack on September 11. Then we had a war on terrorism. Then \nwe had the largest corporate scandals in history. All of this happened, \nit seems to me, suggesting that perhaps some of us who urged caution \nwere right, because what happened is those big budget surpluses are now \nvery big budget deficits.\n  What does the President say we ought to do about that? Let's provide \nmore 10-year tax cuts to the tune of $670 billion. When interest is \nadded to it, it is going to be over $1 trillion. None of that adds up.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that on February 6, 1997, the senior \nSenator from Nebraska said: ``The real threat to Social Security is the \nnational debt. If we do not act to balance the budget and stop adding \nto the debt, then we are truly placing the future of Social Security in \njeopardy''? These huge deficits that have been accumulated during the \nlast 2 years of this administration--the first 2 years, I should say, \nof this administration, the last 2 years--certainly that is not good \nfor Social Security. Senator Hagel is right, is that not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. What these deficits do is they injure the Social Security \nsystem, and the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. There \nis no question about that. We have a lot riding on putting this economy \nback on track. The sooner the better. I think what the President and \nthe Congress need to do is find a way to work together to do something \nthat is effective right now.\n  Let me thank the Senator from Nevada for his questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1661-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 224\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, there are two recent developments in \nCambodia deserving of the Senate's attention.\n  First, voter registration for parliamentary elections in July, which \nis ongoing throughout that country over the next month, is being \nundermined by the ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP. In complete \ncontrol of the national and local election machinery, the CPP is making \nit difficult for opposition activists and supporters to register to \nvote and is creating a climate of fear that only bolsters the status \nquo.\n  While I am pleased the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and the royalist \nFUNCINPEC party have publicly complained of CPP interference and \nmanipulation, I am deeply troubled by the relative silence of the \ninternational community in condemning these pre-election abuses.\n  Unless the complacent donor community aggressively checks CPP's \nmanipulation in the preparation of these polls, the outcome of the \nelections will be a foregone conclusion even before the first vote is \ncast.\n  Second, recent comments by CPP hardliner and Prime Minister Hun Sen \nshould be of grave concern to all donor nations, and democracy \nactivists throughout Cambodia. On January 14, 2003, Hun Sen said: ``I \nwould like to announce to all the political parties to be very careful. \nIf you would like to break Hun Sen's party, or the CPP, you might miss \nthe opportunity to work on your own internal affairs. And as usual, Hun \nSen would beat up and destroy the head of the engine. Meaning, I never \nbeat up unimportant person but completely destroy the main engine. If \nyou would like to play this game, I would be more than happy to \naccompany you. And I will use my last resort if that is what it takes. \n. . .''\n  This public threat betrays Hun Sen's total commitment to harassment, \nintimidation, and violence as a means of maintaining his rule.\n  Hun Sen's dark character was further revealed when he continued: ``I \nassure you that I have all the means to get the information from you \n[opposition political parties]. If you have the meeting in the morning, \nthe information will come to me in the afternoon. Except if you kill \nall the people in your own party like Pol Pot, then the information \nwill not reach Hun Sen. Everywhere there are Hun Sen's men. Don't \nforget that I am the head of an undercover agency. I would like my \ncapabilities to be known to the world. The CIA [Central Intelligence \nAgency] is American, but we are the Cambodian Intelligence Agency \n(CIA).''\n  Through his own words, and by his own admission, Hun Sen has shown \nhimself to be nothing less than a paranoid evil dictator. His tough \ntalk is unimpressive and only underscores his complicity in the \nnumerous corrupt and violent episodes of Cambodia's more recent past, \nincluding illegal logging and the ongoing harassment of Global Witness, \nthe killing of opposition activists, the banning of Voice of America \nrebroadcasts by the Beehive radio station, the March 1997 grenade \nattack against the Khmer Nation Party, and the July 1997 coup d'etat.\n  Let me be very clear to the State Department, the World Bank, and \nother international financial institutions: the failure to hold Prime \nMinister Hun Sen and the CPP accountable for their repressive actions \nand abuses, including in the ongoing harassment of Global Witness, will \nhave funding ramifications in the fiscal year 2004 foreign operations \nbill.\n  I want to assure the people of Cambodia that many of us in the \nCongress will continue to follow political developments in Cambodia. We \nknow that you want change, and the stability that comes from a nation \nrooted in the rule of law. And we know that the CPP cannot provide \nthis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1662-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EXTENSION OF THE RURAL ADD-ON PAYMENT FOR HOME HEALTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Bond, I \nwant to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee for agreeing to include a 6 month \nextension of the add-on payment for rural home health services in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. Extension of this add-on payment, which \ncurrently is scheduled to sunset on April 1 will help to ensure that \nMedicare patients in rural areas continue to have access to the home \nhealth services that they need.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled, and often technically \ncomplex, services that our Nation's home health agencies provide have \nenabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older persons to \navoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be, \nin the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural \nareas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the \nextra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, \nhigher transportation expenses, and other factors.\n  Rural agencies also experience higher costs relative to productivity. \nBecause of the longer travel times and distances between patients, \nrural caregivers are unable to perform as many visits in a day as their \nurban counterparts. Saundra Scott-Adams, the executive director of the \nVisiting Nurses of Aroostook in Aroostook County, ME, where I am from, \ntells me her agency covers 6,600 square miles with a population of only \n72,000. Her costs are understandably much higher and her staff \nproductivity much lower than the average due to the long distances her \nstaff must cover to see patients.\n  Moreover, agencies in rural areas are frequently smaller than their \nurban counterparts, which means their relative costs are higher due to \nsmaller scale operations. Smaller agencies with fewer patients and \nfewer visits means that fixed costs, particularly those associated with \nmeeting regulatory requirements, are spread over a smaller number of \npatients and visits, increasing overall per-patient and per-visit \ncosts.\n  If the rural add-on payment is eliminated on April 1, it will only \nput more pressure on rural home health agencies that are already \nstruggling and could force more of these agencies to close. Many \nagencies operating in rural areas are the only home health providers in \na vast geographic area. If any of these agencies are forced to close, \nthe Medicare patients in that region will lose complete access to home \nhealth care.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, met earlier this \nweek and voted unanimously to extend for 1 year the add-on payments for \nrural home health services at 5 percent. Our provision is consistent \nwith the MedPAC's recommendation and will extend the expiring provision \nthrough September 30. This will give the Finance Committee time to \nconsider whether this add-on payment should be extended further.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues for their assistance, and I look \nforward to working with them on this and other issues of importance to \nthe health of rural Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1662-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1662-S1663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HONORING MISS DAISY ROSE BECK\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

She retired from the U.S. Federal Service \nin 1995 after serving America for 54 consecutive years. She holds the \nrecord for length of employment as a female GS-level employee.\n  From the early 1960s through 1995, her duties included personal \nsecretary for the four-star U.S. army generals who pulled tours of duty \nin the Republic of Korea, commanding the United Nations Command, ROK/\nU.S. Combined Forces Command, U.S. Forces Korea and the 8th U.S. Army. \nIn addition, she was one of the workers at the German War Crimes Trial \nat Nuremberg.\n  Daisy Rose Beck was very quiet, friendly, efficient, respectful, and \nvery much loved by all who met her. Daisy served for decades in places \nwhere most Americans only served a single year. She is a true American, \nhard working, efficient, intelligent, courteous, kind, and yet focused \nand dedicated to the success of a mission.\n  These days we face harsh enemies around the globe. We Americans have \na proud tradition of doing what is right\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nwith fairness, kindness, and courage. Daisy Beck epitomizes these \nqualities.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \noutstanding citizen of the great State of Alabama, Miss Scarlotte \nDeupree.\n  Scarlotte may be a young woman, but her accomplishments are numerous \nand exceptional. Her most recent achievement was receiving the very \ndistinguished honor of being First Runner Up to Miss America for 2003. \nThis honor bears important functions, including representing and \nadvocating good American values, which is a fundamental part of the \nMiss America Pageant. These young women choose platforms, or issues, \nimportant to our society and use their stature to help raise awareness \nand bring positive changes to these areas. Before entering the Miss \nAmerica Pageant, Scarlotte knew that her platform would be adult \nliteracy, an issue she has worked with for many years.\n  Scarlotte has devoted a great amount of her time to helping others \nand raising the public's awareness of adult literacy. Included in \nScarlotte's work are her efforts in forming the Sylacauga Adult \nLiteracy Council, her coordination of the first Women in Literacy \nSummit, as well as her work with the Literacy Council of Central \nAlabama, ALERT, Habitat for Humanity, and the Ronald McDonald House. In \naddition, Ms. Deupree helped spearhead the Literacy Awareness Week for \nthe cities of Homewood and Athens, AL.\n  For her great work, Ms. Deupree has been honored by the Daily Points \nof Light Foundation with the Daily Point of Light No. 660 Award. She \nalso received the Distinguished Partner Award by the Literacy Council \nof Central Alabama, the Miss Alabama Community Service Award, 1999 and \n2002, Miss America State Community Service Award, 2002, the U.S. \nPresidential Service Gold Award, 1999 and 2002, and she was voted \n``Most Ambitious'' by her student peers at Samford University.\n  Scarlotte also has a great record of accomplishment in other areas, \nincluding education. She completed high school at the top of her class \nat Sylacauga High School, where she was a member of the National Honor \nSociety, student council, Mu Alpha Theta Math Honor Society, Political \nAwareness Club, and the B.B. Comer Library Teen Advisory Board. She \nwent on to study English and journalism at Samford University, one of \nthe Nation's best liberal arts colleges. There she was a member of the \nSigma Tau Delta English Honor Fraternity, Samford University Honor's \nProgram, Freshman Forum, Alpha Delta Pi Social Sorority, and \nvolunteered as a Step Sing Consultant. In addition, she worked in my \nSenate office as an intern in the winter of 2000, a very busy time for \nour political system and country. She produced excellent work, received \nhigh marks from my staff, and contributed greatly to my office during \nher stay. I was very impressed with her.\n  She is an example of the great work our Nation's young people do. I \nam very proud of her and I know she will continue to give leadership to \nthe critical area of adult literacy and that she will be a leader in \nwhatever career she chooses. I applaud her tireless efforts on behalf \nof all Alabamians and would like to take this opportunity to thank her \nfor all that she has contributed to her community, the State of Alabama \nand our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing \nScarlotte Deupree for her outstanding achievements and wish her well as \nshe continues to work to improve literacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1663-2", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1663-3", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1663-4", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1663-S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION--PM 1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, \ndistinguished guests, fellow citizens:\n  Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state \nof the union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of \ndecisive days that lie ahead.\n  You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During \nthis session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs \nvital to our country . . . and we have the opportunity to save millions \nof lives abroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity \nthat is broadly shared . . . and we will answer every danger and every \nenemy that threatens the American people.\n  In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be \nconfident. In a whirlwind of change, and hope, and peril, our faith is \nsure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong.\n  This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not \nignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, other \nPresidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus, \nand clarity and courage.\n  During the last 2 years, we have seen what can be accomplished when \nwe work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we \nachieved historic education reform--which must now be carried out in \nevery school, and every classroom, so that every child in America can \nread, and learn, and succeed in life. To protect our country, we \nreorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To \nbring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief \nin a generation. To insist on integrity in American business, we passed \ntough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.\n  Some might call this a good record. I call it a good start. Tonight I \nask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our \nfellow citizens.\n  Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast \nenough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.\n  After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock \nmarket declines, our economy is recovering--yet it is not growing fast \nenough, or strongly enough. With unemployment rising, our Nation needs \nmore small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, \nmore employers to put up the sign that says, ``Help Wanted.''\n  Jobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when \nAmericans have more money to spend and invest; and the best, fairest \nway to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the \nfirst place.\n  I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and \n2006 be made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as \nsoon as I have signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up \nin workers' paychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage \npenalty, we should do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child \ncredit to a thousand dollars, we should send the checks to American \nfamilies now.\n  This tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes--and it will \nhelp our economy immediately. Ninety-two million Americans will keep--\nthis year--an average of almost $1,100 more of their own money. A \nfamily of four with an income of $40,000 would see their federal income \ntaxes fall from $1,178 to $45 per year. And our plan will improve the \nbottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.\n  You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and \npromised them for future years. If this tax\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nrelief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, \nit is even better for Americans today.\n  We also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our \ntax laws. It is fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to \nagain tax the shareholders on the same profits. To boost investor \nconfidence, and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive \ndividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of \ndividends.\n  Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. \nMore jobs mean more taxpayers--and higher revenues to our government. \nThe best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget \nis to encourage economic growth--and to show some spending discipline \nin Washington, D.C. We must work together to fund only our most \nimportant priorities. I will send you a budget that increases \ndiscretionary spending by 4 percent next year--about as much as the \naverage family's income is expected to grow. And that is a good \nbenchmark for us: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the \npaychecks of American families.\n  A growing economy, and a focus on essential priorities, will also be \ncrucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work \ntogether to keep social Security sound and reliable, we must offer \nyounger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they \nwill control and they will own.\n  Our second goal is high-quality, affordable health care for all \nAmericans.\n  The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation--\nwith a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet \nfor many people, medical care costs too much--and many have no coverage \nat all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health \ncare system that dictates coverage and rations care. Instead, we must \nwork toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance \npolicy . . . choose their own doctors . . . and seniors and low-income \nAmericans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats, and trial \nlawyers, and HMOs, we must put doctors, and nurses, and patients back \nin charge of American medicine.\n  Health care reform must begin with Medicare, because Medicare is the \nbinding commitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment \nby giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that \nare transforming health care in America.\n\n  Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep \ntheir coverage just the way it is. And just like you, the members of \nCongress, members of your staffs, and other federal employees, all \nseniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides \nprescription drugs. My budget will commit an additional $400 billion \nover the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both \npolitical parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare--I \nurge the members of this new Congress to act this year.\n  To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime \ncauses of higher costs--the constant threat that physicians and \nhospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation, \neverybody pays more for health care--and many parts of America are \nlosing fine doctors. No one has every been healed by a frivolous \nlawsuit--and I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.\n  Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, \nwhile dramatically improving the environment.\n  I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy \nefficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to \nproduce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation \nthat mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants over \nthe next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to \nhelp prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill \nwildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest.\n  I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our \nenvironment and our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial \nstep, and protect our environment in ways that generations before us \ncould not have imagined. In this century, the greatest environmental \nprogress will come about, not through endless lawsuits or command and \ncontrol regulations, but through technology and innovation. Tonight I \nam proposing $1.2 billion in research funding so that American can lead \nthe world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.\n  A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates \nenergy, which can be used to power a car--producing only water, not \nexhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and \nengineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory \nto showroom--so that the first car driven by a child born today could \nbe powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free. Join me in this important \ninnovation--to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much \nless dependent on foreign sources of energy.\n  Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest \nproblems of America. For so many in our country--the homeless, the \nfatherless, the addicted--the need is great. Yet there is power--\nwonder-working power--in the goodness, and idealism, and faith of the \nAmerican people.\n  Americans are doing the work of compassion every day--visiting \nprisoners, providing shelter to battered women, bringing companionship \nto lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise . . . they \ndeserve our personal support . . . and, when appropriate, they deserve \nthe assistance of our government. I urge you to pass both my faith-\nbased initiative and the Citizen Service Act--to encourage acts of \ncompassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a \ntime.\n  Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in USA \nFreedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers \nacross America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus \nthe spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of \nsome of our most vulnerable citizens--boys and girls trying to grow up \nwithout guidance and attention . . . and children who have to go \nthrough a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad. I propose \na $450 million initiative to bring mentors to more than a million \ndisadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners. \nGovernment will support the training and recruiting of mentors, yet it \nis the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one \nperson, can change a life forever--and I urge you to be that one \nperson.\n\n  Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds \nout friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the \nrichness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we \nare fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies, and reducing demand \nthrough anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted, \nthe fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives.\n  Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I \npropose a new $600 million program to help an additional 300,000 \nAmericans receive treatment over the next 3 years.\n  Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work, \nOne of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, \nLouisiana. A man in the program said, ``God does miracles in people's \nlives, and you never think it could be you.'' Tonight, let us bring to \nall Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: \nThe miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you.\n  By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and \nwomen who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society--a \nculture that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook \nthe weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of \nbirth, and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because no \nhuman life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I \nask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all \nhuman cloning.\n  The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America \nalso determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more \nthan our power and our interests. Our Founders dedicated this country \nto cause of human dignity--the rights of every person and the \npossibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to \nhelp the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nevil men. In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people . . \n. and we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their \nsociety, and educate all their children--boys and girls. In the Middle \nEast, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a \ndemocratic Palestine. Across the earth, America is feeding the hungry; \nmore than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the \npeople of the United States.\n  As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world \nsafer, we must also remember our calling, as a blessed country, to make \nthis world better. Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million \npeople have the AIDS virus--including three million children under the \nage of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-\nthird of the adult population carries the infection. More than four \nmillion require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, \nonly 50,000 AIDS victims--only 50,000--are receiving the medicine they \nneed.\n  Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do \nnot seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in \nrural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, ``We have no \nmedicines . . . many hospitals tell [people], `You've got AIDS. We \ncan't help you. Go home and die.' ''\n  In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear \nthose words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retrovial drugs can extend \nlife for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from \n$12,000 a year to under $300 a year--which places a tremendous \npossibility within our grasp.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater \nopportunity to do so much for so many. We have confronted, and will \ncontinue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe \nand urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief--a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to \nhelp the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent seven \nmillion new AIDS infections . . . treat at least two million people \nwith life-extending drugs . . . and provide humane care for millions of \npeople suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS. I ask \nthe Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5 years, including \nnearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the \nmost afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.\n  This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a \nplague of nature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting \nand defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism.\n  There are days when the American people do not hear news about the \nwar on terror. There is never a day when I do not learn of another \nthreat, or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order \nin this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes \non, and we are winning.\n  To date we have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key \ncommanders of al-Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics and \nfunding for the September 11th attacks . . . the chief of al-Qaida \noperations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our \nembassies in East Africa and the USS Cole . . . an al-Qaida operations \nchief from Southeast Asia . . . a former director of al-Qaida's \ntraining camps in Afghanistan . . . a key al-Qaida operative in Europe \n. . . and a major al-Qaida leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 \nsuspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. And many \nothers have met a different fate. They are no longer a problem for the \nUnited States and our friends and allies.\n  We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks. \nAmerica and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist \nconspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen . . . the American \nembassy in Singapore . . . a Saudi military base . . . and ships in the \nstraits of Hormuz, and the straits of Gibraltar. We have broken al-\nQaida cells in Hamburg, and Milan, and Madrid, and London, and Paris--\nas well as Buffalo, New York.\n  We have the terrorists on the run, and we are keeping them on the \nrun. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American \njustice.\n  As we fight this war, we will remember where it began--here, in our \nown country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to \nprotect our people and defend our homeland. We have intensified \nsecurity at the borders and ports of entry . . . posted more than \n50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports . . . begun \ninoculating troops and first responders against smallpox . . . and are \ndeploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect \nbiological attack. And this year, for the first time, we are beginning \nto field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles.\n  I thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight \nto add to our future security with a major research and production \neffort to guard our people against bio-terrorism, called Project \nBioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to \nquickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents \nlike anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that \nour enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before \nthe dangers are upon us.\n  Since September 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies \nhave worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists. \nThe FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and \ntransforming itself to meet new threats. And tonight, I am instructing \nthe leaders of the FBI, Central Intelligence, Homeland Security, and \nthe Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration \nCenter, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single \nlocation. Our government must have the very best information possible, \nand we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right \nplaces to protect our citizens.\n  Our war against terror is a contest of will, in which perseverance is \npower. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, \non a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew \nthat pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and \nwhatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence \nin the affairs of men--free people will set the course of history.\n  Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror . . . the gravest \ndanger facing America and the world . . . is outlaw regimes that seek \nand possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes \ncould use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They \ncould also give or sell those weapons to their terrorist allies, who \nwould use them without the least hesitation.\n  This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th \ncentury, small groups of men seized control of great nations . . . \nbuilt armies and arsenals . . . and set out to dominate the weak and \nintimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and \nmurder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, \nmilitarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by \nthe strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States \nof America. Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination \nhas appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. \nOnce again, this Nation and our friends are all that stand between a \nworld at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we \nare called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all \nmankind. And we accept this responsibility.\n  America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these \ndangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter, \nand stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We are strongly supporting \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and \ncontrol nuclear materials around the world. We are working with other \ngovernments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and \nto strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of \nmissile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.\n  In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to \nfollow a process--it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible \nthreats to the civilized world. All free nations have a stake in \npreventing sudden and catastrophic attack. We are asking them to join \nus, and many are doing so. Yet the\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\ncourse of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others. \nWhatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will \ndefend the freedom and security of the American people.\n  Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue \nto see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass \ndestruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking \nintimidation and death as they speak out for liberty, human rights, and \ndemocracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own \ngovernment, and determine their own destiny--and the United States \nsupports their aspirations to live in freedom.\n  On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living \nin fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied \non a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear \nweapons. We now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and \ndeveloping those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime \nis using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. \nAmerica and the world will not be blackmailed. America is working with \ncountries of the region--South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia--to find \na peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that \nnuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and \ncontinued hardship. The North Korean regime will find respect in the \nworld, and revival for its people, only when it turns away from its \nnuclear ambitions.\n\n  Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean \npeninsula, and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A \nbrutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression . . . with ties \nto terrorism . . . with great potential wealth . . . will not be \npermitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.\n  Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last \ncasualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed \nto disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he \nsystematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his \ncountry. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these \nweapons--not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized \nworld, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. \nAlmost 3 months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam \nHussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead his utter \ncontempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world.\n  The 108 U.N. weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger \nhunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The \njob of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It \nis up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons . . \n. lay those weapons out for the world to see . . . and destroy them as \ndirected. Nothing like this has happened.\n  The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had \nbiological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters \nof anthrax--enough doses to kill several million people. He has not \naccounted for that material. He has given no evidence that he has \ndestroyed it.\n  The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials \nsufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin--\nenough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. \nHe has not accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that \nhe has destroyed it.\n  Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the \nmaterials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX \nnerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents also could kill \nuntold thousands. He has not accounted for these materials. He has \ngiven no evidence that he has destroyed them.\n  U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 \nmunitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently \nturned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their \nexistence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of \nthese prohibited munitions. He has given no evidence that he has \ndestroyed them.\n  From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had \nseveral mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce \ngerm warfare agents, and can be moved from place to place to evade \ninspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has \ngiven no evidence that he has destroyed them.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that \nSaddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had \na design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different \nmethods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has \nlearned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of \nuranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has \nattempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear \nweapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these \nactivities. He clearly has much to hide.\n  The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is \ndeceiving. From intelligence sources, we know, for instance, that \nthousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and \nmaterials from the U.N. inspectors--sanitizing inspection sites, and \nmonitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the \ninspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. Iraq is blocking U-2 \nsurveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi \nintelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are \nsupposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi \nofficials on what to say. And intelligence sources indicate that Saddam \nHussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors \nin disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.\n  Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent \nenormous sums, taken great risks, to build and keep weapons of mass \ndestruction--but why? The only possible explanation, the only possible \nuse he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or \nattack. With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological \nweapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the \nMiddle East, and create deadly havoc in the region. And this Congress \nand the American people must recognize another threat. Evidence from \nintelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people \nnow in custody, reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects \nterrorists, including members of al-Qaida. Secretly, and without \nfingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, \nor help them develop their own.\n  Before September 11, 2001, many in the world believed that Saddam \nHussein could be contained. But chemical agents and lethal viruses and \nshadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 \nhijackers with other weapons, and other plans--this time armed by \nSaddam Hussein. It would take just one vial, one canister, one crate \nslipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have \never known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that day \nnever comes.\n  Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since \nwhen have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely \nputting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to \nfully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all \nrecriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and \nrestraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.\n  This dictator, who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, \nhas already used them on whole villages--leaving thousands of his own \ncitizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced \nconfessions are obtained--by torturing children while their parents are \nmade to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other \nmethods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning \nwith hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric \ndrills, cutting out tongues, and rape.\n  If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. And tonight I have a \nmessage for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not \nsurrounding your country--your enemy is ruling your country. And the \nday he and his\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\nregime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.\n  The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not \naccept a serious and mounting threat to our country, our friends, and \nour allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to \nconvene on February 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing \ndefiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present \ninformation and intelligence about Iraq's illegal weapons programs; its \nattempts to hide those weapons from inspectors; and its links to \nterrorist groups. We will consult, but let there be no \nmisunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the \nsafety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a \ncoalition to disarm him.\n  Tonight I also have a message for the men and women who will keep the \npeace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling \nin and near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lie ahead. In \nthose hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training \nhas prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, \nand America believes in you.\n  Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a \npresident can make. The technologies of war have changed. The risks and \nsuffering of war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, \nno victory is free from sorrow. This Nation fights reluctantly, because \nwe know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come.\n  We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be \ndefended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace \nat all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by \njust means--sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is \nforced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the \nUnited States military--and we will prevail. And as we and our \ncoalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi \npeople food, and medicines, and supplies . . . and freedom.\n  Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. \nIn 2 years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an \nawareness of peril . . . from bitter division in small matters to calm \nunity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this \ncall of history has come to the right country.\n  Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our \ntime. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the \nworld, and to ourselves.\n  America is a strong Nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. \nWe exercise power without conquest, and sacrifice for the liberty of \nstrangers.\n  Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of \nevery person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is \nnot America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.\n  We Americans have faith in ourselves--but not in ourselves alone. We \ndo not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in \nthem, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and \nall of history.\n  May He guide us now, and may God continue to bless the United States \nof America.\n  Thank you.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, January 28, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/01/28/senate-section/article/S1667-1", "month": "01", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:20 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to clarify the \nadjustments to be made in determining export price and constructed \nexport price; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber this morning, with a \nnumber of my colleagues, to discuss what is a critical issue in timber \ncountry across the United States, where men and women go to work every \nday in our sawmills only to find the mill has been shut down and the \nlights have been turned out.\n  As a result, that has been a problem which has grown for some time \nbecause of the Canadians, their style of production at this moment, and \nthe huge volume of timber they are pouring into this country. It is a \nmarket condition that will continue to shut down many of our mills, \nsome that will never turn on their lights again, some that will never \nagain employ men and women in the small towns where most of those mills \nare across the country.\n  Today, some of my colleagues and I are introducing legislation to \nwork cooperatively with the administration in trying to resolve this \nthrough negotiation. This legislation is being offered on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Baucus, Senator Crapo, my colleague from Idaho, who is \nin the Chamber, Senator Sessions, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, \nSenator Cochran, Senator Burns, and Senator Lincoln.\n  In introducing this legislation today, we are amending the Tariff Act \nof 1930 to clarify what is an appropriate deduction from the price of \nmerchandise. We believe the deduction of the countervailing duty should \nbe included in the calculation in determining whether or not and to \nwhat extent there have been sales dumped at less than fair market value \nin the United States.\n  Some time ago, we established a countervailing duty against Canadian \nproducts coming into this market. This is in response to that and the \nway it is calculated.\n  While the Department of Commerce has worked diligently on the \nsoftwood lumber case, the Canadian industry and Government continue to \neffectively avoid the countervailing duty and antidumping orders. The \nmost recent move by the Canadian Government to avoid the countervailing \nduty is to declare a significant region of interior British Columbia \nbug kill timber. This particular green lumber--or timber in this case--\nis being sold at salvage prices and has flooded the amount of available \ntimber already in the market.\n  The price for this timber is now as low as a dollar per thousand \nboard feet, while the competitive market value is over $100 per \nthousand board feet--in other words, on the stump at the time of the \nsale.\n  I remind my colleagues a majority of this determined bug kill has not \nyet been affected by bugs. It is simply a decision made by the Canadian \nGovernment in this instance. Yet they are selling it at prices that are \nas if it had been affected by disease.\n  Next, British Columbia has revised their forest practice code to \nreduce costs to the lumber manufacturers by decreasing forestry \nstandards and placing logging corporations in charge of\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\nenforcement actions. That is like the U.S. Forest Service turning to \nthe logging companies and saying the logging companies can enforce all \nof the environmental laws, as well as the laws under which we govern \nand manage our forests. We will turn that authority over to the logging \ncompanies.\n  What does this do to Canadian timber companies? It literally saves \nthem millions of dollars in operating expenses.\n  These recent and blatant moves by the Canadians reveal their true \ndesires to continue to flood the U.S. markets and their unwillingness \nto find a resolution that provides both security for U.S. and Canadian \njobs.\n\n  Our proposal specifies that countervailing duties are to be treated \nas a cost of production, a clarification of the Trade Act that all \nduties should be considered a cost of production incurred on shipments \nto the United States. The deduction of countervailing duty would assist \nin determining whether or not and to what extent there have been sales \ndumped at less than fair market value in the United States.\n  Dumping is when a company sells a product into the United States for \nless than its cost of production. The Department of Commerce currently \ndoes not consider countervailing duties, which offset subsidies, as a \ncost of production when calculating the amount of dumping and requisite \nantidumping duties. The Department's policy of ignoring countervailing \nduties when calculating antidumping duties undervalues the actual \namount of the dumping.\n  Fair value typically is the sales price of the merchandise in the \ncountry-of-origin market. The antidumping analysis compares fair value \nof a good from another country to the fair value of a good from the \nUnited States to determine if the good from another country was dumped \nat an unfair price in the U.S. market.\n  For example, in the U.S.-Canadian softwood lumber dispute, the \nDepartment of Commerce determined that the Canadian provinces subsidize \ntheir industry by providing lumber mills timber at prices that are 33 \nto 50 percent below market value. It also found that Canadian companies \nwere selling lumber in the United States at below their subsidized cost \nof production, requiring an antidumping duty of 8.79 percent.\n  The antidumping duty currently undervalues the Canadian dumping \npractices by comparing a subsidized cost of production to the price of \nlumber rather than comparing the cost of production plus the \ncountervailing duty to the price of lumber. It is all in the math, and \nin this kind of math it is quite obvious that Canadians are taking \ntremendous advantage of the marketplace. As I said earlier, the lights \nin the sawmills across America are going out.\n  Such a change in the Department's policy, we believe--those of us who \nhave authored this legislation--is consistent with the practices of the \nEuropean community and of Canada. It is time the Department of Commerce \ncorrect this accounting error, and it is time for the Canadian \nGovernment and their industry leaders to come to the table to negotiate \na free and fair market price for both U.S. and Canadian lumber \nproducts.\n  I believe this Congress will not tolerate the kind of dumping \nactivity that is going on in the market today, which appears to be at \nthis moment not only blatant but an attempt to grab even a larger \nmarket share in this country.\n  For years, I have worked on this issue, and I clearly recognize the \nimportance in the overall market of Canadian lumber in our market to \nmeet our housing demands, but to do so and to expand that market base \nat a cost to U.S. jobs and U.S. producers is not fair, nor is it \nbalanced. That is why we have introduced this legislation today.\n  Several other colleagues who are cosponsors in the legislation plan \nto come to the floor during this period of morning business to speak to \nthis issue. I am extremely pleased to be joined by Senator Baucus, \nSenator Lott, and Senator Snowe. I mention those three specifically \nbecause they are on the Finance Committee. This is legislation that \nwill be referred to the Finance Committee.\n  As my colleague from Idaho so clearly said, this is a simple \ncorrection in the law. It is a practice followed by other countries in \nEurope and Canada itself. Clearly, it would change the dynamics of how \nwe deal with Canada, but it would also show the Canadians that we are \nnot going to stand idly by and allow what is so blatant and so \nintentional in both the pricing of their stumpage and, therefore, the \ncost of entry into our market. Blatant dumping in the market for the \npurpose of gaining market share and putting some of our businesses out \nof business should not be tolerated.\n  We have all heard over the years the phrase ``mill town.'' It is so \ntrue today, still, in those areas of our country that are adjacent to \nprivate and public forests, that it is the sawmill that often is the \nlarger employer in the community, providing excellent jobs at high pay \nto the men and women who live within that community. When that mill \ngoes down and those citizens are out of work, there is no alternative, \nthere are no other jobs, or there are limited jobs in the community. \nThat community oftentimes is anywhere from 20 to 100 to 150 miles from \nthe next community.\n  So that wage earner oftentimes is faced with a very tough choice he \nor she may have to make. That is not just to go search for another job \nbut oftentimes to pick up their family and move from that small \ncommunity they had chosen to live in and to raise their families. Why? \nBecause a singular employee in this instance was either shut down or \nput out of business. Why? Because of predatory practices on the part of \nour friends to the north. And I say ``friends'' because I believe that. \nBut certainly in this segment of their economy, they are choosing to \nenter the most lucrative timber market in the world--ours--with a \nthriving, aggressive homebuilding industry and an economy in the \nhomebuilding industry that is very strong today, to supply that \nproduct.\n\n  I recognize the sheer demand for dimensional lumber in this market is \nmuch greater than both United States producers from private and public \nlands can supply, and Canadians can and have had and will have a \nsubstantial portion of our market. But now, to do so intentionally so \nthe big boys can get bigger in Canada, putting oftentimes out of \nbusiness the smaller producer here in the United States, is something \nwe should not stand idly by and tolerate.\n  Mr. President, I see I am being joined in the Chamber by my colleague \nfrom Mississippi. Senator Lott is a cosponsor of the legislation we \nhave just introduced dealing with the Tariff Act of 1930. Mississippi \nhas a thriving timber industry that is a major contributor to their \nState's economy, and especially to rural Mississippi's workforce. So I \nwill be happy to yield to Senator Lott for him to discuss this issue, \nof course, or any other issue he might wish to discuss.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a much-needed \nclarification of current trade law. Misinterpretation of the current \nlaw hurts hundreds of American companies and thousands of American \nworkers.\n  It is a misinterpretation that results in the understatement both of \nthe degree of foreign unfair trade and the amount of duties necessary \nto offset it.\n  The legislation Senator Craig and I are proposing would clarify that, \nin an antidumping proceeding, countervailing duties paid by a foreign \nseller should be deducted from the U.S. price.\n  This legislation would rectify the current understatement of unfair \ntrade and ensure that the true expenses of selling in the United States \nare recognized in the calculation of duties.\n  Now, I am here today because this issue is of particular importance \nto Montana's softwood lumber industry. For more than 20 years, I have \nstood beside our lumber industry as they have fought massive illegal \nsubsidies by the Canadian government.\n  All they are asking for is a level playing field.\n  Unfortunately for everyone, this process has been stuck in an endless \ncycle of litigation. I hope we can end that, and get to a place where \nthere is real market-based competition. But until we do, we must ensure \nthat our fair trade laws are as strong as possible.\n  We have countervailing duty laws that offset unfair foreign \nsubsidies. We also have antidumping laws that help ensure that foreign \nproducts are sold for a ``fair price'' in the United States,\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\na price that is comparable to the foreign price, and that reasonably \nreflects the cost of production.\n  But we can't make a fair comparison unless we factor in the cost of \ncountervailing duties. It's that simple. We are letting unfair traders \noff the hook.\n  And we're doing so simply because of a misinterpretation of current \nlaw by the Department of Commerce. There is no sensible policy or legal \nrationale for this practice.\n  And I would note here that adopting this legislation would make our \npractice consistent with the practices of Canada and the European \nUnion. For the life of me, I can't understand we wouldn't give our \ncompanies and workers trade laws that are as strong as those in the \ncountries we compete against. That is just common sense.\n  I would also emphasize that Commerce itself could fix this problem if \nit were so inclined. Commerce could, for example, announce in an \nongoing administrative review its intention to reconsider treatment of \ncountervailing duties as a cost. The Department has often used such \ncases as a means to review policy.\n  The current policy makes no sense. It violates the statute. It fails \nto redress continued dumping. And it effectively discourages \nnegotiations to end unfair trade.\n  Most importantly, correcting the current policy would force Canadian \nmills to make a clear choice, negotiate a long-term resolution or face \nhigher duties.\n  In the absence of a voluntary change in policy by Commerce, I offer \nthis legislation to clarify the statute.\n  This will ensure a fair comparison of prices and a more accurate \nmeasurement of the amount of dumping. It is just the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Craig for his leadership on \nthis issue, and also Senator Baucus and Senator Crapo, and a number of \nothers whose States are being severely impacted by very unfair Canadian \nsoftwood lumber practices.\n  Forestry is the second largest crop in my State of Mississippi and \nrepresents $1.25 billion annually. But what we are dealing with is the \ndumping of this Canadian softwood into our region of the country.\n  ``Dumping'' is when a company sells a product for less than the cost \nof production. But the Department of Commerce currently does not \nconsider countervailing duties, which offset subsidies, as a cost of \nproduction when evaluating and calculating the amount of dumping and \nthe requisite antidumping duties. The Department's policy of ignoring \nthese countervailing duties when calculating antidumping duties \nundervalues the amount of the dumping of the products.\n  Let me just say, I have been working on this issue actually for years \nnow. I have worked with the previous administration and have been \nworking with this administration. Our Customs officials have tried to \nbe helpful. And certainly the current Secretary of Commerce has been \npaying close attention to this issue, and I really appreciate it. But \nthere are limits to what they can do without additional legislation \nthat will make it clear how we will deal with these countervailing \nduties. So that is why this legislation has been introduced.\n  I think we must have had 8 or 10 Senators who met with the Secretary \nof Commerce and other officials of Commerce and discussed this problem \nand its continuing impact on this major industry in my State and in our \ncountry, and talked about the need to take some further actions to make \nsure we are properly evaluating the product that is being dumped in the \nUnited States.\n  The United States-Canada softwood lumber dispute is one that has been \ngoing on a long time. And it is clear from information we have that the \nCanadian provinces are subsidizing their industry by providing lumber \nmills timber at prices that are 33 to 50 percent below market value. \nOur Commerce Department has found that Canadian companies have been \nselling lumber in the United States but below their subsidized cost of \nproduction, requiring an antidumping duty of 8.79 percent. The fair \nmarket value calculation currently undervalues the Canadian dumping \npractices by comparing a subsidized cost of production to the cost of \nUnited States lumber rather than comparing the subsidized cost of \nproduction plus the countervailing duty to the cost of United States \nlumber.\n  That is what this legislation would do. It would correct this by \nspecifying that the CVD duties are to be treated as a cost of \nproduction, a clarification of U.S. statute section 19, U.S.C. 1677, \nwhich states that all duties should be considered a cost of production \nincurred on shipments to the United States. Such a change of Department \npolicy is consistent with practices in the European Union and, as a \nmatter of fact, of Canada.\n  The legislation, in my opinion, will have an immediate impact because \nwith the correction of this problem, then, the Canadian mills will face \nthe prospect of paying considerably higher antidumping rates if the \nlumber market remains at the current low level. So I think this is \nsomething we need to do.\n  I have met with Canadian officials, including the Prime Minister, the \nAmbassador, and Members of their Parliament. I had the impression that \nwhile they recognized this is an economic problem in the United States \nand unfair, they do not believe we are going to take the necessary \naction to really get a result. And they have been dragging it out now \nfor years.\n\n  I am going to meet with some Canadian Government officials even \ntomorrow. I am sure this issue will come up. But once they realize we \nare serious--I believe this administration, this Commerce Department is \nserious--we are not going to allow them to sell this product at below \nproduction of cost, and that we are also going to include in that \nfigure the cost figure, the countervailing duty orders, I think maybe \nthey will understand that we have to deal with this problem.\n  Even today, bug kill timber is being sold at salvage prices in the \ninterior of British Columbia, which has increased the amount of \navailable timber already on the market. The price for this timber is as \nlow as $1 per 1,000 board feet, when the competitive market value is \nover $100 per thousand board feet. That gives you some concept of the \ndisadvantage with which our American softwood lumber producers are \ndealing. Our lumber industry is in a crisis. Make no mistake about it. \nWe have been losing mills. The product value is down. Production is \ndown. If the current market conditions continue, many of our remaining \nlumber manufacturers will not survive the next 6 months. This is a \ncritical situation, and it is one that is going to get much worse if we \ndon't get some action quickly.\n  The U.S. lumber industry supports the Department's changed \ncircumstances process. Therefore, I think this is a solution we can all \nwork on. As a member of the Finance Committee, along with Senator \nBaucus, who also serves on the Finance Committee, we will make sure \nthis legislation receives the consideration it deserves.\n  We urge our colleagues in the country that is one of our two or three \nbest friends in the world, Canada, to work with us on this. This is an \nunfair situation, one that has been going on too long, one that is \ndestroying an important part of our economy. I hope our Government will \nvigorously pursue the litigation that is now being considered. The WTO \nhas already found that Canada has an actionable subsidy, meaning these \nduties will be imposed until provinces allow the market to determine \nthe price of timber. Our Government should continue to pursue it.\n  Our Canadian friends and allies should work with us because this is a \nvery unfair situation, one we are trying to remedy by making sure all \nof the costs of production, including the countervailing duties, are \nincluded in their calculations.\n  I congratulate Senator Craig for his leadership in this area, and I \nlook forward to working with him in the future as we come forward with \na proper solution to this critical issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Lott coming to the \nChamber this morning to speak on the role the timber industry plays in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\neconomy of Mississippi and how important it is. It is important to \nrural Mississippi, to rural Idaho, to rural America, where we struggle \nmightily to keep a viable productive job base.\n  Clearly over the last decade, the economy of this country flourished. \nAnd while all of that was going on, it was rural Idaho that felt much \nof the pain and shared not in that new growth economy, in part because \nof the very problem both Senator Lott and I and Senator Baucus and \nothers are addressing. My colleague Senator Crapo spoke to the matter \nas well.\n  This is a relatively simple adjustment in trade law, but it could \nhave a substantial impact on the Canadians and the current practices in \nwhich they are involved, practices we believe are not in the best \ninterest of both governments and both countries.\n  To have a nearly ``cut at will'' policy, both in provincial and crown \ntimber in Canada, is at best frustrating to some of us who believe not \nonly is that bad policy but, from an environmental point of view, it is \nnot an effectively balanced policy. Are the practices being adhered to \nthat should be adhered to for the purposes of sustaining yields and \nongoing production of timber? Or is it simply an effort to keep people \nat work, in this instance, and, more importantly now, because of the \ndeclaration of green timber unaffected by disease or bug, now being \ncalled bug kill timber, is it simply a policy to grab an increasingly \nlarger portion of the market? When many of these medium- and small-size \nmills go down, oftentimes they don't come back. If they are down for a \nlonger period of time, the workforce disperses in search of another job \nand, as a result of that, many of these mills that go down will stay \ndown permanently.\n  That is exactly what larger producers in Canada are hoping for, as it \nwill allow them an ever-increasing larger portion of the market here in \nthe lower 48 States.\n  I hope the Finance Committee will hold hearings and move quickly on \nthis issue. It is important for our economy and, more importantly, it \nis a small town, mill town issue that in many States, such as Idaho, \nMississippi, Montana, and throughout the South where there are large \ntimber reserves, becomes a critical way of sustaining the rural \neconomy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to join with \nmy colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, and with the other Senators he \nhas listed who are cosponsoring this critical legislation.\n  Senator Craig has already laid out this circumstance. Some time ago, \nwhen we could not reach an agreement with Canada on this critical issue \nthrough trade negotiations, WTO and other trade sanctions were sought \nby American companies seeking to correct the problem that has been \nfaced by subsidized timber flooding into the United States from Canada. \nAs a result of that effort, the U.S. Department of Commerce found the \nCanadian provinces subsidize their industry by providing lumber mills \ntimber at prices that are 33 to 50 percent below market value.\n  As Senator Craig has indicated, as a result of that, a countervailing \nduty was applied and the Canadian timber producers, who are trying to \nbring their timber into the United States, are now required to pay this \ncountervailing duty as a cost for their subsidized timber.\n  The response of the Canadian Government to that has not been simply \nto comply and try to negotiate a new, workable softwood lumber \nagreement. Instead, the Canadian Government has continued to increase \nthe available subsidies and to try to flood the United States markets \nwith this timber. The outcome has been that from August 2000 to March \n2001, the United States lumber manufacturers closed 27 mills \npermanently while only two Canadian mills were closed during that time. \nThe reason, of course, was this continued support provided from the \nCanadian Government.\n  How was it provided? As has already been indicated, allegedly bug \nkill timber. But timber wood that has not faced the impact yet was \nprovided for prices which were as low as $1 per 1,000 board feet when \nthe market price for that timber would have been somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $100 per 1,000 board feet. This significantly \nsubsidized timber has been brought into the United States, exacerbating \nthe problem.\n  Second, as Senator Craig already indicated, the British Columbian \ngovernment has already revised their forest practice code to reduce the \ncost of lumber manufacturers under their code, saving them millions of \ndollars annually. What we see is, in response to this anticompetitive \nsituation of unfair trade practices that have been identified and which \nare now being dealt with in litigation, the Canadians have increased \ntheir subsidies and are continuing to flood timber into the United \nStates markets.\n  A number of changes need to occur. But one of them needs to occur in \nU.S. law because as a part of the entire process, it is important to \ndetermine the amount of subsidy. The subsidy is determined by \nevaluating whether the price that is being charged to the Canadian \nproducers is above or below their cost of production. One of the \ncritical elements is determining that value.\n  Currently, we have found Canadian companies are selling their lumber \ninto the United States at below their subsidized cost of production, \nrequiring antidumping duty of 8.79 percent. The point I make is that \ntheir current subsidies are even below and make it so that they are \nable to provide their timber to U.S. markets below subsidized cost of \nproduction.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will require them to include \nthe countervailing duty which they pay as a part of their cost of \nproduction in determining what their true subsidy is. As long as the \nUnited States does not require the Canadians to include their \ncountervailing duties as a cost of their production, then the amount of \nthe subsidy which we determine will be even less than it truly is. It \nwill not be accurately reflected.\n  This is a simple change to clarify what is already on the books in \nthe United States. This practice is pursued in Europe and in Canada \nalready under their approach to these issues. It is only proper that \nthe U.S. Government stand firmly behind this principle. Again, the \nprinciple is, when a nation is subsidizing its products and shipping \nthem into U.S. markets to the detriment of our producers, that subsidy \nmust be included as a cost of doing business when we calculate in our \nlitigation with them the amount of subsidy and the resultant \ncountervailing duties we can apply.\n\n  I don't believe there is a legitimate argument against this \nlegislation. I realize nations across the world are trying to figure \nout how to continue to do the best they can for their producers to help \nthem get their products into our markets. However, we have now very \naggressive negotiations underway in bilateral trade arrangements as \nwell as in multilateral trade arrangements such as the world trade \nnegotiations seeking to bring down the level of subsidies across the \nworld to a level of zero. That is our objective in our international \ntrade negotiations. We cannot tolerate the continued defiance of these \ntypes of laws in our negotiations. That is the simple purpose behind \nthis legislation.\n  The United States and the Department of Commerce and our United \nStates trade negotiators in particular have been doing a tremendous job \nin helping deal with a very difficult situation resulting from the \nCanadian unfair trade practices in softwood lumber. They are to be \ncommended for this. One of the things we need to provide to them as a \ntool in this ongoing process is a congressional and, indeed, American \nstatutory declaration that countervailing duties must be included in \nthe cost of production as we negotiate on these critical issues with \nour neighbors to the north.\n  I thank the Senate for this time. I thank my colleague Senator Craig \nfor his leadership on this issue and the other Senators supporting this \neffort.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am here today to cosponsor legislation \nthat should help resolve the current crisis being faced by the U.S. \nsoftwood lumber industry, which continues to be devastated by the \ncontinuation of a ``wall of subsidized wood'' coming from four Canadian \nprovinces that are effectively avoiding countervailing duty and \nantidumping orders of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This is causing\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\na crisis in current market conditions not only in Maine but across the \nNation.\n  The purpose of the U.S. countervailing duty, or CVD, law, is to \noffset unfair foreign subsidies which cause injury to our U.S. \nproducers. In the Canadian softwood lumber case, Commerce has \ndetermined that some Canadian provinces subsidize their lumber mills at \nprices that are 33 to 55 percent below market value. Currently, \nCanadian prices for salvage timber, for instance, are as low as $1 per \nthousand board feet at the same time the competitive market value is \nover $100 thousand board feet.\n  Our antidumping law is supposed to ensure that foreign products are \nnot sold for less than its cost of production. Currently, the \nDepartment of Commerce does not consider countervailing duties as a \ncost of production, thereby undervaluing the Canadian dumping practices \nby comparing a subsidized cost of production to the price of lumber \nrather than comparing the cost of production plus the countervailing \nduty to the price of lumber. Ignoring countervailing duties when then \ncalculating antidumping duties undervalues the actual amount of \ndumping, and is devastating to our U.S. softwood lumber industry.\n  The Craig/Baucus legislation that I am supporting today amends the \nTariff Act of 1930 to clarify that countervailing duties should be \nadded into the cost of production as it reflects the true cost of \nproduction by offsetting subsidies. This provision will rectify the \nproblem of undervalued dumping duties and make U.S. trade policies \nconsistent with those of our trading partners, such as Canada and the \nEuropean Union.\n  Adopting this clarification should have an immediate market impact. \nWith the correction of the current problem, Canadian mills would face \nthe prospect of paying considerably higher antidumping rates if the \nlumber market remains at the current low level. This legislation should \ndemonstrate the resolve of the U.S. government to reach a fair and \npermanent solution to the softwood lumber trade case by increasing the \nrisk to Canadian companies if a negotiated settlement is not reached. \nThe Canadian lumber industry and its governments must realize that the \nU.S. will continue to impose the required duty offsets until the \nsubsidies and dumping stop.\n  I commend the Department of Commerce for their diligent work on the \nsoftwood lumber case with Canada and cannot urge our U.S. trade \nnegotiators strongly enough to reach a settlement with Canada just as \nsoon as possible before we have yet another U.S. mill close its doors \nfor good. The subsidized and dumped lumber from Canada has been \ndevastating to my State of Maine, where sawmills continue to close \ntheir doors for good, affecting entire rural communities where these \nbusinesses are located, and where the mills are often the major source \nof good paying jobs in these areas.\n  Moreover, if a negotiated settlement is not reached, I believe that \nthe U.S. should vigorously pursue the litigation with the World Trade \nOrganization, WTO, especially since the WTO has already found that \nCanada has an actionable subsidy, meaning duties will be imposed until \nprovinces allow the market to determine the price of timber rather than \nprovincial governments.\n  Again, this legislation being offered today by Senators from all \nregions of the country provides a much needed clarification of U.S. \ntrade law, in keeping with those of Canada and the European Union, that \nwill greatly help the U.S. softwood lumber industry out of its current \neconomic crisis that has been caused by subsidized, underpriced \nimports, and I urge the support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the efforts of the Department \nof Commerce and United States Trade Representative to negotiate a fair \ntrade agreement with Canada. We have a very important trading \nrelationship with Canada. They are America's strongest trading partner, \nand I hope we can continue strengthening that relationship. However, \nCanada subsidizes its lumber mills, and those mills are dumping lumber \nin our domestic market. This has a devastating effect on the lumber \nindustry in America, particularly in Mississippi where mills are \nclosing each month.\n  Currently, the Department of Commerce has imposed a countervailing \nduty to offset the injury to our market. Canadian mills must pay a 29 \npercent duty on top of the cost of producing their lumber. To arrive at \nthat duty rate, the Department of Commerce calculates what it costs \nCanadian lumber producers to process their lumber. In fact, a U.S. \nstatute, Sec. 19 U.S.C. 1677, states that duties should be considered a \ncost of production incurred on shipments to the United States.\n  Today, Senators Craig, Baucus, Burns, Miller, Crapo, Lott, Sessions, \nSnowe, Collins, Lincoln, and I introduced a bill to clarify the law so \nthat there is no misunderstanding of the rules under which the \nDepartment of Commerce calculates the duties imposed on illegally \nsubsidized Canadian lumber. This recalculation would raise the price it \ncosts Canadians to produce their lumber and would allow the Department \nof Commerce to raise the current 29 percent duty. The practice of \nsubsidizing and dumping must be taken seriously.\n  I am hopeful that the recent trips by the U.S. Government to Canada \ncan result in honest and fruitful negotiations leading to a fair lumber \ntrading agreement. It is in the best interest of both of our countries \nthat we reach an agreement. In my State, lumber is one of our most \nvaluable agricultural products.\n  For years the mills in my state have endured unfair trading \npractices. Now that the U.S. is finally imposing duties to offset the \ninjury to these mills, the Canadians are simply incorporating the \nduties into their cost of doing business. On behalf of the few \nremaining lumber mills in Mississippi I urge the Department of Commerce \nto uphold existing trade laws by counting duties as a cost.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 220. A bill to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement \nof construction of a hydroelectric project in the State of Illinois; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreinstate a license surrendered to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, that authorized the construction of a hydroelectric \npower plant in Carlyle, IL. In order to facilitate the construction of \nthe hydroelectric power plant, the bill also contains a provision that \nextends the deadline for beginning construction of the plant.\n  Carlyle, IL, is a small community of 3,406 people in Southwestern \nIllinois, fifty miles east of St. Louis. Carlyle is situated on the \nKaskaskia River at the southern tip of Carlyle Lake, which was formed \nin 1967 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed construction of \na dam on the river. Carlyle Lake is 15 miles long and 3.5 miles wide, \nthe largest man-made lake in Illinois.\n  When the Army Corps of Engineers constructed the dam, it failed to \nbuild a hydroelectric power plant to capitalize on the energy available \nfrom water flowing through the dam. A hydroelectric power facility in \nCarlyle would produce 4,000 kilowatts of power and provide a renewable \nenergy source for surrounding communities. Furthermore, the \nenvironmental impact of adding a hydroelectric facility would be \nminimal, and such a facility, located at a site near the existing dam, \nwould not produce harmful emissions.\n  In 1997, Southwestern Electric Cooperative obtained a license from \nthe FERC to begin work on a hydroelectric project in Carlyle. In 2000, \nSouthwestern Electric Cooperative surrendered their license because \nthey were unable to begin the project in the required time period. The \nCity of Carlyle is interested in constructing the hydroelectric power \nplant and is seeking to obtain Southwestern Electric Cooperative's \nlicense.\n  The bill I am introducing today is required for the construction of \nthe facility. Legislation is necessary to authorize FERC to reinstate \nSouthwestern Electric Cooperative's surrendered license. Because there \nis not enough time remaining on the license to conduct studies, produce \na design for the facility, and begin construction of the project, the \nbill includes a provision that allows FERC to extend the applicable \ndeadline.\n  The full Senate passed this bill, during the 107th Congress, on \nNovember 20, 2002 without opposition, but, the House\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nof Representatives was unable to act on this legislation before the \n107th Congress adjourned.\n  This legislation is an easy and environmentally safe approach to \nmeeting the energy needs of Southwestern Illinois. Please join me in \nsupporting this measure to provide a clean alternative energy source \nfor this part of the Midwest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY \n                   COMMISSION PROJECT.\n\n       Notwithstanding the time period specified in section 13 of \n     the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would otherwise \n     apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project \n     numbered 11214, the Commission may, at the request of the \n     licensee for the project, and after reasonable notice, in \n     accordance with the good faith, due diligence, and public \n     interest requirements of that section and the Commission's \n     procedures under that section--\n       (1) reinstate the license for the construction of the \n     project as of the effective date of the surrender of the \n     license; and\n       (2) extend the time period during which the licensee is \n     required to commence the construction of the project for 3 \n     consecutive 2-year periods beyond the date that is 4 years \n     after the date of issuance of the license.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 221. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to facilitate \nan increase in programming and content on radio that is locally and \nindependently produced, to facilitate competition in radio programming, \nradio advertising, and concerts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation \nthat will promote competition in the radio and concert industries.\n  This legislation will begin to address many of the concerns that I \nhave heard from my constituents regarding the concentration of \nownership in the radio and concert industry and its effect on \nconsumers, artists, local businesses, and ticket prices.\n  Last year, I introduced this same legislation, and with the help of a \nwide range of organizations and other Senators, we put this issue on \nthe front and center in Congress. I am pleased that a number of \nCommittees are looking at this issue and considering holding hearings \nin the coming weeks.\n  With these hearings coming up, I want once again to bring this \nproposal to my colleagues attention. And as the Committee process works \nitself forward, I expect that we will discover additional issues to \naddress that will strengthen the provisions in my legislation.\n  But this legislation is where Congress should begin its efforts to \npromote competition, diversity, and localism in radio.\n  I love radio. But, over the last year, I have learned that \nconcentration of ownership in the radio and concert industry has made \nit difficult for individuals, artists, and organizations to find \noutlets to express their creativity and promote diversity.\n  Music and local news carried over the radio can help society to \nconsider some of the most serious issues affecting our Nation: issues \nlike war and peace, issues like social justice.\n  If the already diminishing number of gatekeepers of radio content \nchooses not to air controversial music because it may turn off \nadvertisers, one of the most universal mediums to engage in dialogue \nwill be lost. Regardless of our point of view, we must retain the \nability of radio to show the diverse range of voices that form our \nculture.\n  I have heard many stories about the effects of this concentration. \nBut perhaps the most compelling was at the annual Congressional Black \nCaucus event last year, when two people who have been involved in radio \nfor decades told me about the real life importance of diversity in \nradio.\n  They spoke about the importance of the locally-owned media that \nhelped raise public awareness of the campaign of the late Harold \nWashington to become the first black mayor of Chicago. They said that \nthe main avenue for many in the central city to hear about the campaign \nwas through locally-owned radio stations.\n  If an out-of-State corporation controlled the programming of these \nradio stations, would this political pioneer have received the same \ncoverage?\n  I have also heard a great deal from religious organizations about how \nconsolidation harms their ability to reach out in their communities. \nThey have said that we must get to the root of the problem by curbing \nanti-competitive practices that make it difficult for locally-owned, \nindependent radio stations to prosper.\n  I also learned about the story of Everett Parker, who during the \ncivil rights movement of the 1960s was a pioneering defender of public \ninterest in broadcasting.\n  In Dr. Parker's most famous crusade, he and the United Church of \nChrist went to Jackson, MS, to challenge the license renewals of \nstations that were blocking coverage of the civil rights movement, even \nthough African-Americans constituted almost half of the audience.\n  By failing to cover the civil rights movement, the station failed all \nof the citizens of Jackson by limiting access to information on issues \nof public importance.\n  So, joining with the local NAACP, the group went to the Federal \nCommunications Commission and challenged the licenses of the Jackson \nstations. The case went all the way to the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, which took away the station's license.\n  What makes this case so significant is that it established the right \nof any American to petition the Commission, instead of limiting such \npetitions to commercial interests.\n  The radio airwaves continued to be owned by the public. Radio is a \npublic medium. It must serve the public good.\n  We must promote localism and diversity on our airwaves and crack down \non anti-competitive practices that are a result of concentration in the \nradio and concert industry.\n  We must address negative consequences of the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct, which opened the floodgates for consolidation and led to anti-\nconsumer and anti-competitive practices.\n  Just consider how the rise in ticket prices coincided with the \npassage of the Telecommunications Act. Following the passage of the \nAct, and the resulting consolidation of the radio and concert industry, \nticket prices went through the roof!\n  Before the passage of the 1996 Act, ticket prices were increasing at \na rate slightly higher than the Consumer Price Index. Following the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, however, ticket prices have increased \nat a rate almost 50 percentage points higher than the Consumer Price \nIndex. From 1996 to 2001, concert ticket prices rose by more than 61 \npercent, while the Consumer Price Index increased by just 13 percent.\n  During the debate of the 1996 Act, I joined a number of my colleagues \nin opposing the deregulation of radio ownership rules because of \nconcerns about its effect on consumers, artists, independent radio \nstations, and local communities.\n  Passage of this Act was an unfortunate example of the influence of \nsoft money in the political process. I have consistently said that this \nAct was bought and paid for by soft money, by unlimited contributions \nby corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to the political \nparties. Everyone was at the table, except for the consumers.\n  That's why I am pleased to re-introduce this legislation, the \nCompetition in Radio and Concert Industries Act, which would reduce the \nlevels of concentration and curb some of these anti-competitive \npractices.\n  My legislation prohibits those who own radio stations and concert \npromotion services or venues from leveraging their cross-ownership to \nhinder competition in the industry. For example, if an owner of a radio \nstation and a promotion service hinders access to the airwaves of a \nrival promoter or artist, then the owner would be subject to penalties.\n  My legislation will also help to curb the concentration that leads to \nthese anti-competitive practices.\n  It would strengthen the FCC merger review process by requiring the \nFCC to\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nscrutinize the mergers of any radio station ownership group that \nreaches more than 60% of the nation.\n  My legislation would also curb consolidation on the local level by \npreventing any upward revision of the limitation on multiple ownership \nof radio stations in local markets.\n  The bill would also prohibit the current shakedown system, where the \nbig radio corporations are said to leverage their market power to \nrequire payments from artists in exchange for playing their songs. And \nit would also close a loophole that allows large radio ownership \ncompanies to exceed the cap by ``warehousing stations'' through a third \nparty. In these cases, they control the station through a third party, \nbut the stations are not counted against their local ownership cap.\n  Songs and ideas should not be broadcast on the radio based on how \nmuch money has changed hands. Airplay should be based on good songs and \ngood ideas what the local audience wants to hear.\n  My legislation would slow the levels of concentration and address a \nnumber of concerns that I have heard from artists and others, although \nit does not address all the issues facing our communities.\n  Over the coming months, I hope that my colleagues will give this \nissue their attention, both on the floor and in committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation so that we can \nwork together to restore competition to the radio and concert industry \nby putting independent radio stations, local concert promoters, and \nartists on a level playing field.\n  People should have choices, listeners should have a diversity of \noptions, and Americans should be able to hear new and different voices. \nRadio allows us to connect to our communities, to our culture, and to \nour democracy. It is one of the most vibrant mediums we have for the \nexchange of ideas, and for artistic expression. We must fight to \npreserve it, and together I believe we can do just that.\n  Radio is a public medium, and we must ensure that it serves the \npublic good. That's a democratic vision of American radio well worth \nfighting for.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 222. A bill to approve the settlement of the water rights claims \nof the Zuni Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself I am \nintroducing legislation today that would codify the settlement of the \nZuni Indian Tribe's water rights for its religious lands in \nnortheastern Arizona. Congress first recognized the importance of these \nlands in 1984 when it created the Zuni Heaven Reservation, Pub. L. 98-\n498, as amended by Pub. Law No. 101-486, 1990. For nearly a century, \nthe small communities upstream from this Reservation have fully-\nappropriated the water from Little Colorado River for use in their \nhomes and on their fields. Yet the Zuni Tribe asserted that it would \nneed water to restore and use its Reservation lands. The prospect of \ndividing the limited water of the Little Colorado River with still \nanother user created great uncertainly. To resolve that uncertainty and \nto avoid expensive and protracted litigation, the Zuni Tribe, the \nUnited States on behalf of the Zuni Tribe, the State of Arizona, \nincluding the Arizona Game and Fish Commission, the Arizona State Land \nDepartment, and the Arizona State Parks Board, and the major water \nusers in this area of Arizona negotiated for many years to produce a \nwater settlement that is acceptable to all parties.\n  This bill would provide the Zuni Tribe with the resources and \nprotections necessary to acquire water rights from willing sellers and \nto restore and protect the wetland environment that the Zuni Tribe \npreviously used. In return, the Zuni Tribe would waive its claim in the \nLittle Colorado River Adjudication. In addition, the Zuni Tribe would, \namong other things, grandfather existing water uses and waive claims \nagainst many future water uses in the Little Colorado River basin. In \nsummary, with this bill, the Zuni Tribe can achieve its needs for the \nZuni Heaven Reservation while avoiding a disruption to local water \nusers and industry. Furthermore, the United States can avoid litigating \nwater rights and damage claims and satisfy its trust responsibilities \nto the Tribe regarding water for the Reservation. The parties have \nworked many years to reach consensus and I believe this bill would \nproduce a fair result to all.\n  This legislation unanimously passed the Senate in the 107th Congress. \nUnfortunately, the House of Representatives adjourned and was unable to \ntake action on the bill. We hope for its swift passage in the 108th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Corzine, and \n        Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 223. A bill to prevent identity theft, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, along with Senator Grassley, \nSenator Corzine, and Senator Gregg to introduce the Identity Theft \nPrevention Act.\n  This bill addresses the growing tide of identity theft cases by \nrequiring banks, credit bureaus, and other financial institutions to \ntake some practical steps to protect sensitive personal information.\n  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses \nanother person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license \nnumber, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car \nloans, phone plans or other services in the victim's name.\n  The criminal literally assumes the identity of the victim for illicit \ngain.\n  Identity theft has become the number one white collar crime of the \nnew millennium, and Congress needs to make a major effort to protect \nAmericans' personal information.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are victimized by identity theft \neach year.\n  The personal losses as a result of these crimes are major. The \naverage financial loss from an identity theft case is $17,000 and it \ntakes a typical victim 18 months to restore his or her good credit.\n  In some cases, victims are falsely saddled with criminal records or \nare denied loans and other valuable financial services.\n  Identity theft is frighteningly easy to commit. One of my \nconstituents, Kim Bradbury of Castro Valley, knows this too well. Kim \nreported that an identity thief obtained a credit card in her name \nthrough the Internet in less than 60 seconds. The false application \nonly had her Social Security number and birth date correct.\n  Kim only found out she was an identity theft victim when a \nrepresentative of a telemarketing company called her at home while she \nwas feeding her one-year child. The representative told her that \nsomeone with a different address had applied for a credit card in Kim's \nname.\n  In Kim's case, it appears that her Social Security number was stolen \nby a fellow employee who also had stolen the identities of several \ndozen company employees. The thief ultimately stole over $100,000 in \nmerchandise, including 20 cell phone accounts, via identity fraud.\n  All indicators suggest that the crime continues to grow at an \nalarming rate.\n  Just two months ago, Federal prosecutors announced the largest single \nidentity theft case in U.S. history. Three individuals allegedly sold \nthe credit and personal information of 30,000 people.\n  At one national credit reporting agency, consumers requested 53 \npercent more fraud alerts in fiscal year 2001 than fiscal year 2000.\n  As of December 2001, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, Identity \nTheft Clearinghouse averaged more than 3,000 call-ins per week, a \nseven-fold increase since the clearinghouse began operation in November \n1999.\n  The Identity Theft Prevention Act offers a series of practical steps \nto cut-off criminal access to sensitive consumer data.\n  No. 1, Credit card number truncation on receipts: first, the Identity \nTheft Prevention Act would require all new credit-card machines to \ntruncate any credit card number printed on a customer receipt.\n  Thus, when a store gives a customer a receipt from a credit card \npurchase, only the last five digits of the credit card number will \nshow.\n  This prevents identity thieves from stealing credit card numbers by \nretrieving discarded receipts.\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\n  Existing machines would have to be reprogrammed to truncate credit \ncard numbers on receipts within four years after enactment of the \nlegislation.\n  No. 2, Fraud alerts: the bill would give the Federal Trade Commission \nthe authority to impose a fine on credit issuers who issue new credit \nto identity thieves despite the presence of a fraud alert on the \nconsumer's credit file.\n  Too many credit card issuers are granting new cards without \nadequately verifying the identity of the applicant. Putting some teeth \ninto fraud alerts will curb irresponsible granting of credit.\n  No. 3, Free credit reports: third, the legislation would entitle each \nconsumer to one free credit report per year. Currently six States, \nColorado, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont, \nhave laws entitling consumers to one free credit report per year from \nthe national credit bureaus.\n  According to identity theft victim advocates, identity theft is \ndetected much earlier if consumers actively monitor their credit files. \nThe cost of credit reports is a major obstacle to their use by \nconsumers.\n  No. 4, Change of address: finally, the bill requires a credit card \ncompany to notify consumers when an additional credit card is requested \non an existing credit account within 30 days of an address change \nrequest.\n  This provision addresses a common method of identity fraud where a \ncriminal steals an individual's credit card number, and then obtains a \nduplicate card by informing the issuer of a change of address.\n  The Identity Theft Prevention Act requires financial institutions to \nimplement needed precautions to prevent identity fraud and protect a \nperson's good name.\n  Verifying a credit applicant's address, complying with ``fraud \nalerts'', and truncating credit numbers on receipts are all measures \nthat will make it harder for criminals to engage in identity fraud.\n  It is appropriate and necessary for financial institutions to take \nthese steps. These companies have a responsibility to prevent \nfraudsters from using their services to harm the good name of other \ncitizens.\n  Morever, in this complex, information-driven society, consumers \nsimply can't protect their good name on their own.\n  I strongly believe this legislation will provide desperately needed \ntools to combat identity theft, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to secure its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Identity Theft Prevention \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the crime of identity theft has become one of the major \n     law enforcement challenges of the new economy, as vast \n     quantities of sensitive, personal information are now \n     vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;\n       (2) in November 2002, Americans were alerted to the dangers \n     of identity theft when Federal prosecutors announced that 3 \n     individuals had allegedly sold the credit and personal \n     information of 30,000 people, the largest single identity \n     theft case in United States history;\n       (3) hundreds of thousands of Americans are victims of \n     identity theft each year, resulting in an annual cost to \n     industry of more than $3,500,000,000.\n       (4) several indicators reveal that despite increased public \n     awareness of the crime, the number of incidents of identity \n     theft continues to rise;\n       (5) in December 2001, the Federal Trade Commission received \n     an average of more than 3,000 identity theft calls per week, \n     a 700 percent increase since the Identity Theft Data \n     Clearinghouse began operation in November 1999;\n       (6) allegations of social security number fraud increased \n     by 500 percent between 1998 and 2001, from 11,000 to 65,000;\n       (7) a national credit reporting agency reported that \n     consumer requests for fraud alerts increased by 53 percent \n     during fiscal year 2001;\n       (8) identity theft violates the privacy of American \n     citizens and ruins their good names;\n       (9) victims of identity theft may suffer restricted access \n     to credit and diminished employment opportunities, and may \n     spend years repairing the damage to credit histories caused \n     by identity theft;\n       (10) businesses and government agencies that handle \n     sensitive personal information of consumers have a \n     responsibility to protect this information from identity \n     thieves; and\n       (11) the private sector can better protect consumers by \n     implementing effective fraud alerts, affording greater \n     consumer access to credit reports, truncating of credit card \n     numbers, and establishing other prevention measures.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prohibit an individual from knowingly opening, \nmaintaining, managing controlling, renting, leasing, making available \nfor use, or profiting from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, \ndistributing, or using any controlled substance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to introduce the \nIllicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act. This legislation arises out of a \nhearing Senator Grassley and I held in the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control in December 2001 on the proliferation \nof Ecstasy and other club drugs generally, and the role of some \npromoters of all-night dance parties, known as ``raves'', in \ndistributing Ecstasy to young people. Our bill provides Federal \nprosecutors the tools needed to combat the manufacture, distribution or \nuse of any controlled substance at any venue whose purpose is to engage \nin illegal narcotics activity. Rather than create a new law, our bill \nmerely amends a well-established statute to make clear that anyone who \nknowingly and intentionally uses their property, or allows another \nperson to use their property, for the purpose of distributing or \nmanufacturing or using illegal drugs can be held accountable, \nregardless of whether the drug use is ongoing or occurs at a single \nevent.\n  While my legislation is aimed at the defendant's predatory behavior, \nregardless of the type of drug or the particular place in which it is \nbeing used or distributed, one problem that we are facing currently \ninvolves so-called ``club drugs'' and raves. According to a report \nwhich the Partnership for a Drug Free America will release in the near \nfuture, teens who report attending a rave are seven times more likely \nto have tried Ecstasy than teens who report not attending a rave. I \nfind this statistic quite troubling.\n  Despite the conventional wisdom that Ecstasy and other club drugs are \n``no big deal,'' a view that even the New York Times Magazine espoused \nin a cover story, these drugs can have serious consequences, and can \neven be fatal. Just last month we got some encouraging news: after \nyears of steady increase, Ecstasy use is finally beginning to decrease \namong teens. That said, the rate of use remains unacceptably high and \nwe still have quite a bit of work to do to counter the widespread \nmisconception that Ecstacy is harmless, fashionable and hip.\n  At the Drug Caucus hearing, witnesses testified that rogue rave \norganizers commonly go to great lengths to portray their events as safe \nso that parents will allow their kids to attend. They advertise their \nparties as alcohol-free events and some even hire off-duty police \nofficers to patrol outside the venue. But the truth is that some of \nthese raves are drug dens where use of Ecstasy and other ``club \ndrugs'', such as the date rape drugs Rohypnol, GHB and Ketamine, is \nwidespread.\n  But even as these promoters work to make parents think that their \nevents are safe, they send a different message to kids. Their \npromotional flyers make clear that drugs are an integral part of the \nparty by prominently featuring terms associated with drug use, such as \nthe letters ``E'' or ``X''--street terms for Ecstasy, or the term \n``rollin''', which refers to an Ecstasy high. They are, in effect, \npromoting Ecstasy along with the rave.\n  By doing so, unscrupulous promoters get rich as they exploit and \nendanger kids. Some supplement their profits from the $10 to $50 cover \ncharge to enter the club by selling popular Ecstasy paraphernalia such \nas baby pacifiers, glow sticks, or mentholated inhalers. And predatory \nparty organizers know that Ecstasy raises the core body temperature and \nmakes the user extremely thirsty, so they sell bottles of water for $5 \nor $10 apiece. Some even shut off the water faucets so club goers will \nbe forced to buy water or pay admission to enter an air-conditioned \n``cool down room.''\n  After the death of a 17-year-old girl at a rave party in New Orleans \nin 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted an assessment of \nrave activity in that city which showed the close relationship between \nthese parties and club drug overdoses. In a two year period, 52 raves \nwere held at the New Orleans State Palace Theater, during which time \napproximately 400 teenagers overdosed and were treated at local \nemergency rooms. Following ``Operation Rave Review'' which resulted in \nthe arrest of several rave promoters and closing the city's largest \nrave, overdoses and emergency room visits dropped by 90 percent and \nEcstasy overdoses were eliminated.\n  State and local governments have begun to take important steps to \ncrack down on rave promoters who allow their events to be used as \nhavens for illicit drug activity. In Chicago, where Mayor Daley has \nshown great leadership on this issue, it is a criminal offense to \nknowingly maintain a place, such as a rave, where controlled substances \nare used or distributed. Not only the promoter, but also the building \nowner and building manager can be\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\ncharged under Mayor Daley's law. The State of Florida has a similar \nstatute making such activity a felony.\n\n  And in Modesto, California, police officers are offering ``rave \ntraining classes'' to parents to educate them about the dangers \nassociated with some raves and the club drugs often associated with \nthem.\n  At the Federal level, there have been four cases in which Federal \nprosecutors have used the so called ``crack house statute'' or other \nFederal charges to go after rogue rave promoters. These cases, in \nLittle Rock, AR, Boise, ID, Panama City, FL, and New Orleans, LA, have \nhad mixed results, culminating in two wins, a loss and a draw, \nsuggesting that there may be a need to tailor this Federal statute more \nprecisely to the problem at hand. As a result, last session I proposed \nlegislation which would do just that. I am reintroducing it today and I \nam pleased to have Senator Grassley once again as the lead cosponsor. I \nmight note that the legislation is also included in the Democratic \nleadership crime bill.\n  After I introduced this legislation last year, a great deal of \nmisinformation began circulating about it. I want to make the record \nclear. Simply stated, my bill provides technical corrections to an \nexisting statute, one which has been on the books for 16 years and is \nwell established.\n  Critics of my bill have asserted that if the legislation were to \nbecome law ``there would be no way that someone could hold a concert \nand not be liable'' and that the bill ``holds the owners and the \npromoters responsible for the actions of the patrons.'' That is simply \nuntrue. We know that there will always be certain people who will bring \ndrugs into musical or other events and use them without the knowledge \nor permission of the promoter or club owner. This is not the type of \nactivity that my bill would address. The purpose of my legislation is \nnot to prosecute legitimate law-abiding managers of stadiums, arenas, \nperforming arts centers, licensed beverage facilities and other venues \nbecause of incidental drug use at their events. In fact, when crafting \nthis legislation, I took steps to ensure that it did not capture such \ncases. My bill would help in the prosecution of rogue promoters who not \nonly know that there is drug use at their event but also hold the event \nfor the purpose of illegal drug use or distribution. That is quite a \nhigh bar.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Coalition of Licensed \nBeverage Associations, COLBA, be printed at the end of my statement. \nCOLBA, who initially expressed concerns that my bill would make their \nmembers liable for the actions of their patrons, has endorsed my \nlegislation because they realized that my bill was not aimed at \nresponsible party promoters.\n  I am confident that the overwhelming majority of promoters are \ndecent, law abiding people who are going to discourage drug use, or any \nother illegal activity, at their venues. But there are a few promoters \nout there who are taking steps to profit from drug activity at their \nevents. Some of these folks actually distribute drugs themselves or \nhave their staff distribute drugs, get kickbacks from drug sales at \ntheir events, have thinly veiled drug messages on their promotional \nflyers, tell their security to ignore drug use or sales, or send \npatients who need medical attention because of a drug overdose to a \nhospital across town so that people won't link emergency room visits \nwith their club. What they are doing is illegal under current law. My \nbill would not change that fact. Let me be clear. Neither current law \nnor my bill seeks to punish a promoter for the behavior of their \npatrons. As I mentioned, the underlying crack house statute has been on \nthe books since 1986, and I am unaware of this statute ever being used \nto prosecute a legitimate business.\n  The legislation simply amends the current ``crack house statute'' in \ntwo minor ways. First, it clarifies that Congress intended for the law \nto apply not just to ongoing drug distribution operations, but to \n``single-event'' activities, such as a party where the promoter \nsponsors the event with the purpose of distributing Ecstasy or other \nillegal drugs. After all, a drug dealer can be arrested and prosecuted \nfor selling one bag of drugs, and the government need not show that the \ndealer is selling day after day, or to multiple sellers. Likewise, the \nbill clarifies that a ``one-time'' event where the promoter knowingly \ndistributes Ecstasy over the course of an evening, for example, \nviolates the statute the same as a crack house which is in operation \nover a period of time. Second, the bill makes the law apply to outdoor \nas well as indoor venues, such as where a rogue rave promoter uses a \nfield to hold a rave for the purpose of distributing a controlled \nsubstance. Those are the only changes the bill makes to the crack house \nstatute. It does not give the Federal Government sweeping new powers as \nthe detractors have asserted.\n  Critics of the bill have also claimed that it would provide a \ndisincentive for promoters to take steps to protect the public health \nof their patrons including providing water or air conditioned rooms, \nmaking sure that there is an ambulance on the premises, etc. That is \nnot my intention. And to underscore that fact, I plan to remove the \nfindings, which is the only place in the bill where these items are \nmentioned, from the bill. Certainly there are legitimate reasons for \nselling water, having a room where people can cool down after dancing, \nor having an ambulance on hand. Clearly, the presence of any of these \nthings is not enough to signify that an event is ``for the purpose of'' \ndrug use.\n  The reason that I introduced this bill was not to ban dancing, kill \nthe ``rave scene'' or silence electronic music, all things of which I \nhave been accused. Although this legislation grew out of testimony I \nheard at a number of hearings about the problems identified at raves, \nthe criminal and civil penalties in the bill would also apply to people \nwho promoted any type of event for the purpose of drug use or \ndistribution. If rave promoters and sponsors operate such events as \nthey are so often advertised as places for people to come dance in a \nsafe, drug-free environment then they have nothing to fear from this \nlaw. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or \nexpression it is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect \nkids.\n  Last year people criticized the bill's title, the ``RAVE Act'', \nbecause they thought it was unfairly targeting raves. Although I do not \nbelieve that I was unfairly targeting anybody, I have changed the title \nto the ``Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003.''\n  In addition to amending the crack house statute, the legislation also \naddresses the low penalties for trafficking gamma hydroxybutyric acid, \nGHB, by directing the United States Sentencing Commission to examine \nthe current penalties and consider increasing them to reflect the \nseriousness of offenses involving GHB. Currently, GHB penalties are \nsimply too low. In order to get five years for a GHB offense, you have \nto have more than 13 gallons of the drug, equivalent to 100,000 doses \nand a street value of about $1 million. According to the DEA, big-time \nGHB dealers distribute approximately one gallon quantities of the drug, \nthe penalty for which is currently only between 15 and 21 months. These \ncases simply aren't being prosecuted at the Federal level because the \npenalties are so low. The Sentencing Commission needs to take a look at \nthis problem and consider raising the penalties for this dangerous \ndrug.\n  But the answer to the problem of drug use at raves is not simply to \nprosecute irresponsible rave promoters and those who distribute drugs. \nThere is also a responsibility to raise awareness among parents, \nteachers, students, coaches, religious leaders, etc. about the dangers \nof the drugs used and sold at raves. The DEA is already doing some of \nthis through its club drug awareness campaign, where DEA agents are \nholding conferences with local women legislators to get information out \nabout the dangers of these substances. The legislation provides funds \nto the DEA to continue this important work. Further, the bill \nauthorizes nearly $6 million for the DEA to hire a Demand Reduction \nCoordinator in each state who can work with communities following the \narrest of a significant local trafficker to reduce the demand for drugs \nthrough prevention and treatment programs.\n  It is the unfortunate truth that some raves are havens for illicit \ndrugs. Enacting the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act will help to \nprosecute the promoters who seek to profit from exploiting and \nendangering young lives and\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nwill take steps to educate youth, parents and other interested adults \nabout the dangers of Ecstasy and other club drugs associated with \nraves.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me and support this legislation.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Coalition of Licensed Beverage\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 15, 2002.\n     Senator Joe Biden,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Office \n         Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Coalition of Licensed Beverage \n     Associations (COLBA) is a national association representing \n     the interests of private-sector licensed beverage retailers \n     who sell and serve alcohol beverages. COLBA represents both \n     on-premise and off-premise alcohol beverage licensees. It is \n     dedicated to preserving States' rights to ensure legal sales \n     of alcohol to persons of legal-consumption age to maintaining \n     high standards for the retail sale of alcohol.\n       Like you, Mr. Chairman, COLBA members have become \n     increasingly concerned with the trafficking and use of the \n     drug Ecstasy. As you know, much of the abuse of Ecstasy and \n     other club drugs happens at all-night dance parties known as \n     ``raves.'' Rave organizers often go to great lengths to \n     portray their events as safe, alcohol-free parties in order \n     to persuade parents to allow their children to attend. Such \n     events tend to reflect negatively on the legitimate licensed \n     beverage industry and its many small businesses.\n       COLBA supports state and local government's efforts to \n     crack down on rave promoters who allow their events to be \n     used as havens for illicit drug activity. COLBA also supports \n     your effort to strengthen the current statues to provide law \n     enforcement and prosecutors with the tools necessary to bring \n     a halt to this activity.\n       Initially COLBA had concerns about your legislation effort \n     and felt that if it were to become law any concert or special \n     event holder would be held liable for incidental drug use. \n     There was a misconception in the industry that the bill would \n     hold the owners and the promoters of non-rave events \n     responsible for the actions of the patrons.\n       However, it is the understanding of COLBA that the purpose \n     of the Rave Act legislation is not to prosecute legitimate \n     law-abiding managers of stadiums, arenas, performing arts \n     centers, licensed beverage facilities and other venues due to \n     incidental drug use at their events. The purpose of the Rave \n     Act is the prosecution of rogue promoters who not only know \n     that there is illegal drug use at their event, but also hold \n     the event for the purpose of illegal drug use or \n     distribution.\n       In light of this clarification by your gracious and \n     dedicate staff, the Coalition now understand the intent of \n     your legislative effort and fully supports the passage of the \n     Rave Act. Please feel free to contact me if you need any \n     additional information or if I can be of any further \n     assistance.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                David S. Germroth.\n                                        Washington Representative.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Biden today in introducing the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation \nAct. This is a continuation of an effort he and I spearheaded last year \nto update our laws so they can continue to be used effectively against \ndrug dealers who are pushing drugs on our kids.\n  As drug dealers discover new drugs and new methods of pushing their \npoison, we must make sure our legal system is adequately structured to \nreact appropriately. I believe this legislation does that.\n  Our proposal will modify the existing crack house statute so that its \njurisdiction over temporary events, such as raves, would be more clear. \nAnd although this legislation grew out of the problems identified at \nraves, the criminal and civil penalties in the bill would also apply to \npeople who promoted any type of event for the purpose of drug use or \ndistribution. Illegal drug use in any location should not be tolerated, \nregardless of what cover activity is created to hide the transaction.\n  This said, I want to emphasize that our legislation should in no way \nhamper the activities of legitimate event promoters. I realize that \ndrugs are not widely available at all raves or other events open to the \npublic. And I know that my colleagues Senator Biden is just as aware as \nI am that drug use occurs at events without the knowledge or \nendorsement of the event promoters. This legislation should not affect \nthe activities of legitimate event promoters. In no way is our bill \naimed at stifling any type of music or public expression, it is only \ntrying to deter illicit drug use and protect kids.\n  The sale of illicit narcotics, whether on a street corner here in \nWashington, D.C., or a warehouse in Des Moines, IA, must be confronted \nand halted wherever possible. One of the new, ``trendy'' illicit \nnarcotics is Ecstasy--an especially popular club drug that is all too \noften being sold at all-night dance parties, or raves. Ecstasy is an \nillegal drug that has extremely dangerous side effects.\n  In general, Ecstasy raises the heart rate to dangerous levels, and in \nsome cases the heart will stop. It also causes severe dehydration, a \ncondition that is exacerbated by the high levels of physical exertion \nthat happens at raves. Users must constantly drink water in an attempt \nto cool off--a fact that some unscrupulous event promoters take \nadvantage of by charging exorbitant fees for bottles of water, after \ncutting off water to drinking fountains and rest room sinks.\n  Too often, Ecstasy users collapse and die because their bodies \noverheat. And even those who survive the short-term effects of Ecstasy \nuse can look forward to long-term problems such as depression, \nparanoia, and confusion, as scientists have learned that Ecstasy causes \nirreversible changes to the brain.\n  Many young people perceive Ecstasy as harmless and it is wrongly \ntermed a recreational or ``kid-friendly'' drug. This illegal substance \ndoes real damage to real lives. Although targeted at teenagers and \nyoung adults, its use has spread to the middle-aged population and \nrural areas, including my own State of Iowa. Ninety percent of all drug \ntreatment and law enforcement experts say that Ecstasy is readily \naccessible in this country. We cannot continue to allow easy access to \nthis drug or ignore the consequences of its use.\n  That is why I believe it is important that we update the laws that \nhave been effectively used to shut down crack houses so they can go \nafter temporary events used as a cover to sell drugs. It is important \nto remember that this legislation builds upon an existing statute, with \nexisting case law, and therefore existing standards of how it is to be \nimplemented. The existing statute has been used to go after landlords \nwho ``knowingly and intentionally'' let their property be used for \nillegal narcotics activities. It has not, nor should it be used, to \ntake action against every landlord of every property where drug \nactivity takes place.\n  Similarly, the expansion of authorities created by this legislation \nis designed to target promoters who ``knowingly and intentionally'' \nallow drug use at their events. This is a high standard that should \nprotect event promoters from casual application of this statute. \nClearly, taking steps to reduce or eliminate drug use at an event, such \nas the posting of signs or through zero-tolerance instructions to \nsecurity personnel, are not actions that would be taken by someone who \nwould intentionally allow drug use to occur at an event.\n  I believe an event promoter does have some responsibility for what \ngoes on at an event that they create. Particularly if they knowingly \ncreate an event for the purpose of buying, using, keeping, or selling \ndrugs. While not common, there have been court cases which have been \nable to reach this high standard of proof. Using 21 U.S.C. 856, more \npopularly known as the ``crack house'' statute, law enforcement has \narrested drug dealers who hosted raves and other dance events as a \ncover to push their product. Four cases have been brought to Federal \ncourt, with mixed results--mostly because the applicability of current \nlaw is unclear.\n  This legislation is an important step, but a careful one. Our future \nrests with the young people of this great nation and America is at \nrisk. Ecstasy has shown itself to be a formidable threat and we must \nconfront it on all fronts, not only through law enforcement but \neducation and treatment as well. I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this legislation, and help us work towards its quick \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 227. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nloan forgiveness for certain loans to certified or licensed teachers, \nto provide for grants that promote teacher certification and licensing, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this bill \nwith Senator Harry Reid to increase the maximum loan cancellation \namount available to credentialed teachers from $5,000 to $10,000.\n  Educational research is clear: the single most important contributor \nto raising student achievement is having well-trained, high-caliber \nteachers in the classroom. And yet, far too many of our Nations' \nstudents are being taught by teachers who are not fully credentialed.\n  This is especially true in low-income communities, where 22 percent \nof the teachers do not have credentials, more than 10 times the rate in \nwealthy communities.\n  Because good teachers can make such a positive difference in the \nclassroom, the ``No Child Left Behind Act,'' signed by President Bush \nlast year, requires States to ensure that all teachers in our public \nschools are ``highly qualified'' by the 2005-2006 school year. This \nbenchmark, which I believe was long overdue, is one that I applaud and \nwas pleased to support last Congress.\n  And while we have taken a bold first step by committing that our \nchildren will receive quality education from a licensed teacher, our \nwork is far from over.\n  We must now strengthen our commitment by helping States look for new \nways to reach prospective teachers and build quality into their teacher \npreparation and development programs.\n  Nationwide, it is estimated that approximately 2 million new teachers \nwill need to be hired by 2009.\n  This statistic, combined with the reality that roughly 200,000 \nveteran teachers will need to get their teaching certificate by the \n2005 school year or lose their ability to teach, makes it clear that \nStates have an ambitious requirement to fulfill in a short amount of \ntime.\n  But many States and school districts argue that they lack the \nresources necessary to fulfill these mandates on their own.\n  The gravity of this problem is vividly depicted in California, where \nat least 300,000 new teachers will need to be hired and credentialed by \n2008 to replace retirees and to accommodate the projected population \ngrowth at a time when the State is experiencing a drastic budget \nshortfall. All of this must happen during a time when the State is \nexperiencing drastic budget shortfalls. The California State Board of \nEducation projects that all of these changes will cost $6 billion.\n  The $6 billion price tag does not include the costs associated with \ncredentialing 32,000 emergency credentialed teachers, which is 11 \npercent of California's entire workforce, by the 2005 school year. This \ntask alone would cost California $365 million.\n  And none of these cost-estimates take into account the cost of \ncredentialing teachers in other States with high percentages of the \nteaching work force not fully credentialed.\n  While I strongly believe that States need to be held accountable for \nensuring that all teachers are fully credentialed. But I also recognize \nthat in order for States to meet this Federal mandate on time, many may \nneed guidance and support from the Federal Government.\n  This is not just a matter of holding those in the local school \ndistrict or the local schoolhouse accountable; it is also a question of \nholding those in positions of public trust from the schoolhouse up to \nthe statehouse, and to the U.S. Capitol, too, accountable for making \nsure that the job gets done.\n  I believe that this bill takes a good first step in doing just that \nby creating a balance between State and Federal accountability and \naddressing two obstacles confronting school districts as they prepare \nfor the 2005 academic year: lack of incentives to lure teachers into \nteacher credentialing programs early and lack of resources available to \nteaching institutions to improve and build upon their credentialing \ncurriculum.\n  I believe that the Federal Government should recognize the value of \nhaving a qualified teacher in a low income classroom by enhancing the \nloan cancellation benefits of credentialed teachers.\n  Current law allows teachers to receive up to $5,000 of their student \nloans to be forgiven in exchange for 5 years of teaching in a low-\nincome school. Unfortunately, few teachers have taken advantage of this \nprogram because of the low loan cancellation amount available to them \nin comparison to the length of service required for eligibility.\n  To encourage recent graduates of teacher licensure programs to enter \nand remain in the teaching field, this bill doubles the maximum loan \ncancellation amount to $10,000 for credentialed teachers teaching for \nfive years in a low income school.\n  And while uncredentialed teachers would continue to be eligible for \nloan forgiveness available to all teachers under the current law, the \nenhanced benefits for uncredentialed teachers will expire on December \n31, 2005, just in time for the mandated deadline set for all teachers \nto be fully licensed.\n  The second element of my bill authorizes grants to institutions of \nhigher education to create and expand credentialing programs. Funds \nwould be made available to colleges and universities to develop and \nimplement teacher preparation programs including curriculum development \nthat focuses on credentialing teachers.\n  I strongly believe that teachers desiring to become credentialed \nshould have every resource available to them to do so. These components \nare meant to complement State programs already available to \ncredentialed teachers, which aim to improve teacher quality and tenure.\n  To California's credit, since the 1999-2000 school year, 5,000 \nemergency credentialed teachers have been successfully placed in State-\nbacked teacher preparation programs. And the State is working to create \nand improve teacher preparation programs that include relevant course \nwork, classroom training, and mentoring by a veteran teacher, with a \ngoal of full credentialing.\n  But this is not happening in every school district nationwide and it \nmust, States and local school districts should work together to \nprioritize available funds to set up programs to ensure that every \nteacher within their district is adequately trained.\n  States must continue to look for innovative ways to keep qualified \nteachers in the classroom, especially in low performing school \ndistricts, and funnel available Federal funds to local initiatives to \nget emergency certified teachers into credentialing programs.\n  We as a Nation must continue to make providing quality education to \nour children a top priority. Passing legislation is just the first \nstep. With the expected population growth and the need to replace \nteachers approaching retirement, States must act swiftly and \naggressively to ensure that neither children nor teachers are left \nbehind.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important piece \nof legislation that would give States and teachers the necessary \nresources to ensure that every teacher is a ``highly qualified'' \nteacher. Our Nation's students deserve nothing less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 228. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of social security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise to reintroduce, along with \nSenator Judd Gregg, the Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act. \nThis is critical legislation, especially in light of the increasing \nnumber of cases of identity theft.\n  In fact, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, this week announced that \nidentity theft is the Nation's top consumer fraud complaint for the \nthird consecutive year.\n  Last year, this legislation was approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and the Finance Committee was set to vote on it as well, but \nit got entangled in an unrelated, amendment.\n  It is my hope that Congress will approve this legislation this year, \nso that we can begin to protect one of the most fundamental rights of \nall Americans.\n  I believe all Americans should have the right to: control how their \npersonal identifying information is used. Keep their Social Security \nnumber out of the public domain. Limit disclosure by public agencies of \npersonal information; and I also believe that Americans have the right \nto expect that businesses and government agencies will\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nprotect your personal information held within their databases.\n  Lately, however, these rights have been seriously compromised by \nthieves who are stealing American's identity's in record numbers.\n  Just in the last year, identity theft cases have doubled nationwide. \nAmerican consumers filed approximately 163,000 identity theft \ncomplaints with the FTC in 2002. Fully 43 percent of all the complaints \nthe FTC receives are about identity theft.\n  My own State, California, has more victims than any other State. The \nFTC recorded 30,738 identity theft cases last year from California \nconsumers alone.\n  Senator Gregg and I are reintroducing our Social Security number \nprotection bill because Social Security numbers are the keys thieves \nuse to unlock and take over a person's identity.\n  Identity thieves use Social Security numbers to: fraudulently obtain \ncredit cards, access existing financial accounts, commit bank fraud, \nfalsely obtain employment and government benefits; and create \nadditional false identification documents, such as drivers' licenses.\n  Sally Twentyman, for instance, had her identity stolen when a thief \nrifled through her mail and stole credit card renewal forms.\n  The thief used her name and Social Security number to make $13,000 in \ncash advances and to open two additional credit card accounts in her \nname.\n  Not surprisingly, reports of Social Security number misuse have risen \nlockstep with the growth in identity theft.\n  Allegations of Social Security number fraud have increased by 600 \npercent over the past several years from 11,000 in 1998 to 73,000 in \n2003.\n  Social Security Number Prevention Act:\n  The goal of this legislation is straightforward, to get Social \nSecurity numbers out of the public domain so that identity thieves \ncan't access the number.\n  First, this bill prohibits anyone from selling or displaying an \nindividual's Social Security number to the general public without the \nindividual's consent, but does permit legitimate business-to-business \nand business-to-government uses of the number.\n  This practice occurs today. A stranger or stalker can buy your Social \nSecurity number off the Internet for a few dollars.\n  In one troubling case, Christopher Jones, a twenty-five-year old \nemployee at the University of North Carolina-Pembroke, stole \napproximately 3,000 Social Security numbers through his job handing out \ntowels and other equipment at the university gym.\n  In order to get equipment from Mr. Jones, students had to give him \ntheir Social Security numbers. Jones mined these numbers over several \nmonths and advertised the Social Security numbers for sale on eBay with \nan opening bid of $1.00 per number for a block of 1,000 numbers.\n  One advertisement, for example, read ``100 (one hundred social \nSecurity # Numbers Obtain False Credit Cards Idenity Theft I Don't Care \nBid Starts at a Dollar a Piece USPS Money Orders only all Different.''\n  Second, this legislation gives consumers the right to refuse to give \nout their Social Security numbers to companies that don't really need \nit.\n  Companies, however, can still require Social Security numbers for \npurposes under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, for background checks, if \nrequired by law, or if the number is necessary to verify identity or \nprevent fraud.\n  Third, this legislation curbs the public display of Social Security \nnumbers on government documents. Specifically, the bill removes Social \nSecurity numbers from government checks and driver's licenses.\n  In addition, the bill prohibits governments entities from displaying \nSocial Security numbers on public records that are posted on the \nInternet or in electronic media after the effective date of the act.\n  I don't believe a complete stranger should not be able to get access \nto my Social Security number from my birth certificate or marriage \nlicense, especially just by logging onto the Internet!\n  Finally, this legislation creates new penalties targeting the misuse \nof Social Security numbers. Specifically, the bill gives the Social \nSecurity Administration the authority to issue civil penalties of up to \n$5,000 for people who misuse Social Security numbers.\n  The bill also creates a maximum five year prison sentence for anyone \nwho obtains another person's Social Security number for purpose of \nlocating or identifying that individual with the intent to physically \nharm that person.\n  This legislation is fundamental to protecting the identities of \nAmerican citizens.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Gregg to secure its passage \nthis year, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social \n     security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     social security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n     security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     social security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of social security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a social security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3.
