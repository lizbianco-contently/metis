Mr. President, I take a few minutes today to speak \nabout recent events on The National Mall. The Mall, as Judge Buckley of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, has written, \n``is an area of particular significance in the life of the Capital and \nthe Nation.'' It is a 2-mile green area that stretches from the Capitol \nin the east to the Lincoln Memorial in the west. It is, as another \njudge noted, ``the site of monuments marking great figures and events \nin our Nation's history.'' But it is more than home to these enduring \nsymbols of our nationhood. This judge went on to say: ``Its grassy \nexpanse provides areas for any number of recreational activities. . . \n.''\n  The National Mall has also been used, of course, for large-scale \nevents.\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\nIt is used for the Fourth of July festivities each year and for the \nCherry Blossom Festival. Every 4 years, it is used for our inaugural \ncelebrations. It has been the site of national observances and \nprotests--some of the most famous in our Nation's history. ``It is \nhere,'' as Judge Buckley went on to say, ``that the constitutional \nright of speech and peaceful assembly find their fullest expression.''\n  Mr. President, Congress has entrusted the Department of the Interior, \nand particularly the National Park Service within the Department of the \nInterior, with preserving and regulating the use of this important part \nof our national heritage. It has, according to the statute, charged the \nNational Park Service with regulating the use of The Mall so as to \n``conform'' such use ``to the fundamental purpose'' of ``conserving the \nscenery and natural and historic objects . . . and providing for the \nenjoyment of the same in such manner . . . as will leave them \nunimpaired for their enjoyment by future generations.''\n  The Mall, as I have said, serves many purposes. None of those \npurposes that have been identified by the Congress or in regulation are \ncommercial purposes. Accordingly, the National Park Service regulations \nprovide that demonstrations and special events on The Mall may be held \nonly pursuant to permit issued by the Park Service. The rules prohibit \nthe commercial use of The Mall and specifically provide that ``no sales \nshall be made . . . and no article may be exposed for sale without a \npermit. . . .''\n  Despite the clear prohibitions in its own regulations, the Park \nService has now sanctioned a new use for this area. That use, \nunfortunately, can only be called commercial exploitation.\n  Earlier this month, to promote the start of the new football season, \nthe National Football League held what the Department of the Interior \ndescribed as a music and football festival entitled the ``NFL Kickoff \nLive From The National Mall Presented by Pepsi Vanilla.'' That was the \nofficial title of the event. To allow for the setup and removal of \ninfrastructure associated with this concert, the Park Service gave the \nNFL a permit to use The Mall for 17 days--the period between August 25 \nand September 10. The main event occurred on September 4. For many of \nthose days, much of The Mall was fenced off and the public was \nprevented from using it, although it obviously is one of the most \npopular spaces in our Nation's Capital.\n\n  I have spent a great deal of time on The Mall, as I am sure my \ncolleagues have, and I can tell you that currently, even without this \nkind of extravaganza, it is difficult to walk the length of The Mall \nfrom the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. Large areas are closed \nbecause of construction of the World War II Memorial and also \nconstruction of new security features at the Washington Monument. \nPortions of The Mall are also closed periodically following events, \nsuch as the Fourth of July activities or after large public gatherings, \nto allow for cleanup and restoration of the grassy areas.\n  In this case--the case of this NFL extravaganza--a large segment of \nThe Mall was essentially closed to the public to allow for what, in my \nopinion, can only be characterized as commercial use and as advertising \nby private corporations.\n  Let me start with this photograph and show that corporate sponsors of \nthe concert that occurred on September 4 were allowed to put up a large \nfence covered with advertising. This advertising talks about the \nkickoff of 2003 NFL, live from Washington, DC; AOL for broadband; Pepsi \nVanilla; Coors Light, and Verizon. This is advertising, in my view. \nThis is clearly commercial activity.\n  Apart from keeping the public off The Mall, the clear message to the \npublic was that The Mall had been turned over to these companies for \ncommercial purposes.\n  The National Park Service has published guidelines to help \norganizations that want to hold events on The Mall to know what is \nrequired. The guidelines state:\n\n       The theme of a special event must be consistent with the \n     mission of the park--\n\n  In this case, we are talking about The Mall. These guidelines apply \nto all of our national parks in the capital region.\n  They go on to say:\n\n     and appropriate to the park area in which it is to be held, \n     including consideration for possible damage and/or impairment \n     to park property, facilities, plantings and landscape \n     features . . . and park values.\n\n  Our Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, whose agency approved the \npermit for this event, maintains today that this was an appropriate use \nof The Mall because it was undertaken in partnership with the \nDepartment's ``Take Pride in America'' slogan promoting voluntarism on \npublic lands and because it was an event honoring members of our Armed \nForces.\n  Clearly, nobody objects to an event celebrating public volunteers or \nhonoring military personnel.\n  However, Secretary Norton's stated rationale for approving the event \nis simply not consistent with what actually took place on The Mall. It \nis not consistent, when you look at the banner surrounding The Mall, to \nsay this has anything to do with voluntarism or recognizing the \nmilitary.\n  This is a photograph of the event. Let me show another photograph \nwhich I think makes the case rather convincingly. This is a photograph \nof the event which was published in the Washington Post. This, \nevidently, is Secretary Norton's vision of an appropriate use of The \nMall.\n  It is impossible to miss the advertisements for Pepsi Vanilla or for \nVerizon, for Coors, and for its other sponsors, and you certainly \ncannot miss the huge football promoting the National Football League. \nIt is almost impossible, I suggest, to the untrained eye to find \nreferences to the supposed reasons for the event. The ``Take Pride in \nAmerica'' slogan does appear at the bottom of the advertising banners, \nand in the other photo it appears at the top of the fence, but I am \ncertain that nobody from any distance--I can barely read it from here--\nI am sure nobody can read it from any reasonable distance.\n  This photograph makes the point that the overwhelming image is \nturning over The Mall for commercial advertising. The event was used as \nthe basis for a commercial television production. Commercials were \nbroadcast to the crowd over large televisions that were located on The \nMall itself.\n  The Secretary of the Interior may view this as business as usual, \nbut, in my view, allowing this type of commercial activity with blatant \nproduct advertising is contrary to what the policy is for our national \nparks, including The Mall. It is also contrary to what responsible \npublic policy should be in this area.\n  During her confirmation hearing, I expressed concern to Secretary \nNorton that as Secretary of the Interior she would hold one of the \nhighest positions of public trust in our Nation's Government. The \nSecretary of the Interior is the principal guardian of our national \nparks and our most revered historic sites. Certainly, The National Mall \nis among the most important symbolic spaces in our country.\n  I was concerned that based on her previous public statements and \nwritings, she had a long record of having championed the interests of \ncorporations in opposition to the Federal Government. At her \nconfirmation hearing, Secretary Norton assured me she would enforce the \nlaws as written, and it is my understanding that in this case the laws \nand regulations of the Park Service made very clear The National Mall \nis not to be used as a venue for commercial purposes. It is not to be \nused as a venue for advertising. I do not see how anyone can look at \nthese photos and believe the Secretary carried out her responsibilities \nin this instance.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed legislation to authorize \nconstruction of an education center near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, \nvery much along the lines of a similar bill we passed in the Senate \nduring the last Congress. I was involved in negotiating the language \nfor that bill and tried to ensure that the National Park Service \nretained its ability to approve the site and the design of the center, \nand at the request of the Park Service we included language stating the \ncenter should be built ``consistent with the special nature and \nsanctity of The Mall.''\n  If these photographs reflect Secretary Norton's definition of ``the \nspecial nature and sanctity of The Mall,'' I have great concern about \nwhat, in\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\nfact, we are going to wind up protecting with regard to the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial. What can we reasonably tell those who intend to \noperate the educational center for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is not \npermitted if, in fact, all of this is permitted?\n\n  The National Park Service regulations generally prohibit commercial \nadvertising on public lands. In addition, the specific permit that was \nissued related to this event stated no commercial activity was to be \nconducted. Nevertheless, the Department of the Interior decided the \nactivity we see in this photograph was not commercial activity; that \nthese banners were not advertisements. In the view of the Park Service, \nthese were ``sponsor recognition.'' That is a distinction I was unaware \nof, between advertising and sponsor recognition. But clearly, the \nNational Park Service believes that distinction needs to be maintained.\n  Even though the National Football League was the organization that \nsponsored the concert, it was permitted to solicit other companies to \nunderwrite the event's expenses, and those other companies in turn were \npermitted to advertise on The Mall or, as the Interior Department put \nit, to obtain ``sponsor recognition.''\n  It is not clear where the authority comes from for this decision by \nthe National Park Service to allow such ``sponsor recognition.'' The \nagency's regulations clearly prohibit the display of commercial notices \nor advertisements on National Park Service lands except where the park \nsuperintendent determines the notices relate to products at that park \narea and the superintendent determines the notices are ``desirable and \nnecessary for the convenience and guidance of the public.'' I do not \nsee how these banners, these fence advertisements fit in to that \nrequirement.\n  It would have been one thing if this event had occurred and following \nit the Interior Department and the National Park Service had admitted a \nmistake had been made and they would take appropriate steps to prevent \nthis from occurring in the future. But the leadership of the Interior \nDepartment and the Park Service, from Secretary Norton on down, makes \nno such admission. They continue to insist this was entirely \nappropriate.\n  Secretary Norton may not care whether this type of event takes place \nagain on The Mall, but I do, and I think many of my colleagues will \nwhen they become better informed about this situation.\n  To better understand the Secretary's reasoning that this was not, in \nfact, commercial activity, that there was no commercial advertising \ntaking place, I am sending a letter to the Secretary requesting copies \nof the correspondence and the e-mails and the planning memos and other \ndocuments the Secretary relied on in concluding this was not commercial \nactivity.\n  The Secretary of the Interior and the National Park Service \nleadership maintain that commercial activity is not allowed on The \nMall; what took place here was not commercial. Since there apparently \nis a disconnect between what they say and the reality of what, in fact, \ntook place, I think the only solution is to change the law to make it \nclear, even to the Secretary, that this type of use is not appropriate \non The Mall.\n  When the Interior appropriations bill comes to the floor, I intend to \noffer an amendment to make it clear that future permits to hold special \nevents on The Mall may not include commercial advertising, whether they \ncouch that as ``sponsor recognition'' or not. I want to emphasize The \nMall clearly should continue to be available for large-scale events.\n  If the Secretary had approved a large concert to celebrate our troops \nor to promote her volunteer program, then there would not have been a \npublic outcry such as we have seen as a result of this situation. It \nwas her decision to allow the concert to be used for commercial \npurposes, to allow the commercial advertising that occurred here that, \nin my view, crossed the line.\n  If the Department of the Interior and National Park Service officials \nhad made any effort to advocate the protection of the resource with \nwhich they are charged to manage, then this would not have been a \nproblem. Since they have refused to do so, it seems to me we must \nchange the statute.\n  Last week, Albert Eisele of the Hill newspaper wrote an excellent \narticle entitled ``Desecration of The Mall.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of that article be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \neditorial entitled ``Marketing the Mall,'' and an article by Tom Shales \nin the Washington Post entitled ``America, Brought To You by . . . '' \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibits 2 and 3.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, The National Mall is more than just an \nexpanse of grass or an undeveloped field. It is a national treasure. By \nthe National Park Service's own account, it is the single most \nsignificant public park and open space in our Nation's Capital. It is \nvisited by millions of citizens and visitors from abroad each year.\n  It provides a formal work of landscape architecture of monumental \nproportions and provides the unifying element for the carefully placed, \ndiverse architectural symbols, repositories and shrines of the heritage \nof our democracy on and along its length.\n  There has been broad public agreement both in Washington and around \nthe country that allowing the type of activity that occurred at these \ncommercial events is a new low point in the storied history of The \nMall. Perhaps this will only be remembered as an unfortunate incident, \nbut we need to make sure that this is not the model for future events \non The Mall. We need to act to prohibit increased commercialization in \nour national parks, and a good place to start is acting to protect The \nMall.\n  When we do get to the actual voting on the issue, I hope my \ncolleagues will support the effort to protect The Mall from further \ncommercial exploitation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Hill, September 10, 2003]\n\n                        Desecration of the Mall\n\n                           (By Albert Eisele)\n\n       An older colleague who wrote a daily column in the St. Paul \n     Pioneer Press when I worked there many years ago once told me \n     his best columns were those generated by a sense of outrage.\n       If so, this should be one of my best columns, as few things \n     have offended me more than the disgraceful display of \n     mindless patriotism, insatiable commercialism and sheer bad \n     taste perpetrated last week by the National Football League \n     with its $10 million rock concert extravaganza on the Mall.\n       I wasn't there and didn't watch it on ABC-TV--thank God--\n     but one photograph in Friday's Washington Post convinced me \n     that aside from the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon and \n     subsequent anthrax attacks, last fall's sniper shootings or \n     the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, this was \n     the worst thing that's happened here during my nearly 40 \n     years in the nation's capital.\n       The spectacle of pop singer Britney Spears being stripped \n     to her black bikini bottoms to just above pubic level by a \n     pair of male dancers wearing Washington Redskins jerseys, \n     with the Capitol shining in the background, was so jarring \n     that it made me want to cringe.\n       Spear's display of erotic gyrations and lip-synched lyrics \n     may have a place in our appalling, vulgarized popular culture \n     but definitely not in the middle of the nation's most \n     hallowed public space.\n       It was bad enough that this dreadful promotion designed to \n     kick off the 2003 pro football season--and sell Pepsi \n     Vanilla, AOL and Reeboks--took place just a week after the \n     40th anniversary of Martin Luther King's immortal ``I Have a \n     Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Or that \n     it took place just before the second anniversary of the awful \n     day when Islamic terrorists crashed a jetliner into the \n     Pentagon and were barely prevented from flying over the Mall \n     to crash another into the White House or the Capitol.\n       But it was even worse that President Bush and Interior \n     Secretary Gale Norton were persuaded to serve as cheerleaders \n     for a so-called game that celebrates violence--as if we don't \n     have enough already--and that has owners who personify \n     rapacious greed. This was nothing more than the desecration \n     of a sacred space and an insult to the men and women of the \n     U.S. military whom the event's promoters professed to honor.\n       The president perhaps can be excused from accepting bad \n     advice but not those who persuaded him to lend the dignity of \n     his office to an event that left the rain-soaked Mall \n     trampled and garbage-strewn, both physically and \n     symbolically.\n       Somebody, ideally the congressman whose committees oversee \n     the Department of Interior and the National Park Service, \n     should\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n     demand an explanation of who was responsible for allowing \n     this travesty to happen.\n       If they don't, what can we expect to see next? An ad for \n     Viagra on the Washington Monument? A pitch for McDonald's at \n     the Lincoln Memorial or Toyota at the Jefferson Memorial? Or \n     maybe even a banner on the Capitol Dome offering low-interest \n     loans from Citibank to ease the federal deficit?\n       I have nothing against pro football, and I'm glad the \n     Redskins won their opener, even as I despair of Major League \n     Baseball ever returning to Washington. Nor do I disagree that \n     many in the crowd that the NFL generously estimated at \n     125,000 thought it was wonderful that Britney and her fellow \n     entertainers were invited to do their thing on the Mall.\n       Nevertheless, I'm outraged and saddened. This was a low \n     point for a special space that stands for so much in America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 3, 2003]\n\n                           Marketing the Mall\n\n       Three days of football activities culminating in a concert \n     bash with celebrities ranks right up there with the Friskies \n     Alpo Canine Frisbee Disc World Finals as the kind of event \n     with a commercial flavor that has been allowed to set up shop \n     on the Mall in recent years. The National Park Service, which \n     oversees the Mall, has in the past permitted other activities \n     to take up space with exhibits, programs and corporate \n     sponsors (including The Washington Post, which has been a \n     sponsor of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival). But the ``NFL \n     Kickoff Live 2003, Presented by Pepsi Vanilla,'' the \n     promotional activity underway on the land between the Capitol \n     grounds and the Washington Monument, is, for sheer space and \n     length of occupancy, in a class by itself when it comes to \n     hawking a commercial sporting event. Is it the last of its \n     kind? Or is this commercialization of the Mall, marketing the \n     National Football League and Pepsi's new soft drink, the \n     start of a new and a fundamental debasement of a national \n     shrine?\n       Nearly $10 million bought the NFL and its sponsors the \n     right to take over the large expanse of federal land for 11 \n     days (including setup time), reports Post staff writer David \n     Montgomery. Pepsi is in the deal for $2.5 million, other co-\n     sponsors include a beer company and the New York Stock \n     Exchange. Pepsi is likely to get its money's worth: At every \n     angle of the nationally televised concert to be aired before \n     tomorrow night's Washington Redskins-New York Jets game, \n     cameras will be able to capture Pepsi Vanilla signs. Ten \n     million dollars not only gets the NFL and other businesses a \n     huge claim on public space: For the first time in Mall \n     history, network television will have the right to beam a \n     professional sporting event, complete with commercial \n     advertisements, on America's core promenade.\n       What next?\n       We ask this question knowing full well that the \n     participatory events, sports clinics and autograph sessions \n     with famous former NFL stars are great fun and the kind of \n     buildup certainly fitting for the launch of the 2003 season. \n     As a marketing tool, a four-day spectacle, including a \n     concert paying tribute to the U.S. military, is probably good \n     for professional football and the promoters of Pepsi. It \n     certainly will be a nice celebration for the NFL's 2,000 VIP \n     guests invited to the Thursday night concert. The Park \n     Service has given the NFL permission to serve wine and Coors \n     beer to its special Mall guests--Coors being an event \n     sponsor. Regular concertgoers will be screened and no alcohol \n     will be allowed.\n       And do onto the Mall--a space that, as the National Park \n     Service observes, is as old as the capital city itself, one \n     commissioned by George Washington and planned by Pierre \n     L'Enfant to be an ``ideal stage for national expressions of \n     remembrance, observance and protest--comes now Pepsi Vanilla, \n     the National Football league, and Coors beer. Is this the \n     beginning, or will it be, mercifully, the beginning of the \n     end for a trend out of control?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 5, 2003]\n\n                    America, Brought To You by . . .\n\n                            (By Tom Shales)\n\n       American bad taste is the most powerful bad taste in the \n     world. That seems to be what was really being celebrated on \n     the Mall last night at an excruciating 55-minute rock concert \n     ostensibly convened to herald the new pro football season and \n     televised live on the struggling ABC network.\n       The event was deemed so auspicious that George W. Bush took \n     yet more time off from fighting the war on terrorism to \n     appear, via videotape, at the end of the concert and just \n     before the game, in the manner of a TV huckster. He tried to \n     make some connection between football and ``the spirit that \n     guides the brave men and women'' of the military, much as the \n     concert had done.\n       He also said pro football ``celebrates the values that make \n     our country so strong.'' Like what, violence and greed?\n       Then, in intense close-up, the leader of the Free World \n     asked the trademarked rhetorical question, ``Are you ready \n     for some football?''\n       Some bureaucrat whose thinking cap had blown off authorized \n     lending the once-solemn, or at least dignified, Mall to this \n     very raucous and very commercial event. The show was a \n     collaboration between the NFL, apparently trying to lure \n     younger viewers to football, and, as the announcer said, \n     ``New Pepsi Vanilla and Diet Pepsi Vanilla, the Not-So \n     Vanilla Vanilla.''\n       The not-so-musical music included a performance by bouncy \n     sex bunny Britney Spears, whose vocalizing was clearly \n     prerecorded and badly lip-synced--but then who knew what the \n     heck she was singing about anyway? Spears depended heavily on \n     elaborate pyrotechnics and on manic aerobic-erotic \n     choreography during her two numbers; dancers hurled \n     themselves, cartwheeled, tumbled and even crawled across the \n     stage.\n       At one point, she gamboled about amid, literally, great \n     balls of fire--apparently forgetting that Michael Jackson's \n     hair was once set ablaze while he was filming a Pepsi \n     commercial.\n       There was also, as part of the alleged dancing, what's \n     commonly referred to as ``some girl-on-girl action'' (Spears \n     and Madonna kissed on the lips on a recent MTV special), as \n     well as writhing onstage costume changes. When they weren't \n     being groped or fondled by her, dancers helped Spears strip \n     her pants off, revealing a bikini-like black bottom for the \n     second number. They even helped straighten out the little \n     pixie's shorty shorts so that they didn't reveal too much. Or \n     maybe so that they did.\n       Spears just kept singing, singing, singing. Or rather \n     syncing, syncing, syncing. But the feeling some of us at home \n     were having would be better described as sinking, sinking, \n     sinking.\n       Also appearing was a Waldorf-born rock band called Good \n     Charlotte, rock veterans Aerosmith--who did so many numbers \n     they turned it into an Aerosmith concert--and popular \n     supershrieker Mary J. Blige, who apparently prefers a strange \n     squatting position when she wails and screams.\n       The only really respectable musical performance, also \n     clearly recorded in advance, was the majestic Aretha \n     Franklin's overblown yet effective rendition of the national \n     anthem. Of course on the line ``rockets' red glare,'' red \n     fireworks were set off at the back of the stage. The show, \n     directed and co-produced by Joel Gallen, was a never-let-\n     well-enough-alone production.\n       A closed credit, ``Paid for by the NFL,'' suggested the \n     football league bought the time outright from ABC and then \n     sold the commercial minutes. Many of the ads were, of course, \n     for new Pepsi Vanilla and Diet Pepsi Vanilla, the Not-So-\n     Vanilla Vanilla (when will they come out with not-so-\n     chocolate chocolate?), but there was also a super-kinetic \n     blitz of a commercial for Reebok Vector shoes, scored to the \n     opening chorus from Carl Orff's ``Carmina Burana,'' one of \n     the most frequently appropriated pieces of 20th-century \n     classical music.\n       When Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini included a bit \n     of ``Carmina Burana'' in his borderline-obscene film \n     ``Salo,'' he explained he did so because he considered it \n     ``fascist music.'' We just note that in passing.\n       Each musical act was introduced by a former NFL star--Joe \n     Theismann and Joe Namath opened the show together--teamed \n     with a member of the armed forces. Theismann said of the \n     concert, ``It's a national moment of remembrance,'' which \n     really seems preposterous in light of what followed. A woman \n     representing the Coast Guard said, ``I'm proud to be an \n     American'' before introducing Aerosmith.\n       During a brief cutaway to FedEx Field in Landover, game \n     announcer John Madden and Al Michaels argued briefly over \n     which player seemed more ``juiced'' for the Redskins-Jets \n     game that was soon--they promised--to follow. Then back to \n     the Mall for more eardrum-shattering rock.\n       While the sun still shone, the beautiful U.S. Capitol \n     provided an unlikely and, it seemed, reluctant backdrop for \n     the acts. When night came, and the dome was lit up, it \n     appeared to recede a bit into the distance, as if in shame.\n       Perhaps the Mall will be available now to every American \n     for weddings, birthday parties and bar mitzvahs. No, probably \n     not. You'll have to be a giant corporation to take over this \n     precious public space and, in effect, spill a ton of garbage \n     all over it.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask to speak for 5 minutes under the morning business \nprovision under which we are now operating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for his very eloquent speech in regard to the life and \ncontributions of Johnny Cash. I suppose some might wonder why people in \nthe Senate would stand up and choose basically to praise an individual \nwho some might think was a simple country western star. Simple is \nright. But, perhaps, they would ignore the fact that this was a unique \nstar in the horizon of stars that means a lot to Americans.\n  The Senator from Tennessee called him ``the poet for the working \npoor.'' I might call him the minstrel for the working poor.\n  I came across Johnny Cash when I was in Phoenix, AR trying to be the \nWilliam Allen White of Arizona with a career in journalism. Up to that \npoint, I had not been a country-and-western aficionado, if you will, or \neven a fan. Then, in a place called South Phoenix, which is certainly \nhistory now, the performers would perform in California, stop in \nPhoenix and go on their way to Texas. I am trying to think of the \nvarious performers who came in there, along with Johnny Cash. He was \npart of that show. I think it was before Waylon Jennings and Willie \nNelson. I really can't think of other performers. It doesn't make much \ndifference. But people wanted to come and see Johnny Cash. Other \nperformers finished--and the South Phoenix ballroom was not exactly the \nMetropolitan Opera in terms of demeanor and what went on there. People \nused to see the shows and then stay and watch the fights.\n  But anyway, the lights went off and then the spotlight went on. And \nhere was this tall man in black, who said, ``Hello. I am Johnny Cash.'' \nAnd the place erupted. He went through the repertoire of his famous \nhits at that particular time. He was magnetic in his appeal. He had a \nspecial appeal for the people who could really identify with what he \nwas singing in terms of their daily life, their pocketbooks, and the \nchallenges they went through.\n  The second time I had an opportunity to hear him was when he came to \nWashington at the Merriweather Post Pavilion. The place was packed. At \nthat time, he was married to June Carter. I think that was probably the \ntop act in show business, at least on the western and country side.\n  The thing I wanted to mention is we had the Bicentennial ceremonies \nhere on The Mall in 1976. The Senator from New Mexico indicated The \nMall is sacred ground--until we had our Bicentennial ceremonies. We \nwent through quite a bit of activity in getting the Capitol spruced up. \nA lot of artwork was redone at that particular time.\n  Guess who the master of ceremonies was on The Mall celebrating our \nNation's 200th anniversary. Johnny Cash. Guess who performed at a Joint \nSession of Congress with his rendition of Our Flag. I think I have that \nright. I may have it wrong. But there is a beautiful rendition--a \nhistoric rendition--of the Flag. He sang, I believe, a medley of \npatriotic songs before the Senate and the House.\n  I thought to myself: Here is someone who came from the Depression, \nwho had a rough time in show business, and then was a great \nentertainer. And who else would be more appropriate to head up the \nBicentennial ceremonies than Johnny Cash?\n  The third time I had an opportunity to meet him was at the Kennedy \nCenter Honors where he was being honored along with great performers of \nour day. His health was none too good. But I stood in line with \neverybody else shaking his hand. I said to him, ``I wanted to see the \nman in black. I saw you in Phoenix way back in 1962. I was very proud \nof you in 1976 when you headed up the Bicentennial, and it is a real \npleasure and a privilege to make your acquaintance as of today.''\n  He was a very down-home man, very humble, and said it was a \nprivilege. He asked my name. We had a very nice conversation. I can't \nthink of any other entertainer who represents American talent better \nthan Johnny Cash.\n  I have, by the way, I tell the Presiding Officer, about eight \nalbums--not CDs, albums. If we could just find a turntable, we could go \nback to Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Trio, and later we could ``Walk \nThe Line'' together.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11433-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11433-S11434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GOVERNMENT AGENCY RUN AMOK\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I brought with me to the floor a picture \nof a woman named Joan Slote. Joan, as you can see, is a bicyclist, \nstanding there with a bicycle helmet and a bicycling outfit. She is a \nsenior olympian. She is a 74-year-old grandmother of six and a champion \ncyclist. She rides about 100 miles a week, and has pedaled her bicycle \nthrough 21 countries.\n  I am showing a picture of Joan Slote on the Senate floor because she \nis in trouble with the Federal Government. Joan Slote never sought to \ndeceive the U.S. Federal Government. She responded to a Toronto-based \nadventure catalog for a bicycle trip to Cuba. It intrigued her. It \nsaid, incorrectly, in the advertisement that U.S. law does not bar \ncitizens from visiting Cuba as long as they fly there through Canada. \nSo Joan Slote, this grandmother cyclist, joined a cycling trip through \nCuba.\n  When she returned to the United States through Canada, they asked her \nwhere she had been. She said she had been in Canada and prior to that \nhad been in Cuba. So she was not attempting to deceive anyone.\n  Guess what happened to this grandmother? She went from her home on \nthe west coast to Europe on a bicycling trip. While she was gone, she \nlearned her son had a brain tumor. She rushed back, packed some clothes \nin her place in Oregon, and rushed to her son's side. He died of this \nbrain tumor. She finally got back home and she saw letters from OFAC, \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control, at the U.S. Department of \nTreasury. OFAC was upset because Joan Slote had been to Cuba. They told \nthis 74-year-old grandmother the Feds were hot on her trail and that \nthe Feds wanted a $7,600 fine from her. The Feds wanted $7,600 dollars \nfrom this grandmother because she violated American laws by travelling \nto Cuba.\n  We have people down here at the Department of Treasury looking after \nJoan Slote and people like her.\n  They fined her $7,600 because she visited Cuba and spent $38 there. \nSince that time, OFAC added penalties and interest until the total was \nalmost $10,000. Then a few months ago in July, Joan Slote received a \ncollection letter saying she would pay up in 10 days or they would \nstart attaching her Social Security payments. They say, we are slapping \nyou with a big fine; you are obviously a problem for this country.\n  Let me remind listeners, this is the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl. This is the office that is supposed to be tracking terrorism \nin the Department of Treasury. This is the office that ought to be busy \nfull time tracking the movement of terrorist funds across this world. \nAs a matter of fact that is what most of the employees in the Office of \nForeign Assets Control do. But not all of them.\n  Some of them are taken off those duties to make sure Joan Slote does \nnot undermine this country's interests by visiting Cuba. They are \nchasing a retired schoolteacher riding a bicycle in Cuba trying to slap \nher with a fine. They cannot find Osama bin Laden but they can sure \nfind this retired grandmother. They are determined to levy a fine on \nthis grandmother.\n  I learned about that. They wanted to take it out of her Social \nSecurity payments if she did not pay the fine. Her\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\nmonthly income, by the way, is $1,200, so she is no match for the Feds.\n  The Feds are a big, strong, bulky group of people going after this \nlady. Earning $1,200 a month income, she is no match for the Feds. She \ncalled OFAC and told them she had not been home to get her mail and she \nhad not responded to their notice because her son had brain cancer and \ndied. She asked if they would give her a hearing. Absolutely not, they \nsaid. Wouldn't give her a hearing and would not reduce her fine by one \ncent.\n  I met Joan at a conference and I got involved in her case. I called \nOFAC and said: You ought to be embarrassed.\n  I know there is law against U.S. citizens traveling in Cuba. It is a \nfoolish law that ought to be repealed. The House of Representatives has \nnow, incidentally, voted to prohibit the enforcement of that law. But \nthe fact is this country long ago decided to try to punish Fidel Castro \nby limiting the ability of the American people to travel. The nuttiest \nidea I ever heard of. So we end up saying to Joan Slote that you have \nto pay a fine.\n  Well, I got involved and said to the OFAC folks: You ought to be \nashamed of yourself and you ought to be embarrassed. They agreed to \nreduce her fine to $1,900. I don't think she should have paid a cent, \nbut they reduced it to $1,900. So Joan paid $1,900 with two checks. She \npaid the $1,900. She lives on $1,200 a month.\n  Then this morning I received this email from her:\n\n       I sent the settlement money in two payments, one in July \n     and paying it all by the end of August. I checked with the \n     bank and the bank said the checks have not been cashed as of \n     a week ago. Two weeks ago I got a letter from a collection \n     agency asking for about $10,000 and a letter from the Social \n     Security system telling me they will start reducing my Social \n     Security payments in November.\n\n  Shame on the Federal Government. Do we have completely and totally \nincompetent Federal agencies? No. 1, they are chasing old ladies riding \nbicycles when they ought to be chasing terrorists. She may not like me \ncalling her an old lady, but she is a 74-year-old senior bicyclist. She \nis proud of what she does. She bicycles in the Olympics. And she has \nthe Federal Government after her. They ought to be chasing terrorists, \nnot retired schoolteachers biking in Canada. What are they thinking? Is \nthere no common sense at all at the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n  I had the Secretary of the Treasury in front of a committee a year \nand a half ago. He got in trouble because he answered the question \nhonestly. I liked him. He was a guy who said what was on his mind. I \nsaid: Let me ask you a question. Don't you think if you could use your \nassets the way you want to use your assets in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, you would pull employees off of tracking little old \nschoolteachers and others from bicycling in Cuba and instead use all of \nyour muscle and all of your energy and all of your resources to track \nterrorism? Don't you think that is where the priorities ought to be?\n  Well, he did not answer. I asked again. He didn't answer. I asked \nagain and finally he said: Of course. Of course I prefer that be the \ncase. But he got in mighty big trouble, according to the press, with \nthe White House because there is a political correctness about this \nissue of travel to Cuba and they want the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl to clamp down on the folks. Go get them.\n\n  Let me tell you who they are getting: Joan Slote. She should not have \nhad to pay a penny. Not a penny.\n  How about Cevin Allen, Washington State. He traveled to Cuba to bury \nthe ashes of his late father, a Pentecostal minister of \nprerevolutionary Cuba who wanted his ashes buried on the grounds of the \nformer church he had in Cuba. OFAC tried to slap his son with a $20,000 \nfine for taking his father's ashes to bury them on the church grounds \nin Cuba.\n  He told the hearing that I chaired on this subject that the trip to \nCuba let him deal with the pain of losing his parents. But he said the \ngood feelings from giving them the burial he knew they wanted and \nreuniting with friends from his childhood when his parents were \nmissionaries in Cuba were crumbled when he came home to face hostile \nofficials and the fine for traveling to Cuba illegally.\n  Then there is Tom Warner who is 77 years old. Tom Warner has not even \ntraveled to Cuba. He is a World War II veteran. He posted on his Web \nsite the schedule for the February 2002 annual meeting of the United \nStates-Cuba Sisters Cities Association in Havana. What happened to him? \nThis 77-year-old World War II veteran heard from OFAC. OFAC accused him \nof organizing, arranging, promoting, and otherwise facilitating the \nattendance of persons at a conference in Cuba without a license. Mind \nyou, this World War II veteran never went to Cuba. He simply posted on \na Web site the information he had about a Sisters Cities meeting in \nCuba. Warner got a letter from OFAC giving him 20 days to tell OFAC \neverything he knew about the conference and the organizing folks who \nparticipated in it. He has since, of course, hired a lawyer.\n\n  I just don't understand. We can travel to Communist China. We can \ntravel to Communist Vietnam. We can travel virtually anywhere in the \nworld except for three countries: Cuba, Libya, and, for now, Iraq.\n  The fact is, other Communist countries, we are told, will move in the \nright direction through engagement: engage them in trade and travel and \nthat is the way to persuade them to move in the right direction towards \ngreater human rights, towards democracy.\n  With Cuba, for 40-some years, we have been telling people: Well, you \ncannot travel there, you cannot trade there, because somehow that would \nbe giving aid and comfort to the Castro government.\n  Well, the best way to give aid and comfort to the Castro government \nis to continue this embargo. The best way to undermine the Castro \ngovernment is through trade and travel. It is what we do in China. It \nis what we do in Vietnam. It is what we ought to do with respect to \nCuba. But the reason I came to the floor today is to say this poor \nwoman ought not to be chased by the Federal Government. She has done \nnothing wrong. She made a mistake by responding to an advertisement in \na magazine that said what she was going to do on this bicycle trip was \nnot illegal. She did it in good faith and now comes home to have the \nFederal Government chase her.\n  What is galling to me is the agency in the Federal Government--the \nTreasury Department and this little organization called OFAC, which we \nrequire to track terrorists--is using their resources to chase Joan \nSlote. Shame on them.\n  We are going to try to change the law in the Senate. I am going to \noffer an amendment to the Treasury appropriations bill that is \nidentical, word for word, with every punctuation mark, that was in the \nHouse bill. I think it passed the House by 40 votes. My expectation is, \nif we have a chance to vote on it, it will pass the Senate as well.\n  It simply says this travel ban makes no sense. We ought not enforce \nthe travel ban. No one ought to be chasing a retired schoolteacher or a \nbicyclist or someone who takes their father's ashes back to bury in \nCuba.\n  I don't know. Maybe the folks at Treasury can be just embarrassed \ninto doing the right thing. But it is inexplicable to me that we talk \nabout homeland security, we talk about fighting terrorism, and then we \nhave an agency of the Federal Government that is using its resources to \ndo this.\n  Yes, I know what the law is. But I also know what the priority is: to \nuse scarce enforcement dollars to track terrorists. Common sense would \ntell you not to divert those dollars to try to take part of the Social \nSecurity payments away from this retired woman because she went on a \nbicycle trip in Cuba.\n  That is the kind of heavy-handed Federal Government I do not want to \nbe a part of. I believe we ought to do something legislatively to \naddress that situation, and I intend to do that when we have the right \nappropriations bill on the floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11434-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11434-S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

I want to join\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\nthem in pointing out my special concern about what is happening with \nrespect to nuclear weapons.\n  We have roughly 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world--30,000 nuclear \nweapons, the use of any one of which would cause a catastrophe, as all \nof us know. So we have had what we call a doctrine of mutually assured \ndestruction for a long, long while, with the other nuclear superpower \nbelieving no one would be able to use a nuclear weapon in an attack \nbecause they would be obliterated by the other side.\n  That doctrine of mutually assured destruction has lasted for well \nover a half century. There are many in the world that aspire to achieve \nnuclear weapons for their own use--terrorists and other countries.\n  The world depends on us and on our leadership to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. There is no--I repeat, there is no--duty that is more \nimportant, in my judgment, than for this country to use its leadership \ncapability to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. For surely, if \nnuclear weapons proliferate in this world, they will, one day, be used, \nand when used in anger will persuade others to use them; and this Earth \nwill not be the kind of Earth that we recognize in the future.\n  The Energy and Water appropriations bill contains certain money to \ndevelop new bunker-buster nuclear weapons and to come up with so-called \nadvanced concepts for new more ``useable'' nuclear weapons, and it has \nmoney to make it easier to end the ban on testing so we would begin \ntesting once again.\n  This is, in my judgment, reckless discussion, reckless talk. It \ncertainly falls under the rubric of free speech and free debate, but I \nhappen to think this country ought to say to the rest of the world: We \nwant to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, No. 1. And we don't need \nto develop new nuclear weapons. We have far more than anyone needs. And \nsecond, the last thing we ought to do is to suggest to anyone there is \na green light for anyone to use, at any time, under any circumstances, \nnuclear weapons.\n  Here on this chart is what the House of Representatives said in their \nreport recently about the administration's plans for nuclear weapons:\n\n       It appears to the Committee the Department is proposing to \n     rebuild, restart, and redo and otherwise exercise every \n     capability that was used over the past forty years of the \n     Cold War and at the same time prepare for a future with an \n     expanded mission for nuclear weapons.\n\n  As indicated on this other chart, here is the stockpile of nuclear \nweapons--roughly 30,000. We have about 10,000; the Russians have about \n18,000--you can see a few others around--the use of any one of which or \nthe stealing of any one of which or the loss of any one of which to a \nterrorist group or a rogue nation would be devastating if they were to \ndetonate.\n  The people who are talking about developing new nuclear weapons are \nsaying: What we ought to do is take a look at earth-penetrating, \nbunker-buster nuclear weapons. What a wonderful idea that is, they say.\n  Well, the best scientists tell us you cannot penetrate the earth much \nmore than 45 or 60 feet; you just can't. But they are talking about \nnuclear weapons up to 1 megaton, 60 to 70 times bigger than the \nHiroshima bomb. That is what they talk about here: earth-penetrating, \nbunker-buster nuclear weapons. That means this country would build a \nnuclear weapon that we could actually use, not to deter someone else \nfrom using it, but a nuclear weapon that would be a useful weapon for \ndesigner purposes. If you have a bunker that you can't bust, lob over a \nnuclear weapon.\n\n  Here is a picture of what a 100-kiloton nuclear explosion 635 feet \nunderground does at the surface. These are not tiny, little designer \nnuclear weapons. These are huge explosions.\n  The explosion shown on this picture was 635 feet underground. Likely, \na bunker-buster weapon would be detonated at 50 to 60 feet underground.\n  The point is this: We have a responsibility in this country, it seems \nto me, on these policies to exhibit great restraint. We have countries \nin the world that do have nuclear weapons, and we worry a great deal \nabout them using them. India and Pakistan each have nuclear weapons. \nThey don't like each other very much. There have been moments when we \nhave been very concerned about the command and control of nuclear \nweapons in some other countries.\n  Our job, at this point, is not to be talking about building new \nnuclear weapons: low-yield nuclear weapons, bunker-buster, earth-\npenetrator nuclear weapons, to begin testing nuclear weapons. Our job, \nit seems to me, is to talk about restraint.\n  We have all the nuclear weapons we will ever need, well over 10,000, \nboth theater and strategic nuclear weapons. We do not need to be \nbuilding more. We do not need to talk about using nuclear weapons. \nThose who talk about building specific-use nuclear weapons and saying \nthere is a use for actual employment of nuclear weapons in conflict, \nthat is not, in my judgment, in the long-term interests of this world \nor this country. I hope we will exhibit much more restraint than that.\n  I know some will say: Well, we are simply beginning research on some \nof these issues. I say we do not need to research earth-penetrating, \nbunker-buster nuclear weapons. That is not in our country's interest, \nwith due respect.\n  What we ought to do is to exhibit every ounce of energy that we can \nand that we have to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, so that, \nGod forbid, other countries do not acquire nuclear weapons, and then \nbegin to work to reduce the number of nuclear weapons around the rest \nof the world.\n  I know the amendment that will be offered by my colleague Senator \nFeinstein, this afternoon, will be controversial and will be debated. I \nrespect people who do not share my own opinion on this issue, but I \nfeel very strongly that the only conceivable future for nuclear \nweapons--for my children and grandchildren and yours--is to try to \nprevent nuclear weapons from ever again being used. That is the only \nthoughtful and conceivable future that will not address the future of \nthis world in a very negative way.\n  We must use our leadership capabilities. We are a great country and a \nmighty country. We must use our capabilities to persuade others that \nthe use of nuclear weapons is not something that is thinkable or \nconceivable. We must exert every energy to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons to so many others who want to obtain them in a way that would \nbe destructive to our long-term interests.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11435-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11435-S11451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2754, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2754) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when we called this bill up, we called \nup the House version. I ask unanimous consent that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, the text of Calendar No. 213, S. 1424, the \nSenate committee-reported bill, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill, \nas amended, be considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendments; provided that no points of order be waived by reason of \nthis agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, the energy and water \nappropriations bill, as reported out unanimously by the subcommittee \nand Committee on Appropriations, is pending. One amendment--there may \nbe others--we are awaiting is a Feinstein, et al., amendment to be \noffered and debated. I don't believe it serves any purpose for the \nSenator from New Mexico to discuss the issue until the amendment is \noffered. As a consequence, I am going to yield the floor and put in a \nquorum call, with the full understanding that Senator Feinstein intends \nto offer shortly her amendment. And from what I understand, an hour \nlater, at about 3:30, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, is going to speak in support of the Feinstein amendment. In \nbetween those, I will speak, and there may very\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\nwell--either this afternoon before we recess and go into morning \nbusiness, or early in the morning--be other Senators on either side who \nmight want to speak to this issue. I am not totally aware of that.\n  It is not the intention of the Senator from New Mexico that we go on \nindefinitely. This is a well-known amendment. We voted on something \nlike it already once. But this is different in some respects. It is \nappropriations. So in that context, it is actual money instead of \nauthorizing.\n  Having said that, everyone should now know the bill that is pending \nis the Senate-reported energy and water bill. All of you who had water \nprojects that you asked about, you can have your staff look to see if \nyou were successful. We have attempted to advise most of you. I can say \nthat to the extent we have had to be arbitrary because of a shortage of \nmoney, it has principally been when we have somebody asking for a new \nauthorization. We haven't been able to do that in this bill. With \nrespect to the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, we \nhaven't started any new programs. So if you asked us for that, you may \nsay: Gee, they didn't treat me right. It may be that you have to come \nand ask, and that is the reason. It is not a new authorization.\n  We have tried our very best to do what we could with a shortage of \nmoney in the Corps, which I have already explained to the Senate. I \nexplain it every year. We could pull the record player out and repeat \nit because every year Presidents do the same thing. They leave out \nprojects, and they don't put in enough money. And then we come along \nand we have the most desired projects of all because if you are \nchairman Senators stuff your pockets with requests. They come in \nsaying: Please help with this. It is a little project in my State. But \nit seems as though we are the only ones who understand how important \nthese little projects are to Senators. It doesn't seem as though the \nadministration--this one, other ones--thinks it is very important.\n  They are not all in here. But a few more than the President was able \nto put in are here in this bill. So please look. And if you have any \ncomplaints, bring them to us. We will do our best. We will even explain \nto you, if we turned you down, that it is a new project. We will \nexplain what that means and why we have no alternative. When we can't \npay for the ones we have, we can't be adding any new ones.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from California. Whether she \ndesires to offer the amendment is up to her. I yield the floor at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1655\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. \nThere should be no doubt in anyone's mind that this administration is \nreopening the nuclear door. They are doing this to develop essentially \na new generation of nuclear weapons. They call them low yield. It is \ncontained in words such as ``advanced concepts.'' Essentially, they are \nbattlefield tactical nuclear weapons.\n  This latest Defense authorization bill reversed the Spratt-Furse \namendment which had existed for 10 years and had prohibited the \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons. So for 10 years there was a \nprohibition on this reopening of the nuclear door.\n  With this year's Defense authorization bill, that went down the \ntubes. Now we see in this Energy appropriations bill money to move \nalong in the development and the research of these weapons.\n  What is interesting to me is when you ask these questions in \ncommittee, as I did of Secretary Rumsfeld--and I will get to that--what \nwe hear is: Oh, it is just a study.\n  In fact, last year, $14 million was appropriated for the study. It is \nmore than just the study. It is the study and development.\n  I rise today to send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy; the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed; the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg; the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden; and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 1655.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for Department of Energy \n activities relating to the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, Advanced \n Weapons Concepts, modification of the readiness posture of the Nevada \nTest Site, and the Modern Pit Facility, and to make the amount of funds \n         made available by the prohibition for debt reduction)\n\n       After section 503, insert the following:\n       Sec. 504. (a) Reduction in Amount Available for National \n     Nuclear Security Administration.--The amount appropriated by \n     title III of this Act under the heading ``ATOMIC ENERGY \n     DEFENSE ACTIVITIES'' under the heading ``National Nuclear \n     Security Administration'' under the heading ``Weapons \n     Activities'' is hereby reduced by $21,000,000, with the \n     amount of the reduction to be allocated so that--\n       (1) no funds shall be available for the Robust Nuclear \n     Earth Penetrator; and\n       (2) no funds shall be available for Advanced Weapons \n     Concepts.\n       (b) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Certain Modification of \n     Readiness Posture of Nevada Test Site.--None of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act for the \n     Department of Energy may be obligated or expended for the \n     purpose of modifying the readiness posture of the Nevada Test \n     Site, Nevada, for the resumption by the United States of \n     underground nuclear weapons tests from the current readiness \n     of posture of 24 months to 36 months to a new readiness \n     posture of 18 months or any other readiness posture of less \n     than 24 months.\n       (c) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Site Selection of \n     Modern Pit Facility.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act for the Department of \n     Energy may be obligated or expended for the purpose of site \n     selection of the Modern Pit Facility.\n       (d) Reduction of Public Debt.--Of the amount appropriated \n     by this Act, $21,000,000 shall not be obligated or expended, \n     but shall be utilized instead solely for purposes of the \n     reduction of the public debt.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very concerned that through a \npolicy of unilateralism and preemption, combined with the creation of \nnew nuclear weapons, we may very well be encouraging the very nuclear \nproliferation we seek to prevent. It seems to me that pursuing the \ndevelopment of new tactical battlefield nuclear weapons not only lowers \nthe threshold for possible use but also blurs the distinction between \nnuclear and nonnuclear weapons.\n  The amendment I have just sent to the desk essentially in many ways \nmirrors what the House of Representatives has done. Much to the credit \nof Chairman Hobson, the House of Representatives has deleted this \nfunding. I believe very strongly the Senate should follow.\n  The amendment I proposed would strike $15 million for the study of \nthe development of the robust nuclear earth penetrator and $6 million \nin funding for advanced nuclear weapons concepts, including the study \nfor development of low-yield weapons--these are battlefield tactical \nnuclear weapons--and it would prohibit spending--this is where it is a \nlittle different in the Senate version than in the House version--in \nthe 2004 year to increase the Nevada Test Site's time to test readiness \nposture from the current 24 to 36 months to 18 months. The House \nactually cut the 24 $8 million. We fence it for this year.\n  Secondly, it would implement site selection for the modern pit \nfacility. The House cut $12 million. We would delay it for 1 year.\n  The House also redirected the savings from this bill for water \nprojects. We essentially use the money for deficit reduction. By \nseeking to develop a new generation of 5-kiloton, or below, tactical \nnuclear weapons, which produce smaller explosions, the administration \nis suggesting we can make nuclear weapons less deadly. It is suggesting \nwe can make them more acceptable to use. Neither is true.\n  By seeking to develop a robust nuclear earth penetrator, the \nadministration seems to be moving toward a military posture in which \nnuclear weapons are considered just like other weapons--like a tank, a \nfighter aircraft, or a cruise missile. By seeking to speed up\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\nthe time to test requirement for the Nevada Test Site, the \nadministration is taking us down a road that may well lead to the \nresumption of underground nuclear testing, overturning a 10-year \nmoratorium. By seeking to move forward with the modern pit facility, \nthe administration appears to be seeking to develop a facility that \nwill, in 1 year, allow the United States to produce a number of \nplutonium pits that exceeds the entire current arsenal of China.\n  Given that the United States has a robust pit stockpile and plans for \na facility that will be able to produce an adequate number of \nreplacement pits in the coming years, questions must be asked as to why \na facility like the modern pit facility is necessary, and why now? What \nsort of message is the United States sending to the rest of the world, \nat a time when we are trying to discourage others from developing their \nown nuclear arsenal, by our taking this action? We say to North Korea, \nyou cannot do this. We say to Iran, you cannot do this. Yet we set a \nprecedent whereby countries such as Pakistan and India--each with their \nown indigenous nuclear capability, each diehard enemies--may well take \nthe example and say: If they can do it, we can do it. We should start \nour own advanced concepts program.\n  I deeply believe the combined impact of studies or development of new \nnuclear weapons enhancing the posture of our test sites and developing \na new plutonium pit facility could well have the result of leading \nthese other nuclear powers and nuclear aspirants to resume or start \ntesting and to seek to enlarge their own nuclear forces--action that \nwould fundamentally alter future nonproliferation efforts and undermine \nour own security. Instead of increasing it, it will undermine it.\n  The House of Representatives had the foresight to realize that going \ndown this path was not in the best interest of the United States \nnational security. I truly hope this Senate will respond and do the \nsame. I cannot say enough good things about Chairman Hobson. I have had \nthe privilege of working with him on MilCon, and I think he has shown \ndramatic courage, spunk, individualism, good thinking, and solid common \nsense.\n\n  Nearly 60 years ago, our world was introduced to nuclear weapons. I \nwas 12 years old when the Enola Gay left our shores. I saw a 15-kiloton \nbomb destroy Hiroshima. It killed up to 140,000 people--just that bomb \nkilled 140,000 people. A 21-kiloton bomb then destroyed Nagasaki, \nkilling 80,000 people. Two bombs, 220,000 people dead, and the largest \npattern of destruction the world has ever seen--just look at it on this \nphoto.\n  For the decades that followed, we saw a standoff between the United \nStates and the Soviet Union with armadas of nuclear weapons, many of \nwhich remain today. They are targeted at each other's cities even right \nthis very minute. We have seen other nations become nuclear powers--the \nUnited Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan. And others--like I \nsaid, Iran and North Korea clearly have nuclear aspirations. But after \ndecades of steady progress, our efforts against nuclear proliferation \nhave also produced a number of dividends. Nuclear-capable states, like \nSouth Africa, Brazil, Argentina, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, the \nUkraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan have either forgone developing nuclear \nweapons or, like the States of the former Soviet Union, given up the \nweapons they possessed. China has recently signaled it might be \nwilling, finally, to sign onto the comprehensive test ban treaty. When \nU.S. policy can urge others to act responsibly, the world is a far \nsafer place and the United States is safer as well.\n  As we continue to prosecute the war on terror, it should be a central \ntenet of the U.S. policy to do everything at our disposal to make \nnuclear weapons less desirable, less available, and less likely to be \nused. This does just the opposite.\n  This administration appears to be looking for new ways to use our \nnuclear advantage, to restructure our force so nuclear weapons are more \n``usable.'' That sends a very troubling message to others who might \nalso aspire to obtain or use nuclear weapons.\n  Let me just quote a Pentagon spokesperson in saying this:\n\n       This administration is fashioning a more diverse set of \n     options for deterring the threat of weapons of mass \n     destruction. That is why the administration is pursuing \n     advanced conventional forces and improved intelligence \n     capabilities. A combination of offensive and defensive and \n     nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities is essential to meet the \n     deterrence requirements of the 21st century.\n\n  I profoundly disagree. If the most potent conventional military on \nEarth cannot meet the challenges without new nuclear weapons, it is a \ntragedy indeed. The administration's own nuclear posture review, \nreleased in January of 2002, did not focus solely on the role of \nnuclear weapons for deterrence. It stressed the importance of actually \nbeing prepared to use nuclear weapons. In fact, the review noted we \nmust now plan to possibly use them against a wider range of countries.\n  To that end, I would like to put into the record a New York Times \narticle by Michael R. Gordon, dated March 9. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record following my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in addition, the nuclear posture \nreview said we need to develop new types of weapons so we can use them \nin a wider variety of circumstances and against a wider range of \ntargets, such as hard and deeply buried targets, or to defeat chemical \nand biological weapons. Even the New York Times suggests we would even \nconsider a first strike against a nonnuclear country if that country \npossessed biological or chemical weapons.\n  It seems clear that this administration is no longer focused solely \non the role of nuclear weapons for deterrence. Rather, the new triad \nproposed by the administration has grouped nuclear and conventional \nweapons together on a continuum, believing each has an equal role on \nthe battlefield.\n  During the cold war, the nuclear triad consisted of air, land, and \nsea nuclear forces--bombers, ALBMs, ICBMs and SLBMs. The new triad \nconsists of offensive strike forces, missile defense--which has yet, \nincidentally, been shown to work--and a responsive infrastructure to \nsupport the forces. Strategic nuclear forces are combined dangerously, \nin my view, with conventional strike capabilities in the offensive leg \nof the new triad.\n  This new triad represents a radical departure from the idea that our \nstrategic nuclear forces are primarily intended for deterrence, not for \noffense as the new triad proposes.\n  In a few months, after issuing the Nuclear Posture Review, President \nBush signed National Security Presidential Directive 17 indicating the \nUnited States might use nuclear weapons to respond to a chemical or \nbiological attack. I find the Nuclear Posture Review and NSPD-17 deeply \ndisturbing.\n  Some have maintained we don't need to concern ourselves too much with \nthese documents because they are merely intellectual exercises. In \nfact, at a hearing of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in May, I \nasked Secretary Rumsfeld about where the administration was going on \nthese issues. He responded, in essence, that there was nothing to be \nconcerned about because current research to develop nuclear weapons is \njust a study. But the fact is, the administration has begun to take \nconcrete steps toward developing new classes of nuclear weapons. In \nfact, the administration's statement of policy for the fiscal year 2004 \nDefense authorization bill may well have been more honest than \nintended. This is the statement of administration policy:\n\n       The administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee's continued support of our national defense and \n     support for critical research and development for low-yield \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  As Fred Celec, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for Nuclear \nMatters, stated: If a hydrogen bomb can be successfully designed to \nsurvive a crash through hard rock or concrete and still explode, ``it \nwill ultimately get fielded.''\n  That is his statement: If a hydrogen bomb can be successfully \ndesigned to survive a crash through hard rock or concrete and still \nexplode, ``it will ultimately get fielded.''\n  That is where we are going, Mr. President. I believe it is in this \ncontext that we must view the funding requests in this bill.\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\n  This is not an esoteric funding request. I don't believe it is just a \nstudy. I believe it is the second step in the study and in the \ndevelopment of these so-called advanced nuclear concepts of moving up \ntest readiness, of building a huge modern pit facility. The legislation \nbefore us today contains funding to start that process of developing \nthis next generation of nuclear weapons, clear and simple.\n  I strongly support a robust military, and our safety interests and \nour security interests should be protected, but I believe we are going \nto make our Nation and our allies less secure, not more, if the United \nStates opens the door to the development, testing, and deployment of \nnew tactical and low-yield nuclear weapons.\n\n  I think there are several things wrong with the logic which suggests \nthat using these weapons is acceptable. First, using nuclear weapons, \neven small ones, will cross a line that has been in place for 60 years. \nI don't want to be a Member of the Senate who crosses that line and has \nto explain to my five grandchildren why I voted to sanction a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons, whether it is a robust earth penetrator \nor whether it is a tactical battlefield weapon, because you cannot \nprotect from the radiation. What grandmother or mother wants to send \ntheir son or daughter on to a battlefield with tactical nuclear \nweapons? Sixty years of history is in the process of being reversed.\n  It was the Secretary of State, GEN Colin Powell, who wrote in his \nautobiography about possibly using tactical nuclear weapons in Europe \nto thwart a Soviet invasion. Let me read what he said. He wrote:\n\n       No matter how small these nuclear payloads were, we would \n     be crossing a threshold. Using nukes would mark one of the \n     most significant political and military decisions since \n     Hiroshima.\n\n  That is what we are doing, I say to my colleagues--one of the most \nsignificant decisions since Hiroshima--and his statement in his book is \njust as true today.\n  Second, I wish to speak for a moment about the fact that there is no \nsuch thing as a clean or usable nuclear bomb. According to Stanford \nUniversity physicist, Dr. Sidney Drell, the effects of a small bomb \nwould be dramatic. A 1-kiloton weapon detonated 20 to 50 feet \nunderground--1 kiloton detonated 20 to 50 feet underground--would dig a \ncrater the size of Ground Zero and eject a million cubic feet of \nradioactive debris into the air. This chart shows 1 kiloton at 30 feet \nand it will eject a million cubic feet of radioactive debris into the \nair.\n  A low-yield weapon would have very little utility in trying to \ndestroy a deeply buried underground bunker. Given the insurmountable \nphysics problems associated with burrowing a warhead deep into the \nearth, destroying a target hidden beneath a thousand feet of rock will \nrequire a nuclear weapon of almost 100 kilotons. That is 10 times the \nsize of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n  As this chart shows, if a bunker buster were able to burrow into the \nearth to reach its maximum feasible depth--that is about 35 feet--it \nstill would not be deep enough to contain a bomb with an explosive \nyield of only .2 kilotons, 75 times smaller than the bomb that exploded \nover Hiroshima, let alone a 100-kiloton bomb.\n  Let me make the point. To destroy a typical bunker or another \nunderground target, such as a chemical or biological weapons facility, \nyou would need to burrow down at least 800 feet, which is not \nphysically possible, or detonate a 100-kiloton weapon whose fallout and \ndestruction belie the idea that an antiseptic nuclear weapon can be \ndeveloped. Anything short of that would not contain the fallout.\n  A fireball would break through the surface, scattering enormous \namounts of radioactive debris--1.5 million tons for a 100-kiloton \nbomb--into the atmosphere. As this map of the Korean peninsula shows, \njust the path fallout, with travel in typical weather, would place both \nSouth Korea and Japan in severe danger while placing millions of \ninnocent people at risk if a nuclear bunker buster were to be used in \nNorth Korea. We can see it used at this point. We can see the path of \nfallout. It is devastating.\n  Ultimately, the depth of penetration of the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator is limited by the strength of the missile casing. The \ndeepest our current earth penetrators can burrow is 20 feet of dry \nearth. Casing made of even the stronger material cannot withstand the \nphysical forces of burrowing through 100 feet of granite, much less 800 \nfeet.\n  I believe it is deeply flawed to argue, as some robust nuclear earth \npenetrator proponents do, that because it would penetrate the earth \nbefore detonating, it would be a clean weapon. It will not be.\n  In fact, far more than the added explosive power a nuclear weapon \nprovides, the most important factor in destroying a deeply buried \ntarget is knowing exactly where it is. Someone is not going to drop a \nbomb such as a robust nuclear earth penetrator unless they know exactly \nwhere the target is. If they know exactly where the target is, there \nare other things that can be done. It can be destroyed with \nconventional weapons. Access to it can be prevented by destroying \nentrances, cutting off electricity, cutting off air ducts. Cutting off \na bunker in this way renders it useless just as effectively as \ndestroying it with a nuclear blast.\n  The fact is that our intelligence is weak. So I very much doubt we \nare going to be throwing around bunker busters of 100 kilotons that are \nnuclear with this fallout spread when we really do not know, among the \ntens of thousands of holes the North Koreans have in the ground, \nexactly what is what.\n  Thirdly, the development of new low-yield nuclear weapons could \nlead--and this is where we are going--to the resumption of underground \nnuclear testing in order to test the new weapons. This would overturn \nthe 10-year moratorium on nuclear testing. So we are changing 60 years \nof history. We are overturning a 10-year moratorium. This could lead \nother countries to resume or start testing, actions that would \nfundamentally alter future nonproliferation and counterproliferation \nefforts.\n  The March 2003 Arms Control Today points out an interesting thing:\n\n       In 1995, many of the world's nonnuclear states made it \n     clear their continued adherence to the NPT was contingent on \n     the cessation of all nuclear-yield testing. . . . A decision \n     to resume testing to build low-yield nuclear weapons could \n     deal the regime a fatal blow while providing the United \n     States a capability of questionable military value.\n\n  This is where we are going with this bill. We are moving up test \nreadiness from 24 to 30 months to 18 months. So inherent in this bill \nis the beginning of expedited testing, overturning 60 years, going \nagainst the nonproliferation treaty, which will then encourage other \nnations to do the same, and beginning testing once again.\n  According to the 2003 Report to Congress on Nuclear Test Readiness, \n18 months is the minimum time necessary to prepare a test once a \nproblem is identified. Yet even during the cold war when tests were \nongoing on a regular basis, the Nuclear National Security Agency found \nthat it required 18 to 24 months to design and field a test with full \ndiagnostics.\n\n  As purely a technical matter, 18 months is also an extremely short \ntimeframe for test readiness. So why are we doing it? Why are we doing \nit now with no pressing need? Why is the administration pushing so hard \nfor the absolute minimum time necessary to conduct a test?\n  This tells me exactly where this administration is going. Even \nputting aside the concern I have about the message that the United \nStates moving ahead with test readiness sends to the rest of the world, \nthis short time period may well not be technologically feasible.\n  In an op-ed in the Washington Post on July 21, Secretary of Energy \nSpencer Abraham said this:\n\n       We are not planning to resume testing; nor are we improving \n     test readiness in order to develop new nuclear weapons. In \n     fact, we are not planning to develop any new nuclear weapons \n     at all.\n\n  Then what are we doing this for? Fourteen million dollars last year, \n$50 million this year, a $4 billion modern pit facility program over 10 \nyears. What are we doing it for? I think what the Secretary did by \nthese comments is really an injustice in terms of casting a web over \nthese moves that is not credible.\n  I can only deduce that despite all the ``this is just a study'' \nrhetoric, there is an intention to test, and this administration is \nreopening the nuclear door\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\nto develop a new generation of tactical battlefield nuclear weapons, \nand I do not want to be a part of it.\n  In fact, in a September 3 interview, Fred Celec stated:\n\n       If you say, I've got to go to design a new nuclear weapon . \n     . . you probably will have to have a nuclear test.\n\n  Likewise, I have serious concerns about the intentions behind the \nfunds included in this bill for work on the modern pit facility. As I \nhave said, the modern pit facility is the administration's proposed $4 \nbillion plan where new plutonium pits for nuclear weapons will be \nfabricated. This facility, when completed, would be able to produce 250 \nto 900 plutonium pits per year.\n  To put this in perspective, if the proposed modern pit facility \noperated at half of its capacity, it could equal or exceed China's \nentire new nuclear arsenal in 1 year. This production would be in \nexcess of our current inventory of 15,000 plutonium pits.\n  What does this say to other nations? What does this say to China? \nWhat does it say to Iraq? What does it say to Iran, Pakistan, India, or \nany other nation? What does it say to North Korea?\n  At a time when we should be lessening our reliance on nuclear weapons \nand lessening the amount of fissile material available which might fall \ninto the hands of terrorists, encouraging other countries in the world \nto do likewise by following our example, why do we need this new \nproduction capability?\n  The Department of Energy has already begun a separate $2.3 billion \npit fabrication and plutonium chemistry complex at Los Alamos, which \nwill begin producing 20 pits per year in 2007 and can be equipped and \nenlarged to produce as many as 150 pits per year. So what do we need \nthis for? No one has answered that question.\n  With the current age of our stockpile pits averaging 19 years, and \nthe Department of Energy estimating a pit minimum lifetime to be 45 to \n60 years, with no ``life-limiting factors'' being identified, why put \nour Nation $4 billion further into debt by creating additional capacity \nfor plutonium pits we don't need? We can't find anything that indicates \nwhy we need these additional plutonium pits. As I said, we already have \na $2.3 billion program to produce 20 pits that can go up to 150 pits. \nAre we going into some kind of enormous program that we don't know \nabout?\n  The House report language in their version of the energy and water \nbill put it this way:\n\n       It appears to the Committee that the Department is \n     proposing to rebuild, restart, and redo and otherwise \n     exercise every capability that was used over the past 40 \n     years of the cold war, and at the same time prepare for a \n     future with an expanded mission for nuclear weapons. Nothing \n     in the past performance of NNSA convinces this Committee that \n     the successful implementation of the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program is a foregone conclusion, which makes the pursuit of \n     a broad range of new initiatives premature.\n\n  This was just written. This was considered by the House of \nRepresentatives, and the House of Representatives had the guts to take \nit out of the bill. So this amendment would put in place a 1-year stay. \nIt is a little different from the House bill. It would put in place a \n1-year stay on site selection for the modern pit facility. If the \nadministration can come forward with a convincing rationale and plans \nin a year, we can revisit this issue. But until then, we should not be \nsupporting this new initiative.\n  Today, America's current conventional and nuclear forces vastly \noverpower those of any other nation. So for me, it is difficult if not \nimpossible to reconcile building a multibillion-dollar nuclear bomb \nfactory, which is what this is, as we preach the importance of limiting \nproliferation and preventing other nations from developing weapons of \nmass destruction. And, if I may say so, it is hypocritical. It is \nhypocritical; we say one thing to others and we do an entirely \ndifferent thing ourselves. If that is not hypocrisy, I don't know what \nis.\n  Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, nuclear weapon states are \ncommitted to halting so-called vertical proliferation. That means they \nare prohibited from increasing their nuclear stockpiles. They are \nprohibited. The purpose is to encourage other nations to halt \nhorizontal proliferation, whereby more and more nations become nuclear \ncapable. That is what the NPT is trying to do. They are trying to stop \nit, and we are doing exactly the opposite. If our country goes down the \nroad of developing and bringing the modern pit facility on line, we \nwill effectively undermine the nonproliferation treaty.\n  I know the Bush administration doesn't like it. I know they don't \nattend meetings. I know we are now on a big unilateral binge, where we \nknow better than anybody else. But this is for our children and our \ngrandchildren. Perhaps more than any other this represents the \ncountry we try to be and the country we are going to be.\n\n  I think with this legislation, and by going down this path, we \nundermine the nonproliferation treaty. Maybe that is what they want to \nhappen. And by our example we create an incentive and we present a \nchallenge to others with nuclear aspirations to develop them.\n  I don't know whether that is the intention. We know ballistic missile \ndefense does the same thing. I think we are seeing, in Iraq, where \nunilateralism is not working. We have before us an $87 billion \nsupplemental which will bring the cost of the war to about $166 billion \nso far. Yet we are starting a whole new nuclear program.\n  I guess why I don't like it, most of all, is it is all done under the \nguise of study, of development. The facts are never really put on the \ntable. It just kind of happens. Then some get kind of ``suckered'' into \nit, if I can use that word, because of the economics of doing it in \nthis State or that State or competing for it.\n  We need to begin to think what we are competing for. I don't want us \nto compete for something that is going to encourage China to begin \nnuclear weapons production or begin testing. I don't want to encourage \nsomething that is going to say to Pakistan and India: We developed \ntactical battlefield nuclear weapons. Look at our example. That is what \nwe are doing and we don't see it.\n  Finally, to those who argue that the United States needs new weapons \nfor new missions, I should point out that the United States already has \na usable nuclear bunker buster, the B61-11, which has a dial-to-yield \nfeature, allowing its yield to range from less than a kiloton to \nseveral hundred kilotons. When configured to have a 10-kiloton yield \nand detonated 4 feet underground, the B61-11 can produce a shock wave \nsufficient to crush a bunker buried beneath 350 feet of layered rock.\n  If, indeed--I don't think there is--but if there is a legitimate \nmilitary mission for these kinds of weapons, the experts tell us we \nalready have one. We don't need new nuclear weapons. On the other hand, \nthe U.S. military, the strongest and most capable military force the \nworld has ever seen, has plenty of effective conventional options \ndesigned to penetrate deeply into the earth and destroy underground \nbunkers and storage facilities. These range in size from 500 pounds to \n5,000 pounds, and most are equipped with either a laser or a GPS \nguidance system. The 5,000-pound bunker buster, like the guided bomb \nunit 28/B, is capable of penetrating up to 20 feet of reinforced \nconcrete, or 100 feet of earth.\n  The GBU-28 was used with much success in Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Afghanistan.\n  Other conventional bunker busters were used to take out Saddam \nHussein's underground lairs in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In fact, the \nU.S. military possesses a conventional bunker buster--the GBU-37--which \nis thought to be capable of taking out a silo-based ICBM.\n  I only wish that instead of beginning the research and development of \na new generation of weapons, this administration would lead efforts to \nprevent nuclear development and prevent the spread and delegitimize the \nuse and utility of nuclear weapons. Oh, how I wish they would. Instead, \nwith these appropriations a new nuclear arms race will begin. Let there \nbe no doubt. I know it as sure as I am standing here now. I know it \nfrom the judgment of past history. I know how difficult it has been. I \nknow just how difficult it was to reach agreements with the Soviet \nUnion to begin to ratchet down the nuclear arsenal of both of our \ncountries. We will be dealing with governments far more difficult to \ndeal with than the Soviet Union, like those typified by North Korea.\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\n  If we appropriate these dollars, we can expect that other nations \nwill follow, that a new nuclear race will begin to develop, and the \nchance that one day, somehow, some way they will be used against us. \nThose chances are clear. Let there be no doubt.\n  As the Economist concluded in its May 17 issue:\n\n       In their determination to leave no weapons avenue \n     unexplored [the administration] is proposing to lead America \n     along a dangerous path.\n\n  This is why our amendment seeks to strike the funding in this bill \nfor the development of the robust nuclear earth penetrator and the \nother so-called advanced concepts--I hate calling nuclear weapons \n``advanced concepts''--including low-yield weapons, and to limit the \nfunding for enhanced test readiness and the modern pit facility.\n  Right now our country is spending well over $400 billion on defense. \nNext year we will spend more on our military than all of the other 191 \nnations on the planet combined. If we can't protect ourselves without \nthinking about nuclear weapons, who can? Who can? We spend more than \n191 nations combined--all of the other nations on Earth. Yet the \nproposal is that we reopen the nuclear door and begin a new generation \nof nuclear weapons.\n  I think once again we will see rogue states basically conclude that \nthey will be safe from the United States only if they develop their own \nnuclear weapons quickly. I think that is exactly what is happening in \nNorth Korea, which has responded to the Bush administration's \naggressive posture by claiming that only a ``tremendous military \ndeterrent'' will protect it from the United States. Now Iran is \nfollowing suit. Will we encourage India and Pakistan to develop \ntactical nuclear weapons as well?\n  Indeed, by seeking to develop new nuclear weapons ourselves, we send \na message that nuclear weapons have a future battlefield role and \nutility. This is the wrong message. It takes us in the wrong direction. \nIn my view, it will cause Americans to be placed in greater jeopardy in \nthe future.\n  We are telling others not to develop nuclear weapons and not to sell \nfissile materials, but we continue to study and design new nuclear \nweapons ourselves. Again, ``hypocrisy.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The House has totally \neliminated the money. We don't do exactly that. We eliminate some and \nwe fence others. We delay the pit facility for 1 year. We don't use the \nmoney for water projects, and we don't use it for deficit reduction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I urge them to \nrealize that we are at a historic turning point. It may well be that \npeople do not remember the Enola Gay, they don't remember Hiroshima, \nthey don't remember Nagasaki, and they don't remember that 220,000 \npeople were killed instantly in both of those strikes. They don't \nremember Chernobyl and what radioactive fallout does to people.\n  I see this as a very historic vote. The way is carved for us by the \nHouse of Representatives. They have eliminated funding. They have done \nwhat is right. I hope we follow suit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the New York Times, March 10, 2002]\n\n           U.S. Nuclear Plan Sees New Targets and New Weapons\n\n                         (By Michael R. Gordon)\n\n       Outlining a broad overhaul of American nuclear policy, a \n     secret Pentagon report calls for developing new nuclear \n     weapons that would be better suited for striking targets in \n     Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Libya.\n       The Nuclear Posture Review, as the Pentagon report is \n     known, is a comprehensive blueprint for developing and \n     deploying nuclear weapons. While some of the report is \n     unclassified, key portions are secret.\n       In campaigning for office President Bush stressed that he \n     wanted to slash the number of nuclear weapons and develop a \n     military that would be suited for the post-cold war world.\n       The new Pentagon report, in fact, finds that non-nuclear \n     conventional weapons are becoming an increasingly important \n     element of the Pentagon arsenal. But the report also \n     indicates that the Pentagon views nuclear weapons as an \n     important element of military planning.\n       It stresses a need to develop earth-penetrating nuclear \n     weapons to destroy heavily fortified underground bunkers, \n     including those that may be used to store chemical and \n     biological weapons. It calls for improving the intelligence \n     and targeting systems needed for nuclear strikes and argues \n     that the United States may need to resume nuclear testing.\n       The New York Times obtained a copy of the 56-page report. \n     Elements of the report were reported today by the Los Angeles \n     Times.\n       One of the most sensitive portions of the report is a \n     secret discussion of contingencies in which the United States \n     might need to use its ``nuclear strike capabilities'' against \n     a foe.\n       During the cold war, the United States used nuclear weapons \n     to deter a Soviet attack on Western Europe.\n       But now, the Pentagon report says, the nation faces new \n     contingencies in which nuclear weapons might be employed, \n     including ``an Iraqi attack on Israel or its neighbors, or a \n     North Korean attack on South Korea or a military \n     confrontation over the status of Taiwan.'' Another theme in \n     the report is the possible use of nuclear weapons to destroy \n     enemy stocks of biological weapons, chemical arms and other \n     arms of mass destruction.\n       Pentagon and White House officials turned down repeated \n     requests for interviews on the report. The Pentagon issued a \n     statement this evening noting that the purpose of the review \n     was to analyze nuclear weapons requirements, not to specify \n     targets.\n       ``It does not provide operational guidance on nuclear \n     targeting or planning,'' the Pentagon statement said. ``The \n     Department of Defense continues to plan for a broad range of \n     contingencies and unforeseen threats to the United States and \n     its allies. We do so in order to deter such attacks in the \n     first place.''\n       ``This administration is fashioning a more diverse set of \n     options for deterring the threat of weapons of mass \n     destruction,'' the Pentagon statement continued. ``That is \n     why the administration is pursuing advanced conventional \n     forces and improved intelligence capabilities. A combination \n     of offensive and defensive, and nuclear and non-nuclear \n     capabilities is essential to meet the deterrence requirements \n     of the 21st century.''\n       Critics responded to the report by complaining that the \n     Bush administration was not only pushing for the development \n     of new types of nuclear weapons, but broadening the \n     circumstances in which they might be used.\n       ``Despite their pronouncements of wanting to slash nuclear \n     arms, the Bush administration is reinvigorating the nuclear \n     weapons forces and the vast research and industrial complex \n     that support it,'' said Robert S. Norris, a senior research \n     associated at the Natural Resources Defense Council and an \n     expert on nuclear weapons programs. ``In addition the Bush \n     administration seems to see a new role for nuclear weapons \n     against the `axis of evil' and other problem states.''\n       Classified versions of the report were provided to Congress \n     in January but the disclosure now could become a public \n     relations problem for vice President Dick Cheney, who is \n     scheduled to leave on Sunday for a 10-day trip to Britain and \n     Middle Eastern countries. The disclosure of the \n     administration's ambitious nuclear plans is likely to spark \n     criticism from European groups that have long supported more \n     traditional approaches to arms control. Middle Eastern \n     leaders may be alarmed to learn that the Pentagon sees Iraq, \n     Iran, Syria and Libya as potential nuclear battlegrounds.\n       One of the most sensitive portions of the report is its \n     discussion of countries that do not have nuclear arms. \n     Recalling the Cuban missile crisis, the report noted that the \n     United States might be caught by surprise if an adversary \n     suddenly displayed a new ability involving weapons of mass \n     destruction or it a nuclear arsenal changes hands as a result \n     of a coup in a foreign land.\n       ``In setting requirements for nuclear strike capabilities, \n     distinctions can be made among the contingencies for which \n     the United States must be prepared,'' the Pentagon report \n     states. ``Contingencies can be categorized as immediate, \n     potential or unexpected.''\n       ``North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya are among the \n     countries that could be involved in immediate, potential or \n     unexpected contingencies,'' it added. ``All have long-\n     standing hostility toward the United States and its security \n     partners; North Korea and Iraq in particular have been \n     chronic military concerns.''\n       It said, ``All sponsor or harbor terrorists, and all have \n     active'' programs to create weapons of mass destruction and \n     missiles.\n       Among Iraq, Iran, Syria or Libya none has nuclear weapons, \n     though Iraq and Iran are making a serious effort to acquire \n     them, according to American intelligence.\n       American intelligence officials believe that North Korea \n     may have enough fissile material for one or two nuclear \n     weapons, but there is considerable debate as to whether it \n     has actually produced one.\n       Significantly, all of those countries have signed the \n     Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Washington has promised that \n     it will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon \n     states that have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty \n     unless those countries attack the United States or its allies \n     ``in alliance with a nuclear weapon state.''\n       The policy was intended to discourage outsider nations from \n     seeking to develop nuclear weapons. But conservatives argue \n     that Washington should be able to threaten the use of nuclear \n     weapons as a way to deter one state from attacking the United \n     States with chemical or biological weapons.\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\n       Earlier this month, Richard Boucher, the State Department \n     spokesman, repeated the policy but then added that ``if a \n     weapon of mass destruction is used against the United States \n     or its allies, we will not rule out any specific type of \n     response.'' His qualified statement along with the Pentagon \n     report raises the question of whether the Bush administration \n     still plans to abide by the longstanding policy.\n       One former senior American officials said that the \n     development of new weapons to attack non-nuclear states would \n     not in itself contradict American policy since it would be no \n     more than a contingency. But using them would contradict the \n     policy, he said, unless the nations violated their \n     commitments to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by \n     developing nuclear weapons.\n       ``I would not say that developing a bunker-busting nuclear \n     weapon for use against these countries would by itself \n     violate that pledge,'' the former American official said. \n     ``But using nuclear against them would unless they violated \n     their assurance by acquiring nuclear weapons.''\n       The Pentagon report discussed other contingencies as well. \n     The report stated that China is also a potential adversary \n     and is modernizing its nuclear and conventional forces. While \n     Russia has the most formidable nuclear force, the report took \n     the view that relations with Moscow have vastly improved.\n       ``As a result, a contingency involving Russia, while \n     plausible, is not expected,'' the report states. Still, the \n     report said that the United States cannot be sure that \n     relations with Russia will always be smooth and thus must be \n     prepared to ``revise its nuclear force levels and posture.''\n       In addition to surveying the potential situations in which \n     nuclear weapons might be employed, the report discussed the \n     sort of force that might be needed. The Bush administration \n     has said that it plans to reduce strategic nuclear weapons to \n     between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads, a big reduction from the \n     6,000 or so nuclear weapons that the United States has now.\n       Critics of the Bush administration say the cuts are roughly \n     the same as those foreseen by the Clinton administration, \n     which agreed that future strategic arms treaty should reduce \n     nuclear weapons to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads. While \n     the reductions projected by the Bush administration seem \n     deeper, the Pentagon has changed the rules for counting \n     nuclear weapons and no longer counts bombers or nuclear \n     missile submarines that are in the process of being \n     overhauled.\n       Adding new detail to previous briefings, the Pentagon says \n     that its future force structure will have the following \n     components. By 2012, the United States will have 14 Trident \n     submarines with two in overhaul at one time. They will be \n     part of a triad that will include hundreds of Minuteman III \n     land-based missiles and about 100 B-52 H and B-2 bombers.\n       ``This will provide an operationally deployed force of \n     1,700 to 2,200 strategic nuclear warheads and a wide range of \n     options for a responsive force to meet potential \n     contingencies,'' the report says.\n       But the Pentagon report said that nuclear planning is not \n     merely a question of numbers. The Pentagon also wants to \n     improve existing nuclear weapons and possibly develop new \n     ones.\n       The report cites the need to improve ``earth-penetrating \n     weapons'' that could be used to destroy underground \n     installations and hardened bunkers. According to a secret \n     portion of the Pentagon study, more than 70 nations now use \n     underground installations. It notes that the only earth-\n     penetrating weapon that exists is that B61 Mod 11 bomb and \n     that it has only a limited ``ground-penetration capability.''\n       The report argues that better earth-penetrating nuclear \n     weapons with lower nuclear yields would be useful since they \n     could achieve equal damage with less nuclear fallout. New \n     earth-penetrating warheads with larger yield would be needed \n     to attack targets that are buried deep underground. The \n     report said it is very hard to identify such underground \n     targets but that American Special Operations Forces could be \n     used for the mission.\n       Another capability which interests the Pentagon are \n     radiological or chemical weapons that would be employed to \n     destroy stockpiles of chemical or biological agents. Such \n     ``Agent Defeat Weapons'' are being studied. The report also \n     argues that Washington needs to compress the time it takes to \n     identify new targets and attack them with nuclear weapons, a \n     concept it calls ``adaptive planning.''\n       In general, the Pentagon report stresses the need for \n     nuclear weapons that would be more easy to use against enemy \n     weapons of mass destruction because they would be of variable \n     or low yield, be highly accurate and could be quickly \n     targeted.\n       Pentagon officials say this gives the United States another \n     tool to knock out enemy chemical, biological or nuclear \n     weapons. But critics say that the Bush administration is, in \n     effect, lowering the nuclear threshold by calling for the \n     development of nuclear weapons that would be easier to use.\n       The need to maintain the capability to rapidly expand the \n     American nuclear arsenal in a crisis, such as ``reversal of \n     Russia's present course,'' is also a theme of the report. The \n     Pentagon calls this hedge ``the responsive force.'' The \n     notion that the United States is reserving the right to \n     rapidly increase its nuclear forces has been an important \n     concern for Moscow, which has pressed Washington to agree to \n     binding limits and even destroy some of its warheads.\n       The Responsive Force, the Pentagon report says, ``retains \n     the option for the leadership to increase the number of \n     operationally deployed forces in proportion to the severity \n     of an evolving crisis,'' the Pentagon report said. As part of \n     this concept, bombs could be brought out of the non-deployed \n     stockpile in days or weeks. Other efforts to augment the \n     force could take as long as a year.\n       To maintain the nuclear infrastructure a number of steps \n     are planned. The Pentagon says that an ``active'' stock of \n     warheads should be maintained which would incorporate the \n     latest modifications and have the key parts.\n       The report says that the United States needs a new \n     capability to produce plutonium ``pits,'' a hollow sphere \n     made out of plutonium around which explosives are fastened. \n     When the explosives go off they squeeze the plutonium \n     together into a critical mass, which allows a nuclear \n     explosion. The Pentagon said the production of Tritium for \n     nuclear warheads will resume during the fiscal 2003 year.\n       Another sensitive political point involves the report's \n     discussion of the United States moratorium on nuclear \n     testing. The Bush administration has refused to ratify the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban treaty, but says it has no plans yet \n     to resume nuclear testing. But the report suggests that it \n     might be necessary to resume testing to make new nuclear \n     weapons and ensure the reliability of existing ones.\n       ``While the United States is making every effort to \n     maintain the nuclear stockpile without additional nuclear \n     testing, this may not be possible in the indefinite future,'' \n     it said.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can we get the yeas and nays?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how much time I will take \nbut obviously some amount of time. There are a number of other Senators \non our side who wish to speak but I want to speak to this amendment.\n  First, fellow Americans and friends here, there are a lot of issues \nthat the wonderful Senator from California talked about that deserve \nsome real clarification. There is an inference that we are not \ninterested in nonproliferation and that we are going in the wrong \ndirection. Everybody should know that the United States of America not \ntoo many years ago had 40,000 nuclear weapons. We are moving rapidly \ntoward 5,000--40,000 moving rapidly toward 5,000. In fact, both the \nUnited States and the former Soviet Union are having difficulty getting \nrid of what comes out of these nuclear weapons because they are moving \nso fast. That which is coming out of them is creating proliferation \nitself because we are moving so rapidly. We do not know what to do with \nthe plutonium that comes out of them. The Russians don't know where to \nput it. But in terms of getting rid of nuclear weapons, the United \nStates is on a path from 40,000--and I can't give you the classified \nnumber but I can tell you it is 5,000 or less.\n  That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2: The pit--the plural ``pits'' is not a very nice sounding \nword--is an absolutely necessary incremental part of a nuclear weapon. \nWithout a pit, there is no nuclear weapon--none.\n  The United States is not engaged in producing new weapons but, \nrather, is seeing to it that we make sure what we have will work. That \nis called science-based stockpile stewardship, which means about 6 or 8 \nyears ago we voted to have no more nuclear underground testing. There \nis nothing in this amendment that says we are going to break that. If \nit was, we would be up here arguing that we are here to break the \nagreement that the United States has. The Senate voted, then the House \nfollowed, and the President signed. It was Mark Hatfield who offered \nthe amendment. It passed here as a consequence.\n  We are not involved in underground testing. I repeat: We are not \ninvolved.\n  This amendment would strike a provision--let us take them one at a \ntime--that says over there in Nevada there is a great operation wherein \nwe used to do underground testing. It is huge. It is complex in nature. \nWe said in the Senate when we put our blood on the line, no more \ntesting. That is a vote far from unanimous. We said, we will always \nkeep that Nevada desert test site ready for tests.\n\n  Did we say that because we planned a new generation of nuclear \nweapons? Of\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\ncourse not. We said that because there is a huge risk to America in the \nscience-based stockpile stewardship as a method of assuring the \nvalidity of our nuclear weapons. There are scientists in America who at \ntheir own expense would come and tell us it will not work. In a few \nyears, you will not know whether your weapons will work or not. That is \nwhy we said, keep Nevada ready.\n  All this amendment says--and it is high time; we should have done it \n4 or 5 years ago--spend a little bit of money, less than $20 million, \nand begin to make the Nevada Test Site ready so instead of taking 3 \nyears to get it ready for a test, we get it ready in 18 months. That is \nall it says.\n  Incidentally, Senator Feinstein, we are both worried about our \ngrandchildren. We probably cannot decide who loves our grandchildren \nmore. At this time in my life, I have twice as many plus three, so if \nyou are worried about your five, I am worried about my 13. But I am \nclearly not worried that this amendment, the language you are striking, \nthis funding, has any chance of harming my grandchildren. That is an \nabsolute myth.\n  Does making the Nevada Test Site capable of conducting an underground \ntest ready in 18 months endanger the children of America? Fellow \nSenators, there is a valid argument it helps the future of our children \nand America's future to have it ready on 18 months' notice instead of 3 \nyears. That part does not belong in this amendment and should not be \nstricken. It should be in this bill. We should make Nevada modern so if \nwe need it, we use it, not 3 years after we decide we need a test \nbecause we have some idea there is something amiss in some of our \nweapons which are 35, 40, and 45 years old. Our nuclear weapons are \nthat old. And we are saying, they will work. We used to test them. But \nnow we have these great scientists and the laboratories--two of them in \nmy State--and they are doing it by assimilation. And they are saying, \nwe think they will work.\n  Then the Senator talks about the planning or a plant to manufacture \npits for the nuclear weapons. Fellow Senators, we need to manufacture \npits for the weapons we have, not the weapons someone is dreaming we \nwill build. There is nothing in this law that says we will build one \nadditional nuclear weapon. Does the Senator know that every country \nwhich has nuclear weapons has spare pits, extra pits, to make sure they \nwill never run short--except one country. This country. We have no \nspare pits. I don't want to infer it is the end of the world. It is \njust a fact. For those who think we could make a new nuclear weapon and \nbreak all our agreements, they have to know right now we do not have a \nspare pit to put in a nuclear weapon. And the world knows it.\n  Senator Domenici is not giving any secrets to anyone. It is a truism. \nFor 8 years we have been fooling around with funding at Los Alamos to \nsee if we can make a pit. I regret to say it has been one terribly \ntough job. I cannot state today--and I know as much as anyone--\nwhether they have produced one that meets all the test requirements. \nFrankly, it is the only place in America that if tomorrow we said, Get \na pit, we need to replace one, one of our nukes needs a new pit, it is \nthe only place to look to. What in the world is wrong with an \nadministration that says the time has come to build a manufacturing \ncenter for pits?\n\n  The good Senator from California ties it into the fact that she \nthinks it is for a new generation of nuclear weapons. Where is the \nauthority to build a nuclear weapon? Read this law we are funding and \ntell me where there is authority to build a new nuclear weapon. This \nSenate would have to stand up and vote to build a new nuclear weapon. \nBelieve you me, it would be a bigger day of debate than this particular \nafternoon in the Senate. It would be a red-letter day when the United \nStates sends to the Senate floor a proposal to build more nuclear \nweapons. And it is not this day. That is not what we are doing. There \nis not one single word that says we are going to build a new nuclear \nweapon.\n  So two proposals the Senator is talking about in this language, the \nfear for the future and what we are going to do to the world: In \nbuilding pits for the future we are going to do nothing to the world. \nThey are already wondering why we have not built them. That is what \nothers are wondering. They are asking, What is the matter with America?\n  We want to begin a plan. I am not sure when they bring the plans that \nI am going to agree to as big a plant as they want. Maybe we will build \na little plant. But this says, begin the planning and designing. It \nprovides not one penny for construction, nor does it decide where this \nplace to build pits will be. Do they need it now? It could wait. But we \nhave been waiting pretty long--for 9 years, maybe 10. The planners ask \nwhat is going on, why can't we build one? We keep asking scientists to \nbuild it at Los Alamos, but that is not a production center. They do \nnot have the facilities. They have built the facilities and I have seen \nthem. It is more like a science lab than a manufacturing plant. One \ncould say, let them keep doing it that way. I don't like it and I don't \nthink anyone planning for the future thinks it is a very good idea to \nplan for our future in terms of replacements at Los Alamos.\n  That leaves the part of this amendment wherein we agreed with the \nSenate. We already voted in this Senate on these issues. We voted \naffirmatively in the Senate on these issues in the armed services \nauthorizing bill. We already voted on every one of these issues. The \nnuclear posture review suggested the credibility of our nuclear \ndeterrence is dependent upon flexibility and adaptive production \ncomplexes, ones that would be able to fix safety or performance \nproblems on aging stockpiles as they arise. The Senate bill does that.\n\n  The Nuclear Posture Review suggests we should keep our nuclear \nscientists engaged and thinking about the nuclear stockpile of the \nfuture and what it should look like. Might I repeat, the Nuclear \nPosture Review suggests we should keep our nuclear scientists--the \ngreatest in the world, excited about their work, living at one of three \ngreat laboratories--engaged and thinking about what the nuclear \nstockpile of the future should look like.\n  It does not commit us to build any new weapons. And there is no money \nin this bill to build new weapons. Let me repeat, there is no money in \nthis bill to build new weapons. It suggests that our scientists should \nremain flexible, that we should not have to have them worried all the \ntime whether thinking about certain aspects of a nuclear weapon of the \nfuture is a violation of the law or not.\n  They should be permitted to think about--based upon what we have \nlearned, what we know about both our friends and our enemies and war so \nfar, and what people are creating in the world--they should be able to \nthink and design and posture, but not build a single new weapon, \nwhether it be one the Senator from California talks about in terms of \ntactical weapons--I do not even know where that comes into this \nthinking. There is no authority for tactical weapons in this bill, in \nthis money, as the Senator in the chair knows. There was nothing in the \nauthorizing committee that said that.\n  There is much more to say, but I believe I have done my best, in a \nfew moments, to dispose of the idea that America is on a path that will \ncause the world to start rebuilding new nuclear bombs in anyone's \nstockpile to react to our improving the Nevada weapons site. The idea \nthat any country is going to react by saying, ``We are going to go do \nsomething now and build more bombs because they are getting Nevada \nready,'' is an absurdity. It has no logic to it.\n  We should never have let it go to 3 years. That is what it takes to \nget ready to test one there--not test a new one, to test one we have, \nto test one if science-based stockpile stewardship fails.\n  I repeat, the other part of it is we do not want to start planning a \ndesign for a manufacturing center for pits in an inventory which would \nthen make America have an inventory of spare parts like other countries \ndo instead of being the only one without them.\n  Now, if you finish those two, and then you argue the one that wants \nto give these engineers and scientists authority to think about what \nweapons might look like in the future, you have the whole substance--\nthe cake, the strawberries. Everything that goes with it in this \namendment is encapsulated in those three ideas.\n  Now, I have argued with many Senators. I have been in the Chamber on\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\nmany issues. I have respect for some, great respect for others. The \nSenator from California is among those for whom I have great respect. \nBut in this instance, the conclusions that have been drawn with \nreference to what is in this bill, and what was proposed by the review \npeople of the United States who review our nuclear posture, are just \nnot so, plain and simple.\n  I think the Senate should not follow the House. The House, for some \nreason, decided to spend this money on water projects. That is fine.\n  I say to the Senator, we would like $40 million more for water \nprojects. But this Senator is not going to prevail and preside over a \ncommittee, because we are short of water money, that looks at these \nprojects in the wrong way and then, in the end, says: Well, we will \nhave $21 or $24 million more for you House Members' water projects. Not \nthis Senator. We will put it right here. This is what this money ought \nto be for.\n\n  We are going to vote on this bill. We are going to vote sooner rather \nthan later. Hopefully, Senators will see it like they saw it before. A \nsubstantial majority voted yea on the authorizing bill to do this. We \ncame along in an appropriations bill and said: The Senate told us to do \nthis.\n  We voted for it. So we have done what the Senate asked us to do.\n  I hope the Senate will say: Having done what we asked you to do, we \nwill leave the money that you put in to do what we asked you to do. We \nwill leave it right there. We won't put it on the debt or put it in \nwater projects. We will put it right where you asked us to put it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, has the Pastore rule run its course?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. BYRD. How long will it require to do so?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will run its course at about 5:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. Five thirty. Very well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, what was the question? I am sorry, I \ndid not hear it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I made a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair. It has nothing \nto do with what you are saying, your argument or hers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to speak on another subject. That is what I want to \ndo.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I inquire of the distinguished Senator from California \nif she wishes to respond in any way to the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I would. But \nI know Senator Kennedy has come to speak on this amendment. At an \nappropriate time--I have made some notes--I would like to respond to \nhim. But I do not want to delay everybody else.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am going to speak on another subject, and \nI do not want to interfere with the discussions on this amendment.\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to speak on this same \nsubject?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I would like to do so. This is an amendment offered \nby Senator Feinstein and myself dealing with the development and \ntesting of nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. Does the Senator from Arizona wish to speak on \nthis subject also?\n  All right.\n  Mr. President, inasmuch as I have the floor, I would like to propound \na unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed with his request.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the four \nSenators on the floor at the moment, other than I, finish their \ndiscussions on this amendment, I be recognized. I make that request. \nNow, what I am saying is, when Senator Domenici, when Senator Kyl of \nArizona, when the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, have finished their \ncolloquies, their discussions, or their statements, that I then be \nrecognized to speak on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \njust talk with the Senator for a moment.\n  That means I have a chance for rebuttal?\n  Also, I say to the Senator, I wanted to tell you--I am not sure if \nyou knew--the yeas and nays have been ordered on this amendment, and I \nassume you are going to debate an issue unrelated to this. How long \nmight we expect you to speak?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would suspect that my speech would require an hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. An hour?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia for being typically courteous to the Members offering this \namendment and also being courteous to the consideration of this issue \nwhich is of central importance not only to this appropriations bill but \nalso in terms of the whole question of security for our country. We \ndon't find too often where our colleagues and friends wait their time \nhere on the Senate floor and are so willingly generous to give up some \ntime.\n  I don't intend to take an undue period of time, but it is typical of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, his courtesy and his respect for the \ninstitution, to permit us to make a presentation on an extremely \nimportant matter. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not surprised, but I am always impressed with the \nspirit with which the Senator respects this institution and an \nindividual Member's ability to raise important matters to make the case \nwhich Senator Feinstein and I are making this afternoon.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we live in a dangerous world, and the \ngreatest danger of all is still the danger of nuclear war or the use of \na nuclear weapon by a terrorist group. We know that terrorists are \nstill plotting each and every day to find new ways to kill Americans.\n  The United States has a responsibility to do what it can to make this \na safer world--not as a lone ranger, not as the world's policeman, but \nfor our national security, and for the principles of freedom and \ndemocracy that make our country what it is.\n  We can't afford to let our own policy help ignite a new nuclear arms \nrace. At the very time when we are urging other nations to halt their \nown nuclear weapons programs, the administration is rushing forward to \ndevelop our own new nuclear weapons.\n  This bill contains $6 million for the development of the so-called \n``mini-nukes'', and $15 million for the so-called nuclear bunker-\nbuster. They want to speed up the testing of nuclear weapons, and \nselect the site for a new pit facility--a factor for new nuclear \nwarheads.\n  These provisions demonstrate the dangerous new direction of our \nnuclear weapons policy. They continue the go-it-alone, damn-the-\ntorpedoes approach to the delicate balance of international arms \ncontrol in today's world.\n  By passing this amendment, we can demonstrate that we are not \nembarking on this reckless new nuclear policy. It makes no sense for us \nto tell other nations to ``Do as we say, not as we do.'' We must do a \nbetter job of leading the way in reducing reliance on nuclear weapons \nand honoring our commitments to international arms control. The House \nbill takes this approach, because it prohibits the use of funds for the \ndevelopment of low-yield nuclear weapons and nuclear bunker busters.\n  There's a reason why arms control has been such a key element of our \nforeign policy and defense policy over many decades. Last month, an \ninfuriated gathering took place in Hiroshima to honor those who died \nthere in 1945. The world knows the massive devastation that a nuclear \nweapon can unleash. Since 1945 nuclear weapons have never been used \nagain in war.\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\n  Yet, this year on the anniversary of those tragedies, the Bush \nAdministration's Strategic Command held a secret meeting in Nebraska at \nOffut Air Force Base to discuss the plan for a new generation of \nnuclear weapons. They barred congressional staff from the meeting. \nTheir nuclear policy is being discussed in the dark, without telling \nthe American people or our allies what the policy is.\n  The administration disbanded an advisory committee to the National \nNuclear Security Administration with membership that ranged from James \nSchlesinger to Sidney Drell. Obviously, the administration is not \ninterested in what some of the best minds in our country and the world \nhave to say about nuclear policy in today's world. It's wrong to begin \na new nuclear arms race by designing, building, and testing new \nweapons.\n  The administration wants to lift the 1993 statutory ban imposed on \ndeveloping ``mini-nukes.'' But these weapons are far from the type of \nsmall, surgical-strike weapons that the name suggests. They will not \nkeep us safer or more secure. Mini-nukes are a dream come true for \nrogue regimes and terrorists, and a nightmare for every other nation on \nEarth. Just one of these weapons, carried by a terrorist in a suitcase, \ncan devastate an entire city. A five-kiloton weapon would be half the \nsize of the Hiroshima bomb.\n  Some claim that these weapons are needed against deeply buried, \nhardened bunkers. But current technology will allow such a warhead to \nburrow only fifty feet into the ground or less. Detonating even a one-\nkiloton weapon at that depth would create a crater larger than the \nWorld Trade Center, larger than a football field. It will spew a \nmillion cubic feet or radioactive dust into the atmosphere. Imagine \nwhat a five-kiloton blast would do.\n  Not only is the Bush administration developing their new nuclear \nweapons, it's also rushing to test them. As Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof Defense, Fred Celec said in 2003, if you, ``design a new nuclear \nweapon . . . you will probably have to have a nuclear test.''\n  In fact, the administration coupled its request to design their \nnuclear weapons with a request to speed up the time it would take to \ntest them.\n  No one questions the safety of our nuclear stockpile. This \naccelerated test readiness is not needed to preserve our existing \narsenal. The only reason for rushing to achieve the shortest possible \ntesting time is to test new kinds of nuclear weapons.\n  Consistent with this goal, the administration has also requested \nfunds to design a large-scale production facility for plutonium pits, \nwhich are factories for new nuclear warheads. The administration wants \na facility able to produce 500 of these pits a year, a level that far \nexceeds what is needed to maintain the current stockpile.\n  The administration claims that it is reducing its current nuclear \nstockpile from 7,500 tactical warheads to less than 2,200. But while \nthey plan for these reductions, the Department of Energy continues to \nask for funding sufficient to support the stockpile levels set by the \nSTART I Arms Control Treaty in 1991 a level set before the fall of the \nSoviet Union. If we build 500 plutonium pits a year, it will far exceed \nthe number needed for the current stockpile, even if we make the \nreductions planned by the administration. The numbers don't add up. We \nare escalating the nuclear arms race, not reducing it.\n  These actions demonstrate the administration's contempt for the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the foundation of all current global \nnuclear arms control. The Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed in 1968, has \nlong stood for the fundamental principle that the world will be safer \nif nuclear proliferation does not extend beyond the five nations that \npossessed nuclear weapons at that time--the United States, Great \nBritain, the Soviet Union, China, and France. It reflected the \nworldwide consensus that the greater the number of nations with nuclear \nweapons, the greater the risk of nuclear war.\n  The Non-Proliferation Treaty has clearly prevented a worldwide \nnuclear arms race. Since the treaty was signed, only five additional \nnations acquired nuclear weapons, and out of them South Africa later \ngot rid of them. Israel, India, and Pakistan never signed the treaty. \nNorth Korea signed it in 1985, but withdrew from it last year.\n  The Bush administration's policy jeopardizes the entire structure of \nnuclear arms control so carefully negotiated by world leaders over the \npast half century, starting with the Eisenhower administration.\n  The history of those years is still vivid in our minds. I was 13 \nyears old on that fateful day in August 1945, when a B-29 bomber named \n``Enola Gay'' dropped the first nuclear weapon, ``Little Boy,'' over \nHiroshima. More than four square miles of the city were instantly and \ncompletely destroyed. More than 90,000 people died instantly. Another \n50,000 died by the end of that year. Three days later, another B-29 \ndropped ``Fat Man'' over Nagasaki, killing 39,000 people and injuring \n25,000 more.\n  In 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, it became clear that \ntwo oceans could not protect us from a nuclear attack at home.\n  The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 showed the entire world how close it \ncould come to catastrophe, and gave supreme urgency to nuclear arms \ncontrol.\n  In 1968, the Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed in Moscow, London, \nand Washington, DC, and went into full effect in 1970. For the next 20 \nyears, the United States and the Soviet Union negotiated a series of \nlandmark treaties to keep the world from blowing itself up.\n  Some say these efforts on arms control have not prevented the spread \nof nuclear weapons. But look at the past 15 years; South Africa, \nBelarus, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine--the world's third largest nuclear \npower--renounced the use of nuclear weapons and joined the Non-\nProliferation Treaty as non-nuclear states.\n  Britain and France ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Even \nthough the U.S. Senate did not ratify this landmark treaty, every \nsignatory and ratifier has obeyed the spirit of the treaty and not \ntested nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia have removed \nthousands of nuclear weapons from alert status, reduced the number of \nweapons, and coordinated in protecting nuclear materials from theft.\n  Without this amendment, we turn our backs on five decades of progress \nin reducing the threat we and the world face from nuclear weapons. Some \nin the administration argue that in today's world the yield of the \nnuclear weapons in our current arsenals is so immense that our enemies \nknow that we will never use them. They argue that these massive nuclear \nweapons have no deterrent value against many of today's adversaries and \nthat we need smaller, more ``usable'' nuclear weapons to make \ndeterrence more credible.\n  In fact, if we start treating nuclear weapons as just another weapon \nin our arsenal, we will increase the likelihood of their use--not only \nagainst our adversaries, but also against ourselves. We would be \ndangerously blurring the line between nuclear and conventional weapons, \nand tear down the firewall between these weapons that has served us so \nwell in preventing nuclear war in the entire half-century since World \nWar II.\n  As Secretary of State Powell said last year, ``Nuclear weapons in \nthis day and age may serve some deterrent effect, and so be it, but to \nthink of using them as just another weapon in what might start out as a \nconventional conflict in this day and age seems to me to be something \nthat no side should be contemplating.''\n  It is difficult to believe that these new types of nuclear weapons \nserve any rational military purpose. As we saw in the first Persian \nGulf war and again in the war against Iraq, precision-guided \nconventional and stand-off weapons serve us incredibly well. How could \nlow-yield nuclear weapons be any more effective than the precision-\nguided conventional weapons? And their radioactive fall-out would be \nfar more dangerous to our ground troops and to civilian populations.\n  Our goal is to prevent nuclear wars, not start them. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve the Feinstein-Kennedy amendment, and say ``no'' \nto any such fateful step on the road to nuclear war.\n  I wanted to thank my good friend and colleague from California for \nher presentation earlier this afternoon and also for her eloquence when \nwe addressed this issue earlier in the session.\n\n[[Page S11445]]\n\nShe has reminded us in this body about how this administration has been \nevolving its whole nuclear policy with very subtle changes, moving us \nin a very dramatic and different direction than has been generally \nembraced over the period of the last 50 years.\n  What she has commented on, and what troubles me and, I think, \nincreasingly Members of the Senate at these hearings that have been \nheld, by and large under security conditions and not in the broad \ndaylight for public debate and discussions--I think, hopefully, as a \nresult of these discussions and the understanding we have developed \nhere, and has been particularly well developed--I think in the House of \nRepresentatives by many of those on both sides of the aisle, I might \nadd, Republican and Democrat alike, who have examined this in \nconsiderable detail, they have reviewed this and made a very strong \nrecommendation we not move in this direction.\n  I don't think anyone can say our House colleagues have been negligent \nin assuring that we were going to develop the kinds of defense systems \nand also the defense capability to ensure the protection for our \nnational security.\n  As shown on this chart, we review very briefly the half century of \narms control. Going back over the period of time, in 1963 there was the \nPartial Test Ban Treaty, and there was the Nonproliferation Treaty in \n1970. We also see the SALT and ABM Treaties, and also SALT II. These \nare all efforts by both Republicans and Democrats to move us away from \nthe real dangers of nuclear confrontation and nuclear war. As we \nremember, a number of years ago we talked about the ``nuclear winter'' \nas well. We have seen enormous progress that has been made and great \nleadership by both Republicans and Democrats. Many of our colleagues in \nthe recent past, such as Senators Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn, with the \ndevelopment of the Nunn-Lugar provisions, tried to get those countries \nthat have been willing to sign on and move us away from the dangers of \nnuclear proliferation, to get help and assistance from the United \nStates to help them achieve that goal. Now we have a very different \ndirection.\n  Finally, we have these statements made by the administration. Fred \nCelek said:\n\n       If a nuclear bomb could be developed to penetrate rock and \n     concrete and still explode, it will ultimately get fielded.\n       I have a bias in favor of the lowest usable yield because I \n     have advised the use of that which will cause minimum \n     destruction.\n\n  We are basically talking about an effort that recognizes a very \nimportant part of our history--Republicans and Democrats--to move us \naway from nuclear proliferation, and the United States has been a \nleader. Other countries have been willing. That has been the result of \n50 years of work of Republicans and Democrats.\n  Now, in a world of increased tension, in many respects as a result of \nterrorism, we are finding ourselves in a situation where the \nadministration wants to alter that policy in terms of development and \ntesting. Mininukes--and there is really no such thing as a small nuke; \na nuke is a nuke. It is no different by nature, disposition, and its \ncapability. Those who have served in the military are familiar with a \ngreat deal of information regarding nuclear weapons. Our present \nSecretary of State wrote a book and included the comments I stated. As \na former military officer, he understands this. At a time, frankly, \nwhen we are unsurpassed in terms of our military capability, why in the \nworld do we want to develop small conventional systems which will \ntrigger other countries to do that. That could compromise what we have \ntoday in terms of our military and our Armed Forces.\n  There is one modern military force in the world, and it happens to be \nthe United States. We have to keep it that way. Why put at risk that \nadvantage with the proliferation by other countries of small useful \nnukes--I think that is unwise--as well as the dangers it would pose in \nterms of the growth of terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murkowski). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I very much thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his remarks. I appreciate very much his leadership \nand support on this issue. I want to make some comments in response to \nthe chairman's comments.\n  The first is, on July 16, the House published their report. I would \nlike to read excerpts from the House Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act into the Record because I think it sets some things \nstraight:\n\n       Before any of the existing program goals have been \n     successfully demonstrated, the Administration is now \n     proposing to spend millions on enhanced test readiness while \n     maintaining the moratorium on nuclear testing, aggressively \n     pursue a multi-billion dollar Modern Pit Facility before the \n     first production pit has even been successfully certified for \n     use in the stockpile, develop a robust nuclear earth \n     penetrator weapon and begin additional advanced concepts \n     research on new nuclear weapons. It appears to the Committee \n     the Department is proposing to rebuild, restart and redo and \n     otherwise exercise every capability that was used over the \n     past forty years of the Cold War and at the same time prepare \n     for a future with an expanded mission for nuclear weapons. \n     Nothing in the past performance of the NNSA convinces this \n     Committee that the successful implementation of Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program is a foregone conclusion, which makes the \n     pursuit of a broad range of new initiatives premature. Until \n     the NNSA has demonstrated to the Congress that it can \n     successfully meet its primary mission of maintaining the \n     safety, security, and viability of the existing stockpile by \n     executing the Stockpile Life Extension Program and Science-\n     based Stewardship activities on time and within budget, this \n     Committee will not support redirecting the management \n     resources and attention to a series of new initiatives.\n\n  What they are saying is, shouldn't we certify before starting this \nprogram? Shouldn't we certify to its safety? There are just a few \nreasons to do that. I am going to bring up the Rocky Flats plant \nnorthwest of Denver.\n  Fourteen years ago, this plant, which had produced pultonium pits, \nsank permanently into a multibillion-dollar cesspool of contamination, \ncriminality, and managerial incompetence. I am quoting from an article \nin the bulletin of Atomic Scientists:\n\n       Not to worry says, the Department of Energy, Rocky Flats II \n     will have all the necessary equipment for suppressing \n     plutonium fires that regrettably cannot be totally \n     eliminated, but whose frequency and severity can be reduced, \n     and even planned for, in the structural and process designs.\n\n  This keeps getting mixed up. We already have $2.3 billion \nappropriated for a pit facility at Los Alamos, and that facility will \nbegin producing 20 pits per year in 2007 and can be equipped to produce \nas many as 80 pits per year and can be further enlarged to produce 150 \npits per year. At what are we throwing this money? How big does this \nthing have to get? That is what is going on in this. It may be that Los \nAlamos is having trouble with it. I don't know. But I do know this: \nThrowing money at it is not the solution.\n  It might be useful to put the entire report language in the Record. I \nask unanimous consent to print the report language in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Funding, House Language on New Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Testing, \n                           September 12, 2003\n\n       The Senate is currently considering the Energy & Water \n     Appropriations bill. On Tuesday, Senators Feinstein and \n     Kennedy will offer an amendment to reduce and restrict \n     funding for specific nuclear weapons budget items.

The Committee \n     is concerned the NNSA is being tasked to start new activities \n     with significant outyear budget impacts before the \n     Administration has articulated the specific requirements to \n     support the President's announced stockpile modifications. \n     Under current plans, the NNSA is attempting to modernize the \n     industrial infrastructure of the weapons complex and restore \n     production plant capability in order to refurbish the entire \n     START I stockpile, reengineer the Federal management \n     structure of the complex\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\n     and downsize the workforce by 20 percent by the end of fiscal \n     year 2004, while struggling to successfully demonstrate its \n     core mission of maintaining the existing stockpile through \n     the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Before any of the existing \n     program goals have been successfully demonstrated, the \n     Administration is now proposing to spend millions on enhanced \n     test readiness while maintaining the moratorium on nuclear \n     testing, aggressively pursue a multi-billion dollar Modern \n     Pit Facility before the first production pit has been \n     successfully certified for use in the stockpile, develop a \n     robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon and begin additional \n     advanced concepts research on new nuclear weapons. It appears \n     to the Committee the Department is proposing to rebuild, \n     restart, and redo and otherwise exercise every capability \n     that was used over the past forty years of the Cold War and \n     at the same time prepare for a future with an expanded \n     mission for nuclear weapons. Nothing in the past performance \n     of the NNSA convinces this Committee that the successful \n     implementation of Stockpile Stewardship program is a foregone \n     conclusion, which makes the pursuit of a broad range of new \n     initiatives premature. Until the NNSA has demonstrated to the \n     Congress that it can successfully meet its primary mission of \n     maintaining the safety, security, and viability of the \n     existing stockpile by executing the Stockpile Life Extension \n     Program and Science-based Stewardship activities on time and \n     within budget, this Committee will not support redirecting \n     the management resources and attention to a series of new \n     initiatives. (Emphasis added.)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Madam President, it may be useful \nto think for a moment--the chairman started me thinking. He asked the \nquestion: Why did we need 40,000 nuclear weapons? The answer is we \ndidn't. Now 40 years later, we are left with enormous problems: 40,000 \nnuclear weapons which this country entered into the study, the \nresearch, the design, and the development of. We could blow up this \nEarth time and time and time again, obliterate it from existence. Does \nanyone think that makes sense--40,000? No, because what happens is the \neconomic urge, the parochial nature of States--all of this takes over \nand subliminally, under the radar, huge weapons systems become \ndeveloped which need to be maintained, secured, activated, and \ndeactivated.\n  It is a crazy system, and we all pat ourselves on the back and think \nwe are good Americans. Does anybody believe the United States of \nAmerica needed 40,000 nuclear weapons? But we built them. That is what \nis happening here again. That is exactly what is happening here again.\n  We are appropriating money for a $4 billion bomb factory in addition \nto the $2.3 billion bomb factory we already appropriated. If they can't \ndo it for $2.3 billion--and I am talking about Los Alamos run by the \nUniversity of California--if they can't do it, let's take a good look \nat the reasons.\n  Other nations know what we are doing. The Finnish Foreign Minister, \njust a week ago, commenting on our failure to ratify the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, the move sent completely the wrong message to the \ninternational community.\n  That is exactly what I have been saying. That is exactly what we are \ndoing. We are sending a message we are doing it and, believe me, others \nwill follow suit.\n  Then he went on and said:\n\n       We should be concerned about the development of weapons of \n     mass destruction even in the case of low-yield weapons, the \n     foreign minister said in an interview to be published in the \n     Austrian daily Die Press on Friday. Muhammad el-Baradei, the \n     head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, accused the \n     United States last week of effectively breaking a ban on the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through its \n     research on so-called mini-nukes.\n\n  The chairman says there is no research going on regarding mininukes. \nThen why did we repeal the Spratt-Furse language that for 10 years \nprevented the development of mininukes? Why did we do it if we were not \ngoing to build it? This is the deception. This is the covert nature of \nthese programs. I do not doubt that we are building them.\n  To say this is not happening really bothers me. If my colleagues do \nnot believe it is happening, reread the Nuclear Posture Review. Every \nMember has access to the classified version of the Nuclear Posture \nReview which came out in January of 2000. They can read the \nunclassified version. For these purposes, I am going to quote from the \nNew York Times of March 10. This is about the Nuclear Posture Review.\n  It stresses a need to develop earth-penetrating nuclear weapons to \ndestroy heavily fortified underground bunkers, including those that may \nbe used to store chemical and biological weapons.\n  Now I am quoting from parts of the article.\n  There is a quote again from the Pentagon: This administration is \nfashioning a more diverse set of options for deterring the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction. That is why we are pursuing advanced \nconventional forces and improved intelligence capabilities. A \ncombination of offensive and defensive and nuclear and nonnuclear \ncapabilities is essential to meet the deterrence requirements of the \n21st century.\n  In my mind, what that means is the smaller nuclear weapons will be \nbuilt below 5 kiloton. The difference is kind of blurred between \nconventional and nuclear weapons and it makes it easier to use the \nnuclear weapon on the battlefield. That is what I believe is going on.\n  Another place states: Adding new detail to previous briefings, the \nPentagon says that its future force structure will have the following \ncomponents. By 2012: 14 Trident submarines with two in overhead at one \ntime. They will be part of a triad that will include hundreds of \nMinuteman III land-based missiles, 100 B-52, H and B-2 bombers. That is \nan operationally deployed force of about 1,700 to 2,200 strategic \nnuclear warheads.\n  The Pentagon said that nuclear planning is not merely a question of \nnumbers. The Pentagon also wants to improve existing nuclear weapons \nand possibly develop new ones. The report cites the need to approve \nearth-penetrating weapons. In general, the Pentagon report stresses the \nneed for nuclear weapons that would be more easy to use against enemy \nweapons because they would be of variable or low yield, be highly \naccurate, could be quickly targeted.\n  It is going on. No matter how one wants to cloak advanced weapons \nconcept designs, it means new nuclear weapons, and that is what we are \ndoing. We are breaking a 60-year tradition. We are going to move up \ntesting. Testing does not need to be moved up. Why do they want to move \nup testing to the basic minimum time possible when the experts say it \nis not possible to do it in 18 months?\n  Now, you can believe that we can be fairly assured by the fact that \nwe spend $400 billion a year on our defense, more than every other \nnation on Earth combined; that maybe ought to give us an element of \nsecurity; but I think to open this door, to walk through a nuclear \ndoor, to propose that we are going to begin to develop low-yield \nnuclear weapons and nuclear bunker busters sets an example for the \nworld. They read the Nuclear Posture Review. They read the Washington \nPost. They read the French press. They read the speeches. They \nknow what is happening. So we are setting an example for other nations. \nWe say all the time that we do not want to proliferate, and we are \nencouraging proliferation by our own actions. Forty thousand nuclear \nweapons, I guess 45 years ago or 40 years later--I bet there is no one \nin the United States who can say we need 40,000 nuclear weapons, but we \ndevelop them. They are there. A lot of them have been disarmed.\n\n  We are going to begin now this next generation. It is wrong. It is \nmorally wrong. It is wrong for our children. It is wrong for our \nsoldiers who have to go on the battlefield.\n  Take another look at Hiroshima. Both Senator Kennedy and I spelled \nout the number of deaths. If we add them all up within a year, I think \nbetween Hiroshima and Nagasaki it totals 220,000 dead. That is a \ncombination of a 15-kiloton bomb--what was it, a 21-kiloton bomb at \nNagasaki--and we are talking about a 100-kiloton nuclear bunker buster.\n  Look at this devastation. This is one bomb. I will never forget as a \n12-year-old what we grew up with. Children today have different fears, \nbut what we grew up with was the fear of an atomic bomb. That is why \nthe daisy spot that was used in the Goldwater campaign had such an \nimpact because there was a whole generation of young children who were \nimpacted by it. I was one of them. Senator Kennedy is the same \ngeneration. He was one of them.\n  When we were young, we said: We are never going to let this happen \nagain. But in the Senate we are letting it happen again. If this Senate \ndoes not do\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nwhat the House of Representatives does, I think there is a moral \ndegradation spread over this whole body because we will then become the \nones who launched the new generation of nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for one or two \nquestions?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I saw the photograph that the Senator has of Hiroshima. \nI have a chart that gives us a for instance. If we use a 5-kiloton \nearth-penetrating nuclear explosion in Damascus--this is just a for \ninstance, obviously--and they had the traditional winds that flow from \nthe east to the west, it gives the general flowline of where the \nradioactivity and the dust would flow, but we can see roughly it would \ngo from Syria, across northern Israel through southern Lebanon, just \nnorth of Haifa. The best estimates would be 230,000 fatalities and \n280,000 casualties. This is a 5 kiloton bomb.\n  I have heard the Senator from California talk about the fact that \nthis is a mini-nuke, but she has just again restated very clearly that \nthere is really no such thing as a mini-nuke. We are talking about \nweapons that have such a massive, distinctive, unique, and special \nquality that they have such an extraordinary danger to all of those who \nare directly affected, and those who would be indirectly affected well \ninto the future.\n  So we are looking at these casualties the Senator mentioned, \nHiroshima and Nagasaki. We can also look at what the casualties would \nbe with the 5-kiloton earth penetrator that went down to 30 feet in \ndepth. We are talking about major devastation that this country, as \nSenator Feinstein has said so eloquently, has never accepted--through \nRepublican and Democratic control; this has not been a partisan issue \nover a long period of time.\n  Let me just ask the Senator a final question that is the question I \nthink all Americans are wondering about: whether we have security of \nour current nuclear capacity. This is raised in discussion and debate. \nWhy should we ever take a chance, in terms of what we do have, in terms \nof a current capability?\n  I have seen and read and heard the directors of the laboratories that \nhave responsibility for this repeatedly indicate their sense of \nassurance. They are skilled, committed individuals who have dedicated \nbasically their lives to ensure the deterrent capability of our \ncapacity, in terms of nuclear weapons. They give the assurance to us \nthat we can give to the American people that we have the capability and \nit is current.\n  I am just interested, as someone who has spent a great deal of time \non this, because this is an issue that has been talked about a great \ndeal even during the course of this debate, whether the Senator \nbelieves she can give assurances unequivocally to the American people \nfrom what we do have--from her knowledge of the lab directors--that we \nare able to give them the assurance that our nuclear stockpile is \ncurrent and capable and ready to meet the test if called upon.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair, respectfully, to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I think no one can give an unequivocal statement that \nour nuclear supplies, plants, et cetera, are unequivocally safe. I \nthink a lot of steps have been taken.\n  As to whether they are adequate to meet any challenge, I have never \nheard anyone say they were not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the distinction the Senator has made. She \ngets to the nub of the issue: The question, in other words, is whether \nwe have an adequate stockpile--more than an adequate stockpile, as the \nSenator has pointed out.\n  I thank the Senator. This is an issue of enormous importance and \nconsequence. I share the view of the Senator that we have many \ndifferent, important issues that are before Congress this year: \nObviously, the overarching issues, the conflict in Iraq and the war on \nterror, and how we are going to deal with those, as well as other \npriorities to which we are committed. But the issue in terms of the \nsecurity, even as we are thinking about the nature of terrorism, I \nthink she would agree with me, is also related to the whole issue of \nthe battle against terrorism, as well, in terms of what the potential \nmay be in the future with the development of these, what they call \nmini-nukes, and what that means in terms of the proliferation issue.\n  I thank the Senator for her comments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. The Senator \nwas not in the Chamber. But the chart I used was of a predicted \nradioactive fallout from a B61-11, the 300-kiloton explosion in west \nPyongyang, North Korea, using historical weather data for the month of \nMay. It is a similar chart to what the Senator has shown, but it gives \nthe 48-hour dose of radiation contamination. The possible effects of \nradioactive fallout should a nuclear weapon be used include, possible \nradiation burns; change in blood chemistry, hemorrhaging, as well as \ndeaths in weeks or months--it is a terrible chart to have to look at. \nOf course, this is an extraordinarily large device, so we are not \ntalking about a bunker buster. That is 300 kilotons. But that is the \nchart that we happen to have.\n  I think the thing that bothers me most about this program is that \nnobody really knows what is going to be produced with all this money. \nIt always happens kind of under the shelf. Then the economics of it \nbecome so important that there needs to be a continuation of it. I \nreally suspect that is why we ended up with 40,000 nuclear bombs--\nbecause once you get into it, it just keeps going and keeps rolling; \nthere are constant demands. I think that is indicated by the fact that \nwe have already appropriated $2.3 billion for this plutonium pit \nfacility at Los Alamos and reportedly this pit facility, if it is able \nto be built correctly, can take care of all of the needs for the \nforeseeable future.\n  But this is another $4 billion program--that is over 10 years--of \nwhich an amount is authorized in this bill that we are trying to strike \nbecause there is no need for it. I think we have tried to lay out the \narguments here. This is not an easy issue. I really believe we will \nprobably never have more of an issue of conscience in this session than \nwe do in this vote. I think the House of Representatives have given \ntheir consciences a test and measured up by eliminating the funds. They \nsaid clearly we are not ready to spend these funds in the report \nlanguage that I read and put in the Record. And the balance really \nrests with the Senate.\n  I suspect we may be defeated. It will be a conferenceable item, and \nall of those who want this new generation of nuclear weapons will end \nup prevailing. But I can tell you I don't want my fingerprint on it. I \ndon't want to have to say what I have done to my children.\n  Every bit of information I have ever received indicates that with the \nmost superior conventional weapons forces in the world, and an amount \nof money spent that is more than that spent by all of the nations put \ntogether, a huge nuclear arsenal, and the ability to dial up or down \nthe kilotonnage of our nuclear bombs--my hope is we will continue our \ncommitment to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty; that we will not be \nhypocritical; that we will live by our words, our statements; if we \nwant other nations not to proliferate; that we will see that we do not \ndevelop the mechanisms by which proliferation is incentivized or \ncarried out.\n  So I think this is a very big vote. I really hope the Members of this \nesteemed body will vote yes to strike the money from this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, Senator Kennedy is still in the \nChamber, and he asked a question of the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia about the safety of our nuclear weapons.\n  Senator Kennedy, once a year, each of three civilian men--it happens \nin this case they are men. I don't think there has been a woman in \ncharge of either of the three nuclear laboratories since their \ninception. But, once a year, three civilians certify to the President \nof the United States that, to the best of their knowledge, the nuclear \nstockpile is intact, safe, and reliable.\n  That has been going on for well over 60 years. But only 8 years ago, \nor 9, we changed the way those men concluded the weapons were safe and \nreliable and ready. Properly or improperly, we said no more underground \ntesting. Prior to that, every time a certification was\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\nmade to the President, it was predicated upon the single best way to \ndetermine the validity of a weapon, and that was to test it.\n  Now we have said let us do it another way. Let us send a signal to \nthe world we don't want to test underground. This amendment is \nrelevant, which I will tell you about in a moment.\n  We said to the scientists, How much money do you need to get the best \nequipment, including new equipment, to determine the validity of the \nweapons without testing? That is called science-based stockpile \nstewardship. There are many who do not think it will work, that we will \nhave to return someday not for a new stockpile, but to answer that \nquestion we might have to return to testing.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts has studied these issues, and \nhe is a very involved Senator. But I spent a huge portion of my life \nlearning this. We are going through the throes of the most incredible \nkind of research just to determine there is nothing wrong with the \ninnards of a 40-year-old bomb, or 30-year-old bomb as we reduce from \n40,000 to 5,000, or less, which is where we are now and heading down.\n  Yes. The answer is if you follow that sequence, those men not too \nlong ago told the President they are OK. But in this amendment, one \nportion the Senator from California strikes is a provision that could \nbe freestanding and important. It has nothing whatsoever to do with a \nnew weapons system. It just says bring the test site in Nevada current \nso it doesn't take 3 years if you make a decision to use it. One \nportion does that. Instead of letting that system in Nevada degenerate \nso that if you need it, it will take 3 years to build it up, part of \nthis amendment says move it along so it is only 18 months.\n  If you want to conclude that is in there because we want to build a \nwhole new system of weapons, you can do that. But the truth is it is in \nthere because the time has come to get it more relevant to the problems \nwe may be confronted with in terms of one of these directors saying we \nhad better test the weapon. Then we have to wait 3 years. Part of this \namendment says no, you will only have to wait 1\\1/2\\ years. That part \nshould pass under all circumstances. Why the United States House of \nRepresentatives said no, I can't understand. The Senate said yes \nalready, overwhelmingly.\n  This amendment would take it out and say leave it at 3 years; let the \nreliability kind of lie in wait in case we need it to test a weapon; \nlet it be 3 years instead of 1\\1/2\\ years.\n  The second part of this amendment: There is no use today on the floor \nof the Senate in terms of this amendment to talk about the fact that \nyears ago we had 40,000 nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union had \n60,000. Those are true numbers. That happened. I am not sure the last \nnumber is right, but it is plenty more than 40,000. We are on the way \ndown substantially while three or four new countries are added that I \ndon't think had anything to do with this amendment. Pakistan had \nnothing to do with this amendment as they developed their nuclear \nweapon. I don't believe this amendment has anything to do with the \nNorth Koreans. This amendment says get that site ready in case we have \nto test the weapons we own.\n  We can get up here and talk all we want about America is already \nbuilding new nuclear weapons, but it isn't true. If any Senator stands \nup here and says we are making new nuclear weapons and they are just \nlittle nuclear weapons, I submit they ought to ask anybody they want \nunder oath anywhere in the Government, and the answer will be we \naren't, we haven't, and we will not build a nuclear weapon until \nCongress says we can.\n  Building a nuclear weapon is not in this language. Look at it. Look \nat every single word. See if it says you are going to build one nuclear \nweapon with the money in this appropriations bill. It in no way permits \nthe building of a nuclear weapon. It does what I said about the Nevada \nTest Site. It says to our scientists at these laboratories, In the \nmeantime you can study, you can research weapons of the future. And it \nnames the kinds of things we might be looking at in the future.\n  I submit that for a great nation to say anything to its scientists \nbut you can do that is absolutely crazy. Do you mean we are going to \ntell these great scientists we don't know what is going to be here in \n15 years, but you better not be studying what kind of weapons we are \ngoing to need in 15 years because we are scared of that, we think that \nmeans we are going to build new weapons? I don't believe that. I \nbelieve they ought to be permitted to study. They ought to be permitted \nto think. We ought to be wondering about underground chemical plants \nthat might be building things to destroy the world. I see nothing wrong \nwith that. I do not see that as threatening to anyone, for it builds \nnothing. If anything, it builds brainpower on the part of the great \nscientists, and that is it.\n  The last one about a plant to manufacture pits: This request says \nthat for the next 40 years--40 years--we may need pit replacements from \ntime to time for our nuclear weapons. That is a given. It says let us \ndesign the complex to do that.\n  This amendment doesn't say cut it in half, we don't want you to make \nit so big. We say send us the plans and we will look at them. This says \ndon't do it. Why not do it? Every other country with nuclear weapons \nhas spare pits, I regret to say. But for us, it doesn't mean much. \nNobody has to be scared. That doesn't mean next week or next month, but \nit is something our experts are saying shouldn't exist too long. And we \nare busy trying to build a couple in a makeshift manner, to which my \nfriend from California alludes. It is not a factory. It will not take \ncare of 30 or 40 years of the future. It is a makeshift assembly in the \ncity of Los Alamos as part of the research laboratory. It has been a \ndevil of a job for them to manufacture consistent with the need for a \nplutonium pit for a nuclear weapon.\n  Today we are discussing things which we hardly ever discuss. But I \nbelieve at 10 minutes of 5 on the 15th day of September on a Monday, if \nwe were authorizing the building of new nuclear weapons, there would be \na block of Senators on this floor. There would be steam heat from those \nwho oppose it.\n  The truth is that isn't what the amendment does. It is not an \namendment that will build any new nuclear bombs.\n  I repeat: As important as it is, and as magnificent as the Senator \nfrom California is in her presentation on September 15, it is not an \namendment that has anything to do with building or not building nuclear \nweapons, for we are not authorizing that. It won't happen because of \nwhat we are doing. And she won't stop it from happening with her \namendment because it isn't happening to begin with.\n  Essentially, the Senator indicated it is a moral issue. That is an \neasy term to throw around--a moral issue. I could probably say it is a \nmoral issue, also. I understand it in stark, objective terms. It does \nnot frighten me a bit.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I am more frightened to think of having the \nscientists who have manned our nuclear laboratories told they cannot \nthink and plan for the future regardless of what their great brains say \nmight be around the corner, over the hill, or in some decade to come, \nfor these United States. That frightens me more and creates more of a \nmoral issue than the issue that is not even an issue, to wit, we are \nbuilding more nuclear weapons, a new arsenal, and the like.\n  It cannot be a moral issue for me because a negative can hardly be. \nIf you are not doing it, it does not seem to me to be an issue, moral \nor otherwise. That is how I see it.\n  The Senator suspects we will win. I am not sure. If the Senate has \nany consistency, we should. We already won once. In fact, since then we \nhave learned a lot more. But we have reduced it to dollars and to \nprograms that had been authorized. It is easier to see what we are and \nare not doing in this amendment, in this appropriations bill, than it \nwas when we voted in favor of the authorization bill. I am not sure how \nit will come out. I am not sure what will happen in the House. I \nguarantee if the Senate votes to go to conference with the language we \nhave written in this bill that came out of Appropriations, we will \nconsider it a very important issue for America's future. It will not be \neasy to give it away to a House that canceled it and spent the money on \nwater projects instead of these issues. That was the outcome.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could inquire quickly of the Senator, as I \nremember,\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\nwe had the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at that time in 1998 \nwhen we considered the comprehensive test ban treaty. We did not ratify \nit, but it was supported. I don't know, as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, of any request by the Joint Chiefs of Staff that \nthey have made, any representation to the Armed Services Committee that \nthey believe our nuclear capability and capacity is in any way \nthreatened today.\n  We do have the testing capability. It takes anywhere from 24 to 36 \nmonths to move ahead on the tests. I don't know that we know of any \nrequests made by the Joint Chiefs or any chiefs or the Secretary of \nDefense specifically suggesting our capability regarding our nuclear \nweapons is anything but robust and capable now. It is very important we \nknow as we debate this issue. I would be interested in the Senator's \nanswer to that.\n  Second, I understand what has been done with the separate amendment \nwhich prohibited the development and testing of mini-nukes, as well as \na number of provisions in the Spratt amendment in the authorization \ncommittee. When we get a conference report, as a member of that \nconference, the conferees understand that issue will be resolved. The \nSpratt amendment will no longer be in effect.\n  So on the one hand the authorization committee will eliminate the \nSpratt amendment, which would have actually prohibited the development \nof anything below the 5 kiloton. Now we are on the second phase of this \nappropriations process in terms of the Department of Energy, and the \nSenator is saying the money in here cannot be used for this \ndevelopment. But it is clear, as the Senator from California has \npointed out, from the Nuclear Posture Review, the debate on the \nauthorization, and the elimination of the Spratt amendment, the \ncontinued effort to put the money in mini-nukes, this is the dangerous \ndirection the administration is moving.\n\n  I hear what the Senator has said and the assurances the Senator has \ngiven to Members, but I wonder why we cannot have more clarity \nregarding the legislation.\n  Finally, I will add with regard to the scientists and what they were \nable and not able to pursue. As the Senator knows, we had the most \nextraordinary upgrading of weaponry, particularly in the Iraq \nsituation, particularly on the precise guidance and precision bombs. We \nwill not take the time in this debate to review it, but there has been \nabsolutely extraordinary progress made in the area of conventional \nforces. The scientists have been working effectively. That has enhanced \nour capability.\n  I am interested whether the Senator knows of any Joint Chiefs who \nbelieve the nuclear weapon stockpile would require additional testing?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, let me answer this way: I don't \nbelieve there is a single member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a single \nexpert in the United States of America on its nuclear weapons arsenal, \nthat if asked would they prefer that the Nevada Test Site be ready for \ntests in 18 months or 3 years, would not answer: 18 months; 3 years is \ntoo long.\n  If you ask me, I will tell you. I believe there is no one who is \ncertain that over time what we are doing is going to work and that we \nare not going to have to go to testing at some time. Almost everyone \nsays that. Since they say it, I am confident they would rather have the \nNevada Test Site ready in a shorter timeframe rather than longer.\n  I thank the Senator for the question. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the only question, then, is an issue of timing and \nupgrading the testing to reduce it from 2 years to 18 months or 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, I don't think we would have an amendment here. We know that \nalone does not show the thrust of what we believe will be permitted \nwith this policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthis amendment in support of the Senator from New Mexico and in \nopposition to the proponents of the amendment.\n  It seems to me, this amendment seeks to put our head in the sand and \nignore circumstances around us in the vain hope that somehow everyone \nelse in the world has as good intentions as the United States and if we \njust wish hard enough that they will not cause trouble.\n  The amendment says we ought to at least be thinking about what we \nwould do in the event that we decide our deterrent was no longer \ncredible enough to deter the threats against us.\n  Everyone supports the idea of a deterrent. That includes a nuclear \ndeterrent. That is, frankly, one of the things that kept the Soviets \nand the United States from engaging in a hot war during the cold war.\n  What we are saying is, sometimes when things change, you have to \nthink about what that means in terms of your defense posture. This is \none of those times. What the amendment would do is stop us from \nthinking about it. If you concede we need a nuclear deterrent, you \nshould not propose an amendment that says we cannot think about it.\n  One thing that has changed, we no longer face an opponent which, like \nthe United States, had these huge multimega tonnage weapons that were \nbasically conceived, developed, and deployed in order to scare the \nother side into believing if they ever attacked, we would incinerate \nmost of the people in the other country. These were not bunker-busting \nbombs. These were city-killing bombs, bombs that would be detonated \nover the opponents' city, killing literally millions of people. That \nwas such a scary thought in the cold war it deterred aggression.\n  The question is, Would that same deterrent work? I ask in the case of \nIraq, if Iraq used chemical or biological weapons against the United \nStates, does anyone believe that a credible United States threat would \nhave been dropping one of our large massive nuclear weapons over \nBaghdad, killing millions of innocent Iraqis? It is not a credible \ndeterrent.\n\n  So in a world where you have terrorist organizations and terrorist-\nsponsored states, and you no longer have the two great superpowers--the \nSoviet Union and the United States--facing off against each other, the \nquestion is, What kind of a nuclear deterrent should we have?\n  What this amendment would do is stop us from even thinking about \nthat. It seems to me we ought to be thinking about that. And if \nsmaller, more precise weapons could do the job just as well, wouldn't \npeople of good will, who are concerned about unnecessary death, be \ninterested in at least thinking about weapons that would pose a \ndeterrent to an attack but would not kill as many people, would not \nkill so indiscriminately?\n  One of the great lessons from this Iraqi experience is that we now \nhave the capability of delivering weapons very precisely. Wouldn't it \nbe better to do that, even in a nuclear context, than the one we are in \nnow?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts just alluded to the great progress \nmade in precision conventional weaponry. Even that, however, was not \nsufficient to destroy at least one, and I believe some, of the bunkers \nin Iraq. And without getting into a lot of detail, let me just say we \nare well aware that there are countries in the world that have \ndeveloped extraordinarily robust underground facilities that we are \ngoing to have to take out if we are ever to win a military conflict \nwith them. If we do not have the capability of doing that, they have \nthe upper hand.\n  Wouldn't it make sense to be able to deliver very precisely the kind \nof weapon that we are asking just to be able to think about here in \norder to destroy that kind of facility? The conventional weaponry will \nnot do it, as precise as it is. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed \nout, we are not asking for money to do it. We are just asking to allow \nour scientists to think about what would be necessary and what would be \npossible--perhaps maybe not even necessary but perhaps make \nrecommendations to us so we could then act on those recommendations.\n  To this matter of the time, I am glad the Senator from Massachusetts \nperhaps conceded the point that if we need to reduce the time necessary \nto prepare our Nevada Test Site, we should have the ability to do that. \nAll of the experts--the Senator from New Mexico is correct--agree that \nwe should not have to wait 3 years to even test a weapon. As a matter \nof fact, one of the problems is that we do not necessarily\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\nknow whether our nuclear weapons--the existing ones--will work well \nafter all of these years. And our opponents do not necessarily know.\n  Also, the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is merely a bunch of \ncomputers designed to tell us, as best they can, whether they think \nthese weapons will work, is not a perfect system at all. It is not \ngoing to be done for years. It is not at all sure it will provide us \nwhat we need to know.\n  But if we have an inkling that one of our weapons cannot be \ncertified, and we decide to have a test in order to determine whether \nit can be certified, right now we are in for a very long period of time \nin which our potential enemies know full well that we do not have full \nconfidence in our stockpile; that we are preparing to conduct tests, \nand obviously the only reason we are preparing to conduct tests is that \nwe do not have full confidence, and we are going to have to test \nsomething in order to see what kind of changes would have to be made. \nAnd that process would take 3 years. That process makes no sense at \nall.\n\n  Another argument that makes no sense at all is that it is important \nfor the United States to lead and that it is going to be impossible for \nus to argue--how little confidence this shows in the United States. Can \nwe have confidence that we are right? The argument is that we cannot \nlead if we even think about developing new nuclear weapons; we cannot \ntell others in the world to stop developing nuclear weapons as long as \nwe are developing nuclear weapons.\n  Now, that is perverse thinking. When the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty was entered into, it recognized that certain countries in the \nworld, including the United States, had nuclear weapons. This was not a \nbad thing. In fact, the NPT even called for us to share our nuclear \npeaceful technology with other countries if they would foreswear \ndevelopment of their weaponry.\n  We have had a self-imposed moratorium now for many years even on the \ntesting of any nuclear weapon. Has it stopped countries from developing \nnuclear weapons? Has it stopped North Korea? Apparently not. Is it \nstopping Iran? No. Did it stop China? No. Did it stop India? No. \nPakistan? No.\n  It looks to me as though the self-imposed moratorium is not very \neffective. And leading the world by saying, ``We are not going to test \nany weapons, would you please not test weapons,'' has resulted in a \nwhole host of countries, most of which are not our allies, developing \nor seeking to develop nuclear weapons. That is not a good thing. It \nshows a failed strategy, not a successful strategy.\n  If these countries are led to believe that the United States will \nkeep up with them, or at least we will not prevent ourselves from \nthinking about keeping up with them, maybe they will be a little less \nlikely to develop these weapons.\n  If North Korea, for example, just speaking hypothetically, believes \nwe are serious about preventing them from acquiring a lot of nuclear \nweapons and proliferating them around the world, clearly, that must \nmean we are willing to use our own nuclear weapons. They have to depend \nupon the United States being confident of our nuclear deterrent and \nbeing willing to use it under certain circumstances. If they cannot be \nconfident of that, then what incentive do they have, except their good \nwill, to not develop their nuclear weapons?\n  So far, the idea that we have to not develop or even think about our \nnuclear weapons in order to induce other countries not to do the same \nhas proven an utter failure. And there are other countries in the \nworld, whose names I could mention, that we believe are also trying to \nacquire this nuclear capability. So our self-imposed moratorium of even \nthinking about these weapons is not doing a very good job of convincing \nother countries to do the same. Better that we recognize reality, get \nour head out of the sand, and acknowledge that if we are going to rely \nupon a nuclear deterrent, we had better be able to think about it and \neven, at some point in the future, be able to do something about it.\n  Let me just make a couple of quick other points, Madam President.\n  We have made the commitment, subject to future development, of \ncourse, to reduce the very large arsenal of our nuclear weapons, and \nnot just to reduce the number but to reduce the quantity of the very \nhigh megatonnage weapons. One of the reasons--well, there are a couple \nof reasons that are relevant here, but one of the reasons is that we do \nnot think we would need that kind of weapon in the future because we no \nlonger are facing a superpower potential enemy such as the Soviet \nUnion. They are also expensive to maintain, I might add. And, thirdly, \nwe know that over time these weapons deteriorate, and at some point we \nare going to want to remove them from our arsenal in any event. So we \nhave made that commitment.\n\n  Now, which is better? Which is better? That we follow through with \nthat commitment to remove this large number of extraordinarily powerful \nnuclear weapons that may or may not be all that safe, and think about \nsubstituting, in some cases, much smaller, much more precise, much \nsafer weapons maybe or just keeping those large weapons around, hoping \nthey will be safe, hoping they will not deteriorate, hoping they will \nwork but, if we ever had to use one, understanding that it would result \nin massive casualties?\n  It seems to me that the people who really value life would want us to \nthink in 21st-century terms, not middle-of-the-20th-century terms, in \nthat regard.\n  Another point: There is a very important relationship between \nresearch and development, and I do not think we should fall into the \ntrap of attempting to separate research from development.\n  The Senator from New Mexico made the point that nobody is talking \nhere about producing weapons. And we are not. But I hope we do not get \nto the point that we are so committed to eliminating U.S. nuclear \nweapons that we would make a decision that said we will never develop \nor, at this point, we are going to put a legislative ban on the \ndevelopment of any such weapons.\n  That would send a very bad signal to countries of the world against \nwhich we want to have some kind of nuclear deterrent. It is a little \nbit like asking what our exit strategy from Iraq is. We would like to \nleave Iraq. But the point is, you don't start signalling before the \ntime is ready that we want to get out of there as soon as we can or the \nterrorists will simply wait us out. You want to demonstrate that you \nare committed to stay as long as it takes.\n  We want to demonstrate to our potential enemies that we are prepared \nto do what it will take to defend the United States. Why would you want \nto signal to them that you are going to put an absolute moratorium on \nresearch and an absolute prohibition on development? That makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  It also ensures that the great scientific minds that in the past have \nbeen willing to work on these projects are no longer going to be \nwilling to come to the National Laboratories of the great prominence we \nhave all been so proud of in the past because there is no future in it. \nThey tell us now that they are not getting the kind of students coming \nout of the universities they were used to. Their manpower, in terms of \nthe capability in nuclear testing, has dwindled to virtually nothing. \nIf they ever had to go back to a test, let alone develop, a nuclear \nweapon, they would have to bring people out of retirement who \nunderstood how it worked back in the 1960s and 1970s, but they would \nhave a lot of difficulty even working with the new kinds of materials, \nwith the new computer technology and other advancements that we would \nprobably want to incorporate into any new designs.\n  If we are going to entice the best minds to think about this, to keep \nup with people in other countries that have no compunction about doing \nthis, we have to send them a signal that we are not forever going to \nshut off any work in this area. What young scientist would want to \ncommit his life's work to this when there is obviously no future in it?\n  We have to think about these things and not be a Luddite about it, \nsaying there is no problem; we are not going to think about it; we will \njust shove it under the rug; we are not for progress; we are for only \nretaining what we developed back in the 1960s and hoping it will work.\n  That is very backward thinking. It is very dangerous thinking.\n  There are a lot of issues involved in this particular amendment. What \nit\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\nboils down to, though, is this: Our first obligation is to ensure the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  One of the pillars of our security is our nuclear deterrent. It must \nbe safe and it must be workable. It must be relevant to the new threats \nwe face. If we are precluded by this amendment from even thinking about \nthose things, we have done a great disservice to our constituents. At a \ntime when we are not at peace but at war with terrorists around the \nglobe and at a time when we are not the only nuclear power, but there \nare all kinds of countries that we are, frankly, quite concerned about \ndeveloping nuclear weapons, countries such as North Korea and Iran and \nothers that I could mention, that is exactly the wrong time to be \nsending the signal this amendment would send; that we are going to \nstick our head in the sand; we are not going to support scientists \nthinking about these issues and even potentially recommending to us the \ndevelopment of some kind of new 21st century weapons that could better \nprotect our troops, better protect the American homeland, and better \ndefeat our enemies who would do us harm.\n\n  I can't think of any reason why Americans would want to support that \nkind of a policy. Remember, we have not been successful in deterring \nother nations by this unilateral embargo on our own testing and \ndevelopment. They have gone right ahead with their programs, some of \nthe worst countries in the world. The ``axis of evil,'' North Korea and \nIran, has gone right ahead with their programs. So what makes us think \nthat by the United States continuing this see-no-evil unilateral \nmoratorium that the great moral situation of the United States will \nprevent these countries from moving right along with their projects? \nHistory does not support that view.\n  Better that we have peace through strength. And strength is the \nstrength of the United States in terms of its commitment, in terms of \nits scientific capability, and in terms of its willpower to think about \nwhat we are going to need to defend America in the future.\n  I hope my colleagues will defeat this amendment as they have before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in recent weeks, there has been a great \ndeal of discussion about a June 2 vote by the Federal Communications \nCommission to lift the lid on media ownership rules. Under the new \nregulations, a broadcast network can own and operate local television \nstations that reach as much as 45 percent of the Nation.\n  What does that mean? According to the Consumer Federation of America, \ntelevision and newspaper mergers will be allowed in about 200 markets \nwhere approximately 98 percent of the American people live. TV \nduopolies, where one owner owns two television stations in the same \nmarket, and perhaps even triopolies, where one owner controls three \nstations in one market, will be allowed in more than 160 markets, \ncovering better than 95 percent of the population.\n  This is a dangerous vote by the FCC. I fear that it will strangle \nvoices that disagree with corporate interests at virtually every level \nof news and commentary.\n  Local news media represent a community's window on the school board, \nthe city council, the county commission. The local media, more than any \nother resource, educates people about the issues that directly affect \ntheir lives. But these new rules, as approved by the FCC, threaten that \nrole by allowing one person or one corporate interest to control such a \nsignificant level of discourse and debate. News and information may be \nforced to fit into a corporate plan or personal agenda.\n  I have been in Congress for more than 50 years. If there is one \nlesson that I have learned, it is that the media and politicians share \nat least one common bond: both rely on public trust for credibility. To \nearn that trust, the public must know that it can rely on the honesty \nand integrity of the people in critical decisionmaking positions. \nCredibility is jeopardized when questions about the veracity of reports \nare raised or when a news organization is seen more as a biased \npromoter of opinion rather than as a fair arbiter of fact.\n  In October 1958, a pioneer of the broadcast industry took the podium \nat the Mayfair Hotel in Chicago to address his colleagues at the annual \nconvention of the Radio-Television News Directors Association. On that \nnight, when reporters, news directors, sponsors, and network executives \ngathered together to honor excellence in their industry, Edward R. \nMurrow called it his duty to speak about what was happening in the \nradio and television industry.\n  Mr. Murrow, one of the most honored and respected journalists in our \nNation's history, criticized his colleagues for failing in their \nobligation to the people of this country.\n  ``Our history will be what we make it,'' Murrow said. ``If there are \nany historians about fifty or a hundred years from now, and there \nshould be preserved the kinescopes for one week of all three networks, \nthey will find there evidence of decadence, escapism, and insulation \nfrom the realities of the world in which we live.''\n  He continued: ``One of the basic troubles with radio and television \nnews is that both instruments have grown up as an incompatible \ncombination of show business, advertising, and news. . . . The top \nmanagement of the networks, with a few notable exceptions, has been \ntrained in advertising, research, or show business. By the nature of \nthe corporate structure, they also make the final and crucial decisions \nhaving to do with news and public affairs. Frequently, they have \nneither the time nor the competence to do this.''\n\n  Here we are, almost 45 years later. What would Mr. Murrow think of \ntoday's media? Would he consider the FCC vote a threat to a strong, \nindependent media? The news and broadcast industry has had time to \nmature, to evolve into what Mr. Murrow hoped would be a responsible \nventure that exalts the importance of ideas, and not simply panders to \nthe lowest virtues in the human race. Alas, I believe Mr. Murrow would \nbe disappointed in what he would see today.\n  Instead of exalting ideas, mass media today seem more often than not \nto worship at the altar of sex, blood, and scandal. Instead of pursuing \na higher cause and taking the time to educate the public about the \nissues and events affecting our everyday lives, we read and hear about \nthings that serve to titillate or divide us.\n  There are a few voices in the media that attempt to educate, to \ninform, rather than to incite. But too often these men and women are \nsent packing because their corporate bosses fear low ratings and a \ncommercial backlash.\n  This spring, for example, the General Electric-owned cable network \nMSNBC, fired Phil Donahue from his evening talk show. Mr. Donahue was \none of the few voices in the news-talk genre that did not worship at \nthe altar of the salacious story. He did not titillate. He spoke \nfrankly, sharing his beliefs and welcoming those who saw otherwise. And \nwhen confronted with a person offering differing opinion, Phil Donahue \ndid not insult or bully that person. Instead, he debated calmly and \nfairly, and treated his guests with courtesy and respect.\n  Mr. Donahue was opposed to war in Iraq. He made his views known. He \ndebated, he argued, and he persuaded. But at least one insider at the \nMSNBC network said that Phil Donahue was fired because the corporate \nheads at\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\nthe network worried about having a critic of President Bush in its \nprogramming schedule.\n  They worried: What would sponsors think? How would they react? \nInstead of defending constitutional freedom of the press, MSNBC, it \nappears, caved in to the business bottom line. Instead of a critical \nvoice, the network has filled the time with yet another carbon copy of \nthe typical current day talk show hosts: slanted, biased, and arrogant.\n  Is that what the future holds for news outlets? MSNBC seems to be \nfollowing the examples set by News Corporation, the corporate umbrella \nof Fox News channel. Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and CEO of News \nCorporation, has used his influence and his money to buy significant \ninfluence over the country's politics and priorities. Coincidence? Not \nlikely. In fact, one former News Corporation executive stated in a \nprofile on Mr. Murdoch earlier this year that:\n\n       He hungered for the kind of influence in the United States \n     that he had in England and Australia. Part of our political \n     strategy here was the New York Post and the creation of Fox \n     News and The Weekly Standard.\n\n  Political strategy? What happened to journalistic strategy? Are we \ndoomed to more politics than journalism as a result of the June 2 FCC \nvote? In fact, the complete list of holdings of News Corporation gives \none pause.\n  News Corporation is quickly growing into a media empire. Its main \nholdings are the Fox broadcast networks and the cable networks Fox News \nChannel, Fox Sports, FX, and others, 20th Century Fox studios, 35 local \nAmerican television stations, the New York Post, plus the Times and the \nSun of London, the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, the \npublishing house HarperCollins, the Sky satellite system in England, \nand the Star satellite system in Asia, and various publications in Mr. \nMurdoch's native Australia.\n  In addition, News Corporation is seeking Federal approval to buy a \none-third share in DirecTV, the leading satellite broadcast system in \nNorth America. Should that purchase be approved, News Corporation would \nthen control a worldwide satellite system beyond any other company's \nreach.\n  Yet the Federal Communications Commission, the people's watchdog on \nbroadcast fairness and responsibility, would rubberstamp such mergers \nand monopolies rather than examine them with a skeptical eye. The FCC \nis supposed to be a watchdog, not a lap dog.\n  The media enjoy a rare position in our society. Reporters and editors \nare supposed to responsibly detail events and activities, explain ideas \nand innovations to a public who might not, on first hearing, completely \nunderstand the issue. But complex ideas, such as peace in the Middle \nEast or even the doctrine of preemptive strikes on which the war in \nIraq was based, are pared down into short broadcast packages lasting 2 \nminutes, perhaps.\n  The focus is on sound bites rather than on sound information. Instead \nof an intelligent discussion, we hear a constant barrage of commentary \nthat is supposed to pass for news judgment. We listen to television \nshow hosts call Members of Congress the ``lie choir'' because they \nquestion administration policy. Without foundation, in fact, \nallegations of dishonesty by Senators are tossed around and, although \nbaseless, they have the air of fact because they are repeated time and \ntime again by pseudo news hosts. This so-called unbiased media is \nnothing more than partisan opinion covered in a thin veneer of news and \ninformation.\n  I do not question the media's right to report on stories and to have \ntalk shows which express opinion. That right is clearly laid out in the \nfirst amendment of the Bill of Rights:\n\n       Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech, or of the press.\n\n  This amendment, ratified in December 1791, gives broad power to the \npress. Our constitutional Framers understood that the Republic would \nnot function properly if the press were not allowed to operate freely \nand without intervention from Government.\n  However, the media industry also must recognize the responsibility \nthat it has to the public which relies so heavily on the information \nprovided in daily reports. The free press must be a fair press.\n  Through the first amendment, our Framers guaranteed a free press. We, \nthe people, demand a fair press, one that meets its responsibilities \nand our expectations. A free press cannot exist without the trust of \nthe public it serves. To win and maintain that trust, the press must be \nunbiased in its work.\n  Unfortunately, expectations may be too high. News organizations often \nrely solely on the word of those speaking from podiums of power. They \ntake information as gospel truth without, many times, checking the \nfacts or verifying the information.\n  At a time when standards should be strong, the news industry seems \nvery happy to follow the day's latest scandal. It does not hesitate to \nbring to bear the full light of public scorn when there is the \nslightest suggestion of a misstep by a person in the public light. \nHowever, when that same light is turned squarely on the media, there is \nlittle enthusiasm for the intensity.\n  Edward R. Murrow experienced this firsthand. While those in \nattendance at the dinner in Chicago in 1958 applauded Mr. Murrow after \nhe finished his speech, the response away from the podium, away from \nMr. Murrow, was quite different. He was castigated by network \nexecutives who accused him of biting the hand that fed him.\n  No less than William Paley, the president of CBS and a good friend of \nMurrow's, was said to be furious after Murrow criticized the broadcast \nindustry. He saw it as a breach of loyalty. But Edward Murrow believed \nhe carried a greater burden of loyalty to his audience. He saw his \nChicago remarks as his faithful duty to the people who listened to him \nevery night, who relied on him to give them the information they needed \nto know.\n  I think Edward Murrow would be ashamed of much of the news \nprogramming on television today. Like so much of the American public, \nhe would not believe that the media, on the whole, are fulfilling the \nresponsibility to educate and inform.\n  According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll from this past May, only 36 \npercent of the American people believe that news organizations get the \nfacts straight.\n  What can improve the public confidence in the media?\n  Perhaps the media in Minnesota have a good start. In 1970, University \nof Minnesota Professor Ed Gerald helped to set up the Minnesota News \nCouncil, believing then that:\n\n       To the common man, it seems that journalists, at will, can \n     make heroes or scoundrels out of any of us.\n\n  Professor Gerald recognized the sheer power and influence of the \nmedia. He also knew that, as much as a free press is crucial to the \nRepublic, a fair press is needed to ensure the public trust.\n  The Minnesota News Council provides an avenue for the public to hold \nmedia outlets accountable for the reports they air or print. Outside of \na courtroom and free of charge to either party, the News Council, made \nup of reasonable, qualified people from within the media and outside of \nit, comes together to decide whether a report or story is fairly \nproduced or whether it is distorted, untrue, or dishonest. The State of \nWashington has a similar news council. Many nations, including the \nUnited Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, have news councils.\n  At least one noted journalist has long supported the concept of a \nnews council, if not on a national level then on State or regional \nlevels. For many years, Mike Wallace, CBS News Correspondent and co-\neditor of 60 Minutes, has believed that the concept of a news council \ncould be an important tool in building the public trust in the media. \nMr. Wallace, in a 1996 lecture at the Freedom Forum's Media Studies \nCenter, said, he is ``convinced that more state news councils, regional \nnews councils, and/or a renewed national news council could strike a \nblow for a better public understanding in a time of skepticism about \nus, of who we are and what it is we do.'' Since those remarks, Mr. \nWallace has continued to urge his colleagues to support the news \ncouncil idea, but the resistance, especially from national media \norganizations, is profound.\n  What is wrong with this approach? A news council is not a court of \nlaw; rather it is a forum where the public and the news media can \nengage each other in examining standards of fairness. It is not a \nradical idea, but a commonsense approach. As the Minnesota News Council \ndescribes the concept, in their various forms, news councils are \ndesigned to promote fairness in the\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\nnews media by giving members of the public who feel damaged by a news \nstory an opportunity to hold the news organization accountable. What is \nwrong with allowing the public, which has such a poor view of the \nmedia, to take part in such an endeavor? This type of public dialogue \ncan lead to a better understanding of the media industry and its role \nin society by that society, as well as a stronger foundation for more \naccurate, more responsible dissemination of news.\n\n  Solid journalism is also a way to improve the public's view of the \nmedia. It restores that sense of credibility that is threatened when we \nread about reporters who have published stories without any factual \nbackground. It would help to reaffirm independent voices, even if those \nvoices run counter to the opinions of the corporate management.\n  On television and in print, large media conglomerates already control \nthe vast majority of what Americans see, read, and hear. A grand total \nof five--five--media companies today control 75 percent of prime time \nprogramming. Outlets such as cable and the Internet, which could have \nserved to check corporate media conglomeration power, have instead \nfollowed the old adage, ``if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.'' Thus, \ntoday these same 5 companies control 90 percent of the top 50 channels \non cable. Similarly on the Internet, existing newspapers and TV \nnetworks dominate the most popular sites for news and information. \nTechnology may have increased the number of media outlets, but it has \nnot stopped big media from further extending its reach.\n  Former Washington Post assistant managing editor Ben Bagdikian has \nsketched out the growing concentration of media ownership. In 1983, \nwhen his book, ``The Media Monopoly,'' was first published, Mr. \nBagdikian reported that ``50 corporations dominated most of every mass \nmedium.'' But, with each new edition of the book, that number shrinks \nand shrinks and shrinks: 29 media corporations in 1987, 23 in 1990, 14 \nin 1992, and 10 in 1997. The sixth edition, published in 2000, \ndocumented that just six--six--corporations supply most of America's \nmedia content. Bagdikian wrote:\n\n       It is the overwhelming collective power of these firms, \n     with their corporate interlocks and unified cultural and \n     political values, that raises troubling questions about the \n     individual's role in the American democracy.\n\n  The June 2 vote by the Federal Communications Commission threatens to \nexpand the influence of these few corporations even further, stretching \ntheir hands around a larger number of local television and radio \nstations, scarfing up newspapers and Internet news outlets.\n  This is an opinion shared by consumer advocates, media watchdog \ngroups, and various organizations representing the spectrum of \npolitical and societal views in the United States, from the National \nRifle Association to the National Organization for Women, from the \nCatholic Conference of Bishops to the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights. The Parents Television Council, Common Cause, the National \nAssociation of Black-Owned Broadcasters, the National Association of \nHispanic Journalists, the Writers Guild, and the Association of \nChristian Schools, all of these groups questioned the wisdom of even \ngreater media consolidation.\n  Tens of thousands of Americans have expressed their opposition to the \nFCC rule. In fact, three-quarters of a million people contacted the FCC \nabout this new consolidation, and, according to FCC Commissioner \nJonathan Adelstein, 99.9 percent of them opposed further media \nconsolidation.\n  In testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, Commissioner Adelstein was blunt.\n\n       [T]he FCC approved the most sweeping and destructive \n     rollback of consumer protection rules in the history of \n     American broadcasting. I'm afraid democracy was not well \n     served by Monday's decision. Allowing fewer media outlets to \n     control what Americans see, hear and read can only give \n     Americans less information to use in making up their own \n     minds about the key issues they face.\n       The decision will diminish the diversity of voices heard \n     over the public airwaves, which can only diminish the civil \n     discourse and the quality of our society's intellectual, \n     cultural and political life. It will diminish the coverage of \n     local voices and local issues as media giants gobble up local \n     outlets and nationalize the stories they broadcast.\n\n  In the end, our new rules will simply make it easier for existing \nmedia giants to acquire more outlets and fortify their already massive \nmarket power. As media conglomerates go on buying sprees, they will \naccumulate enormous debt that will force them to chase the bottom \ndollar ahead of all else. This is likely to result in more \nsensationalism, more crassness, more violence, and even less serious \ncoverage of the news and local events.\n  Recently, there have been obstacles thrown in the way of the FCC's \nMack truck of a rule. The Senate Appropriations Committee has blocked \nthe implementation of the new policy. The unanimous committee approval \nof the fiscal year 2004 Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nAppropriations bill was a strong endorsement of media diversity. The \ncommittee's action follows the House of Representatives vote on July \n23, 400-21, to pass the fiscal year 2004 Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations bill. As part of that legislation, the House also would \nprohibit the Federal Communications Commission from implementing this \npolicy allowing for media consolidation.\n  But the Congress is not the only branch of Government involved in \nthis issue. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nissued a surprise order on September 3, blocking the Federal \nCommunications Commission from imposing its new rules just one day \nbefore those rules were slated to take effect.\n\n       Given the magnitude of this matter and the public's \n     interest in reaching the proper resolution, a stay is \n     warranted pending thorough and efficient judicial review,\n\n  The court concluded in the case.\n  Indeed, it is my hope that, with such growing opposition, the \nadministration and the Federal Communications Commission will abandon \nsuch an ill-advised policy.\n  I have often said that as long as there is a forum in which questions \ncan be asked by men and women who do not stand in awe of a chief \nexecutive and one can speak as long as one's feet will allow one to \nstand, the liberties of the American people will be secure. That forum \nis this Senate. But the same can be said of the news media--the \nnewspapers, radio stations, television stations, and other outlets that \nprovide information that is important to the lives of all Americans. \nThat freedom, that unbiased coverage, is a key, a foundation stone of \nthis Republic. For, without it, the American people can be led to \ndisaster without so much as a whisper. Their freedoms can be trampled; \ntheir rights can be subverted.\n  In his speech in Chicago in 1958, Mr. Murrow offered a challenge to \nhis colleagues.\n\n       Just once in a while, let us exalt the importance of ideas. \n     Let us dream to the extent of saying that, on a given Sunday \n     night, the time . . . occupied by Ed Sullivan is given over \n     to a . . . survey of the state of American education [or] the \n     time normally used by Steve Allen is devoted to a \n     thoroughgoing study of American policy in the Middle East.\n\n  While Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen are not with us anymore, the need \nfor responsibility that Mr. Murrow called for among his colleagues in \nthe news industry clearly still remains with us today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Senator Hollings raises several issues that are so \nimportant to the Nation. This issue of media ownership getting out of \ncontrol and the need to reverse what the FCC did and also the issue of \nthe war, how badly it is going, how much it is costing, the danger our \ntroops are in, the fact it is not internationalized and there is \nvirtually no burden sharing going on--these are all issues that I hear \nabout at home when I go to the grocery store or take a walk. People are \nanxious and concerned. These are the issues of the day.\n  Therefore, it is rather stunning to me that given all this and the \nfact that the deficit has gone off the charts--we have seen the picture \nof what has happened to the deficit since Bill Clinton left office; it \nis a straight line up. I never saw anything like it in my life. We are \ngetting to the point where we are bankrupting this country and laying \nall that bankruptcy on the backs of our kids, as Senator Hollings has \nsaid.\n  With all of these issues pending, why am I here tonight speaking \nabout an issue that was resolved in 1973, the right of a woman to \nchoose--the fact that this Senate went on record supporting that right \nquite recently as part of S. 3, that very simple language that simply \nsaid Roe v. Wade has saved lives, stating it is the sense of the Senate \nthat the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade was appropriate \nand secures an important right and such decisions should not be \noverturned.\n  That was language in S. 3 which also for the first time banned a \nmedically recognized procedure. Senator Harkin and I and a majority of \nthe Senate added this language.\n  What happens with all of the problems we are facing and with our \nbrave men and women in such jeopardy abroad, our taxpayers just getting \nsqueezed, our education bill underfunded, the country going broke, the \nenvironment getting worse because every other day, and usually on \nFridays, we see more rollbacks of environmental laws, the media getting \nbigger. We have to overturn that.\n\n  With all of those issues, one would think the House of \nRepresentatives and the Republican leadership would have said: We want \nto get this bill to the President's desk. We want to ban this \nprocedure. So let's just take this language. The decision of the \nSupreme Court in Roe was appropriate and secures an important right, \nand such decisions should not be overturned.\n  Friends, that was not to be the case. Instead of sending this bill \noff to the President for his signature, which my colleagues have been \nwanting to do for a very long time, they say we need to strip out this \nvery simple Roe language. In fact, that is what the House did.\n  So before this bill can go to conference--and it is a technical \nmatter, but in order for a bill to become law, when the bills are \ndifferent, you have to have a conference to resolve the differences. \nWhen the bills are the same, the bill can go straight over to the \nPresident's desk.\n  No, the House leaders, Republican leaders, I believe quite radically \non this point of a woman's right to choose that was resolved in 1973, \nthey strip this out. Now in order to go to conference, we will have a \nvote to disagree with what the House did. I hope we will disagree with \nwhat they did and take another stand for Roe. That is why we are here \ntonight.\n  The reason the House will not go along with this, and many in our own \nSenate will not, the real agenda in all of these bills that attack a \nwoman's right to choose--and there have been many, and I will go \nthrough them, including bills that hurt family planning--the real \nagenda is to overturn Roe. I believe that is what we are talking about. \nIt may show up in a different form, such as banning one medical \nprocedure, which is a horrible precedent, as we are going to do.\n  It may show up by saying to a woman in the military: You will have to \nfly back to the United States on an ``as available'' basis and spend \nyour own money--nothing to do with your own military pay--to get an \nabortion. We have said to Federal employees: You cannot use the health \ninsurance that you pay a good part of to get a legal abortion, legal, \nnot illegal, a legal abortion. Abortion is legal.\n\n  My friends, some of them here do not like that. So there has been \nthis huge attempt to narrow this right. So every time we get a chance, \nwhen we see these bills come forward that would narrow this right, that \nwould potentially harm women, we offer the Harkin-Boxer amendment in \nfavor of Roe. Even though we did not get as many votes as we would \nlike, we got a majority, and that is what we are continuing to discuss.\n  Now, what does Roe guarantee to women?\n  In the decision of the Supreme Court, the Court found that a woman's \nreproductive decisions are a privacy right guaranteed by the \nConstitution. But I have to say that even though this right was granted \nto women, it was not an unbalanced decision. It was a very moderate \ndecision. That is why, in my opinion, the majority of Americans support \nit.\n  In the early stages of a pregnancy, the Government cannot intervene \nwith a woman's right to choose. That is it, plain and simple. Guess \nwhat. We are not going to be big brother or sister, as the case may be. \nWe are going to allow a woman, her doctor, and her God to make that \ndecision.\n  But in the later stages of pregnancy, Roe found that the Government \ncan intervene, that it can regulate, that it can restrict abortion. We \nall support that. All of us support that. But there is one caveat--\nalways, always, always. Any law that a State may pass to restrict \nabortion rights has to have an exception to protect the life of the \nwoman or to protect her health.\n  This is important because, I have to tell you, before Roe, before \n1973--and I remember those years--life for women was very different. \nBefore Roe, up to\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\n1.2 million women each year resorted to dangerous illegal abortions. \nAccording to one estimate, at least 5,000 women a year died as a result \nof botched illegal abortions. Thousands of others nearly died, became \ninfertile, or suffered other health complications.\n  I have a few stories--I want to tell a couple of them--of life before \nRoe.\n  Polly Bergen--we know her--an actress, went public with her story. \nShe became pregnant when she was in her late teens and it was a \ndisaster for her. As a result of an unsafe abortion, she had several \nmiscarriages. At the age of 33, her doctor said, because of that \nbotched abortion, she had to have a hysterectomy. She desperately \nwanted children. She had a hysterectomy.\n  Lynn Kahn was 24. She was divorced with two young children when, in \n1964, she was raped by a stranger on her way home from work. Because \nshe was so ashamed, she did not report the rape. But she soon found out \nshe was pregnant. She scraped together $300 for an illegal abortion. \nShe nearly died. She was hospitalized with a serious infection caused \nby a botched abortion.\n  During her multiday hospital stay, she was absolutely terrified that \nthe police would come and arrest her because the treating physician had \ntold her he was going to inform them about the abortion. The police did \nnot arrive, but the whole experience was so traumatic that Lynn was \nunable to talk about it for over 20 years.\n  Mary Roper, a 19-year-old sophomore in college, was in an abusive \nrelationship. She got pregnant, and the man she was dating encouraged \nher to get an abortion. She had been raised a Catholic and felt she \ncould not be single mother in her community. She endured three attempts \nto end her pregnancy--one person used a coat hanger, and one a hose. \nDuring the time she was seeking an abortion, she was questioned by the \npolice about her intention. She finally found a doctor in Chicago, 3 \nhours away, to perform an abortion. She continued to have problems and \na couple of months later needed her parents' written permission to \nreceive a medically necessary abortion. She continues to have \nnightmares today.\n  Elizabeth Furse, a former Representative from Oregon, was 25 in 1961, \nmarried and pregnant with her third child. During the first trimester \nof her pregnancy, she developed the measles. She was subsequently \ntested, and the tests confirmed what she and her husband, and \nobstetrician, had feared: if she carried her pregnancy to term, the \nbaby would likely be blind, deaf, and severely brain damaged. They were \nanxious to have more children but did not want their child to suffer \nand be in pain, and so they sought an abortion. Her physician was \nsympathetic but would not perform an illegal abortion. At that time \nboth the doctor and Elizabeth could be prosecuted and jailed for \nterminating the pregnancy. She did not want an illegal abortion and \ncould only have one legally if her life was threatened. Since she had \none kidney, her doctor thought that they might be able to persuade a \npanel of doctors that he life would be in danger if she carried the \nbaby to term. They agreed, but required her to have a total \nhysterectomy at the same time.\n  Rollyn Carlson of Austin, TX, was 20 years old in the summer of 1971 \nand pregnant. She decided to have an abortion and found an office in \nMexico on the other side of the Texas border. After the abortion, she \nbled heavily and ran a high fever for 3 days. She was one of the lucky \nones. She married and had two children. She now has a teenage daughter \nand is concerned about her. What if she got pregnant? What if she \nneeded an abortion? Rollyn worries that if abortion is illegal, her \ndaughter would have to have an illegal abortion and could die.\n  Sherry of Peoria, IL, was married with two children when in the mid-\n1950s, she was brutally raped and left for dead. She did not die, but \nas a result of the rape, she became pregnant. She went to her doctor--\nhe would not perform an abortion. She went to another--he would not \nperform an abortion either. She then resorted to ``home remedies'' such \nas pounding on her abdomen with a meat mallet and throwing herself down \nthe stairs. It did not work, so she went to the local abortionist. He \nwas drinking during the procedure and offered to give her back some \nmoney if she would perform oral sex on him. She subsequently started to \nhemorrhage and was hospitalized. Decades later, she still has \nnightmares about the procedure.\n  Romanita of Pittsburgh, PA, married and had three children, one--her \ndaughter, Norma--with spina bifida. Her husband was a heroin addict and \nhad left the home. One day he showed up and raped her. He then \ndisappeared, and she found out she was pregnant. She did not want to \ntake the chance of having another baby with deformities. She sought out \nan illegal abortion and experienced bleeding for 2 weeks.\n  So the point is that when the Court made this historic decision \ncalled Roe v. Wade, women were dying, maybe 5,000 a year. And you ask \nme, why would people, lawmakers, want to see us go back to those days? \nI will tell you right now, I don't understand it. It isn't right. It \nisn't right for the women of this country. It isn't right for the \nfamilies of this country. Roe v. Wade was a balanced decision.\n  Then you have a situation where we wish we had more family planning \nfunds because then we would be in a situation where we would not have \nthese unwanted pregnancies. The same people who want to outlaw abortion \nare not interested in family planning funds. And interestingly, the \nsame people who want to go back to the days when abortion was illegal, \nwho will fight for the right of the fetus over the right of a woman, \nwhere are they, sometimes, on preschool programs, afterschool programs, \ncaring for our children, helping our children? A lot of times they do \nnot vote for it. As a friend of mine once said, he sometimes thinks \nthat some of our colleagues who take this position, and then don't help \nthe kids, are all for the kids between conception and birth; and then \nwhere are they?\n  So the reason we are here tonight is because the House is so radical \non the point that they will not accept our language, that simply says: \nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Roe was appropriate and secures an \nimportant right, and such decision should not be overturned.\n  Imagine, they say they want S. 3 so badly, they want to outlaw this \nmedical procedure, which is the first time an accepted medical \nprocedure is outlawed by politicians, but yet they cannot accept this \nlanguage, which has no force of law. That is the incredible thing. It \nis a sense of the Senate. It does not even have the force of law, but \nit shows you that the goal here is not simply outlawing this one \nprocedure; it is overturning Roe. I cannot say that enough because that \nis absolutely true, even when 80 percent of the people said that \nwhether to have an abortion is a decision to be made between a woman \nand her doctor.\n  This debate is very serious. It is very serious because the \nunderlying bill, S. 3, which bans this procedure, makes no exception \nfor the health of the woman, and we tried every which way to do that. \nWe said: Roe is the law of the land. Under Roe, the life and the health \nof a woman must always be protected. So in order to be constitutional, \nwe are willing to walk hand in hand with you, and we will ban this \nprocedure, even though some of us believe we should not get into \nplaying doctor--that is not our role. There is no OB/GYN in this body. \nPeople don't come to us when they are sick. They come to us when they \nare sick and tired of politics, but they don't come to us when they are \nphysically ill.\n  We were willing--those of us who are very pro-choice--to say: We will \naccept this if you will have an exception for the life and the health \nof a woman. Oh, no. They would not do it. That is why our language on \nRoe, that we attached to this bill, is so important. Because, folks, \nthis bill, when it becomes law--and it will become law--is going \nstraight to the Court.\n  We want the Court to understand we stood firmly for Roe. When they \ntake a look at the outlawing of this procedure, and when they see there \nis no exception for the health of a woman, they will realize maybe some \npeople voted for it who would have preferred a health exception. By \nshowing them we have the votes to sustain a sense of the Senate in \nfavor of Roe, we will be sending a strong signal on behalf of the women \nof this Nation to the courts.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for coming to the floor and talking \nabout this controversial issue because the Senate will have to face it. \nI am trying to recall, was there not a State statute in Kansas or----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Nebraska.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Nebraska relative to this so-called partial-birth \nabortion procedure? Is it not true that the same Supreme Court that is \ngoing to consider our bill ruled that you had to include, in the \nprotection for the woman involved, if her health was at risk, she could \ngo forward with the procedure? Is my memory correct that this Court, \nwithin the last year or two, made that decision?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It was in 2000. It was a case of a Nebraska law. And, \nyes, the Court found it unconstitutional.\n  What the authors of S. 3 will tell you is they have met the test. But \nwhat constitutional lawyers tell us is that the test isn't met at all. \nThere is no exception for health. My colleague actually carried the \nhealth exception.\n  Now, this is what the Supreme Court said--and I am glad my colleague \nasked this question--in Stenberg v. Carhart. They basically said: If \nyou are outlawing a medical procedure, you have to have a health \nexception.\n\n       The governing standard requires an exception ``where it is \n     necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the \n     preservation of the life or health of the mother.''\n       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that in the \n     process of regulating the methods of abortion impose \n     significant health risks.\n\n  My friend is right on target. This is the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my friend from California, who has followed this \nissue more closely than any other Member, for those who are trying to \nfollow this debate, when the Supreme Court says if you are going to \nwrite a law banning an abortion procedure, you have to acknowledge that \nif the mother is about to die, that procedure will be allowed. Then the \nCourt went on to say in this case, if there is a significant health \nrisk involved as far as the woman is concerned, you have to allow the \nprocedure. Would the Senator from California give us indications of \nwhat that means when we talk about health risk and significant health \nrisk? What are we saying? A complication late in pregnancy that is so \nsignificant as to give to that mother the right to terminate the \npregnancy, could the Senator give us some illustrations of what kind of \nhealth risk we are talking about?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Working with physicians across the country, I want to \ntell you what they have told us in writing. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint those letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  American Medical\n\n\n                                    Women's Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Nadler: The American Medical Women's \n     Association (AMWA) strongly opposes HR 760, the ``Partial-\n     Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.'' While the Association has \n     high respect for each member and their right to hold whatever \n     moral, religious and philosophical beliefs his or her \n     conscience dictates, as an organization of 10,000 women \n     physicians and medical students dedicated to promoting \n     women's health and advancing women in medicine, we believe HR \n     760 is unconscionable.\n       AMWA has long been an advocate for women's access to \n     reproductive health care. As such, we recognize this \n     legislation as an attempt to ban a procedure that in some \n     circumstances is the safest and most appropriate alternative \n     available to save the life and health of the woman. \n     Furthermore, this bill violates the privilege of a patient in \n     consultation with her physician to make the most appropriate \n     decisions regarding her specific health circumstances.\n       AMWA opposes legislation such as HR 760 as inappropriate \n     intervention in the decision-making relationship between \n     physician and patient. The definition of the bill is too \n     imprecise and it includes non-medical terminology for a \n     procedure that may ultimately undermine the legality of other \n     techniques in obstetrics and gynecology used in both abortion \n     and non-abortion situations. At times, the use of these \n     techniques is essential to the lives and health of women. The \n     potential of this ban to criminalize certain obstetrics and \n     gynecology techniques ultimately interferes with the quality \n     of heath and lives of women. Furthermore, the current ban \n     fails to meet the provisions set forth by the Supreme Court \n     in Stenberg v. Carhart, a ruling that overturned a Nebraska \n     statute banning abortion because it contained no life and \n     health exception for the mother.\n       AMWA's position on this bill corresponds to the position \n     statement of the organization on abortion and reproductive \n     health services to women and their families.\n       AMWA believes that the prevention of unintended pregnancies \n     through access to contraception and education is the best \n     option available for reducing the abortion rate in the United \n     States. Legislative bans for procedures that use recognized \n     obstetrics and gynecological techniques fails to protect the \n     health and safety of women and their children, nor will it \n     improve the lives of women and their families.

We believe that a physician in consultation \n     with the patient should make the decision regarding what \n     method should be used to terminate a pregnancy.\n       We are opposed to H.R. 760 because we believe this and \n     other legislative and judicial restrictions to safe, \n     medically accepted abortion procedures severely jeopardize \n     women's health and well-being. APHA also opposes the bill \n     because it fails to include adequate health exception \n     language in instances where certain procedures may be \n     determined by a physician to be the best or most appropriate \n     to preserve the health of the woman. We urge members of the \n     House of Representatives to oppose this legislation.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns regarding the \n     negative effect this legislation would have to a woman's \n     right to a safe, legal abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     George C. Benjamin, MD, FACP,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I understand that you will be \n     considering Senate S. 3, the ban on abortion procedures, soon \n     and would like to offer some medical information that may \n     assist you in your efforts. Important stakes for women's \n     health are involved: if Congress enacts such a sweeping ban, \n     the result could effectively ban safe and common, pre-\n     viability abortion procedures.\n       By way of background, I am an adjunct professor in the \n     Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive \n     Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, \n     where I co-directed the Center for Reproductive Health \n     Research and Policy. Formerly, I directed the Reproductive \n     Health program for the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and \n     served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs \n     for the United States Department of Health and Human \n     Services. I represented the United States at the \n     International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) \n     in Cairo, Egypt, and currently serve on a number of Boards \n     for organizations that promote emergency contraception and \n     new contraceptive technologies, and support reducing teen \n     pregnancy. My medical and policy areas of expertise are in \n     the family planning and reproductive health, prevention of \n     sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDs, and \n     enhancing international and family planning.\n       The proposed ban on abortion procedures criminalizes \n     abortions in which the provider ``deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus . . . for the \n     purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will \n     kill the partially delivered living fetus . . .'' The \n     criminal ban being considered is flawed in a number of \n     respects: it fails to protect women's health by omitting an \n     exception for women's health; it menaces medical practice \n     with the threat of criminal prosecution; it encompasses a \n     range of abortion procedures; and it leaves women in need of \n     second trimester abortions with far less safe medical \n     options: hysterotomy (similar to a cesarean section) and \n     hysterectomy.\n       The proposed ban would potentially encompass several \n     abortion methods, including dilation and extraction (d, \n     sometimes referred to as ``intact d), dilation and \n     evacuation (d), the most common second-trimester procedure. \n     In addition, such a ban could also apply to induction \n     methods. Even if a physician is using induction as the \n     primary method for abortion, he or she may not be able to \n     assure that the procedure could be effected without running \n     afoul of the proposed ban. A likely outcome if this \n     legislation is enacted and enforced is that physicians will \n     fear criminal prosecution for any\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\n      second trimester abortion--and women will have no choice but \n     to carry pregnancies to term despite the risks to their \n     health. It would be a sad day for medicine if Congress \n     decides that hysterotomy, hysterectomy, or unsafe \n     continuation of pregnancy are women's only available options. \n     Williams Obstetrics, one of the leading medical texts in \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology, has this to say about the \n     hysterotomy ``option'' that the bill leaves open: ``Nottage \n     and Liston (1975), based on a review of 700 hysterotomies, \n     rightfully concluded that the operation is outdated as a \n     routine method for terminating pregnancy.'' Cunningham and \n     McDonald, et al, Williams Obstetrics, 19th ed., (1993), p. \n     683.\n       Obviously, allowing women to have a hysterectomy means that \n     Congress is authorizing women to have an abortion at the \n     price of their future fertility, and with the added risks and \n     costs of major surgery. In sum, the options left open are \n     less safe for women who need an abortion after the first \n     trimester of pregnancy.\n       I'd like to focus my attention on that subset of the women \n     affected by this bill who face grievous underlying medical \n     conditions. To be sure, these are not the majority of \n     women who will be affected by this legislation, but the \n     grave health conditions that could be worsened by this \n     bill illustrate how sweeping the legislation is.\n       Take for instance women who face hypertensive disorders \n     such as eclampsia--convulsions precipitated by pregnancy-\n     induced or aggravated hypertension (high blood pressure). \n     This, along with infection and hemorrhage, is one of the most \n     common causes of maternal death. With eclampsia, the kidneys \n     and liver may be affected, and in some cases, if the woman is \n     not provided an abortion, her liver could rupture, she could \n     suffer a stroke, brain damage, or coma. Hypertensive \n     disorders are conditions that can develop over time or spiral \n     out of control in short order, and doctors must be given the \n     latitude to terminate a pregnancy if necessary in the safest \n     possible manner.\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible for some women who have underlying medical \n     conditions necessitating a termination of their pregnancies, \n     including: death (risk of death higher with less safe \n     abortion methods); infertility; paralysis; coma; stroke; \n     hemorrhage; brain damage; infection; liver damage; and kidney \n     damage.\n       Legislation forcing doctors to forego medically indicated \n     abortions or to use less safe but politically-palatable \n     procedures is simply unacceptable for women's health.\n       Thank you very much, Senator, for your efforts to educate \n     your colleagues about the implications of the proposed ban on \n     abortion procedures.\n           Sincerely,\n     Felicia H. Stewart, M.D.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Physicians for\n\n\n                               Reproductive Choice and Health,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We are writing to urge you to stand in \n     defense of women's reproductive health and vote against S. 3, \n     legislation regarding so-called ``partial birth'' abortion.\n       We are practicing obstetrician-gynecologists, and academics \n     in obstetrics, gynecology and women's health. We believe it \n     is imperative that those who perform terminations and manage \n     the pre- and post-operative care of women receiving abortions \n     are given a voice in a debate that has largely ignored the \n     two groups whose lives would be most affected by this \n     legislation: physicians and patients.\n       It is misguided and unprincipled for lawmakers to legislate \n     medicine. We all want safe and effective medical procedures \n     for women; on that there is no dispute. However, the business \n     of medicine is not always palatable to those who do not \n     practice it on a regular basis. The description of a number \n     of procedures--from liposuction to cardiac surgery--may seem \n     distasteful to some, and even repugnant to others. When \n     physicians analyze and debate surgical techniques among \n     themselves, it is always for the best interest of the \n     patient. Abortion is proven to be one of the safest \n     procedures in medicine, significantly safer than childbirth, \n     and in fact has saved numerous women's lives.\n       While we can argue as to why this legislation is dangerous, \n     deceptive and unconstitutional--and it is--the fact of the \n     matter is that the text of the bill is so vague and \n     misleading that there is a great need to correct the \n     misconceptions around abortion safety and technique. It is \n     wrong to assume that a specific procedure is never needed; \n     what is required is the safest option for the patient, and \n     that varies from case to case.\n\n\n                               the facts\n\n       (1) So-called ``partial birth'' abortion does not exist.\n       There is no mention of the term ``partial birth'' abortion \n     in any medical literature. Physicians are never taught a \n     technique called ``partial birth'' abortion and therefore are \n     unable to medically define the procedure.\n       What is described in this legislation, however, could ban \n     all abortions. ``What this bill describes, albeit in non-\n     medical terms, can be interpreted as any abortion,'' sated \n     one of our physician members. ``Medicine is an art as much as \n     it is a science; although there is a standard of care, each \n     procedure--and indeed each woman--is different. The wording \n     here could apply to any patient.'' The bill's language is too \n     vague to be useful; in fact, it is so vague as to be harmful. \n     It is intentionally unclear and deceptive.\n       (2) Physicians need to have all medical options available \n     in order to provide the best medical care possible. Tying the \n     hands of physicians endangers the health of patients. It is \n     unethical and dangerous for legislators to dictate specific \n     surgical procedures. Until a surgeon examines the patient, \n     she does not necessarily know which technique or procedure \n     would be in the patient's best interest. Banning procedures \n     puts women's health at risk.\n       (3) Politicians should not legislate medicine. To do so \n     would violate the sanctity and legality of the physician-\n     patient relationship. The right to have an abortion is \n     constitutionally-protected. To falsify scientific evidence in \n     an attempt to deny women that right is unconscionable and \n     dangerous.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, \n     representing 45,000 ob-gyns, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decision making is \n     inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n       The American Medical Women's Association, representing \n     10,000 female physicians, is opposed to an abortion ban \n     because it ``represents a serious impingement on the rights \n     of physicians to determine appropriate medical management for \n     individual patients.''\n\n\n                              the science\n\n       We know that there is no such technique as ``partial \n     birth'' abortion, and we believe this legislation is a \n     thinly-veiled attempt to outlaw all abortions. Those \n     supporting this legislation seem to want to confuse both \n     legislators and the public about which abortion procedures \n     are actually used. Since the greatest confusion seems to \n     center around techniques that are used in the second and \n     third trimesters, we will address those: dilation and \n     evacuation (D), dilation and extraction (D), \n     instillation, hysterectomy and hysterotomy (commonly known as \n     a c-section).\n       Dilation and evacuation (D) is the standard approach for \n     second-trimester abortions. The only difference between a D \n     and a more common, first-trimester vacuum aspiration is the \n     cervix must be further dilated. Morbidity and mortality \n     studies indicate that this surgical method is preferable to \n     labor induction methods (instillation), hysterotomy and \n     hysterectomy.\n       From the years 1972-76, labor induction procedures carried \n     a maternal mortality rate of 16.5 (note: all numbers listed \n     are out of 100,000); the corresponding rate for D was 10.4. \n     From 1977-82, labor induction fell to 6.8, but D dropped to \n     3.3. From 1983-87, induction methods had a 3.5 mortality \n     rate, while D fell to 2.9. Although the difference between \n     the methods shrank by the mid-1980s, the use of D had \n     already quickly outpaced induction, thus altering the size of \n     the sample.\n       Morbidity trends indicate that dilation and evacuation is \n     much safer than labor induction procedures, and for women \n     with certain medical conditions, e.g., coronary artery \n     disease or asthma, labor induction can pose serious risks. \n     Rates of major complications from labor induction were more \n     than twice as high as those from D There are instances of \n     women who, after having failed inductions, acquired \n     infections necessitating emergency D, which ultimately \n     saved her fertility and, in some instances, her life. \n     Hysterotomy and hysterectomy, moreover, carry a mortality \n     rate seven times that of induction techniques and ten times \n     that of D\n       There is a psychological component which makes D \n     preferable to labor induction; undergoing difficult, \n     expensive and painful labor for up to two days is extremely \n     emotionally and psychologically draining, much more so than a \n     surgical procedure that can be done in a few hours under \n     general or local anesthesia. Furthermore, labor induction \n     does not always work: Between 15 and 30 percent of cases \n     require surgery to complete the procedure. There is no \n     question that D is the safest method of second-trimester \n     abortion.\n       There is also a technique known as dilation and extraction \n     (D). D is merely a variant of D There is a dearth of \n     data on D as it is an uncommon procedure. However, it is \n     sometimes a physician's preferred method of termination for a \n     number of reasons: it offers a woman the chance to see the \n     intact outcome of a desired pregnancy, thus speeding up the \n     grieving process; if provides a greater chance of acquiring \n     valuable information regarding hereditary illness or fetal \n     anomaly; and there is a decreased risk of injury to the \n     woman, as the procedure is quicker than induction and \n     involves less use of sharp instruments in the uterus, \n     providing a lesser chance of uterine perforations or tears \n     and cervical lacerations.\n       It is important to note that these procedures are used at \n     varying gestational ages. Neither a D nor a D is \n     equivalent to a late-term abortion. D and D are used \n     solely based on the size of the fetus, the health of the \n     woman, and the physician's judgment, and the decision \n     regarding which procedure to use is done on a case-by-case \n     basis.\n\n\n                            the legislation\n\n       Because this legislation is so vague, it would outlaw D \n     and D (and arguably techniques used in the first-\n     trimester). Indeed, the Congressional findings--which go\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\n     into detail, albeit in non-medical terms--do not remotely \n     correlate with the language of the bill. This legislation is \n     reckless. The outcome of its passage would undoubtedly be \n     countless deaths and irreversible damage to thousands of \n     women and families. We can safely assert that without D and \n     D, that is, an enactment of S. 3, we will be returning to \n     the days when an unwanted pregnancy led women to death \n     through illegal and unsafe procedures, self-inflicted \n     abortions, uncontrollable infections and suicide.\n       The cadre of physicians who provide abortions should be \n     honored, not vilified. They are heroes to millions of women, \n     offering the opportunity of choice and freedom. We urge you \n     to consider scientific data rather than partisan rhetoric \n     when voting on such far-reaching public health legislation. \n     We strongly oppose legislation intended to ban so-called \n     ``partial birth'' abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Natalie E. Roche, MD,\n       Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New \n     Jersey Medical College.\n     Gerson Weiss, MD,\n       Professor and Chair, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology \n     and Women's Health, New Jersey Medical College.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. What the physicians have told us is there are serious \nhealth consequences of banning safe procedures such as the one that \nwill be banned in this bill. One is hemorrhage. People can die, they \ncan lose blood, or be ill for a very long time. They can rupture their \nuterus and therefore never be able to carry a baby. They could get \nblood clots and have serious brain damage, an embolism, a stroke. There \ncould be damage to nearby organs. There could even be paralysis. These \nare the terrible incidents that could happen to a woman if a doctor is \nin a situation of an emergency late-term procedure and is not able to \nuse everything he has been able to use up until S. 3.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So for clarity, I ask the Senator, the bill we are going \nto be asked to vote on has an exception. This procedure is allowed if \nthe life of the mother is at stake. But all of the significant health \nrisks which you have just read, does this bill allow a doctor, in the \nmidst of a medical emergency, to terminate a pregnancy if there is a \nsignificant health risk to the mother?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The answer is absolutely not. That is why it is so \nshocking to me. My friend knows because he worked hard on this. He \ntried to get a health exception. As a matter of fact, it was very \nstrong language. Will my friend remind me what he said in making that \nhealth exception?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I offered an alternative to the bill that will be before \nus. I said, if late in a pregnancy a woman who is carrying a fetus is \nin danger of a grievous physical health risk, verified by two doctors--\nnot just a doctor performing the procedure but another doctor, for a \nsecond opinion, has to verify it--then it would be allowed. That was \ndefeated on the floor. What I tried to do was to narrow the exception, \neven probably more narrow than the Supreme Court said so my colleagues \nwould give a doctor, in an extraordinary emergency situation, not life \nor death but one equally serious, at least in terms of the woman's \nfuture health. As the Senator from California probably will recall, \nthat was defeated on the floor.\n  I ask the Senator from California this: If the Supreme Court has \nalready said, don't send us a statute, don't send us a proposal that \ndoesn't protect the health of the mother when there is a significant \nhealth risk late in the pregnancy because that violates what we found \nto be the right of privacy under Roe v. Wade, why are we now \nconsidering S. 3, this bill, which defies the Supreme Court and says to \nthem, we know better, we are going to change your mind, we are going to \nsend you something that doesn't meet the test in light of the Nebraska \nstatute? Can the Senator from California explain why we are going \nthrough this?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I would say politics is part of it, but I would \nalso say there is an agenda in this Senate and in the House. That \nagenda is to overturn Roe, to keep on pushing through bills that \nchallenge Roe directly. And Roe, as I said, is very clear on the health \nexception.\n  Let's go back to the first chart. The bottom line is, Roe is very \nclear:\n\n       In 1973, for the stage subsequent to viability, the State \n     in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life \n     may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe--\n\nwhich is a fancy word for ban--\n\n     abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical \n     judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the \n     mother.\n\n  This is the heart of Roe.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is saying this proposal we are receiving, \nbanning a specific abortion procedure, does not allow an exception for \nthe health of the mother.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Even though the Supreme Court ruled 2 or 3 years ago on a \nState statute that tried to do the same thing that it clearly was \nunconstitutional or at least violative of Roe v. Wade, they have \nalready thrown that out. Yet the Senate is going to be asked to vote \nagain to eliminate an abortion procedure which a doctor may decide is \nin the best interest of a woman who, late in her pregnancy, facing an \nemergency, has a significant health risk; that is what we are being \nasked to vote on?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right. But it is even worse because the language \nTom Harkin had written into the bill, the sense-of-the-Senate language, \nis now being stripped out of the bill by the House. The reason we are \nhere talking about this is, I want the Senate to disagree with what the \nHouse did. It is bad enough to do what we have done here without my \nvote--and I believe without yours, although I am not sure in the end \nhow you voted.\n  The bottom line is, it is bad enough to ban a procedure and make no \nexception for the health of a woman. It is so violative of her rights \nand her dignity and of the respect that is due her. But in addition, \nthey stripped out the language we added that said, maybe people, for \nwhatever reason, are going to vote for this, but we also want to go on \nrecord in support of Roe. The reason we are here now is that the House, \nrather than take that language and send it off to the President, would \nhave gotten their ban with a little sense-of-the-Senate language that \nsupported Roe. No, the House had to prolong this, strip this out. And \nnow to get to conference, we have to have a motion to disagree with \nwhat the House did, which I hope we will disagree with what they did.\n  So what I was trying to do and what Harkin was trying to do--and we \nall were trying to do--is say: S. 3 has problems, but you should know \nwe still support Roe.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, is it your impression the House \nconferees and those who agreed in the Senate are really going after the \nheart of the issue in Roe v. Wade? It is their intention to overturn \nRoe v. Wade by reason of the fact they have stripped the language \nSenator Harkin offered affirming Roe v. Wade?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And if we eliminated Roe v. Wade--and there are some in \nyour State and in my State, too, who would say, do that, because of our \npersonal, religious and philosophical beliefs--what protection would \nthere be that an abortion procedure under any circumstances would be \nsafe and legal in the United States?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It would be a disaster for women. I have noted that \nbefore Roe, 5,000 women a year died because there were very harsh laws. \nIf Roe v. Wade was eliminated, women would not have the right to \nprivacy in this matter. Early-stage abortion would not be between her \nand her doctor and her God and family, but it would be a matter for \nSenators to determine--and State Senators and assembly members and \nGovernors all over this country. And a woman would risk her freedom if \nshe had an abortion, just like we had before 1973.\n\n  So affirming Roe v. Wade is the right thing to do. It has made a \ndifference in women's lives. More than anything, I think as our country \nmatures, we recognize that women deserve to be treated with respect and \ndignity. It has been a long, hard road for women in this country, I say \nto my friend who is such a supporter of equality across the board. \nWomen didn't even get to vote until 1920. We had to struggle. In 1973, \nI remember it very well. I remember women risking their lives to get an \nillegal abortion. I had read a case of a woman who was raped and she \nwas so fearful and embarrassed and ashamed, she got an illegal, botched \nabortion. She was sick and the doctor even threatened to call the \npolice on her.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator this question. I can recall in the time \nI have\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nbeen in public service that the vocal supporters of Roe v. Wade and \nkeeping abortion safe and legal used to contain in their ranks many \nwomen who remembered vividly from a personal experience or a family \nexperience what it was like before Roe v. Wade, when women in desperate \ncircumstances sought an abortion in an unhealthy, unsanitary, unclean \nsurrounding, endangering their lives. I ask the Senator, does she \nbelieve the national debate is different today because we have had 25 \nor 30 years of legal opportunities to terminate a pregnancy and, thank \ngoodness, there are fewer of those women whose lives were lost or \ndamaged because of these illegal and unsafe abortions that preceded \nthem?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think the Senator is right. The further we get away \nfrom those years, there is less memory. I think there is something \nelse. I think most people--young people and middle-aged people--who \ndon't have that many memories of it think Roe v. Wade will not be \noverturned; it is just a slogan.\n  Let me say what my friend knows so well. Roe v. Wade is hanging by a \n5-to-4 vote in the Supreme Court. That is why I think my colleagues \nkeep coming back with this approach of banning this medical procedure, \nwhich many doctors have used because it was the safest one to save the \nlife and health of a woman. They keep coming and they keep thinking \nsomeday the Court will reverse it and go 5-to-4 the other way. I think \nat that point women will rise up. But it is our job. That is why I am \nso grateful to the Senator for coming over here. It is our job because \nwe are lawmakers to look ahead and not wait for that crisis, and to \nmake the point and to discuss what could happen to a woman. She could \nhave a stroke if this procedure is outlawed. She could have a \nhemorrhage or a blood clot. She could become paralyzed. She could be \ninfertile. These are horrible things that can happen to our daughters, \nour granddaughters, and it could even be worse. We can have some \nStates, if Roe were overturned, that could put a woman in jail, could \nput a doctor in jail for trying to assert a privacy right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask one last question of the Senator from \nCalifornia. First, let me say, though I personally oppose abortion, and \nI would counsel a woman in my family to look for an alternative, or \nadoption, and help in any way I could, I believe we have to really make \na special effort to protect the legality of the decision that a woman \nultimately makes in this situation, when her life and her health are at \nstake--a decision that should be made by her, her doctor, her \nconscience, and her family, as the Senator said.\n\n  What I found 21 years ago, when I came to Congress with that belief, \nwas the startling discovery that so many people who opposed abortion \nalso opposed family planning. That, to me, seems totally inconsistent--\nthat you would not give to a woman options so that she could avoid an \nunplanned pregnancy.\n  I want to ask the Senator from California this: Based on what she has \nseen, and what I have seen in almost 21 years on Capitol Hill, if those \npeople are successful in the Senate and House and eventually overturn \nRoe v. Wade, can the Senator give me some indication of what she thinks \nis next when it comes to issues of family planning--issues that women \nvalue as much as their Roe v. Wade rights, but those issues as well? \nHave we not seen repeatedly in the Congress the same voices who are \ncalling for the overturning of Roe v. Wade also limiting options for \nwomen to plan the size of their family--the frequency of children in \ntheir family?\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is no question about it. With this administration, \nthe very first thing the President did was put in place the \ninternational gag rule, which stopped nonprofits all over the world \nfrom getting Federal funds to use to help these women to plan their \nfamilies.\n  Let me tell you what has happened. We have seen already an assault on \na woman's right to choose. I think my colleague is absolutely right to \npoint out that Roe is just one of their goals; it is their major goal, \nhowever. I will tell you what is happening. Federal regulations were \nissued by this administration that make embryos and fetuses, but not \npregnant women, eligible for health benefits. What you will see is this \nis all leading up to the place where a woman eventually will not have a \nright to choose, or any rights at all when she is pregnant. In other \nwords, pregnant women now cannot get the prenatal care; it is the \nfetus. We have never done that before. We have always recognized that \nit is the woman who is nurturing that child; that the woman gets the \nhelp and the child gets the nourishment.\n  There is legislation being pushed here to recognize an embryo as a \nperson with rights separate and apart from the woman. That is another \nmove to set up a situation where abortion, even in the first minute, \nwould be seen as murder. So this is what is happening today. There is \nmoving legislation forcing some young women to make reproductive health \nchoices alone and criminalizing caring adults who help them. There are \nattempts to block women's access to RU486, a drug that is proven safe \nand effective and would be an alternative to surgical abortion. There \nare attempts to block access to emergency contraception. There is a \ndenial of Roe v. Wade protections to Federal employees and low-income \nwomen who rely on the Federal Government, who live in the District of \nColumbia, and to U.S. servicewomen living overseas, and women in \nFederal prison. These women cannot get the health care if they want to \nexercise their right to choose, whereas a wealthy woman can do that.\n  Here is your point: They are starving funding for family planning \nprograms, both here and abroad. And there is also the cancellation of \ninternational family planning funding. We voted in Congress for $34 \nmillion for international family planning money. The Bush \nadministration will not spend a penny. When you ask them why, they say \nthese agencies are using it for abortion. That is plain untrue. It is \nuntrue. They don't because they are audited and monitored, and they \ncannot.\n  In winding down this debate--and we have several hours left--I want \nto say why I think it is so important that we stand in favor of Roe v. \nWade. We are going to go back to what the debate is really about. It is \nabout standing up for the Senate language that was brought to us by the \nSenator from Iowa, Tom Harkin, with over 50 of us signing on and voting \nfor it, that simply says it is the sense of the Senate that the \ndecision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade was appropriate and \nsecures an important right, and such decision should not be overturned. \nIt is a very straightforward and simple statement--elegant, if I may \nsay so; it is an elegant amendment by the Senator from Iowa that says \nto the women of this country that we respect you and, as my friend \nsaid, he is personally opposed to abortion. You know what. That is so \nmuch that is right in this country of ours. That is what being pro-\nchoice is--that each of us in our own hearts, with our own family, with \nour God, can decide this issue for ourselves, without Senators peering \ninto our private decisions. What a horrible thought is that. Really, \nlife is complicated enough without having a bunch of Senators deciding \nwhat we should do in the privacy of our own homes in the early stage of \na pregnancy.\n  That is what Roe was--a very balanced decision. It says: If you want \nto go through with this pregnancy, absolutely that is your right, but \nif you do not, in the early stages it says to women: We respect you \nenough, we give you that dignity; we trust you enough to make that \ndecision.\n  Senator Harkin said it right. This Senate stood up with him and we \nvoted in favor and appended that language to the banning of this \nmedical procedure. Our colleagues in the House looked at this--and they \nare so radical, I say to my friend--and rather than moving that bill \nright through to the President's desk with sense-of-the-Senate language \nthat has no force of law, they chose to strip out this language from \nthe bill, and now we have to take this bill to conference.\n  The reason I am here and the reason the Senator from Illinois is here \ntonight is to say we are going to take another stand in favor of Roe. \nWe are going to vote to disagree with what the House did. We hope that \nvote will be large, and we hope that the conferees will, therefore, go \ninto that conference and push hard to have this language added.\n  If this language is not added, this Senate is going on record with S. \n3,\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\nminus this language, of saying: Women's health is just not important. I \nhope every woman in this country, whether they agree with Roe or they \ndisagree with Roe, whether they themselves would make one decision or \nanother, will come together and say: Pro-choice means that the \nGovernment respects the individual, and isn't that really what our \ncountry is all about?\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I admire my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia. She is a fighter. She has a conscience, and she is \ndedicated. I am delighted to listen to her. I agree with her \nabsolutely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11460-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11460-S11463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a no-no subject--\ntaxes. I get really worn out when I go home and hear the local folks \nare against taxes. I came to public service over 50 years ago when \nthere was a conscience of paying the bill for the Government we \nprovided. I will never forget, one of the first measures we had come \nbefore us was a veterans' bonus for the World War II veterans. I can \nsee Julian Dusenberry, a Member from Florence, whose legs had been shot \nout from under him. He was a Distinguished Service Cross recipient. He \nraised himself up on those brass bars we had at the back of the Chamber \nfor him, and he said: Mr. Speaker, we all are veterans, but we are all \nSouth Carolinians. South Carolina doesn't have the money, and I move to \ntable the bill. And we killed the veterans' bonus.\n  It was shortly thereafter that I could see we were not providing \npublic education in a general sense for all of our constituency. More \nparticularly, there were just absolutely no schools for African \nAmericans. I went to one shortly after I was elected. It was a one-\nsquare building, one floor. It was a cold November day. They had a \npotbellied stove in the middle, a class in one corner, a class in \nanother corner, a class in the third corner, and a class in the fourth \ncorner. This African American school had one teacher for the four \nclasses. So I introduced the sales tax to pay for education. It was a 3 \npercent sales tax, and we finally enacted it in 1951. It was quite a \nstruggle, but nobody has really contested that measure, nor has anyone \nput in a bill to repeal it.\n  We have to pay for the public schools. Under Governor Riley--he was \nSecretary of Education--we increased that from 3 to 5 percent.\n  When I came in as Governor of South Carolina, some 40 years ago, we \nhad to attract industry. Everybody was looking for jobs. I am sort of \nan expert at looking for jobs. I traveled the highways and byways, but \nbefore I did that, I prepared myself to sell the point. I knew they \nwere not going to invest in South Carolina, unless we had a pay-as-you-\ngo operation. So I moved to increase taxes and got the AAA credit \nrating for the State of South Carolina back in 1959, before any \nSouthern State, including the State of Virginia, had a AAA credit \nrating.\n  I address the distinguished Chair because he gave real leadership to \nhis State of Virginia when he was Governor. He knows exactly what we \nare talking about. In fact, the gentleman we had in South Carolina went \nback up to Richmond, VA, to help in industrial expansion. So we worked \ntogether trying to develop public education, strong communities, and \nfiscal responsibility at the State level. But you can come up here to \nWashington and you can forget about it.\n  I saw one article the other day that was put in the Record relative \nto President Lyndon Baines Johnson. It said he didn't care. Oh, no, he \ndid. He didn't give us guns and butter. He paid in 1968 and 1969 for \nthe Vietnam War. The last time your U.S. Government balanced the budget \nwas under President Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1968-1969. We ended up in \nthe black with a surplus. Thereafter, as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee under President Carter I can tell you, we still had a \nconscience.\n  I will never forget that 1980 election. They cleaned out Democrats. I \nwent to the ones who were cleaned out and said: Look, you have to give \nme a vote. We can't leave this year with a deficit bigger than the one \nwe inherited from President Ford. I went to Senator Magnuson, I went to \nSenator Church, I went to Senator Culver, I went to Senator McGovern, I \nwent to Senator Bayh, I went to Senator Gaylord Nelson--all defeated in \n1980. I said: You have to give me one vote. They did, and we reduced \nthat deficit.\n  Then, of course, when President Reagan came in with voodoo, which \nVice President Bush called it, the idea is to cut your taxes and that \nwill increase your revenue. That is absolute nonsense. We know now from \nvoodoo 1, 2, 3, and 4 that we are in the worst trouble we have ever \nbeen. That is why I take the floor today to speak generally with \nrespect to taxes.\n  All politicians are against taxes. In fact, some are so adamant \nagainst them, they run against the Government, they run against the job \nthey are running for. But taxes are what we pay for a civilized \nsociety, said Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n  Let's try, Mr. President, a nation without taxes, just momentarily. \nLet's agree, for example, to not touch Social Security and Medicare--\nthey are both in surplus. In fact, everybody wants to save Social \nSecurity. If you just left it alone and quit spending the Social \nSecurity revenues on any and everything but Social Security, you would \nhave a $1.5 trillion surplus in the Social Security trust fund, which \nthe Greenspan Commission called for and which we passed in law, section \n13-301 of the Budget Act, that we totally ignore now. So let's leave \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Defense alone.\n\n  But let's take all the other things government does with taxpayer \ndollars and get rid of them so we can get rid of taxes. The Departments \nof State, Justice, Commerce, and Education would immediately be \nabolished. We would eliminate the FBI.\n  We would stop building roads or fixing the ones we have. We would do \naway with the hospitals receiving Federal support, eliminate the \nNational Institutes of Health, and close all the Veterans Hospitals.\n  We would close the monuments and the parks, decertify the food \ncertified by the Food and Drug Administration, decertify the drugs for \nthe same reason, eliminate all the farm programs. When one mentions \nfarm programs, they can get some attention in this body. That is the \ncrowd that does not want to pay for anything, but they wiggle their way \nin and walk away with billions every time, every session. They always \nget billions, but let's do away with the farm programs, eliminate the \ndevelopment programs, forget about clean air, clean water, just close \nthe Environmental Protection Administration; cancel NOAA, cancel NASA, \ncancel the housing programs, close the airports because they are \nsupported by Federal taxes.\n  In fact, just close the prisons. Tell all the prisoners, sooey, pig, \njust get out. Just shoo, get out. Get rid of the President, get rid of \nthe Congress, the Cabinet, the courts. Just get rid of the government.\n  I talked to a group in South Carolina and finally got their attention \nthat we are lucky to be born in America where there is a government \nsupported by the taxes that helps provide our opportunities. For \nexample, someone born in Zambia can expect to live to only 37 years of \nage; born in Swaziland, 38 years; born in Rwanda, 39 years; Mozambique, \n40 years; Niger, where someone found yellow cake, he lives to be 41 \nyears of age. If I had been born in Niger, I would have been dead \nalready for 40 years. I do not want to give that idea out to a lot of \npeople listening to what I am talking about.\n  Eighty percent of those born today in rural India have worms. Eighty-\nfive percent will go hungry and 95 percent in rural India will drink \ndirty water all of their lives. One born today in Botswana has a one in \nthree chance of getting AIDS, and someone born in Mali instead of the \nUnited States has only a 10-percent chance of completing the first \ngrade. One born in Brazil has a 40-percent chance of dropping out of \nschool by the sixth grade. A girl born in Pakistan has less than a 10-\npercent chance of attending high school. In Senegal one has only a 50-\npercent chance of finding a job.\n  In Sri Lanka, one can expect to earn only 40 cents an hour; Haiti, 30 \ncents an hour; Bangladesh, 20 cents an hour. So one born in many \ncountries instead of\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\nthe good old USA, they cannot vote, they have no labor rights, they \ncannot even assemble.\n  We all like to think, wait a minute now, we all came up by our own \nbootstraps; that we did it on our own. No. If one is born in America, \nthe government has furnished the boot. The government in America has \nfurnished the law and order, educational opportunity, a market economy, \nclean air, clean water, civil rights, labor rights, a free society. \nBorn in America, as Thomas Wolfe wrote, each has his own shining golden \nopportunity.\n  Because of this land of opportunity, supported by taxes, Asians come \nhidden in containers on ships, and Mexican immigrants risk their lives \nevery day to get here.\n  Some will say we do not need the taxes. What we need is spending \ncuts. I say to my dear colleagues, spending cuts will not do it.

Inflation is projected using the inflators specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency\n  Deficit Control Act of 1985 (the GDP deflator and the employment cost index for wages and salaries).\n\\2\\ This classification includes much of the funding associated with the Department of Homeland Security, as well as funding for homeland security activities performed by other federal\n  agencies, such as the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Energy. Funding for certain activities of the Department of Homeland Security, such as maritime safety and\n  immigration services, is not included because those activities are not part of the Administration's definition of homeland security.

In addition, the Administration's definition includes roughly $1 billion of mandatory spending each year.\n \nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\nNote: Discretionary outlays are usually higher than budget authority because of spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is subject to obligation\n  limitations set in appropriation acts.

If we turn to page 8, we will see that nondefense \noutlays for this particular fiscal year that we are in is 419 billion \nbucks. But if we turn to page 10, we will see that the deficit for this \nfiscal year is $640 billion. So do not just cut. Eliminate all \nnondefense programs, eliminate all those departments, prisons, the FBI, \nthe Congress, the courts, the President. Just eliminate everything. Get \nrid of it. And we still have a $200 billion dollar or more deficit.\n  So do not come around in these debates and give these nice, pleasant, \nChamber of Commerce, rotary club\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\ntalks that what we really need in Washington is to cut down the \nspending, cut down the size of Government, Government is just too big.\n  Well, by gosh, come on up here and just cut it out, and there is \nstill a deficit. So we have over a $200 billion deficit right there and \nthen, and now comes President Bush who says he needs $87 billion--like \nwe have some money. We are just nothing but wallowing around in the red \nusing credit cards, and so he asks that the Congress provide $87 \nbillion more for Iraq. Of course, that is all on the credit card \nfurther, a bigger deficit. It is really a sin and a shame.\n  What we are saying is, me and my generation and most of the \ngenerations of the Members that I see and who can speak this evening \nsay we ain't going to pay the bill. We do not want that GI in downtown \nBaghdad to get killed. We want him to rush back to pay the bill because \nwe ain't going to pay for it. We need a tax cut so next year we can get \nreelected. That is the message of everybody running around with flags \non their lapels showing how they support the troops.\n  Well, come on. Support the troops? When are they going to cosponsor \nmy value-added tax? I tried it with the value-added tax after we failed \nwith Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. We worked with President Reagan in a \nbipartisan fashion and we did a good job momentarily for 2 or 3 years, \nbut then instead of using Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to cut back some $35 \nbillion in spending each and every year, we were using it as a cover to \nincrease spending $35 billion each and every year.\n  So I said give me a divorce from that. I don't want my name connected \nwith it. I got hold of Dick Darman, when President George Herbert \nWalker Bush, the senior Bush, took office. Darman was the OMB Director.\n  I said: Dick, we ought to have a value-added tax.\n  They discussed it. I got a little note from Papa Bush to the effect \nthat he might consider that but not right now, his first year in \noffice.\n  We tried and tried until we got to President Clinton. Then we had a \nshowdown on how to act responsibly. Without a single Republican vote in \nthe House, without a single Republican vote in the Senate, President \nClinton and this Democratic Congress passed an increase in taxes as \nwell as spending cuts. We cut some $350 billion to $400 billion in \nspending, but we increased taxes on the high and wealthy. We increased \nthe income taxes. We increased gasoline taxes. We increased Social \nSecurity taxes.\n  I will never forget the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Phil \nGramm, saying they were going to be hunting down the Democrats in the \nstreets and shooting us like dogs when they found out we were, by gosh, \ngoing to increase taxes on Social Security.\n  But you see now that rich crowd comes in, and what they want and all \nthey ask for is: Give me an income tax cut. Give me a retroactive one, \nnunc pro tunc. They sneaked in all kinds of things for Kenny Boy Lay. \nIt came to $250 million. I have never seen such things.\n  Then they wanted to get rid of the taxes on dividends. I want the \nparty of Lincoln to remember that Abraham Lincoln put a tax on \ndividends to pay for the Civil War. He was willing to pay for the war. \nWe have paid for every war, until now.\n  Let me be brief here because I can see the hour is getting late. \nRather than going into this very interesting article by the former \nSecretary of Labor, Dr. Robert B. Reich, printed in USA Today entitled \n``Tax wealthy to pay for Iraq war,'' I ask unanimous consent to have \nthat article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the USA Today, Sept. 15, 2003]\n\n                    Tax Wealthy To Pay for Iraq War\n\n\n                    test patriotism's deeper meaning\n\n                          (By Robert B. Reich)\n\n       President Bush says he will ask Congress for $87 billion in \n     emergency spending for military and intelligence operations \n     in Iran and Afghanistan. That's on top of the $79 billion \n     Congress already has approved to pay for the war and its \n     immediate aftermath. Neither of these figures includes an \n     estimated $50 billion more that will be needed to rebuild \n     Iraq, or any additional expenditures we may need for homeland \n     security.\n       How can we afford all that?\n       The coming fiscal year's federal budget deficit already is \n     approaching $600 billion. Add in the extra spending, and it's \n     close to $600 billion. And that's just one year's tab. The \n     total over all the years it will take to stabilize both Iraq \n     and Afghanistan and win the war against terrorism is likely \n     to be far higher.\n       Bush and the Republican Congress have no real plan to pay \n     for these extra costs. At one time they mentioned Iraq oil, \n     but the oil won't be flowing in substantial volume until \n     wells and pipelines are rebuilt, which could take years. \n     America's major allies haven't offered to foot the bill. \n     Given that France and Germany are still grumpy about the \n     Iraqi war, and Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair is taking \n     a great deal of heat about it at home, there's no reason to \n     suppose that they will be offering a lot of financial help.\n       One thing is certain. Neither the White House nor Congress \n     is considering the best solution: a year tax on wealthy. \n     Raising taxes is politically unpopular. Bush has wanted only \n     to cut taxes, especially on America's wealth. Yet there's a \n     strong history of conservatives and Republicans who have \n     embraced war taxes as the fairest and best way to finance the \n     costs.\n       Traditionally during wartime, taxes have been raised on top \n     incomes to pay the extra costs of war. The estate tax--\n     overwhelmingly paid by wealthy families--was imposed by \n     wartime Republican presidents Abraham Lincoln and William \n     McKinley. It was maintained through World War I, World War \n     II, the Korean War, Vietnam and the Cold War. Now, the estate \n     tax is being phased out, at least until 2011, as part of the \n     tax cut of 2001.\n       The top income tax rate rose during World War I to 70 \n     percent. In World War II, it reached more than 90 percent. In \n     1953, with the Cold War raging, Republican President Dwight \n     Eisenhower refused to support a Republican move to reduce it. \n     By 1980, it was still way up there, at 70 percent. Then \n     Ronald Reagan slashed it to 28 percent, giving us the lowest \n     top tax rate of all modern industrialized nations. Because \n     Reagan kept spending record sums on the military, the federal \n     deficit ballooned. A few years after that, the Berlin Wall \n     came down, ending the Cold War. We congratulated ourselves \n     and then faced the largest budget deficit since World War II.\n       It seems only fair that the rich should pay proportionately \n     more, especially now that the cost of the war against \n     terrorism is rising. They're the only ones with money to \n     spare. Look at the numbers: In 1979, the top 5 percent of \n     earners took home 16.4 percent of total family income, but by \n     2001, their share had increased to 22.4 percent. In contrast, \n     in 1979 the bottom 60 percent of earners took home 31.4 \n     percent of total income; by 2001 their share had declined to \n     26.8 percent.\n       Besides, the very richest Americans benefit \n     disproportionately from a stable federal government that \n     protects their property and maintains public tranquility.\n       President Teddy Roosevelt made that case in 1906, arguing \n     that the wartime inheritance tax should continue during \n     peacetime: ``The man of great wealth owes a particular \n     obligation to the state because he derives special advantages \n     from the mere existence of government.''\n       It is the least the wealthy can do when so many others are \n     sacrificing for the nation. Most wealthy kids never come near \n     a front line. During the first Gulf War, enlistment rates for \n     children of the richest 15 percent were one-fifth of the \n     national average. Charles Moskos, a sociology professor at \n     Northwestern University and expert on military affairs, notes \n     that in his 1956 Princeton class, 450 of 750 men served in \n     the military. In those days, America still had a draft. Last \n     year, only three of Princeton's 1,000 graduates served.\n       The Bush administration doesn't seem interested in a war \n     tax on the wealthy. To the contrary, the White House has been \n     busily shifting the tax burden away from the rich--phasing \n     out the estate tax, cutting taxes on dividends and parceling \n     out other tax breaks to them. The president says this is the \n     way to stimulate a sluggish economy. But the rich aren't \n     going to spend the extra cash. They already spend as much as \n     they want. They're more likely to invest it around the world, \n     wherever they can get the highest return. Repealing a year's \n     tax cut for the top 1 percent would generate almost enough to \n     cover the entire $87 billion of additional spending on Iraq.\n       A war tax, properly structured, also would prevent the rich \n     from squirreling away their income in foreign tax shelters. \n     An acquaintance from law school, now a partner in one of \n     Washington's biggest firms, with offices to many countries, \n     recently explained to me one such dodge as we lunched in a \n     swanky restaurant. He and his partners use tax rules to \n     create offsetting taxable gains and losses, then allocate the \n     gains to the firm's foreign partners, who don't pay taxes in \n     the United States. That way, they keep the losses in the \n     United States and shelter their income abroad. A war tax, \n     properly structured, would close such foreign loopholes.\n       I noted he had an American flag lapel pin. ``You're \n     supporting our troops,'' I said, referring to it. ``Yup,'' he \n     replied, entirely missing my point. ``And I can't stand all \n     those naysayers who are knocking America. I mean, we stand or \n     fall together, right?''\n       Exactly. Suggesting that the wealthy should pay more to \n     support the nation in time of war isn't inviting class \n     warfare. It's exploring a deeper meaning of patriotism. The \n     basic question is what we own one another as citizens. The \n     question seems especially pertinent in a newly dangerous \n     world, in which we stand or fall together.\n\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, let me address the particular resolution \nfor disapproval of the Federal Communication Commission's order \nrelative to not only increasing media ownership from 35 percent to 45 \npercent but, more particularly, also eliminating cross-ownership rules \nso you can own everything. You can own the cable, you can own the \ntelevision, you can own the newspaper, you can own the satellite and \nmany stations and what have you, and, in the main, the networks own \nthem.\n  I hasten to add that I hold no brief for or difference with any of \nthe 10 particular Federal Communications Commission Chairmen with whom \nI have served. I have served, it will be almost 37 years, beginning \nwith Rosel Hyde back in 1966, to Dean Burch, to Richard Wiley, to \nCharles Ferris, to Mark Fowler, to Dennis Patrick, to Alfred Sikes, to \nJames Quello, to Reed Hundt, to William Kennard. Ask any one of them.\n  I got on the Commerce Committee and on the Subcommittee on \nCommunications, when John Pastore of Rhode Island was the chairman of \nthe subcommittee. For over 20-some years I have served as either \nchairman of that subcommittee or ranking member.\n  Right to the point, I want to try to agree with our distinguished FCC \nchairman, Michael Powell. I tried my best to sit down and talk with \nhim. I realized from the get-go that he was off on a toot because he \nwas asked, just as he was coming into office, about the public \ninterest. He was asked, at his maiden news conference, for his \ndefinition of the public interest.\n  Powell joked:\n\n       I have no idea. The term can mean whatever people want it \n     to mean. It's an empty vessel in which people pour in \n     whatever their preconceived views or biases are.\n\n  I could see we would have trouble because here is a regulatory body \nto carry out the rules and regulations and the intent of the Congress \nto regulate, and here he is coming in and saying: No, no--market \nforces. The public interest is just something fanciful. It is an \n``empty vessel,'' to use his characterization.\n  Free market analysis does not apply to the broadcasting industry \nbecause of spectrum scarcity; that is, the primary local broadcast is \nthe primary source for local news, weather, public affairs programming, \nand emergency information.\n  When we had the 1996 act, it actually was a bill that I had worked on \n2 years as chairman of the Commerce Committee. I can see George \nMitchell, the majority leader, trying to get it up because we passed it \nout of the committee unanimously. We worked in a bipartisan fashion. He \ncould not get it up. In desperation and frustration, he said: The first \nthing I am going to do when we convene next year is call up the \nTelecommunications Act.\n  Of course we Democrats were beat. The Republicans took over. Senator \nLarry Pressler, the distinguished Senator, took over as chairman of the \nCommerce Committee and he put in the Republican version. But in \nconference--you can ask Tom Bliley, who was the Republican chairman in \nthe House and I was working on the Senate side--that we more or less \nreconciled it to a bill that we had worked on literally for 4 years to \npromote competition.\n  We realized we were into a dynamic environment, changing each day. We \nworded the language in there so it would not only deregulate but \nreregulate.\n  Of course the distinguished Chairman Powell went along with every \ngimmick in the book, such as it didn't refer to data, and various other \nthings that my colleague over on the House side, Billy Tauzin, put in, \nbut we held up.\n  Finally, the other day they put out an order relative to the \nownership cap and the cross-ownership. Let's take 1 second with respect \nto the ownership cap.\n  What happens is that we were really trying to hold it to the 25 \npercent. There were some in violation, in excess of that. They wanted \nto be able to reconcile themselves and come into conformance with the \nlaw itself and the rule. We got down to the base wire and everything \nelse of that kind. There was not any question in our own minds that the \n25 percent was enough ownership, because we could see how the radio was \ngoing at the particular time.\n  We all know how radio has gone, where they can own 1,200 stations. \nWhen you get that kind of ownership, they can't just give numbers, you \nhave to get control.\n  I can't get any kind of local thing. It is all foreign. In fact, you \nare liable to get the weather out of India at your local hometown \nstation. They are reading from some kind of report.\n  We had a system that was actually checks and balances at the Federal \nGovernment level. In other words, in broadcasting, the content was \nprovided by producers. The networks served as wholesalers and the local \naffiliates as distributors. Now the networks have come in and gotten \ntheir own programming. They have done away with the financial \nsyndication rule. They have gotten into their own programming in \nvertical integration.\n  The networks have been allowed to buy up stations, and they are \nbuying them up like gangbusters. What we are going to have here is \nalmost one branch of government trying to preserve localism in the \npublic interest. It is not going to happen if this continues. It just \nthrew everyone into turmoil.\n  There isn't any question. On the House side, even though Chairman \nTauzin opposed it vigorously, a bipartisan group put in the State, \nJustice, Commerce appropriations bill that the 45-percent rule of the \nFederal Communications Commission be reversed and go back to 35 \npercent. We considered the same thing over at the markup of the State, \nJustice, Commerce appropriations bill, and we included that same \nprovision word for word.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``How Michael Powell \nCould Have the Last Laugh,'' in this week's Business Week, which goes \nright to the cross-ownership, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From BusinessWeek, Sept. 22, 2003]\n\n              How Michael Powell Could Have the Last Laugh\n\n                          (By Catherine Yang)\n\n       Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. \n     Powell looks like a man on the run. Since he passed sweeping \n     rules in June enabling greater media consolidation, an angry \n     public has ignited a fast-burning backlash against his \n     deregulatory agenda. On Sept. 3, at the urging of public \n     interest groups, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia \n     stayed the rules until it could finish reviewing them. The \n     next day, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to bar \n     the FCC from implementing a new rule allowing TV networks to \n     own stations covering up to 45% of the U.S. audience.\n       But while the opponents of media consolidation seem to be \n     gaining ground fast, they shouldn't be too quick to declare \n     victory. In fact, Capitol Hill's expected repudiation of the \n     networks' 45 percent limit risks letting the steam out of the \n     debate--and leaving Powell's laissez-faire legacy intact. \n     Until now, lawmakers and the anti-Big Media insurgents have \n     focused on gutting this one rule. The 45 percent cap has \n     become a rallying symbol, but the regulations that would \n     truly reorder America's media landscape and affect local \n     communities have flown under the radar. These would allow \n     companies to snap up not only two to three local TV stations \n     in a market but also a newspaper and up to eight radio \n     stations. If the courts and Congress are worried about the \n     dangers of media consolidation, they'll have to resist \n     calling it a day after dispensing with the network cap and go \n     after the rule with real bite.\n       As it stands now, TV's Big Four networks will be losers \n     among media outlets--thanks mostly to vociferous lobbying by \n     independent TV affiliates. With strong ties to lawmakers who \n     depend on them for campaign coverage, the affiliates have \n     succeeded in getting a House vote against the 45 percent rule \n     and will likely see a rerun of that episode when the Senate \n     votes by October. But with Fox and CBS already each owning \n     stations that cover about 40 percent of the nation's \n     audience, ``going up another 5 percent isn't going to make a \n     dramatic difference,'' says Scott A. Stawski, a media \n     consultant at Inforte in Chicago.\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\n       In contrast, opening the floodgates to allow local \n     behemoths to combine newspapers, TV, and radio stations under \n     one roof would change media ownership in towns and cities, \n     concentrating it in the hands of a few. Even in midsize \n     cities, such as San Antonio, for instance, one company might \n     own the leading newspaper, two TV stations, eight radio \n     stations, and several cable channels. Powell argues the \n     explosion of cable networks and the Internet brings a wide \n     choice of media to communities, even if there's a spate of \n     mergers. And--no surprise here--most media companies agree.\n       Yet there's little doubt that, once given the go-ahead, \n     these rules would spur local consolidation. Owning a second \n     or third station in a market is irresistible for TV station \n     owners, which can splash expenses by a third by ditching \n     duplicate cameramen, studio technicians, and reporters. The \n     economies of newspaper-broadcast crossownership may be \n     dicier, but publishers such as Tribune Co., Gannett, and \n     Media General want stations where they publish--if for \n     nothing more than to cut costs in back-office operations.\n       True, the new media giants could conceivably plow their \n     savings back into improving local news coverage. But public \n     companies are more likely to use them to boost returns to \n     shareholders. ``If they can downsize the operational budget \n     through having fewer people cover the news, they'll do it,'' \n     says Jill Geisler, head of the leadership program at the \n     Poynter Institute, which promotes journalism standards.\n       But even asking whether TV duopolicies and newspaper TV \n     combos can produce better news may be beside the point. ``The \n     test is how many different voices we have,'' says James F. \n     Goodmon, CEO of Capitol Broadcasting Co., a Raleigh (NC)-\n     based TV station group that is opposed to the FCC's rules. \n     ``What's good news to you is bad news to me. I'm really \n     worried about someone deciding what good news is.'' The \n     courts and Congress, too, should guard against a Powell \n     doctrine that could end up muffling more voices than it adds.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we had the support of the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters with respect to the overall check of the 45 \npercent being turned back to the 35 percent and not go up to 45 \npercent. However, the station owners realized that money could control \nand they could be in a position where cross-ownership would be done \naway with. There is a lot of big money with these oligopolies coming in \nand buying up their stations, which would position them monetarily and \nenhance the value of their station.\n  We don't have the support of the National Association of Broadcasters \non that cross-ownership. But the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, \nhas it in as a resolution of disapproval. I am a cosponsor. Senator \nLott and many of our Republican colleagues are also cosponsors. We \ndischarged that one out from the Commerce Committee.\n  The Stevens-Hollings authorization bill on the return of 45 percent \nfrom the 35 percent has been reported and is pending at the desk for \nconsideration. I think the appropriations process is the only way that \nwe can proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nUSA Today from this morning entitled ``FCC's Powell keeps chin up as \nregulation storm rages.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 15, 2003]\n\n          FCC's Powell Keeps Chin Up as Regulation Storm Rages\n\n                           (By Paul Davidson)\n\n       Washington.--Federal Communications Commission Chairman \n     Michael Powell is unbowed by a string of rebukes from \n     Congress, the courts and the public to his agency's ruling \n     allowing media giants to get bigger.\n       ``In hindsight, maybe I would have done a little more of \n     this, a little less of that,'' Powell, a Republican, said \n     last week in an interview in his corner office. ``But I don't \n     believe what we did in the mainstream was incorrect.''\n       Powell has endured an unusually punishing year for an FCC \n     chairman. He lost his bid early this year to deregulate the \n     regional Bells' phone service when fellow Republican Kevin \n     Martin sided with the agency's two Democrats. He has come to \n     personify a much-maligned push by the Bush administration to \n     give ``big media'' too much influence. And each move against \n     his media plan by Congress or the courts is portrayed as a \n     personal defeat that further erodes Powell's status as the \n     USA's top communications regulator.\n       In an interview, Powell was calmly defiant, exuding little \n     sense that he is at the epicenter of a national firestorm. \n     ``It does not faze me one bit that you're going to talk about \n     me, because I don't think I'm the story,'' says Powell. ``The \n     story should be (what is the best) policy for the American \n     people.''\n       The newest and potentially most far-reaching setback could \n     come Tuesday, when the Senate considers a rare resolution to \n     reverse all the FCC's new media ownership rules. Backers of \n     the measure expect it to pass, though it faces a battle in \n     the House from Republican leaders and a veto threat from \n     President Bush.\n       The FCC rules, approved by the commission in a party-line \n     3-2 vote in June, would let TV networks own local stations \n     reaching, in total, 45% of the national audience, up from \n     35%. The rules also would allow ownership of a newspaper and \n     a TV or radio station in the same market and up to three TV \n     stations in the largest cities.\n       A diverse coalition, from the National Rifle Association to \n     Common Cause, argues the overhaul would give a handful of \n     conglomerates too much control over what people see, hear and \n     read.\n       Powell downplays concerns as ``melodramatic.'' Noting that \n     a 1996 law and a federal appeals court ordered the FCC to \n     justify its old rules or scrap them, he said the resolution \n     to be voted on Tuesday would spawn ``chaos.''\n       ``Why is it better for this country to reinstate rules that \n     have been overturned by a court? Under the terms of the \n     (resolution), we're not even allowed to replace them.''\n       But Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who launched the resolution \n     push, disagrees. ``The court did not overturn the rules. The \n     court told the FCC that they must justify the rules. Instead, \n     the FCC decided to take a high dive on behalf of the biggest \n     corporate interests.''\n       Dorgan says his measure would simply reinstate the old \n     media limits, adding nothing would stop the FCC from issuing \n     revised rules that make more tempered changes.\n       The resolution is the latest blow to Powell's media \n     deregulation plan. The House in July voted to reinstate the \n     35% cap, and the Senate is expected to follow suit. That more \n     limited measure stands the best chance of withstanding a \n     White House veto because it's attached to a spending bill.\n       Powell says the tighter rules are outmoded as cable \n     threatens free broadcast TV, but, ``(Congress) makes the \n     rules, and we implement them. I think that's completely \n     fine.'' Yet he ripped the legislative proposals as hollow \n     because they don't offer guidance on ownership regulation. \n     ``It is, in some ways, an anti-vote.'' he says.\n       And when critics rail against big media, ``I'm not sure \n     what problem people are trying to solve. I don't have the \n     sense I don't hear every viewpoint from the left to the right \n     on Fox, MSNBC and CNBC.''\n       Powell says he can ``absolutely see the argument'' that \n     easing media limits further could give too much influence to \n     a handful of behemoths, but insists his changes are moderate. \n     ``It's an amazingly gradual, modest package. The difference \n     between 35 and 45 (percent) is the network might own five \n     more stations in the United States. So no, I do not think \n     that's the end of democracy.''\n       But Andrew Schwartzman of the Media Access Project notes \n     the national cap was 25% before Congress raised it in 1996. \n     ``This is a very substantial increase. Chairman Powell \n     persistently trivializes the heartfelt concerns of the \n     public.''\n       Schwartzman, some say dealt Powell his most stinging defeat \n     when he persuaded a U.S. appeals court this month to block \n     all the FCC's new regulations from talking effect until it \n     rules on a broader challenge to them. Washington media lawyer \n     Christy Kunin says the stay indicates the court believes the \n     challenge has at least ``some merit.''\n       But Powell contends: ``The court's decision has been \n     radically exaggerated. It has merely said, `Let's chill out,' \n     and gives us a fair change to consider'' the case.\n       He also dismisses complaints that he could have handled the \n     media ruling with more sensitivity, perhaps heeding calls to \n     delay the vote another 30 days to give the public a chance to \n     comment.\n       ``The commissioners who asked for the 30 days weren't going \n     to change their vote in any way.''\n       Powell concedes the drumbeat of protest against his media \n     plan ``is intense. I'm a human being.'' But, ``I don't \n     personalize policy.''\n       The son of Secretary of State Colin Powell, Michael Powell \n     is a former Army officer, Justice Department official and \n     antitrust lawyer who is deemed a rigorous intellectual \n     analyst but short on the political skills required of an FCC \n     chairman. He admits discomfort with the swirl of politics. \n     ``I like to think of the agency as more judicial than \n     legislative. And when it gets infected with whose \n     constituency is going to win, I don't like that. It's very \n     unsatisfying when you realize somebody's voting a certain way \n     for political reasons.''\n       Powell cites deregulation of the wireless industry and \n     promotion of high-definition TV among his biggest successes. \n     He denies rumors he's poised to step down. There's nothing \n     imminent. The criticism, he adds, ``is not fun. But it's what \n     you're forced to endure to be successful in this job.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you can see, as they say in this \narticle, that Chairman Powell is defiant. He says that it would spawn \nchaos. It wasn't chaos. We had some competition. In fact, Senator \nMcCain and I are trying to reregulate the radio stations, bring them \nback and do away with the ownership and make them divest to a certain \nnumber. But he says the commissioners now ought to have the\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\nviews of the public. That is very interesting.\n  Mr. President, now Michael Powell is going to have a task force \ndesigned to prevent any media company from having excess power over \ncompetition or viewpoints.\n  He does that after two of the commissioners begged for public \nhearings. They literally begged. They were told they did not have money \nenough, and they could only hold one hearing. That hearing was held in \nRichmond.\n  From their own particular little budget, they had 13 hearings. Now a \nfirestorm has erupted. You not only have the National Rifle Association \nand consumer groups, but you have the people of authority and respect \nsuch as Walter Cronkite and Barry Diller. You can go right on down the \nlist all saying this is the worst thing that could possibly happen.\n  The interesting thing is that Commissioner Powell says they have \n``produced a balanced structural rule faithful to the directors of \nCongress.'' Total, total applesauce--applesauce and baloney. I can tell \nyou that we begged and we coached. I thought maybe it was a personality \ndifference.\n  I get along with his father, Secretary Powell. In fact, he and I \nreceived honorary degrees at Tuskeegee together. He calls me Dr. \nHollings. I call him Dr. Powell. I have provided him every red cent he \nhas ever wanted for State Department appropriations as Secretary of \nState. I have that particular appropriations.\n  But Michael Powell is a different character entirely. He is very \ncompetent, very smart, and very intelligent, but not a regulator. He \njust believes that the public interest is an empty vessel and the \nmarket forces should control. When he says ``faithful to the directors \nof Congress,'' that is exactly what he has not been. He has been \ntotally unfaithful. We begged him to hold up the order.\n  This particular reference in the order itself shows that he thinks \nthey need big hearings on localism. Why didn't he hold up the order \nbefore he had the task force, before he had the hearings? The task \nforce will make legislative recommendations to Congress to strengthen \nlocalism. We fought like tigers to try to get him to listen, and he \njust absolutely would not listen.\n  Mr. President, quoting from this morning's Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Entertainment giants such as Viacom, NBC parent General \n     Electric Co. and Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, now reach \n     more than 50 percent of the prime-time television audience \n     through their combined broadcast and cable outlets. The total \n     rises to 80 percent, if you include the parents of newer \n     networks--such as News Corp.'s FOX and AOL, Time-Warner, \n     Inc.'s WB--and NBC's pending acquisition of Vivendi Universal \n     SA's cable assets, estimates Tom Wolzien, an analyst at \n     Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\n       The big media companies are quietly re-creating the ``old \n     programming oligopoly'' of the pre-cable era, notes Mr. \n     Wolzien, a former executive of NBC. Of the top 25 cable \n     channels, 20 are now owned by 1 of the big 5 media companies.\n\n  They own each other. You talk to Chairman Powell, and he says, Look, \ncable is going to be taken over and there won't be any free \nbroadcast. The free broadcaster is the one who owns the cable. He is \ntotally off base. He just will not regulate. An order for localism is a \nsham and a farce. The American people ought to understand it and they \nought to understand why we do not have the support of the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters. They want to enhance the value of their \nindividual stations. They see if you can get the cross-ownership, the \nvalue of their station locally. One of the big oligarchies will give an \ninordinate price and they can go to Virginia Beach, the sun, take it \neasy, and will not have to worry.\n\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Senate at this late hour. I only \nask that you give close attention to the bipartisan Dorgan-Lott \nresolution, that we disapprove it, and put us back to where we were \nbefore they started a feeding frenzy, according to all the stockbrokers \nin the market in New York, ready to buy up all the rest of the stations \nas soon as it becomes effective. It has been stayed by the court. \nRather than causing chaos, it will bring us back and maybe we can find \nout from the task force of localism, of Chairman Powell, what really \nneeds to be done, what the public interest is.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11465-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate \nChapter 0336 of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees, \nNARFE, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.\n  Fifty years ago, Chapter 0336 was formed by 17 NARFE members in Rapid \nCity, SD. Today, the chapter's membership has grown to include over 200 \npersons. As many of my colleagues know, NARFE has been instrumental in \nprotecting the rights of retired Federal and civilian employees.\n  The importance of Federal employees is well illustrated by the \noverwhelming majority of those in the Chamber today. Federal and \ncivilian employment is an essential component of governmental \nefficiency. These employees are the backbone of our great country, and \nthose who devote their lives to public service deserve to know that \nthey will retire with dignity.\n  By acting as an advocate for these retirees, NARFE not only ensures \nthat retirees receive the benefits that were promised to them but also \naims to improve future conditions for current Federal and civilian \nemployees. The years of experience on Capitol Hill and in Federal \nagencies have made NARFE a name respected by Members of Congress and a \nkey player in the Federal community.\n  Throughout my congressional career, NARFE offices across my State \nhave contacted me on numerous occasions urging me to support \nlegislation beneficial to those who helped strengthen our country over \nthe past decades. Its members have always been forthright in suggesting \nlegislative remedies for their problems--I appreciate that.\n  Again, I wish to extend my congratulations to all involved in making \nthis momentous occasion possible, and I look forward to working closely \nwith Chapter 0336 and other NARFE offices well into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11465-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11465-S11466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE AL NEUHARTH MEDIA CENTER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I would like to salute a great \nAmerican and South Dakotan, Mr. Al Neuharth. As the founder of USA \nToday, former chief executive officer of Gannett New Service, and \nfounder of the Freedom Forum, he has made immeasurable contributions to \nour understanding of the world.\n  Mr. Neuharth's commitment to free speech and the press began with a \npaper route in Eureka, SD, when he was 11 years old. Al continued to \nwork in local media throughout his youth, later in the composing room \nat the weekly Alpena Journal in neighboring Alpena. Following his \nservice in World War II, Al returned home to South Dakota, graduating \nfrom the University of South Dakota in 1950 with a degree in \njournalism.\n  Upon graduation, Al Neuharth began what would be a historic career in \nprint media. He began working for the Associated Press in Sioux Falls, \nSD, as a reporter and soon launched his first publication, a statewide \nweekly tabloid called SoDak Sports. While SoDak Sports would not prove \nto be his most successful venture, Mr. Neuharth pressed forward as a \njournalist. In 1954, he became a reporter at the Miami Herald, quickly \nascending the ranks, and in 1960 he was named assistant executive \neditor of the Detroit Free Press. This remarkable success demonstrates \nthat Al's talent for straight truth and love of communication was \nvisible to all who worked with him. In 1963, Neuharth began his career \nwith Gannett News Service as the general manager of its two Rochester, \nNY, newspapers. Only 7 years later he was named president and chief \nexecutive officer of Gannett News Service, a position he held until his \nretirement in 1989. Under Al's leadership, the company launched USA \nToday in 1980--the first national daily newspaper--and their reputation \nfor quality journalism has grown each year since.\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\n  Upon retiring from Gannett News Service, Al Neuharth founded the \nFreedom Forum in 1991 and has since dedicated his work to the pursuit \nof ``free press, free speech, and free spirit for all people.'' I have \nhad the pleasure of working with Al on many occasions and have seen his \ngenuine commitment to preserving free expression for all Americans.\n  In addition to his ongoing efforts to preserve free speech, Al \nNeuharth has also dedicated both time and treasure to his hometown of \nEureka, SD, and has never forgotten his South Dakota roots. Most \nnotably, he contributed greatly to the Eureka Information Center. This \ncenter houses community nonprofits and civic organizations, providing a \nspace for the involvement and dialogue that strengthens small towns.\n  On September 25, 2003, Mr. Neuharth's alma mater, the University of \nSouth Dakota, will dedicate its Al Neuharth Media Center. This center, \nfunded by the Freedom Foundation and the University Foundation, will \nhouse the Freedom Foundation's regional offices, South Dakota Public \nBroadcasting, the University's Department of Contemporary Media and \nJournalism, the Native American Journalists Association, the \nUniversity's publication The Volante, campus radio station KAOR and \ntelevision station KYOT.\n  Freedom of the press is an essential component of America's \nexperiment in democracy and one of the principal reasons the experiment \nhas succeeded. By training future journalists and defenders of the \nfirst amendment, the Neuharth Media Center will convey Al's passion for \nfree speech and help ensure that this great experiment in democracy \nwill be preserved for generations to come.\n  I am proud to honor Al Neuharth and the University of South Dakota \nNeuharth Media Center and proud to know Al Neuharth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11466-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR O'BANNON\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is my sad duty today to inform the \nSenate that the State of Indiana has lost its beloved Governor, Frank \nO'Bannon. He passed away on Saturday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital \nin Chicago, where he was being treated for a massive stroke suffered \nfive days earlier. He was 73 years old.\n  All of us in Indiana mourn the loss of this fine man, whose kind and \ngentle nature had won the hearts of so many Hoosiers over the years. \nFrank O'Bannon will always be remembered for the warmth and \nfriendliness that were essential elements of his character. He was a \ntrue Hoosier.\n  He and his wife, Judy, had been married 46 years and were part of a \nclose-knit family that includes their three children and five \ngrandchildren. Judy was at his side at the hospital when he passed \naway. I extend my deepest condolences to Judy, and I know she will draw \nstrength and support from her family and many dear friends.\n  I consider it a privilege to have known Frank O'Bannon. He grew up in \nSouthern Indiana in the town of Corydon during the 1940s, where he \nexperienced first-hand the special charm of that era captured so \nwonderfully in the movie Hoosiers. After graduating from Indiana \nUniversity in 1952, he served in the Air Force, went to law school and \nthen came home to settle down and work as a lawyer and publisher of \nweekly newspapers.\n  He was first elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1970 and went on \nto serve 18 years there--much of it as the Democratic floor leader. He \nwas Lieutenant Governor for 8 years before being elected Governor in \n1996 and then re-elected by a wide margin in 2000. He was an optimist \nby nature, a consensus builder and a man of absolute integrity. I \nalways looked forward to my visits with him. I will miss him greatly.\n  On Saturday, our Lieutenant Governor, Joe Kernan, was sworn in as \nIndiana's 48th Governor. He will serve the remainder of Governor \nO'Bannon's term, until January 2005.\n  Frank O'Bannon's remains will be buried near other family members in \na small cemetery in Corydon. He touched many people in his life. May he \nrest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11466-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11466-S11471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WITHDRAWAL OF THE ESTRADA NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this month the President withdrew \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Colombia Circuit. This was a nomination for a lifetime \nappointment to the second highest court in the land. The Constitution \naccords the Senate the duty to make informed judgments for these \nlifetime appointments to our Federal courts. Senators cannot make \ninformed judgments if the White House stonewalls the Senate.\n  This withdrawn nomination is another example of the White House's \ninsistence on dividing instead of uniting the American people over the \nPresident's decisions for the Federal courts. Ultimately, the \nnomination was a casualty of that divisive policy. For more than a \nyear, the White House has consistently spurned many private and public \nbipartisan appeals to resolve this matter by working with the Senate to \nprovide access to requested information. Mr. Estrada's work at the \nJustice Department was at the core of the administration's claims for \nhis qualification to serve on this court. Despite the questions raised \nabout his work at the Justice Department and the ample precedents from \nsimilar document requests involving earlier nominations, this \nadministration decided to stonewall the Senate. This stonewalling, \ncombined with Mr. Estrada's reluctance to answer substantively \nSenators' questions, prompted this impasse. The White House always had \nthe key to unlock this stalemate.\n  In the absence of cooperation from the White House, and with the \npersistence of the White House's stonewalling, Mr. Estrada has \nconcluded that this impasse will continue. He is probably right, and he \nand his family can now move on with their lives.\n  In the aftermath of the announcement on September 4, some Republican \nMembers of the Senate have come to the Senate floor and sought out the \nairwaves to renew their offensive and untrue rhetoric about this \nnomination. I must take a few moments to set the historical record \nstraight.\n  First, some Republicans have repeated their false assertion that \nDemocrats opposed Mr. Estrada's nomination because of his ethnicity. \nThat is absurd. In the last Congress, Senate Democrats swiftly acted to \nconfirm six Latino judicial nominees--Christina Armijo, NM; Judge \nPhillip Martinez, TX; Randy Crane, TX; Judge Jose Martinez, FL; \nMagistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, TX; and Jose Linares, NJ. During this \nCongress, Democrats have unanimously supported the confirmation of six \nother Latino judicial nominees--Edward Prado, Fifth Circuit; Consuelo \nCallahan, Ninth Circuit; S. James Otero, CA; Cecilia Altonaga, FL; \nXavier Rodriguez, TX; and Frank Rodriguez Montalvo, TX. All of these \nnominees received the unanimous support of the Senators in the \nDemocratic caucus.\n  Moreover, it was Democrats who worked to clear the nominations of \nJudge Prado and Judge Callahan to the circuit courts over delays and \ninitial objections from the Republican side of the aisle. Yet some \nRepublican Senators assert that those who opposed Mr. Estrada's \nconfirmation to the circuit court did so ``because he's Hispanic.'' \nThat is obviously false, demeaning and divisive.\n  These partisans may need to be reminded that, in addition to \nsupporting the confirmation of two other Latinos nominated to the \nappellate courts by President Bush, Democrats supported the appointment \nof 11 Latinos nominated by President Clinton to the appellate courts. \nIt was Republicans who blocked three of those Latino circuit court \nnominees of President Clinton. Those qualified and distinguished Latino \nnominees were never given hearings by the Republican majority and never \nallowed to come before the full Senate. They were not opposed through \ndebate and votes in the light of day; instead, their nominations were \nfilibustered and killed by delay, in the dark of night, without any \nmeaningful explanation of any substantive concerns about their \nnominations. This all begs the rhetorical question: Do the current \nRepublican charges mean that Republicans are anti-Hispanic for having \nblocked three Hispanic nominees to\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\nthe circuit courts and for having opposed, delayed and voted against \nnumerous others nominated by President Clinton? The facts are clear and \nthe facts are indisputable, and the facts belie the false charges that \nwe have heard from some on the other side of the aisle.\n  Republicans blocked three Latino nominees of President Clinton to the \nappellate courts from ever receiving a vote: Enrique Moreno, who was \nnominated to the 5th Circuit; Jorge Rangel, who was nominated to the \n5th Circuit; and Christine Arguello, who President Clinton nominated to \nthe 10th Circuit. In addition, Republicans refused to allow votes on \nthree of President Clinton's Hispanic district court nominees, Ricardo \nMorado, R. Samuel Paz, and Anabelle Rodriguez. Republicans did not \nallow a hearing or a vote in the Judiciary Committee or on the floor in \na cloture vote or confirmation vote on any of these six Latino \nnominees. I will include for the Record a letter from Judge Rangel, a \nwell-regarded nominee of President Clinton, who never received a \nconfirmation vote from the Republican majority at that time.\n  Republicans did not just block those six Latino judicial nominees of \nPresident Clinton from receiving votes, they also dragged their feet on \nthe confirmation of others who were left pending for a long time, often \nwithout any public statements identifying the concerns that were \ndelaying those nominees, in contrast to Mr. Estrada's nomination which \nhas been debated in the light of day. When they unsuccessfully \nfilibustered Judge Rosemary Barkett and Judge Richard Paez, were they \ndoing so because the nominees were Hispanic? When they delayed and \nopposed the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, do recent Republican \nstatements mean that they did so because she is Hispanic?\n\n  Overall, during President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 \nHispanic nominees were delayed or blocked from receiving hearings or \nvotes by Republican leaders. The Hispanic judicial nominees denied a \nvote by Republicans are Moreno, Rangel, Arguello, Morado, Paz, and \nRodriguez. The four Hispanic judicial nominees delayed but ultimately \nconfirmed over Republican opposition are Judges Richard Paez, a \nMexican-American nominated to the Ninth Circuit; Judge Hilda Tagle, a \nMexican-American nominated to the Texas district court; Judge Rosemary \nBarkett, an immigrant from Mexico nominated to the Eleventh Circuit; \nand Judge Sonia Sotomayor, whose family hails from Puerto Rico. Of \nthese 10, three waited more than 2 years to receive a vote or were \nnever accorded one. Republicans delayed consideration of the nomination \nof Judge Richard Paez for more than 1,500 days yes, that is correct, \nmore than 1,500 days and then when he finally did get a vote, 39 \nRepublicans voted against his confirmation to the Ninth Circuit. He was \nunsuccessfully filibustered by Republicans. Senator Sessions moved to \nindefinitely postpone the vote after we overcame the Republican \nfilibuster, after Judge Paez had been waiting for more than 4 years, \nand 31 Republicans voted with Senator Sessions on that motion after \ntheir filibuster failed. Of course, now Republicans have the temerity \nto assert that it is unprecedented to filibuster a circuit court \nnomination. What short memories they must believe the American people \nhave. I discussed this in more detail in the Congressional Record of \nFebruary 10, 2003.\n  The nomination of Judge Hilda Tagle to a District Court seat in Texas \nwas pending before the Senate for 943 days, before Republicans finally \nallowed her a vote on the floor of the Senate. After failing to defeat \nher nomination through anonymous delay, not a single Republican \nexplained the delay. Republican delays such as these on Clinton \nnominees are discussed in more detail in my statements published in the \nCongressional Record on May 1, 2003, as well as in statements about Mr. \nEstrada's nomination by Senator Reid, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer \nand others.\n  I hope these facts will finally put to rest the untruths that have \nbeen manufactured and perpetrated to attack those who opposed the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada. For Republicans to claim that those who \nopposed the Estrada nomination were motivated by anti-Hispanic \nsentiment is wrong. It is offensive, base and baseless. Indeed, I have \nspoken about the extensive opposition to the Estrada nomination from \nHispanic leaders and organizations. That opposition of Latino leaders \nfrom around the country who opposed the Estrada nomination included our \ncolleagues in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, CHC. According to the \nCHC scorecard, Mr. Estrada failed most of the factors for their \nevaluation of judicial nominees. Furthermore, Mr. Estrada told members \nof the Caucus:\n\n       [H]e has never provided any pro bono legal expertise to the \n     Latino community or organizations. Nor has he ever joined, \n     supported, volunteered for or participated in events of any \n     organizations. Nor has he ever joined, supported, volunteered \n     for or participated in events of any organization dedicated \n     to serving and advancing the Latino community. As an attorney \n     working in government and the private sector, he has never \n     made efforts to open doors of opportunity to Latino law \n     students or junior lawyers . . . [and] he never appealed to \n     his superiors about the importance of making such efforts on \n     behalf of Latinos.\n\n  These are just a few of the concerns raised by the Members of the \nCHC, which are detailed in several statements I have made, including my \nstatements in the Congressional Record on February 5, 2003; February \n10, 2003; February 24, 2003; February 25, 2003; as well as on July 30, \n2003.\n  Mr. Estrada was also opposed by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, PRLDEF, a national civil rights organization concerned \nwith advancing the civil and human rights of the Latino community. \nAfter interviewing Mr. Estrada, like the CHC, and also reviewing his \npublic record and his reputation, PRLDEF concluded that Mr. Estrada was \nnot sufficiently qualified for a lifetime seat on the nation's second \nhighest court and that, among other concerns about his poor temperament \nfor the job, ``he has not had a demonstrated interest in or any \ninvolvement with the organized Hispanic community or Hispanic \nactivities of any kind.'' Their letter was included in the \nCongressional Record and discussed on the dates I just noted. I also \nincluded for the Congressional Record, the serious concerns raised by \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, MALDEF, and \nCalifornia La Raza Lawyers, CLRL, which also opposed Mr. Estrada's \nconfirmation. They wrote:\n\n       [I]t is unclear whether he would be fair to Latino \n     plaintiffs as well as others . . . we found evidence that \n     suggests he may not serve as a fair and impartial jurist on \n     allegations brought before him in the areas of racial \n     profiling, immigration, and abusive or improper police \n     practices where those practices are adopted under a 'broken \n     window theory' of law enforcement . . . We have concerns \n     about whether he would fairly review standing issues for \n     organizations representing minority interests, affirmative \n     action programs or claims by low-income consumers. We are \n     also unsure, after a careful view of his record, whether he \n     would fairly protect labor rights of immigrant workers or the \n     rights of minority voters under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n  In the Congressional Record of February 24, 2003, I also included the \nannouncements of the opposition to this nomination by most of the past \nPresidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association. In the face of the \nfacts about our confirmation of a dozen Hispanic candidates nominated \nby President Bush to the circuit or district courts and the breadth and \ndepth of the opposition of most of the Latino civil rights groups, it \nis astonishing that Republicans continue to assert that those who \noppose Mr. Estrada's confirmation are anti-Hispanic. That is such an \noutright and obvious untruth. Yet we see some of these untruths \nrecycled again and again in news reports and commentaries, despite the \nfacts. These baseless allegations for purposes of wedge politics and \npartisan advantage are wrong and dangerous.\n\n  The facts are that of the 12 Latino appellate judges currently seated \non the Federal courts, eight were appointed by President Clinton and \ntwo, Judges Prado and Callahan, were nominated by President Bush and \nconfirmed with unanimous Democratic support. I discussed the problems \nwith the Estrada nomination in contrast to the nominations of Judge \nPrado and Judge Callahan in the Congressional Record of April 28, 2003 \nand May 22, 2003, respectively, as well as in contrast to less \ncontroversial district court nominees on March 27, 2003, March 31, \n2003, and May 6, 2003.\n  I have included in the record almost seven dozen editorials or \ncommentaries\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\nin opposition to the Estrada nomination or in support of the Democratic \nfilibuster. Those editorials were mentioned in the Congressional Record \non March 6, 2003, and April 2, 2003. At the end of my remarks today, I \nwill include excerpts from additional editorials and op-ed columns in \nopposition to the Estrada nomination or in support of the Democratic \nfilibuster of this nomination. In particular, I note the editorial of \nThe New York Times this week entitled, ``Straight Talk on Judicial \nNominees.''\n  On the issue of the history of the use of filibusters in connection \nwith nominations, some Republicans would now have the public believe \nthat a filibuster of a nominee is, in their words, ``unprecedented.'' \nThis is another deception. As some of these same Republicans well know, \nthey filibustered the nominations of Judge Paez and Judge Berzon on the \nfloor of the Senate in 1999 and 2000, as they conceded at that time. By \nway of example, I note that several Republicans currently serving voted \nagainst cloture, the motion to close debate, after the Paez nomination \nhad been pending before the Senate for more than four years. I have \nalready noted that even after losing the cloture vote, Republicans led \nby Senator Sessions moved to indefinitely postpone a vote on Judge \nPaez's nomination, and a number of Republican Senators currently \nserving voted to continue to block action on the Paez nomination in \n2000. Yet some Republican Senators now claim that it is unprecedented \nto filibuster or deny a circuit court nominee an up or down \nconfirmation vote on the Senate floor.\n  Their filibuster of Judge Paez's nomination is just one example of \nRepublican filibusters of Democratic nominees. Others include Dr. David \nSatcher to be Surgeon General in 1998; Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon \nGeneral in 1995; Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the Third Circuit in 1994; \nRicki Tigert to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1994; \nDerek Shearer to be an Ambassador in 1994; Sam Brown to an ambassador-\nlevel position in 1994; Rosemary Barkett, born in Mexico, nominated to \nthe Eleventh Circuit, 1994; Larry Lawrence, to be ambassador in 1994; \nJanet Napolitano at the Justice Department in 1993; and Walter \nDellinger to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Justice Department in 1993.\n  The nominations of Dr. Foster and Mr. Brown were successfully \nfilibustered on the Senate floor by Republicans. Similarly, the \nnomination of Abe Fortas by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States was successfully filibustered by Republicans \nwith help from some southern Democrats.\n  In addition, to the short-term and life-time appointees of Democrats \nwhose nominations were subject to sometimes fatal delay on the floor, \nRepublicans made an art form of killing nominations in Committee so \nthat they would never have a vote on the floor. According to the public \nrecord, more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were \ndefeated by willful refusal to allow them a vote and more than 200 \nexecutive branch nominees of President Clinton met the same fate, \nincluding several Latinos, with their nominations nixed in the dark of \nnight without any accountability. They were filibustered and never \nallowed a vote on the Senate floor. I discussed this history in more \ndetail on February 26, 2003, in the Congressional Record.\n  In addition, in the Congressional Record on March 5, 2003, March 11, \n2003, and March 13, 2003, I summarized the history of filibusters of \nnominees. I also spoke on May 19, 2003, about the history of Senate \ndebate and the constitutionality of Rule XXII of the Senate rules. The \nfact of the matter is that many nominees have been blocked from \nreceiving votes throughout the Senate's history. For example, 25 \nSupreme Court nominees were not confirmed in the history of our Nation. \nEleven of those nominations were defeated by delay, not by confirmation \nvotes on the Senate floor, including the nomination of Justice Fortas. \nSince the early 19th Century, nominees for the highest court and to the \nlowest short-term post have been defeated by delay, while others were \nvoted down. Not even all of President Washington's nominees were \nconfirmed or those of other presidents, often for political or \nideological reasons. Filibusters and other parliamentary tactics to \ndelay matters were known to the Framers. There was even a filibuster in \nthe first Congress over locating the capital.\n  The plain truth is that Democrats opposed the nomination of Mr. \nEstrada to the DC Circuit based on serious and legitimate concerns \nregarding the stonewalling of the Senate by this White House and this \nnominee. The DC Circuit is the nation's second most important court, \nbecause it has exclusive or special jurisdiction over a broad array of \nfar-reaching federal regulations, such as the rights to safe \nworkplaces, fair employment practices, clean air and water, and other \nimportant laws--areas with which Mr. Estrada had very little \nexperience.\n  Republicans lean heavily on the rating of the ABA, a group that \nRepublicans helped oust from the pre-nomination process and a group \nwhich ever since then has sometimes seemed overly eager to get back \ninto their good graces. Yet, as Senator Reid noted in the Congressional \nRecord in February and March of this year, there were \ncertainly irregularities in the rating given to this nominee by the \nAmerican Bar Association, with the person who recommended a well \nqualified rating working closely with the Bush administration on high-\nlevel appointments and co-founding the Committee for Justice to run \nattack ads against Democrats, while still serving on the ABA rating \ncommittee. Other nominees with similar records did not receive the high \nrating Mr. Estrada did, in this or past administrations. In fact, \npeople with similar records received partial not qualified ratings, \nwhen the process was conducted more fairly and with more candor, and \nwhen the candidate did not already have the imprimatur of the President \nthrough his nomination.\n\n  I would also note that before the hearing on the Estrada nomination, \nFederalist Society insiders gave a special seminar on how to get \nthrough the confirmation process and urged President Bush's judicial \nnominees to say as little as possible. Mr. Estrada appears to have \nfollowed those marching orders to a ``T'' and to his own detriment. \nDuring the hearing on his nomination he often refused to answer \nquestions or provided evasive answers. He declined to share his views \non important Supreme Court cases and his judicial philosophy. For \nexample, Senator Schumer asked Mr. Estrada to name a single case from \nthe entire history of Supreme Court law that he disagreed with, Mr. \nEstrada refused. He claimed he could not comment on any case if he had \nnot read the briefs, listened to oral argument, done independent \nresearch and conferred with colleagues.\n  Most who knew Mr. Estrada personally seemed to agree that he was \nactually a very opinionated person. He admitted in his testimony that \nhe could be ``ruthless'' in his criticism of legal and political \nopinions. Yet, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he would not \ndescribe those views and claimed to have no views he could or would \nshare with the only people entrusted with reviewing his record and \nrecommending his nomination for a lifetime job on the Federal bench.\n  Then Republicans even tried to assert that it would be unethical for \nMr. Estrada to answer questions by Senators. However, the Supreme Court \nheld in 2001 that it does not violate judicial ethics for judicial \ncandidates to comment on legal issues, as long as they do not promise \nhow they will rule. Ironically it was the Republican Party that had \nsued the State of Minnesota to ensure that their candidates for \njudicial office could give their views on legal issues without \nviolating judicial ethics, the State counterpart to the ABA model rule. \nRepublicans took the case all the way to the Supreme Court and won. In \nan opinion by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court ruled that the ethics \ncode did not prevent candidates for judicial office from expressing \ntheir views on cases or legal issues. Justice Scalia said that anyone \ncoming to a judgeship is bound to have opinions about legal issues and \nthe law, and there is nothing improper about expressing them. \nSpecifically, in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, 122 S. Ct. \n2528 (2002), the Supreme Court overruled ABA modeled restrictions \nagainst candidates for judicial office from expressing their views on \nlegal issues while seeking judicial office. Justice\n\n[[Page S11469]]\n\nScalia explained in that majority opinion:\n\n       Even if it were possible to select judges who do not have \n     preconceived views on legal issues, it would hardly be \n     desirable to do so. ``Proof that a Justice's mind at the time \n     he joined the Court was complete tabula rasa in the area of \n     constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of \n     qualification, not lack of bias.''. . . And since avoiding \n     judicial preconceptions on legal issues is neither possible \n     nor desirable, pretending otherwise by attempting to preserve \n     the ``appearance'' of that type of impartiality can hardly be \n     a compelling state interest either.\n\n  Id. at 2536 (quoting Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Laird v. Tatum, \n409 U.S. 824 (1972)).\n  Judicial ethical rules do not prevent Senators from learning about a \njudicial candidate's views. Senators are trying to evaluate whether a \nnominee should be given a lifetime position, and the Senate hearing \nroom should not be the only place where a judicial candidate cannot or \nwill not discuss his views of the law and his opinions.\n  Especially problematic was the stand taken by the administration on \nthe Senate's request to examine the memoranda written by Mr. Estrada at \nthe Justice Department. Because Mr. Estrada has no record and because \nhis impartiality was called into question by one of his direct \nsupervisors at the Justice Department, these memoranda would have \nprovided important insights into Mr. Estrada's approach to issues \ninvolving individual rights and the weight of precedent. I discussed \nthe precedent for this request in my remarks reprinted in the \nCongressional Record of February 5, 2003; February 12, 2003; February \n13, 2003; March 5, 2003; March 18, 2003; and May 8, 2003. Senator \nDurbin and Senator Kennedy also addressed this issue at length in their \nremarks. History makes clear that internal legal memos were requested \nand provided to the Senate in connection with, among others, the \nnominations of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, Brad Reynolds to be \nAssociate Attorney General, William Rehnquist to the Supreme Court, \nStephen Trott to the Ninth Circuit, and Ben Civiletti to be Attorney \nGeneral. In each of these appointments, internal legal memos to or from \nthe nominees were requested and provided to the Senate.\n  Basically, the Bush administration's response to our request has been \ncontemptuous from the beginning. The initial response of the Justice \nDepartment was that the request was unprecedented. That is abundantly \ninaccurate. This administration has itself shared White House Counsel \nrecords in connection with a nomination. There is simply no legal or \nhistorical basis for denying the Senate access to the memoranda \nrequested here. The historical precedent for the Senate's request \nactually supports it. Scores of legal memos to and from Robert Bork \nwhen he was Solicitor General were provided to the Senate during his \njudicial nomination. Walter Dellinger himself advised the Senate during \nJustice Rehnquist's judicial nomination when he reviewed memos provided \nto the Senate by the Justice Department which were written by and to \nRehnquist when he was the head of the Office of Legal Counsel. Indeed, \nthe long-standing policy of the Justice Department, prior to this \nadministration, regarding Congressional requests for memos and other \nnon-public information was a ``policy of accommodation.'' Former \nadministrations cooperated with countless requests for internal \ndocuments sought by Members of Congress as well as more recently by \nKenneth Starr, who sought and obtained documents containing the advice \nof the President's attorneys and closest advisors.\n  The administration also objected that some other Justice Department \nattorneys who have been nominated to other positions were not the \nsubject of memo requests. However, they fail to acknowledge that those \nnominees were not the subject of allegations by their supervisor of \nmany years that they could not keep their ideological views out of \ntheir memos and their work for the Department, unlike Miguel Estrada. \nThe fact that the Senate does not always request such memos does not \ndiminish its power to do so and the precedent to request such documents \nwhen Senators believe it is important to examine them. Indeed, the \nSenate would be abdicating its responsibilities to serve as a check on \nnominations if it had ignored the serious concerns raised about Mr. \nEstrada's writings before giving him a lifetime appointment as a judge \nwith immense power over the lives of all Americans. Mr. Estrada told \nthe Senate that he was proud of his writings and that he did not object \nto their being shared with the Senate but the administration refused \nevery attempt at compromise. Additionally, as Republicans readily \nadmitted when a Democrat was in the White House, it has been the long-\nstanding practice of the Senate not to recognize attorney-client, work-\nproduct, or deliberative process privilege claims.\n\n  As for the generic claim that people working for the federal \ngovernment in the Solicitor General's office would be chilled from \ncandidly expressing their views, it seems unlikely that Mr. Estrada was \nchilled by the revelation of legal memoranda during the Bork, \nRehnquist, Trott and Reynolds nominations in the few years before he \njoined the Solicitor General's office. Indeed, as the Supreme Court \nnoted in the Nixon tapes case, it is quite unlikely ``that advisors \nwill be moved to temper the candor of their remarks by the infrequent \noccasions of disclosure.'' U.S. v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 at 712, 1974. \nThus, while the desire for candor in the Executive Branch may be \nstrong, it is not an absolute right against disclosure in response to \nrequests from a co-equal branch pursuant to its express powers under \nthe Constitution.\n  In my previous statements on the floor of the Senate about the \ndocument request, I have put into the record numerous examples of legal \nmemos provided to the Senate by other administrations, so I will not \nlist them again. I will only say that it is clear to me and other \nSenators who have examined the record or remember the history that past \nrequests of the Senate for legal memos from the Justice Department were \nhonored, that many of these memos involved decisions about appealing \ncases or other significant legal or policy issues, that these memos \nwere written by line attorneys to the Solicitor General as well as by \nthe Solicitor General or Assistant Attorney General, that some memos \nwere provided on a confidential basis while others were made public and \nplaced in hearing records and other congressional documents, and that \nall these claims about this request being unprecedented are just so \nmuch false rhetoric. Congress was not required to stumble in the dark \nin connection with other nominations where memos were sought, and I am \nglad that the Senate did not cave in here, despite all of the attacks, \nintimidation and false claims the Bush administration and its allies \nhave made.\n  In sum, this administration treated the concerns of members of this \nco-equal branch with contempt at nearly every turn. As I stated at the \noutset of this debate, I would have welcomed a record on which I could \nhave had strong confidence about the type of judge Mr. Estrada would \nbe. Senators were denied adequate information to make an informed \njudgment about whether to entrust this nominee with the powerful \nposition to which he was nominated. As I mentioned in the Congressional \nRecord of July 30, 2003, it is regrettable that this Administration did \nnot choose to cooperate and act in good faith in this nomination and \ninstead sought to use this nominee as a pawn in its high stakes game of \nwedge politics. I am certain that this process must have been a \ndifficult one for Mr. Estrada and his family. It is too bad that White \nHouse and Justice Department advisors did not follow the approach they \ntook with another Bush nominee, Jeffrey Holmstead who was nominated to \nthe EPA, and whose White House Counsel's Office memos this very \nadministration shared with the Senate in order to accommodate the \nconcerns of Senators. Instead, the Administration ignored precedent and \ncommon sense in stonewalling the Senate, ignored the suggestions of \ncompromise by Republican and Democratic Senators, and chose the path \nand the tactics of unilateralism.\n  As I mentioned, earlier this year, on March 6, and April 2, 2003, I \nplaced into the record excerpts from 45 editorials and 34 op-eds in \nsupport of the position of Democratic Senators on the nomination of Mr. \nMiguel Estrada's nomination to the Court of the Appeals for D.C. \nCircuit, because Republicans had been asserting that there were only a \nfew editorials or op-eds in support of our concerns. Here are some \nexcerpts\n\n[[Page S11470]]\n\nfrom 14 additional editorials or op-eds expressing concerns about Mr. \nEstrada's nomination, bringing the total to nearly 100. This \ncontroversial nomination clearly divided, rather than united, the \nAmerican people. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nexcerpts of 11 recent editorials and 3 op-eds, as well as the New York \nTimes piece entitled ``Straight Talk on Judicial Nominees.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Straight Talk on Judicial Nominees, The New York Times, \n     September 10, 2003: ``When Miguel Estrada withdrew his \n     nomination for a federal judgeship last week, his backers \n     blamed anti-Hispanic bias. Republicans are regularly tossing \n     around such charges over judicial nomination setbacks, \n     calling them anti-Hispanic, anti-Catholic, anti-woman. But \n     these battles have been over ideology, and the scope of the \n     Senate's questioning of nominees. The name-calling is puerile \n     and divisive . . . [S]ome of the stiffest opposition to Mr. \n     Estrada . . . came from Hispanic leaders, including the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus. And while many Democratic \n     senators opposed Mr. Estrada, they have voted to confirm 12 \n     of President Bush's other Hispanic judicial nominees. The \n     Republicans' record is worse. In the Clinton era, they denied \n     confirmation votes to six Hispanic judicial nominees, and \n     delayed others for years. Jorge Rangel, who went 15 months \n     without a hearing on his federal appeals court nomination, \n     wrote to Senate Democrats last week to ask where Republican \n     senators' ``cry for diversity on the bench'' was when he was \n     forced to withdraw in 1998. . . . Diversity is not the only \n     issue on which Republicans are not talking straight. During \n     the Clinton administration, prominent Republicans argued that \n     there were too many judges on the District of Columbia \n     Circuit, and opposed Clinton nominees on the grounds that \n     confirming them would be a waste of tax dollars. But now that \n     a Republican president is nominating people like Mr. Estrada \n     to the court, these objections to its size have withered.''\n       No Tears Needed Over Estrada's Withdrawal, The Post-\n     Standard (Syracuse, NY), September 7, 2003: ``Conservatives \n     engaged in over-the-top condemnation of Estrada's opposition \n     after he resigned. Bush called Estrada's treatment \n     disgraceful. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., \n     called it a shameful moment in the history of this great \n     institution. Hardly. Never mind that conservatives have done \n     the same thing to liberal nominees. Estrada, however, was \n     secretive about his views, refusing to answer many questions \n     the Senate needed to evaluate him. The Senate wisely declined \n     to rubber-stamp him for such a key post. Also troubling was \n     the GOP claim that Democrats were anti-Hispanic for rejecting \n     Estrada. Fact is that most Hispanic leaders also rejected \n     Estrada, believing his views were too conservative and \n     detrimental to Hispanics, as well.''\n       Estrada Was a Bad Pick, Capital Times (Madison, WI), \n     September 5, 2003: ``When the president nominates responsible \n     conservatives to fill judicial vacancies, they are approved \n     with little trouble. When he nominates judicial activists who \n     put their politics above the law, however, they run into \n     trouble. That's what happened with Estrada. America has been \n     well served by the senators who blocked this bad \n     nomination.''\n       Estrada is Out: Perhaps Future Federal Judicial Nominees \n     Will Be More Cooperative, Omaha World Herald (Nebraska), \n     September 5, 2003: ``His refusal to discuss such basics as \n     his views of federalism vs. states, prerogatives, for \n     instance, was disturbing because it was virtually impossible \n     to assess his fitness for the job. It's unfortunate that his \n     legal practice and his family life were disrupted in such a \n     manner. . . . But senators concerned about the federal \n     judiciary could hardly do less when they knew so little about \n     him.''\n       Miguel Estrada Bows Out, The New York Times, (September 5, \n     2003: ``The Constitution requires not only the Senate's \n     consent but also its advice, and it is on this score that the \n     Bush administration has been most recalcitrant. The White \n     House has resisted Senate Democrats' requests to be brought \n     into the process earlier. If the administration insists on \n     having conservative ideologues choose its judicial nominees \n     in secret, it should not be surprised when Mr. Estrada, and \n     others like him, fail to be confirmed.''\n       Estrada Case Shows How Not to Nominate a Judge, Newsday \n     (New York), September 11, 2003: ``Bush should have advised \n     Estrada not to stonewall legitimate Senate inquiries. And \n     he should have allowed senators a look at Estrada's legal \n     writings from his time in the solicitor general's office. \n     Lacking any real sense of what Estrada thinks about the \n     legal issues of the day, senators were right to block his \n     appointment to the powerful U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia. Stealth nominees shouldn't \n     be rewarded with lifetime jobs on the federal bench. \n     Neither should nominees with ideologies outside the broad \n     mainstream of political thought, like the handful \n     currently being blocked, as Estrada was, by Democratic \n     filibusters.''\n       A Shame, But Nothing New, Columbus Ledger-Enquirer, \n     September 9, 2003: ``In fact, Congress has both the right and \n     the duty to advise and consent--not merely to obstruct, and \n     not merely to rubber-stamp. And maybe it shouldn't be enough \n     that a nominee is `qualified' in a nominal sense, if his or \n     her ideology or interpretation of the Constitution should \n     strike a lawmaker as outrageous or unconscionable.''\n       Bush Team Should Look In The Mirror, The Berkshire Eagle, \n     September 8, 2003: ``The White House can fume all it wants at \n     the Democrats whose Senate filibuster blocked the nomination \n     of Miguel Estrada to the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     Washington, D.C. but if it truly wants to find the source of \n     the blame for the failed nomination it should look in the \n     mirror. The Bush administration's penchant for secrecy, \n     contempt for the legislative branch of government and \n     determination to force radical justices onto the courts, \n     doomed the nomination from the start.\n       Some Judicial Picks Aren't Lightning Rods, San Antonio \n     Express-News, September 6, 2003: ``When presidents insist on \n     nominating strongly ideological candidates to the judiciary, \n     they provoke this kind of frustrating action. Republicans \n     bottled up a full 60 percent of President Clinton's nominees. \n     The Senate Judiciary Committee never voted on two of his \n     choices for the D.C. appeals court.''\n       Democrats Mustn't Allow Bush to Pack Courts With \n     Extremists, Charleston Gazette (West Virginia), August 10, \n     2003: ``As for the others, Democrats would be remiss in \n     exercising their ``advice and consent'' responsibility if \n     they did not block Pryor, Owen and Kuhl. All have records of \n     ideological extremism inconsistent with respect for tolerance \n     and diversity. . . . Republicans and Democrats share blame \n     for the rancorous standoff--one that the president has shown \n     no inclination to ameliorate despite suggestions that he \n     confer with the minority party, as other presidents have \n     done, to seek their advice on his candidates. The Democrats' \n     filibuster is our only hope that this administration won't \n     pack the courts with judges eager to reverse precedents that \n     reflect the American mainstream.''\n       When All Else Fails, Throw Mud, It Might Stick, Roanoke \n     Times & World News, August 6, 2003: ``When far-right \n     appellate candidate Miguel Estrada failed to get through, it \n     was a case of anti-Hispanic bias, they claimed. . . . The \n     charges might be humorous if not for their potential harm to \n     the public sphere. Most immediately, the threat is that they \n     would actually succeed in their purpose, mislead Americans \n     into an uproar and pressure Democrats to abandon opposition \n     for which they had valid reason: Each of the candidates had \n     either an extremist record or, in Estrada's case, little \n     record at all and no inclination to enlighten the Senate on \n     his views. Over the longer term, the danger is that repeated \n     false accusations such as these, however ludicrous, will \n     provoke ethnic and sectarian divisions as well as increase \n     cynicism among the many Americans already estranged from the \n     political process.''\n       Estrada's Dream Lost Out to King's, Mary Sanchez, Kansas \n     City Star, September 9, 2003: ``The cries from Senate \n     Republicans came quickly and were not so thinly veiled. \n     Appalled, several accused their filibustering colleagues of \n     bias against Hispanics. It is not that some members of the \n     Senate don't want Hispanic nominees. They just didn't want \n     this Hispanic nominee. The facts do not support the \n     accusation of bias.''\n       Bush's `Good Hispanic' Has Telling Record, Cindy Rodriguez, \n     Denver Post, September 5, 2003: ``Bush hoped the 38 million \n     Latinos across the country would cheer his pick. Bush's \n     people depicted Estrada as a humble immigrant from Honduras \n     who struggled, learned English, then made his way into \n     Columbia University, then Harvard Law School. That's what we \n     call una gran mentira. A big lie.''\n       Dem's Judicial Objections Valid, Richard J. Condon, Seattle \n     Post-Intelligencer, August 7, 2003: ``Miguel Estrada refused \n     to answer pertinent questions about his judicial philosophy \n     and the Bush administration refused to provide significant \n     background on Estrada's judicial work; Estrada has never \n     served as an appellate judge. Democrats rightly view that the \n     Senate cannot ``advise and consent'' to a nomination without \n     substantive information to support the nominees' \n     qualifications for the bench. Although Bush seems willing to \n     wait until after Estrada is confirmed to a lifetime \n     appointment to the federal appellate bench to measure his \n     qualifications, I agree with Senate Democrats that it is \n     prudent to get that issue resolved beforehand.''\n       In addition, there have been many dozen letters to the \n     editor submitted and published in opposition to editorials or \n     reports supporting the Republican position on this \n     nomination. Here is just a few recent examples of many \n     letters from across the country:\n       Scrutiny In Order, Amanda S. Mattingly, Argus Leader (Sioux \n     Falls, SD), May 29, 2003: ``In South Dakota, we would never \n     hire anyone for a job without an interview or an application. \n     That simply makes no sense. Yet, that is exactly what people \n     want done with Miguel Estrada. Estrada has failed to provide \n     the Senate with even the most basic information. A federal \n     judgeship is a lifetime appointment. That means they can't \n     ever be fired. It seems incredibly irresponsible to hire \n     someone for a lifetime job without knowing everything about \n     them.''\n       A Perfectly Appropriate Filibuster, George Immerwahr, \n     Christian Science Monitor (Boston, MA), September 9, 2003: \n     ``What was so bad about the Senate Democrats' filibuster to \n     deny Estrada's confirmation? Over the\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n     course of a four-year term, a president will submit a great \n     number of nominees to the Senate. Most of them are readily \n     confirmed by large majorities, some even with the unanimous \n     vote of each party. So when a nominee refuses, as this one \n     did, to answer key questions, the opposition party's use of \n     legitimate ways to reject him is far from improper.''\n       A Judicial Nominee, Derailed, Shirley Zempel, The New York \n     Times, September 6, 2003: ``Should our senators blindly vote \n     to approve a nomination without knowing all that they need to \n     know about him? I hope not. All information should be \n     available for scrutiny.''\n       A Judicial Nominee, Derailed, Harold House, The New York \n     Times, September 6, 2003: ``A more cynical view may be that \n     the Bush administration simply put Miguel Estrada forth \n     knowing that the combination of his views and the \n     stonewalling for information would cause the delay and \n     resultant fight. Could this have been nothing more than a \n     talking point in a Republican effort to fractionalize \n     Hispanic voters?''\n       Checks, Balances Fulfilled Objective, D.B. Decot, The \n     Arizona Republic, September 7, 2003: ``Our system was \n     deliberately designed to enable the minority to thwart the \n     tryanny of the majority as it deemed necessary. The Senate \n     gave its `advice' on Estrada; a sufficient number did not \n     `consent' to his lifetime appointment to the federal bench. \n     So the Bush administration has to go back to the drawing \n     board and nominate someone who is able to gain the \n     ``consent'' of at least 60 senators. Big deal. There are \n     plenty of qualified prospects who are not extremists, as \n     Estrada is.''\n       Schumer Made His Case, Carol Jigarjian, The Journal News \n     (Westchester County, NY), July 31, 2003: ``The Bush people \n     are still whining about delayed approval for federal judges \n     and promoting the canard that Estrada is being opposed \n     because he is Hispanic. Estrada is being opposed because, \n     during his hearings, he refused to answer questions about \n     whether his ideology would get in the way of the objectivity \n     required of a federal judge. Bush compounded the problem by \n     refusing to release information he has regarding Miguel \n     Estrada's judicial positions. Estrada's silence and Bush's \n     refusal to release pertinent and critical information on \n     Estrada's views raise justifiable suspicion that this is just \n     one more attempt by Bush to get a committed radical appointed \n     to a powerful lifetime position, under the radar.''\n       Uncover His Record, Evelyn J. Griesse, Argus Leader (Sioux \n     Falls, SD), June 11, 2003: ``Our justice system needs to be \n     filled with qualified judges who are at least comfortable \n     with having the public informed of their philosophy and \n     interpretation of the Constitution.

[Estrada] declines \n     to answer any questions about his legal philosophy. How can a \n     senator claim, in good conscience, to ``advise and consent'' \n     on an appointment when the candidate is a complete blank?

The \n     administration and its supporters should argue for their \n     nominees on the merits.\n       The House majority leader, Tom DeLay, called the effort to \n     defeat Mr. Estrada a ``political hate crime.'' Yet some of \n     the stiffest opposition to Mr. Estrada, who was nominated to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit, came from Hispanic leaders, including the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus. And while many Democratic \n     senators opposed Mr. Estrada, they have voted to confirm 12 \n     of President Bush's other Hispanic judicial nominees.\n       The Republicans' record is worse. In the Clinton era, they \n     denied confirmation votes to six Hispanic judicial nominees, \n     and delayed others for years. Jorge Rangel, who went 15 \n     months without a hearing on his federal appeals court \n     nomination, wrote to Senate Democrats last week to ask where \n     Republican Senators' ``cry for diversity on the bench'' was \n     when he was forced to withdraw in 1998.\n       Hispanic leaders did not oppose Mr. Estrada because he is \n     Hispanic. Catholic senators like Richard Durbin and Patrick \n     Leahy do not oppose William Pryor, a nominee to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, because he is \n     Catholic. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer do not \n     oppose Priscilla Owen, a nominee to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, because she is a woman. Mr. \n     Estrada would not answer Senators' questions. Mr. Pryor and \n     Ms. Owens have met resistance for their archconservative \n     views.\n       Diversity is not the only issue on which Republicans are \n     not talking straight. During the Clinton administration, \n     prominent Republicans argued that there were too many judges \n     on the District of Columbia Circuit, and opposed Clinton \n     nominees on the grounds that confirming them would be a waste \n     of tax dollars. But now that a Republican president is \n     nominating people like Mr. Estrada to the court, these \n     objections to its size have withered.\n       Charing discrimination may score political points, but the \n     confirmation of federal judges is too important to be treated \n     so cynically. Republican and Democratic senators know what \n     they are fighting over: legitimate disagreements over how to \n     interpret the Constitution and define the role of a federal \n     judge. They owe it to the American people to be honest about \n     their differences.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent to print the following \ncorrespondence from Jorge C.

I \n     enthusiastically welcomed the nomination and eagerly awaited \n     a hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the United States \n     Senate to have my qualifications reviewed. I patiently waited \n     for months, but I never received a hearing. My nomination \n     died when the Senate adjourned yesterday.\n       Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will \n     who agree to serve when asked to do so. But, public service \n     asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service \n     are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by \n     interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, \n     but it also has its limits.\n       Many friends and colleagues have urged me to stay in the \n     process by requesting that my name be resubmitted to the \n     Senate next year. Even if you were to decide to renominate \n     me, I have no reason to believe that the Senate would act \n     promptly on the nomination. I am not willing to prolong the \n     continued uncertainty and state of limbo in which I find \n     myself. As a professional, I can no longer postpone important \n     decisions attendant to my law practice.\n       Therefore, I would ask that you not resubmit my nomination \n     next year. There is a season for everything, and the time has \n     come for my family to get on with our lives and for me to get \n     on with my work.\n       Thank you for your trust and confidence in nominating me to \n     the Fifth Circuit. I pray that you will continue to recognize \n     and honor the diversity that is America, so that, one day, \n     our great country can realize its full potential.\n           Yours truly,\n     Jorge C.

Mr. President, in 1994, I supported legislation that \nPresident Clinton signed into law banning the production of certain \nsemiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. \nThe 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific weapons as well as a number \nof other weapons incorporating certain design characteristics such as \npistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash suppressors. \nThe 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the manufacture of \nsemiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\nof these military features and accept a detachable magazine. Pre-\nexisting military-style semiautomatic weapons were not banned. This law \nis scheduled to sunset on September 13, 2004.\n  Last week the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence released a report \nentitled ``Killing Machines: The Case for Banning Assault Weapons.'' \nThis report explains why assault weapons are the guns of choice for \ncriminals, and makes the case for renewing and strengthening the \nfederal assault weapons ban. Also last week, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica announced its support for the reauthorization of the assault \nweapons ban. Former Senator Howard Metzenbaum and Sonia Wills, mother \nof bus driver Conrad Johnson, the last victim of the Washington, DC-\narea sniper attacks, were joined by CFA and 25 state consumer, gun \nsafety, and public health advocates to announce the beginning of a \nyear-long effort to renew and strengthen the federal assault weapons \nban. I commend all of these individuals for their commitment to gun \nsafety, and I look forward to working with them and other gun safety \ngroups to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Feinstein introduced the Assault Weapons \nBan Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize this important piece \nof gun safety legislation. I am a cosponsor of this bill because I \nbelieve it is critical that we keep these weapons off the streets and \nout of our communities. If the law is not reauthorized, the production \nof assault weapons in the U.S. can legally resume. Restarting \nproduction of these weapons will increase their number and \navailability, and I believe lead to a rise in gun crimes committed with \nassault weapons.\n  Although President Bush has indicated his support for renewing the \nban, he has not yet taken action on its behalf. A spokesperson for \nHouse Majority Leader Tom Delay recently said, ``We have no intentions \nof bringing it up.'' I hope the President will take steps to urge the \nCongress to take up and reauthorize the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11472-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11472-S11473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AN AGROTERRORIST ATTACK--ARE WE PREPARED?\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need for \ngreater preparation to protect our agriculture from a terrorist attack.\n  After September 11, the President placed agriculture on the list of \ncritical infrastructure that deserved to be protected from an \nagroterrorist attack. Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nUSDA, has moved to improve our preparedness to prevent and respond to \nan attack upon our agriculture. The President's February 2003 \n``National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical \nInfrastructures and Key Assets'' also outlines a strategy for \nincreasing our ability to react to an agroterrorist attack. Yet, we \nstill have a long way to go in protecting our agriculture industry.\n  There has been a steady drumbeat of warnings about the vulnerability \nof our agriculture. Two major studies were recently released that \nconcluded we should do more to guard our agriculture. The Council on \nForeign Relations, CFR, published a report on our emergency response \ncapability that said we lacked an effective response to an attack on \nour national food supply. The report recommended spending an additional \n$2.1 billion over the next 5 years to improve our ``animal/\nagricultural'' emergency response.\n  On the heels of the CFR report, the Partnership for Public Service \nissued a study that examined whether the Federal Government has the \nnecessary expertise to defend against a bioterrorist attack. In regards \nto agricultural security, it said that federal agencies responsible for \nsafeguarding our agriculture and food supply from bioweapons would face \n``crushing burdens'' if our food and water supplies were contaminated.\n  These are just the most recent reports that recommend we need to do \nmore to increase our guard. Last fall, the National Academy of Sciences \npublished a major study on vulnerability of U.S. agriculture. The \nGeneral Accounting Office, GAO, has issued three reports in the last \nyear that looked at food processing security, foot and mouth disease, \nand mad cow disease. All suggested that we still have a way to go to \nprevent or prepare for an attack on our agriculture.\n  An attack on our agriculture could have serious consequences. \nAgricultural activity accounts for approximately 13 percent of the U.S. \ngross domestic product and nearly 17 percent of domestic employment. \nThe United States is a top producer and exporter of agricultural goods, \nincluding beef, pork, poultry, wheat, corn and soybeans. Major \nagricultural States could be severely affected depending on the nature \nof the attack.\n  States with large cattle herds could be devastated by a deliberately \nset outbreak of foot and mouth disease. There were over 96 million \ncattle and calves in the United States valued at some $70 billion in \n2003. Texas has the largest number by far, 14 million animals, and \ncould be particularly hard hit. In 2001, the cattle industry generated \n$6.8 billion in income for Texas. The breeding herd of beef cows is \nparticularly concentrated in Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, \nNebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas, with each State \nhaving have more than a million head of beef cows.\n  Dairy States could also suffer. The United States has over nine \nmillion milk cows that produce almost $25 billion in income. California \nand Wisconsin are the largest producers. Both have more than a million \nmilk cows that yield close to $8 billion in income. But a number of \nStates--Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Texas, and Washington each have more than 200,000 cows, \ncontributing substantially to their economies.\n  Hog-raising States also could be vulnerable to the spread of foot-\nand-mouth disease, or to an outbreak of African swine fever. The United \nStates had almost 60 million hogs and pigs valued at over $4 billion \ndollars in 2002. Iowa has the largest industry with more than 15 \nmillion animals valued at over a billion dollars. North Carolina is \nnext with some 9.6 million animals valued at a half a billion dollars. \nTen additional States have substantial industries with more than a \nmillion animals: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, \nNebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota.\n  States with large poultry industries are vulnerable to Exotic \nNewcastle Disease or avian influenza. In 2002, 14 States had flocks of \nover 15 million birds each: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, \nGeorgia, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Iowa alone has over 40 million \nbirds valued at over $64 million.\n  Crops, such as wheat, could also be a target. A purposeful spread of \nthe Karnal bunt wheat fungus could have a strong adverse impact on U.S. \nexports. The United States is the world's leading exporter of wheat, \naccounting for almost one-third of world wheat exports valued at over \n$3.5 billion in 2002. Since almost 80 countries do not allow Karnal \ninfected wheat to be imported, a ban on U.S. exports could have a \nsubstantial effect on the U.S. economy. The Economic Research Service \nof the USDA estimated that the total cost of a reduction of exports \nfrom 2003 to 2007 could be over $7 billion if there was such a ban. The \ntop wheat-producing States--Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, \nSouth Dakota, Texas, and Washington--would be particularly hard hit.\n\n  I have been concerned about the vulnerability of our agriculture for \nquite some time. When I was a member of the House Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I was a supporter of the USDA's Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service, APHIS. APHIS plays a critical role in \nguarding our borders and farms from agricultural pests and diseases, \nsomething that is of prime importance to Hawaii. As a Senator, I \ncontinue to be concerned about this problem. In the 107th Congress I \nintroduced a bill to enhance agricultural biosecurity in the United \nStates.\n  In this Congress, I have introduced two bills that will help address \nour shortcomings in agricultural security preparedness. The Agriculture \nSecurity Assistance Act, S. 427, and Agriculture Security Preparedness \nAct, S. 430, are designed to address the need for increasing \ncoordination in confronting the threat to America's agriculture \nindustry. The two bills provide for better funding and better-\ncoordinated response to an incident of agroterrorism. The bills will \nalso serve to increase our defenses against debilitating agroterrorism \nattacks.\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\n  The Agriculture Security Assistance Act is primarily aimed at \nassisting States and communities in responding to threats to the \nagriculture industry. The legislation will provide funds for \ncommunities and States to increase their ability to handle a crisis. It \nalso will help animal health professionals to participate in community \nemergency planning activities to assist agriculturists in strengthening \ntheir defenses against a terrorist threat.\n  The Agriculture Security Preparedness Act will enable better \ninteragency coordination thereby enhancing agriculture security. The \nlegislation will establish senior level liaisons in Departments of \nHomeland Security, DHS, and Health and Human Services, HHS, to \ncoordinate with USDA on agricultural disease emergency management and \nresponse. The bill requires DHS and USDA to work with the Department of \nTransportation to address the risks associated with transporting \nanimals, plants, and people between and around farms.\n  Recently Mother Nature has provided warnings of the costs and dangers \nof a possible agroterrorist attack. In May, Canadians discovered that \nan 8-year-old cow that had been killed in January was infected with mad \ncow disease. The same disease affected cattle in Britain in the 1980s \nand 1990s leading to a slaughter of over 3.7 million animals.\n  Canada faced an enormous adverse economic impact due to the discovery \nof the mad cow disease. Canada's cattle industry generates $7 billion \nin cattle sales and the industry remained paralyzed during the period \nimmediately following the discovery of the disease. Major importers of \nCanada's beef, like the United States, Mexico, Japan and Australia, \ntemporarily halted their imports causing almost $8 million a day loss \nto the cattle industry. The news also affected companies like \nMcDonald's, Wendy's, and Tyson Foods.\n  Canada acted to control the spread of the disease by quarantining \nherds of suspected cattle and slaughtering them to test for the \npresence of the disease. All the herds believed to have come in contact \nwith the infected cow were quarantined and killed for medical \nexamination. More than 2,700 Canadian cattle were slaughtered and \neighteen farms were quarantined in the process of determining the \ndisease's source and to control the spread of the disease.\n  In the United States, the southwest poultry industry has been beset \nby a costly outbreak of Exotic Newcastle Disease, END, since last fall. \nThe outbreak was first detected in a backyard chicken flock in Los \nAngeles County in early October 2002. It then spread to Nevada, Arizona \nand Texas. Over the past months, some 25 countries including the \nEuropean Union have put embargoes on chicken from affected areas. In \nTexas, where the poultry industry employs about 15,000 people and is \nranked sixth in the Nation, the industry said it could lose about $100 \nmillion as a result of the embargoes. In California, State officials \nordered the destruction of more than 3 million birds, enforcing a \nquarantine over a wide area. The outbreak in 2002 and 2003 cost the \nstate almost $100 million to control the spread of the disease.\n  We all know an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The \nNation's capability to counter agroterrorism is increasing. But \nagriculture's central importance to our country suggests greater \nefforts are needed. As the recent cases of Mad Cow and Exotic Newcastle \ndisease dramatically demonstrate, the consequences of a lack of \npreparedness could be quite high. Containing these naturally occurring \ndiseases was costly and it involved extensive coordination. It could be \nmuch more difficult to counter a deliberate attack. The two bills I \nhave introduced will help us to act now so that a future agroterrorist \nattack can be avoided, or dealt with rapidly before it can get out of \nhand. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11473-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE HARNEY LITTLE LEAGUE SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to publicly command \nRobert Duxbury of Wessington, SD, on his selection as one of South \nDakota State University's Eminent Farmers for 2003.\n  The Eminent Farmer and Homemaker Program, which was honored nominees \nsince 1927, seeks farmers who have not only made significant \ncontributions to their community, State and Nation, but have also given \nunselfishly of their talent, time and leadership to public programs, \neducational institutions, and church.\n  Bob has earned the respect and admiration of all those who have had \nthe opportunity to work with him. His love for South Dakota and passion \nfor agriculture set him apart from other outstanding farmers in the \nState. Bob's friendly demeanor and wealth of knowledge have helped him \ndevelop close relationships in various agriculture groups, including \nthe South Dakota 4-H Leaders Association and the State Fair Board. Bob \nhas also served South Dakota in additional capacities: as a member in \nthe South Dakota Legislature in both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives; as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee for \nnearly 20 years; and as South Dakota secretary of agriculture from 1975 \nto 1978. Furthermore, after earning a degree from South Dakota State \nCollege, Bob used his extensive agriculture know-how to teach animal \nscience and coach livestock-judging teams from 1956 to 1959.\n  Americans are the envy of the world because we enjoy the most \naffordable and the safest food, spending only 10 percent of our \nhousehold income on groceries. Agricultural producers in the U.S. must \ncope with the unpredictability of the weather, markets, and government \npolicy, yet time and time again they are the most productive and \nefficient in the entire world. Farming and ranching families provide \nimmeasurable contributions to quality of life, economic development, \nand the culture of rural America. Farmers and ranchers are the backbone \nof South Dakota's economy and should be commended for what they do.\n  This prestigious honor is a reflection of Bob's extraordinary success \nas a farmer, as well as his commitment to conservation, and \ncontributions to the community. I am proud to claim Bob as a good \npersonal friend and former colleague in the South Dakota legislature. I \nam pleased that his agricultural leadership is being publicly \nrecognized, and that his achievements will serve as a model for \noutstanding agricultural producers throughout the state to emulate.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the Volunteers of America, Dakotas in South \nDakota, which celebrated its 80th anniversary celebration in August, \n2003.\n  Volunteers of America, Dakotas is one of over forty affiliates making \nup a national network of nonprofit, spiritually based organizations \nproviding local human service programs and creating opportunities for \nindividual and community involvement. Nationally, Volunteers of America \nemploys more than 11,000 people and each year more than 1.5 million \npeople feel the helping hand of this organization.\n  Began in the early 1920s, Volunteers of America, Sioux Falls was \nstarted as a prison ministry by Frank and Emma Tremont. However, the \nconcerns of the couple were expanded when, during World War I, men went \nto war and women went to work, and childcare became a pressing need. In \nresponse, the organization opened a childcare center and soup kitchen. \nOver the years, the soup kitchen and prison ministry faded away, but \nquality childcare remained a service priority. It was the recent merger \nof this organization with another group, Turning Point, that formed \nVolunteers of America, Dakotas. Started as Project Threshold on \nSeptember 16, 1972, Turning Point's original vision was a home for \ndelinquent and runaway girls. Over its next 20 years, Project Threshold \nbecame a widely recognized leader in adolescent issues, treatment, and \nprevention services, Together, these two associations are now assisting \nmore than 290 children each day.\n  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge all of the Volunteers \nof America-Dakotas Centers in South Dakota, including the Bollinger \nCenter, Joe Foss School, Whittier Middle School, Thrift Store, and \nother Centers in Sioux Falls, SD; the Native Hope Center in Sisseton, \nSD; and the Volunteers of Americas, Dakotas Center in Aberdeen, SD. \nHeadquartered in Sioux Falls, Volunteers of America, Dakotas serves \nover 12,000 individuals of all ages each year. Their mission, which is \nto assist people of all ages in stepping toward a brighter future, is \none that all South Dakotans should strive to live by.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the Volunteers of \nAmerica-Dakotas for its 80 years of outstanding service. People of all \nages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work \ntogether at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our \ntowns and neighborhoods.

Mr. President, on Friday night, John McKissick, \nof Summerville, SC, won his 500th victory as the head coach of the \nSummerville Green Wave high school football team, and this Senator \nrises to congratulate this towering giant of coaches.\n  I want to put this in perspective. That is almost 100 more victories \nthan Eddie Robinson, the winningest coach ever in college football, had \nat Grambling and Leland. That is 170 more victories than Don Shula, the \nwinningest coach ever in the NFL had with the Miami Dolphins and \nBaltimore Colts. This is a record that not Bear Bryant, not Woody \nHayes, not Tom Landry, not Vince Lombardi, not any coach--pro, college, \nor high school has ever come close to ever seeing.\n  He started coaching in 1952, 2 years before Strom Thurmond entered \nthe Senate, 14 years before I came, and now he'll outlast us both. In 5 \ndecades at Summerville High School, he has 10 State championships and \n26 regional titles under his belt; and many of the 3,000 teenagers he \nhas coached went on to win scholarships at colleges across the country. \nIn this time, he has had only two losing seasons, and he has never \nmissed a game. Most of all, he has kept his priorities straight: \neducation first, football second.\n  In my part of the country, John McKissick is a legend. I know all my \nfootball-fanatic colleagues join me in saying to John: you're a \nnational legend, too. You have done more for the sport of high school \nfootball than any person in the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11474-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING LAIRD LARSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nLaird Larson, a farmer near Clark, SD, on his selection as one of South \nDakota State University's Eminent Farmers for 2003.\n  The Eminent Farmer and Homemaker Program, which has honored nominees \nsince 1927, seeks farmers who have not only made significant \ncontributions to their community, State and Nation, but have also given \nunselfishly of their talent, time and leadership to public programs, \neducational institutions, and church.\n  Laird has earned the respect and admiration of all those who have had \nthe opportunity to work with him. His love for South Dakota and passion \nfor agriculture set him apart from other outstanding farmers in the \nstate. Laird's friendly demeanor and wealth of knowledge have helped \nhim develop close relationships in various agriculture groups, \nincluding the South Dakota Crop Improvement Association, Northeast \nResearch Farm Advisory Board, and South Dakota FFE Foundation Board. \nLaird has also worked to raise funds for renovation South Dakota State \nUniversity greenhouses and is currently working to develop a seed \nscience center at South Dakota State University.\n  Americans are the envy of the world because we enjoy the most \naffordable and the safest food, spending only 10 percent of our \nhousehold income on groceries. Agricultural producers in the United \nStates must cope with the unpredictability of the weather, markets, and \ngovernment policy, yet time and time again they are the most productive \nand efficient in the entire world. Farming and ranching families \nprovide immeasurable contributions to quality of life, economic \ndevelopment, and the culture of rural America. Farmers and ranchers are \nthe backbone of South Dakota's economy and should be commended for what \nthey do.\n  This prestigious honor is a reflection of Laird's extraordinary \nsuccess as a farmer, as well as his commitment to conservation, and \ncontributions to the community. I am pleased that his agricultural \nleadership is being publicly recognized, and that his achievements will \nserve as a model for outstanding agricultural producers throughout the \nState to emulate. It is with great honor that I share his impressive \nachievements with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11474-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11474-S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JAMES D. BENNETT, JR.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James \nD. Bennett, Jr., an outstanding public servant who is retiring after a \ndistinguished career spanning more than 34 years as a firefighter in \nthe capital city of Providence, RI.\n  James Bennett began his career as a Providence firefighter in August \nof 1968, quickly rising through the ranks becoming lieutenant in \nDecember of 1977, captain in February of 1984, and ultimately he was \npromoted to the coveted rank of battalion chief in April of 1986.\n  Chief Bennett's illustrious career has been marked with a special \ndedication to his brethren firefighters, and to seeking out leadership \nopportunities and specialized training for himself and the department. \nHe completed numerous Federal, State, municipal and professional \nassociation training programs, courses and workshops on fire and safety \nissues. A member of the Fire Department Safety Officers Association and \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, he served from 1977 to 1982 \nas president Providence Local 99 of the International Brotherhood of \nFirefighters.\n  As a community and as a Nation, it is most fitting that we pause to \nreflect upon the contribution of those in our society from whom we ask \nso much. With selflessness, dedication and great personal sacrifice \nfirefighters answer the call each and every day, putting themselves in \nharm's way to protect\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\nand defend lives and property of our citizens. With courage, compassion \nand devotion to duty they epitomize the phrase ``public servant.'' \nIndeed, I am honored to humbly recognize this noble profession and this \noutstanding individual, Chief James Bennett, on the occasion of his \nretirement.\n  I ask that you join me in paying tribute to Chief Bennett on this \nmilestone and ask that you also recognize his devoted wife Kaiji who \nthis June retired from her own career as an elementary school secretary \nafter many years of loyal service. As a grateful community we recognize \nthe immense contributions made by people like James and Kaija Bennett \nto the cherished quality of life in this great Nation.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to antiterrorism funding; to \n     the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, The heinous terrorist attacks on the World Trade \n     Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, have deeply \n     impacted the fabric of American life, provided a wakeup call \n     to every American's awareness of the nation's vulnerability \n     to terrorists attacks, and changed Americans' lives forever; \n     and\n       Whereas, Californians are gravely concerned about the \n     continued threat of violence and their own personal safety; \n     and\n       Whereas, The takeover of airplane flights by unconscionable \n     terrorists has increased the need for security by state and \n     local governments at all airports and public facilities, \n     including water systems, hospitals, bridges, and dams; and\n       Whereas, Recent horrific incidents of sending anthrax \n     through the mail, other threats of bioterrorism, and hoaxes \n     have increased demands upon public services, including public \n     health departments and laboratories, public safety and fire \n     protection agencies, hospitals, and emergency rooms, and \n     state and local emergency response agencies; and\n       Whereas, City and county governments have experienced an \n     increased awareness and demand from the general public for \n     more public services in the area of public health and safety; \n     and\n       Whereas, Cities and counties have appropriated millions of \n     dollars for increased response and preparedness for potential \n     terrorist threats and anticipate the need for additional \n     funds to continue these efforts; and\n       Whereas, In this period of economic uncertainty and \n     unprecedented need for enhanced local public safety and \n     health services, cities and counties cannot afford these \n     increased costs of security without additional funding; and\n       Whereas, There may be continued terrorism activities in \n     California. For example, in San Diego County investigations \n     revealed that some of the hijackers of September 11, 2001, \n     were training in San Diego training facilities in preparation \n     for the attacks; and\n       Whereas, Public safety officials require specialized \n     training at all levels and local governments have seen an \n     increased demand for additional personnel to effectively \n     protect and serve citizens in the event of a major local \n     incident; and\n       Whereas, Hazardous material teams lack the specialized \n     equipment and protective gear to deal with bioterrorism and \n     new public health threats; and\n       Whereas, Due to the continued bioterrorism threats and \n     hoaxes, public health departments need additional staff to \n     increase their surveillance activities for the identification \n     of biological and chemical threats at the earliest possible \n     stage; and\n       Whereas, Local health departments are the early warning \n     system in the defense against bioterrorism; local health \n     departments rely on strong linkages with other county \n     agencies including emergency medical services, hospitals, \n     county outpatient services, laboratories, mental health \n     departments, and environmental health agencies in preparing \n     for and responding to disasters; and\n       Whereas, The budgets of many public health departments have \n     been neglected for several years, and in order to assure an \n     adequate response, if necessary, to any potential \n     bioterrorism threat, public health infrastructure needs \n     significant investment of state and federal resources. For \n     example, Orange County has identified the need for $2.1 \n     million for public health infrastructure and training in \n     order for their public health system to respond to a public \n     health crisis; and\n\n[[Page S11476]]\n\n       Whereas, Local governments have already encountered budget \n     overruns of 13 percent in public safety, with the City of Los \n     Angeles alone incurring security costs in excess of $11 \n     million in the first two and one-half months following \n     September 11, 2001; and\n       Whereas, Santa Clara County alone has already appropriated \n     $5 million for additional public safety services since \n     September 11, 2001, and expects to spend an additional $7 \n     million by June 30, 2002; and\n       Whereas, Cities and counties estimate over $1 billion in \n     additional one-time and ongoing funding needs and the State \n     of California anticipates expenditures of at least $500 \n     million in 2002; and\n       Whereas, Local governments and the state are financially \n     suffering from an economic recession and lack the funds to \n     provide the required additional services and equipment; and\n       Whereas, Congress has approved a total of $8.3 billion for \n     homeland defense in the emergency supplemental allocation \n     sent to the President for his signature; and\n       Whereas, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Senator \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York have together proposed \n     supplemental federal funding to assist state and local \n     governments in security, prevention, and preparedness; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to enact legislation to provide \n     funds to states and local governments to provide the \n     necessary security and relief measures to protect local \n     citizens from terrorism; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, and to each Senator and Representative \n     from California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-259. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Jersey relative to increasing \n     the minimum allotment for the Food Stamp Program; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, The minimum monthly allotment for one-person and \n     two-person households under the federal Food Stamp Program is \n     currently $10, which is the same amount as was established by \n     the ``Food Stamp Act of 1977''; and\n       Whereas, The amount of food that could be purchased in 1977 \n     for $10 costs $29.19 in 2001; the amount of food that can be \n     purchased in 2001 for $10 only cost $3.43 in 1977; and\n       Whereas, The ``Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger \n     Relief Act,'' which was enacted in 1990, amended the Food \n     Stamp Act to annually adjust the minimum monthly allotment, \n     with the result rounded to the nearest $5, in accordance with \n     annual adjustments to other elements of the Food Stamp \n     Program; and\n       Whereas, The ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996'' amended the Food Stamp Act to \n     remove the provision for annual adjustments to the minimum \n     monthly allotment; and\n       Whereas, Annual cost-of-living adjustments are currently \n     made to maximum monthly allotments and income eligibility \n     standards for the Food Stamp Program; and\n       Whereas, The maximum monthly income, minus deductions \n     allowable within the program, for eligibility for the Food \n     Stamp Program is $696 for one-person households and $938 for \n     two-person households; one-person households with a monthly \n     income between $400 and $696 and two-person households with a \n     monthly income between $760 and $938 are eligible for no more \n     than the $10 minimum monthly allotment; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This House urges the Congress of the United States to \n     increase the minimum monthly allotment for one-person and \n     two-person households under the federal Food Stamp Program \n     from $10 to $25 and require that the minimum be adjusted \n     annually in accordance with changes in the federal cost-of-\n     living.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary of \n     the Senate, shall be forwarded to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, the presiding officers of the Congress of the \n     United States and each member of New Jersey's Congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-260. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to stronger \n     protections for Lake St. Clair, the Heart of the Great Lakes; \n     to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 131\n\n       Whereas, By any measure, Lake St. Clair is a critical \n     component of the Great Lakes system. It is the source of \n     drinking water for millions of Americans and Canadians and a \n     vital element of the region's commercial, recreational, and \n     transportation resources; and\n       Whereas, Even within the Great Lakes network, Lake St. \n     Clair is unique in its value through its wetlands, its great \n     variety of fish and plant species, and the range of habitats \n     it holds. It is an unsurpassed treasure for boaters and \n     anglers; and\n       Whereas, In spite of its clear importance to the health of \n     millions of people and the quality of the water system that \n     is the most valuable in the world, Lake St. Clair has been \n     harmed by several environmental problems, including spills, \n     beach closings, and invasive species. Resources to address \n     all of these needs are badly needed; and\n       Whereas, Congress is considering a measure, House \n     Resolution 121, which calls for increased efforts to protect \n     Lake St. Clair and affirms the central role that it plays as \n     the Heart of the Great Lakes. Clearly, this is a designation \n     that is appropriate not only because of Lake St. Clair's \n     shape and location, but also because of its commercial, \n     environmental, and recreational significance to our nation; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the State, That we memorialize Congress to \n     adopt House Resolution 121 to endorse stronger protections \n     for Lake St. Clair, the Heart of the Great Lakes; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-261. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislative \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Protect Children from \n     E-Mail Smut Act of 2001; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, A 2000 sample survey of 1,501 of the nearly 24 \n     million school-aged children regularly using the Internet in \n     the United States found that approximately one out of every \n     four children in that sample had experienced unwanted \n     exposure to sexual images while on-line; and\n       Whereas, The development of the Internet is widely regarded \n     as the most profound change in the way people communicate \n     since the invention of the printing press, but as remarkable \n     as it may be, there are risks to children that are unique to \n     such a pervasive and accessible medium; with the development \n     of newer and increasingly invasive technologies that can \n     deliver or disguise unwanted material through direct \n     marketing e-mails, or ``span'' mailings, the risks are even \n     more pronounced and difficult to detect; and\n       Whereas, Compounding the challenge of protecting minors \n     from inappropriate material on-line is the fact that children \n     often understand more about the Internet than their parents, \n     teachers, and other caregivers; in addition, common sense \n     measures used to secure a child's environment and the \n     ``physical world'' are not feasible in cyberspace; and\n       Whereas, In a bipartisan effort to address these concerns, \n     congress passed the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) \n     and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and, in doing so, \n     criminalized Internet transmission of indecent materials to \n     minors; however, the Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that certain \n     provisions of the CDA were unconstitutional and in 2002 \n     upheld a district court's temporary injunction against \n     enforcement of COPA on the same grounds; and\n       Whereas, Recognizing the need to make children's on-line \n     experiences safe, educational, and entertaining while \n     honoring constitutional safeguards, the 107th Congress is \n     considering legislation that would address specific questions \n     posed by the Supreme Court without discouraging the evolution \n     of the Internet or violating the First Amendment; and\n       Whereas, Modeled after existing law that regulates the \n     identification of sexually explicit advertisements sent via \n     U.S. mail, House Resolution 2472 requires the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology to prescribe an \n     electronic tag that would identify sexually oriented messages \n     and allow parents to use the filtering tools already \n     available on e-mail programs to block messages bearing the \n     tag; the legislation is a balanced and realistic solution to \n     the complexities of protecting free speech and children on-\n     line; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     enact the Protect Children From E-Mail Smut Act of 2001; and, \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Secretary of State forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and all the members of the Texas delegation to the \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-262.

L. No. 87-525 authorized the \n     construction of an international bridge across the Rio Grande \n     to join Heath Canyon in Texas with the village of La Linda, \n     Coahuila, Mexico, for the purpose of transporting refined ore \n     into the United States from nearby mills in Mexico and to one \n     day facilitate the movement of tourists interested in \n     visiting the Sierra del Carmen mountain areas across from Big \n     Bend National Park; and\n       Whereas, Since the bridge was constructed, the Texas \n     Department of Transportation has, without interruption, \n     maintained Farm-to-Market Road 2627 as a paved two-lane \n     highway for a 28-mile stretch connecting the bridge to United \n     States Highway 385, which leads from that junction southward \n     to Big Bend National Park and northward 40 miles to Marathon \n     and United States Highway 90; and\n       Whereas, La Linda Bridge, also known as the Hallie \n     Stillwell Memorial Bridge, is still in place and is in good \n     repair but cannot be crossed by vehicles or pedestrians \n     because of barriers and the placement of ``no trespassing'' \n     signs at the bridge since 1997 pursuant to orders issued by \n     the governments of the United States of America and the \n     Republic of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, The La Linda international crossing is the only \n     bridge structure in place and the only point of entry \n     authorized by public law between the United States ports of \n     entry at Presidio and Del Rio, a distance of 385 miles; and\n       Whereas, The principal owner of the United States section \n     of the international bridge at La Linda, the National Parks \n     Conservation Association, is prepared to donate its interest \n     in the bridge and associated properties to the State of Texas \n     through the General Land Office so that the bridge may be \n     reopened and operated as a legal border crossing; and\n       Whereas, The tourism industries serving scenic and \n     recreational areas joined by this bridge, including the Big \n     Bend mountains of Texas and the Sierra del Carmen mountains \n     of Northwest Coahuila, wish to promote, accommodate, and \n     economically benefit from cross-border tourism but are unable \n     to implement those objectives if the La Linda crossing is not \n     functioning; and\n       Whereas, The safety of tourists wishing to enjoy the area, \n     the binational scientific cooperation called for under \n     existing international agreements, and the security and \n     public safety of communities and citizens on both sides of \n     the international border would be enhanced by a functioning \n     border crossing at La Linda; and\n       Whereas, The State of Coahuila and the commissioners court \n     of Brewster County, respectively represented by the Instituto \n     de Turismo and the Big Bend Border Council and joined by a \n     coalition of local residents and the Big Bend National Park \n     Superintendent, have twice requested that the Binational \n     Bridges and Border Crossings working group, which is convened \n     semiannually by the United States Department of State and the \n     Mexican Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores, take the \n     necessary actions to have the bridge and border crossing at \n     La Linda reopened by the United States and Mexican federal \n     governments; and\n       Whereas, The working group, composed of United States and \n     Mexican federal authorities responsible for authorizing \n     international ports of entry and required inspections along \n     the international boundary, will convene again in the coming \n     months to consider action on either reopening the bridge at \n     La Linda or ordering its removal; and\n       Whereas, It is in the economic, cultural, and security \n     interest of the State of Texas and the homeland security \n     interest of the United States of America to have a \n     functioning border crossing station under the management and \n     control of trained and equipped law enforcement and public \n     safety officials in the extensive area known as the Big Bend; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 78th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby express its support and encouragement for the \n     reopening of the bridge and border crossing at La Linda to \n     accommodate trade and tourism between Texas and Coahuila, \n     Mexico, and to better protect residents of both countries and \n     secure the protection of our nation from threats that might \n     be associated with the illegal crossing of individuals or \n     materials with a lethal intent; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature hereby urge the General Land \n     Office to proceed expeditiously with the due diligence needed \n     to make a determination regarding acceptance of an ownership \n     interest in La Linda Bridge by the State of Texas; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the legislature hereby urge that the \n     governor, the Texas Department of Transportation, the \n     secretary of state, the Department of Public Safety of the \n     State of Texas, the Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas \n     Department of Economic Development, the Texas Historical \n     Commission, and other appropriate state agencies render \n     encouragement and assistance to the General Land Office as it \n     proceeds in this matter and render encouragement and \n     assistance as well to Brewster County and to private and \n     public advocates for tourism in the Big Bend in their efforts \n     to develop a regional tourism economy in conjunction with a \n     reopened bridge at La Linda; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature hereby call upon the United \n     States Department of State to communicate the interest of the \n     State of Texas in this matter to the government of the \n     Republic of Mexico and to all other parties participating in \n     decisions relating to either reopening or removing the bridge \n     at La Linda; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the legislature hereby respectfully \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to initiate \n     whatever actions are needed to reopen La Linda Bridge as a \n     border crossing;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to legislation that would ban bear baiting on \n     federal lands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 82\n\n       Whereas, Michigan, along with other states throughout the \n     country, has been very successful in its wildlife management \n     strategies. While there is always more progress to\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\n     be made, the increasing numbers of game animals and effective \n     control of wildlife populations in Michigan and other states \n     reflect the wisdom of local management of wildlife and \n     hunting matters; and\n       Whereas, Congress is considering legislation, H.R. 1472, \n     that would require the adoption and enforcement of \n     regulations that would prohibit the intentional feeding of \n     bears on federal lands in order to end what is known as \n     ``bear baiting''; and\n       Whereas, Of the states that allow bear hunting, Michigan is \n     one of several that permit bear baiting. The experience in \n     Michigan and the other states that permit bear baiting is \n     that this technique is a valuable and highly effective \n     wildlife management tool. The voters of Michigan \n     overwhelmingly rejected a 1996 ballot proposal that included \n     a ban of bear baiting. Bear baiting is part of an overall \n     strategy that effectively controls the bear population and \n     does so more humanely than hunting techniques that may result \n     in higher rates of injuries for the animals. This mechanism \n     has clearly allowed Michigan to keep the bear population at \n     appropriate levels; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is a state that includes extensive \n     federal lands. The citizens of our state have used these \n     lands respectfully, and our state's hunting and fishing \n     management efforts have enhanced these lands over the years. \n     Michigan's proven effectiveness in dealing with wildlife \n     management challenges should not be negated by federal \n     control of the matter of bear hunting; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States not to enact \n     any legislation that would ban bear baiting on federal lands; \n     and be if further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-266.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1615. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to make \npermanent the rates of hostile fire and imminent danger special pay and \nfamily separation allowance for members of the uniformed services as \nincreased by the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, \n2003; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a bill that is \nas simple as it is significant. It promises our soldiers that while \nthey fight to protect us, we will do what we can do protect them and \ntheir families by not allowing their pay to be cut.\n  Each day brings a fresh reminder of the debt we owe our men and women \nin uniform. Today, well over 200,000 Americans are stationed abroad, \nmany facing hostile fire in difficult conditions, thousands of miles \nfrom home. In spite of enormous difficulties, they have served \nmagnificently, bringing honor to their families and their country.\n  In light of all that we read in our daily newspapers about our \nsoldiers' heroic performance, it should be unthinkable that anyone \nwould consider cutting their pay. But this isn't a rumor or some errant \nbureaucratic proposal. Unless the President and the Congress act soon, \nmany of our soldiers will see their monthly pay reduced by as much as \n$225 at the end of the current fiscal year. My legislation would help \nus honor the debt we owe to our soldiers by making permanent the rates \nof pay currently provided to our soldiers.\n  Unfortunately, we have received very mixed messages from the \nadministration about their position on this issue. In July, the Defense \nDepartment issued a position paper to the Congress expressing its views \non military pay and a series of other legislative proposals. According \nto the official Pentagon document, the Defense Department urged \nCongress to reduce our troops' pay. Last month, the San Francisco \nChronicle, in an article entitled ``Troops In Iraq Face Pay Cut,'' \nreported, ``The Pentagon wants to cut the pay of its 148,000 U.S. \ntroops in Iraq, who are already contending with guerrilla-style \nattacks, homesickness, and 120-degree plus heat. . . . The Defense \nDepartment supports the cuts, saying its budget can't sustain the \nhigher payments and a host of other priorities.''\n  Not surprisingly, these reports triggered a fire storm. The \nadministration quickly backpedaled. Its latest position is that pay \nwill be kept at current levels for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nbut pay for troops deployed abroad in other countries should be cut. \nThis does a disservice to the men and women who have chosen to risk \ntheir lives for their country and have been deployed far from their \nhomes and their families.\n  At a time when we are asking so much of these troops and their \nfamilies, it is inconceivable to me that this Nation can't sustain \ncurrent pay levels for all troops deployed abroad and that the \nadministration would not fully support this proposition.\n  The legislation would send a clear signal to all of our troops, both \nthose deployed abroad and those facing the possibility of deployment in \nthe coming weeks and months. This Nation recognizes and appreciates the \nrisks they take on our behalf and we honor our commitment to them. I \nurge the administration and my colleagues to join with me in this \neffort. Our troops and their families deserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\n                                S. 1615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MAINTENANCE OF INCREASED RATE OF HOSTILE FIRE AND \n                   IMMINENT DANGER SPECIAL PAY.\n\n       (a) Rate.--Section 310(a) of title 37, United States Code, \n     is amended by striking ``$150'' and inserting ``$225''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2003.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I have joined Senator Daschle in \nintroducing a bill today that would make permanent the increases in \nImminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance passed by Congress \nin the Fiscal Year 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations \nAct.\n  Last spring, when the Senate considered the Budget Resolution, it \npassed, by a vote of 100 to 0, an amendment I offered with Senator \nLandrieu that would have allowed for $1 billion to cover the increase \nin these special pay categories.\n  Then when the Senate considered the Fiscal Year 2003 Emergency \nWartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, it unanimously accepted an \namendment I offered with Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, increasing \nthese pay categories for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  The amendment we offered to the supplemental, sunset these pay \nincreases, not because we wished to end them, but simply to allow the \nArmed Services Committee--the Committee of Jurisdiction--to increase \nthese pay levels in the Fiscal Year 2004 Defense Authorization bill, \nwhich it did.\n  Now, when soldiers are dying in Iraq and military families have been \nseparated for many months, we hear that the administration wishes to \ncut these pay increases in the conference committee.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy on the House version of the \nbill objects to the provision increasing both pay categories, saying it \nwould ``divert resources unnecessarily.'' The statement on the Senate \nbill only objects to the increase in Family Separation Allowance.\n  When confronted with questions about why the administration wanted to \nreduce these pay categories, Defense Department spokesman, Under \nSecretary David Chu, came up with the classic Washington non-denial \ndenial. On August 14, Chu said:\n\n       I'd just like very quickly to put to rest what I understand \n     has been a burgeoning rumor that somehow we are going to \n     reduce compensation for those serving in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. That is not true . . .\n       What I think you're pointing to is one piece of a very \n     thick technical appeal document that speaks to the question, \n     do we want to extend the language Congress used in the Family \n     Separation Allowance and Imminent Danger Pay statutes. And \n     no, we don't think we need to extend that language. That's a \n     different statement from, are we going to reduce compensation \n     for those in Iraq and Afghanistan . . .\n\n  What do these statements mean?\n  Evidently the administration wants to claim that it will keep \ncompensation the same for those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthrough other pay categories, but does indeed intend to roll back the \nincreases to Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance.\n  This means that a soldier getting shot at fighting the war on \nterrorism in Yemen or the Philippines would receive less money than one \nwho is similarly risking his or her life in Iraq. This means that a \nfamily bearing huge costs because of burdensome, long-term deployments \nwould only be helped if the service member is deployed to Iraq or \nAfghanistan, but not if that same service member is deployed anywhere \nelse in the world.\n  It is unfair to cut funding intended to help military families that \nare bearing the costs of far-flung U.S. deployments. It is unacceptable \nthat imminent danger would be worth less in one combat zone than in \nanother.\n  The bill we introduce today makes a clear statement that these pay \ncategories should be increased permanently and should not be cut in \nconference.\n  Until these pay levels were increased in the supplemental, an \nAmerican soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who put his or her life on \nthe line in imminent danger only received an extra $150 per month. My \namendment increased that amount to $225 per month--still only an \nacknowledgment of their courage, but an increase nonetheless.\n  Prior to the increase in the Supplemental Appropriations bill, Family \nSeparation had been only $100 per month. We succeeded in raising it to \n$250 per month.\n  These increases are only part of a normal progression of increases--\nfor example, in 1965, Imminent Danger Pay was $55; $100 in 1985, and \nraised to $150 in 1991. Family Separation Allowance was $30 in 1970, \n$60 in 1985, $75 in 1991, and $100 in 1997.\n  Family Separation Allowance was originally intended to pay for things \nthat the deployed service member would have done, like cut the grass, \nthat the spouse may then have had to hire someone to do. That may well \nhave been appropriate in the past, but now most families have two \nworking spouses--sometimes two working military spouses--and the \nabsence of one or both parents may add huge child care costs that even \nthe increased rate is unlikely to cover.\n  Military spouses sometimes find that they must give up their jobs or \ncurtail their working hours in order to take up the family \nresponsibilities that otherwise would have been shared by the missing \nspouse.\n  Examples of increased costs that families may incur when military \npersonnel are deployed, in addition to increased child care costs, \ninclude: health care costs not covered by TRICARE; for example, the \ncost of counseling for children having a difficult time with their \nparents' deployment; costs for the family of an activated Reservist or \nNational Guard member to travel to mobilization briefings, which may be \nin another state; various communication and information-gathering \ncosts.\n  I would like to quote for the Record from an article that appeared in \nThe Washington Post on April 11, 2003, entitled ``Military Familes Turn \nto Aid Groups,'' that outlines how military families have had to rely \non private aid organizations to help them when their spouses are \ndeployed. The article highlights the case of one mother, Michele \nMignosa and says:\n\n       The last 18 months have brought one mishap or another to \n     Michelle Mignosa. Her husband, Kevin, is an Air Force \n     reservist who since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has \n     been away from their Lancaster, Calif., home almost as much \n     as he's been there. First, there were the out-of-state trips \n     to provide airport security. Then he was deployed to Turkey \n     for 2\\1/2\\ months last spring. Now he's in Greece with an \n     air-refueling unit. . . . And while he has been gone, the \n     problems have piled up at home. . . . Strapped for cash since \n     giving up her part-time job because of Kevin's frequent far-\n     off postings, she didn't know where the money would come from \n     to resolve yet another problem.\n\n  I applaud the efforts of private aid groups to help military \nfamilies, but I believe that it is the duty of the U.S. Government to \ncover more of the costs incurred because of military deployments. If \nshould not matter to which country the service member is deployed. Cuts \nmust not be made to funds helping military families that are bearing \nthe costs of war, homeland security, and U.S. military commitments \nabroad.\n  To say that pay will not decrease to those serving in Iraq or \nAfghanistan is ignoring the truth--rolling back Family Separation \nAllowance from $250 per month to $100 per month will cost our military \nfamilies and could be especially painful for those living on the edge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill that Senator Daschle and I \nintroduce today and make a strong statement to the Defense Department \nthat Congress will not stand for cutting Imminent Danger Pay and Family \nSeparation Allowance.\n                                 3_____\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1616. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to prevent the preemption of State community property law as it \nrelates to nonforfeitable accrued retirement benefits; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senate is expected to consider \nimportant legislation that will affect the pensions of millions of \nAmericans and\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\ntheir families during the 108th Congress. In the last Congress we \nprovided greater security to pensions by correcting the accounting \nabuses that lay at the heart of the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies--\nbankruptcies that caused the employees of these companies to lose their \nlife savings and hurt the investment portfolios of thousands of \nindividual investors.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to correct a unique problem under \nERISA for States with community property laws. The issue came to light \nin the 1997 Supreme Court decision in the case of Boggs v. Boggs. The \nCourt held that ERISA preempted the application of Louisiana's \ncommunity property law in the disposition of pension benefits. While \nthe case originated in Louisiana, the holding tears a hole in the \nfabric of community property laws of seven other States, Texas, New \nMexico, California, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, and Idaho.\n  Long before the women's movement, community property laws stood for \nthe basic premise that a marriage is an economic, as well as social, \nchild rearing partnership in which the ownership of property acquired \nduring the marriage is shared equally. The Boggs case involved a \nhusband and wife. The husband began accumulating benefits in a pension \nplan after they got married. The wife did not have a pension plan, but \nunder the community property law of Louisiana, half of her husband's \nbenefits were hers. The wife died before her husband retired, and \nbefore the plan's benefits were subject to distribution. In her will \nshe left her interest in the pension benefits to her husband for the \nrest of his life, with the remaining interest to her sons for after her \nhusband died. The husband subsequently remarried, retired, and \nultimately died, leaving property to his second wife and an interest in \nhis remaining assets to his sons. The sons attempted to enforce their \nState-law interest in the pension benefits bequeathed to them by their \nmother against the second wife. The Supreme Court held against the \nsons, saying that they were not beneficiaries of, nor participants in, \nthe pension plan under ERISA.\n  This holding goes against the fundamental principles of community \nproperty. What the Court is saying is that although a husband's 401K \nplan may contain a million dollars of deferred earnings accumulated \nduring the course of his marriage, if his wife dies before he retires, \nher interest terminates; she co-owned none of it. The fundamental \nprinciple of marriage as an equal partnership under community property \nis rendered meaningless by this decision.\n  The Boggs ruling will also lead to conflicting results in the \ndisposition of assets at death in community property States. If, \ninstead, the money had been put in an ordinary savings account that is \nnot covered by ERISA, half of it would have been owned by the wife as \ncommunity property in recognition of her contribution to the marriage. \nAt her death, she would have been free to dispose of the assets as she \nsaw fit. Furthermore, after Boggs, if a couple has both a 401K plan and \na savings account, upon the death of the wife the husband gets all of \nthe 401K plan plus half of the savings account; the wife's estate gets \nonly half of the savings account. That is not the equal outcome \ncommunity property laws seek.\n  The legislation that I am proposing will create a narrow exception \nwithin the ERISA preemption provisions to address the circumstances \nunder Boggs. Instead of losing the community property interest in any \nnon-forfeitable accrued pension benefits at death, a spouse will retain \nthat interest and will be able to pass that interest on to his or her \nheirs. This is not an exceptional change to ERISA. What I am proposing \ndoes not affect the joint and survivor annuity required by ERISA nor \ndoes it prevent the participant from having the use and enjoyment of \nthe entire retirement asset until his death. It does not place any new \nburden on the retirement plan administrators. It envisions that upon \nthe death of the participant, the State probate court will apply normal \ncommunity property principles, taking into account the value of the \nretirement assets at the time of the participant's death, in \ndistributing the participant's property between the heirs of the \nparticipant and the heirs of the predeceased spouse. Furthermore, each \ncommunity property State will have the freedom to implement the \namendment by whatever means the State deems best, including the option \nnot to implement the amendment at all.\n  ERISA already contains exceptions to its preemption provisions. One \napplies to divorce or other Qualified Domestic Relations Orders. This \nexception, added to ERISA by the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, allows \nStates to apply their community property laws or equitable division \nlaws to retirement assets when a couple gets divorced. A divorced \nspouse can retain an interest in the undistributed pension assets of \ntheir ex-husband or wife. As it now stands, therefore, ERISA is more \nfavorable to a spouse who divorced the participant before dying, than a \nspouse who remained married to the participant until death.\n  The Senate should act to reaffirm the principles of community \nproperty. My legislation upholds the basic ideal of community property \nlaw: that marriage is a partnership that values as equal the \ncontributions of both the husband and the wife. This notion of equality \nholds true whether one spouse worked and the other stayed at home. I \nurge my colleagues to pass this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide comprehensive \npension protection for women; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Snowe in \nintroducing the Women's Pension Protection Act of 2003, and I commend \nher for her commitment.\n  Retirement security is essential for all Americans, but too often we \nhave failed to meet the needs of women on this basic issue. Women live \nlonger than men, but they continue to earn far less in wages over their \nlifetimes. Women are much less likely to benefit from the private \npension system. Just as women receive less pay and less recognition of \ntheir contributions in the workplace, they also receive fewer \nretirement benefits.\n  Women's lack of retirement security is based in the unfair treatment \nthey face in the workplace. Women still earn only 76 percent of the \nwages of men, and this gap in pay leads to hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in lower pay over their careers. Women are twice as likely as \nmen to work in part-time jobs without benefits. They are much more \nlikely to spend time out of the workforce to meet their family \nresponsibilities. All of these factors translate into seriously \ninadequate retirement income for vast numbers of women.\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\n  The realities of this injustice are grim. According to the most \nrecent Census data, fewer than 20 percent of women age 65 and over are \nreceiving private pension income--and these women are receiving an \naverage of only $4,200 a year in such income, compared with $7,800 for \nmen. Minority women are in even more desperate straits--only 15 percent \nof African-American women and 8 percent of Hispanic women receive \npension income.\n  As a result of these lower wages, longer lifespans and unfair \npensions, nearly one in five older single women are living in poverty.\n  Almost twenty years ago, we modified federal pension laws to provide \ngreater protections for women in their retirements. The Retirement \nEquity Act of 1984 required defined benefit pension plans to pay \nsurvivor benefits, unless the spouse waived this protection. The time \nhas come to extend and expand these protections. In many cases, the \namount a spouse receives as a survivor benefit is often far too little \nto provide adequate support. The existing protections do not cover \n401(k) and other defined contribution plans--which are now the only \nretirement assistance for over half of the American who have private \npensions.\n  Under the legislation we are introducing today, women will have \ngreater retirement security. They will have greater say in the \nmanagement of their husband's 401(k) funds. Widows will have more \ngenerous survivor benefits. Divorced women will have a greater ability \nto receive a share of their former husband's pension after a divorce. \nOur legislation offer long overdue improvements in the private system, \nso that retirement savings programs are more responsive to the \nrealities of women's lives and careers. Congress must do all it can to \nstrengthen women's retirement security and end the many inequities that \naffect women in our current pension laws. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Women's Pension Protection Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11483-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 225--COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n      DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND BULGARIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Lieberman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 68\n\n       Whereas Johnny Cash was one of the most influential and \n     recognized voices of American music throughout the world, \n     whose influence spanned generations and musical genres;\n       Whereas Johnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in \n     Kingsland, Arkansas, and moved with his family at the age of \n     3 to Dyess, Arkansas, where the family farmed 20 acres of \n     cotton and other seasonal crops;\n       Whereas those early years in the life of Johnny Cash \n     inspired songs such as ``Look at Them Beans'' and ``Five Feet \n     High and Rising'';\n       Whereas Johnny Cash eventually released more than 70 albums \n     of original material in his lifetime, beginning with his \n     first recording in 1955 with the Tennessee Two;\n       Whereas Johnny Cash was a devoted husband to June Carter \n     Cash, a father of 5 children, and a grandfather;\n       Whereas Johnny Cash received extensive recognition for his \n     contributions to the musical heritage of the Nation, \n     including membership in the Grand Old Opry; induction into \n     the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Country Music \n     Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; and his \n     receipt of numerous awards, including Kennedy Center Honors, \n     11 Grammy awards, and the 2001 National Medal of Arts;\n       Whereas Johnny Cash embodied the creativity, innovation, \n     and social conscience that define American music;\n       Whereas Johnny Cash was a vocal champion of the \n     downtrodden, the working man, and Native Americans; and\n       Whereas the Nation has lost one of its most prolific and \n     influential musicians with the death of Johnny Cash on \n     September 12, 2003, in Nashville, Tennessee: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the life and accomplishments of Johnny Cash;\n       (2) recognizes and honors Johnny Cash for his invaluable \n     contributions to the Nation, Tennessee, and our musical \n     heritage; and\n       (3) extends its condolences to the Cash family on the death \n     of a remarkable man.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a concurrent \nresolution honoring Johnny Cash.\n  Johnny Cash died on Friday in Nashville. The man whose singing voice \nsounded like a big freight train coming, is gone. The concurrent \nresolution I introduce today is on behalf of my colleague, the majority \nleader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senators from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln and Mr. Pryor, and the distinguished Senator Roberts, who \nprobably knows the words to ``I Walk the Line,'' as do most of us all \nover the world.\n  Johnny Cash lived a little bit outside of Nashville. I was in his \nhome one time and I asked him: Johnny, how many nights do you perform \non the road?\n  He looked at me with some surprise. He said: Oh, about 300 a year.\n  Why do you do that, I asked him in amazement?\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\n  He looked back at me equally amazed. He said: That is what I do.\n  All weekend the radio stations have been playing the songs of the man \nwho performed 300 times a year for all of us, the ``man in black.'' \nStores all over Nashville and all over the world were stocking up on \nJohnny Cash memorabilia this weekend.\n  So much has been said in newspapers and on TV that one wonders what \nelse we Senators might say about Johnny Cash. I mean, what could I say \nbetter, for example, than what Steven Greenhouse wrote on Johnny on \npage 1 of the New York Times on Saturday:\n\n       Beginning in the mid-1950s, when he made his first record \n     for the Sun label, Mr. Cash forged a lean, hard-bitten \n     country-folk music that at its most powerful seemed to erase \n     the lines between singing, storytelling and grueling life \n     experience. Born in poverty in Arkansas at the height of the \n     Depression, he was country music's foremost poet of the \n     working poor. His stripped-down songs described the lives of \n     coal miners and sharecroppers, convicts and cowboys, railroad \n     workers and laborers.\n\n  ``Foremost poet of the working poor.'' Mr. Greenhouse was not the \nonly one who wrote beautifully about the foremost poet of the working \npoor. So did Louie Estrada and David Segal in the Washington Post. So \ndid Craig Havighurst and several other writers in the Tennessean in \nNashville, as well as John Sparks in the Memphis Commercial Appeal.\n  I have no doubt that in Wichita, Topeka, and important cities all \nover the country and world there were writers who were writing as best \nthey could about the music and the sound of Johnny Cash.\n  Why do we wait until Johnny Cash dies to write of his poetry? John R. \nCash is not the only such poet who ever lived in Nashville, TN. Bob \nDylan, Johnny's friend, once said that Hank Williams was America's \ngreatest poet. At last count, there are several thousand songwriters \nliving in Nashville struggling to write poetry, some of which will be \nknown and remembered everywhere in the world one day.\n  Alice Randall, a Nashville songwriter, a writer of songs and books, \nonce observed that it is odd that there is so little serious literary \ncriticism of the poetry of Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, and other \ncountry music songwriters. The outpouring of articles that accompanied \nJohnny's death this weekend suggest that most of the serious criticism \nof the poetry found in country music is done by pop music critics in \nour major newspapers.\n\n  But why is there not a department or a chair or at least a conference \noccasionally dedicated to criticism of the poetry or at least the \nliterature of country music? Literary criticism is a fundamental part \nof the departments of English in universities all across America. Some \nof the most famous of these were among the ``Fugitives'' who met during \nthe 1920s at Vanderbilt University. Cleanth Brooks, Robert Penn Warren, \nAllen Tate, Donald Davidson, and Andrew Lytle were some of those \nliterary critics who began their careers then.\n  If Vanderbilt University, my alma mater, is such a center of literary \ncriticism, then why has Vanderbilt University not done more about the \nliterature that is country music? Or why does Belmont University in \nNashville or the University of Tennessee or the University of Memphis \nnot do it?\n  These Nashville and Memphis songwriters are certainly among the most \nfamous poets in the world. But why do we wait for the New York Times \nand Bob Dylan to tell us that Johnny Cash and Hank Williams are also \namong the best poets when Vanderbilt University, among others, lives \nright there among them?\n  There are hundreds of good English professors in dozens of \nnortheastern universities writing thousands of pages of criticism about \naverage poets, while our Tennessee universities are doing almost \nnothing to write about poets who others say are among the best in the \nworld. We have had a habit in Tennessee of not being willing to look \nright in front of our own noses to celebrate what is special about us. \nWe sometimes worry about producing only average Chopin when right down \nthe block lives the best harmonica player in the world.\n  I am all for Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach. I have played their \nmusic on the piano with symphonies all across Tennessee, but I have \nalso performed with those symphonies some of the most beautiful of the \nunique American music we call country music.\n  The death of our friend Johnny Cash, the poet of the working poor, is \na good time for our Tennessee universities to consider whether they \nmight want to celebrate our excellence by encouraging literary \ncriticism of some of the best known poets in the world: Our \nsongwriters. Our universities might discover what others have \nsuggested, that some of our songwriters are also among the best in the \nworld.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise to join Senators Alexander, \nFrist, and Pryor to introduce a resolution in honor of a great \nAmerican, and one of our greatest Arkansans--Johnny Cash, who passed \naway on Friday, September 12, at the age of 71.\n  John R. Cash was born in Kingsland, AR on February 26, 1932. When he \nwas just 3 years old, his father moved the family to Dyess Colony, a \nNew Deal program that set up new farming communities on uncleared land \nnear the Mississippi River. The family had 20 acres upon which they \nfarmed cotton and other seasonal crops and from the beginning, John was \ntaught to work for a living. It was this time spent farming and living \nin Northeast Arkansas, that inspired songs such as ``Look at Them \nBeans'' and ``Five Feet High and Rising.'' At the age of six, he was \nhauling water for a road crew. At twelve he was chopping cotton. When \nhe reached high school he was singing on the radio in Blytheville. \nStill, John didn't pick up a guitar until he was stationed in West \nGermany as a soldier in the Army. The instrument was so cheap, he said, \nthat ``it didn't even have a brand name.''\n  When he returned from Germany, John moved to Memphis, determined to \nmake it in the music industry. He sold appliances door-to-door and went \nto broadcasting school on the GI bill, playing music whenever he could. \nFinally, he managed to get an audition before Sam Phillips, the owner \nof the legendary Sun Records studio. The first time Phillips heard Cash \nsing, he turned him down, saying that he sounded ``too country.'' John \nreturned with a more rockabilly sound and Phillips began to send his \ngroup out with another artist on the Sun Records label, Elvis Presley. \nPhillips also began to refer to John as Johnny, a name Cash disliked \nbecause he thought it made him sound too young. Johnny would go on to \nrecord some of his most cherished songs for the label, including such \nclassics as ``Cry, Cry, Cry'' and ``I Walk the Line''.\n  Over the next 5 decades, Johnny Cash recorded over 400 albums, with \n48 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and over 130 hits on the Billboard \ncountry music charts. In the process, the boy from Dyess Colony managed \nto sell over 50 million records. He is part of a distinguished group of \nmusicians from Arkansas including: Conway Twitty, Sonny Boy Williamson, \nGlen Campbell, and Charlie Rich. Even though Johnny Cash and these \nother distinguished artists found fame outside of Arkansas, the \nexperience of growing up in Arkansas gave them a unique perspective on \nthe feelings of the common man and woman, working hard to just get by, \na perspective which came through in their music.\n  The number of artists he has influenced is immeasurable. He has been \ninducted into the Country & Western Hall of Fame, the Nashville \nSongwriter's Hall of Fame, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He \nreceived 11 Grammy Awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award, and \nhas been honored by both the Kennedy Center for his contribution to \nAmerican Culture and the United Nations, receiving the Humanitarian \nAward. The last two awards illustrate how Johnny Cash became so much \nmore than a musician.\n  His songs shined a light on aspects of American culture that are \nintegral to our Nation's history but too often overlooked. He never \nforgot where he came from and the people he met along the way. He told \nstories about people who worked hard just to survive, people so poor \nthey couldn't afford a car so they snuck out the parts to build one \nfrom the plant where they worked, ``One Piece At A Time''. And he told \nit all with a voice that once was described as ``the perfect voice for \na man of his spirit. It's unmistakable. It doesn't sound like anybody \nelse. And it sounds like the real thing, which is what he is.''\n  I ask that all my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring a true\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\nAmerican original, a prodigiously talented musician, with a conscience \nthat matched those gifts. Our deepest condolences go out to his family \nand friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/15/senate-section/article/S11485-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1654.
