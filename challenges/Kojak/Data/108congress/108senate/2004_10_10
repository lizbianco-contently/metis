Mr. President, I welcome everybody this morning. It is \nunusual to have to meet on a Sunday, but in order to complete the \nNation's business, we are doing just that. I know that it has \ninterrupted a number of people's schedules, but we are forced to do so \nin order to complete business which does affect the safety and security \nof the American people.\n  This morning, we will continue debate on the conference report to \naccompany the FSC, or JOBS bill. We have controlled debate time until \nthe cloture vote, which will occur at 1 p.m. today. If Senators desire \nto debate the conference report prior to that cloture vote, there will \nbe a limited amount of time and therefore they should notify us early \nthis morning of their request. We hope and expect cloture to be invoked \nat 1 today. If invoked, we would hope the Senate would then act \nexpeditiously on the conference report.\n  As a reminder, not that many hours ago but when we closed last night, \nI filed cloture motions on the two conference reports to accompany the \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill and the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. As I said last night, I regret having to file \nthose cloture motions. However, there was an objection from the other \nside of the aisle. I understand the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill passed unanimously in the House of Representatives. I know of \nabsolutely no issues in that conference report to cause this delay. \nTherefore, once again, I ask my colleagues to take that into \nconsideration so we can proceed on this very important Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. That is money to be invested in our \nsecurity and safety and it is time for us to act.\n  It is unfortunate that because of the action on the other side of the \naisle we are holding up money that will be used to further secure this \ncountry.\n  Having said that, I hope the Members on the other side will rethink \nthis objection and allow us to proceed. I further hope that we can get \nthe disaster package passed in short order as well. It is time to pass \nthis package. We are talking about money to respond to emergencies, to \ndrought, to hurricanes. We are ready to deliver all of that money if we \ncan remove the objections from the other side of the aisle.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that the vote will occur at 1 on the \ncloture motion on FSC/ETI.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11011-7", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nrespectfully wish to raise the issue this morning to the leader because \nI know he has been trying very hard, along with our leader, Senator \nReid, to move this process along. I am here this morning because I want \nthe leader to know that I want to work with him to do that. Since \nWednesday night I have had, along with other Senators, an objection to \nthe Guard and National Reserve being left out of the tax bill.\n  My question is to the leader, and I know he wants to move forward, \nbut with the chairman of the Finance Committee, could he at least give \nsome indication of his willingness to work through this day for the \nnext couple of hours to see if we can take that matter up by voice \nvote, taking no time for debate, because it has been cleared? Would \nthat be possible for him to consider as we move through the day?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to consider it, as we have been \nconsidering it this morning, last night, and yesterday. We will \ncontinue to work with the Senator. There are no commitments to be made \nat this point because there are objections.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I am prepared to not \nobject to this request at this time this morning, but I want to let the \nleadership know, respectfully, the Republican leadership and the \nDemocratic leadership, that I am prepared to stay here today and object \nthroughout the day if this situation cannot be resolved some way on \nbehalf of the Guard and Reserve officers. But I will not object at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the titles of the resolutions en bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 455) supporting the goals of Red \n     Ribbon Week.\n       A resolution (S. Res. 456) designating October 14, 2004, as \n     Lights on Afterschool Day.\n       A resolution (S.

RES. 455\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nresolution that commemorates the annual Red Ribbon Week. The purpose of \nRed Ribbon Week is to educate and advocate a commitment to a drug-free \nlife style. Red Ribbon Week also remembers the contribution of one \nsoldier in the war against drugs, DEA Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' \nCamerena. I am honored to seek the Senate's recognition and support \nagain for the Annual Red Ribbon Campaign.\n  In my State of Alaska, Red Ribbon Week will be a Statewide \ncelebration involving thousands of school children and those people and \norganizations who care about the welfare of our children and community. \nOn October 22, the City of Anchorage of will celebrate with a series of \nRed Ribbon events coordinating with the Alaska Federation of Natives, \nthe Alaska National Guard, the Alaska State Troopers, the Mayor of \nAnchorage, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Alaska, many PTA groups and many \nothers across the community.\n  Throughout the week, Alaskans will be encouraged to show gratitude \nfor all the lives that remain drug free, pledge to live a safe and \ndrug-free life and remember those we have lost in the fight against \ndrugs.\n  The Red Ribbon Week Campaign was started in 1988 by the Federation of \nParents. It was organized as a 8-day event and was then chaired by \nPresident and Mrs. Reagan. The event began as a tribute to DEA Special \nAgent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camerena who was kidnapped, tortured, and \nmurdered by drug traffickers in 1985. I suggest to those who advocate \nthat drugs are a victimless crime talk to the widow and children of \nAgent Camerena. His sons, Erik and Enrique, Jr. continue to honor their \nfather and work to help children and families that are victims of \ncrimes. His death has become symbolic of the cost of illicit drugs.\n  The Red Ribbon which we put on is a symbol of zero tolerance for \nillegal drug use and a commitment to drug abuse prevention. The ribbon \nwill be worn or displayed in the up coming Red Ribbon Week by millions \nof Americans in an act of unity and remembrance of Agent ``Kiki'' \nCamerena.\n  Illicit drugs, the abuse of drugs, and the business of illegal drugs \nare not a private matter. Drugs harm children. Drugs harm our \ncommunities. Illegal drugs only facilitate dependency, addiction and \nthe breakdown of the families.\n  Alaska has the highest rates of domestic violence in the Nation and \none of the highest rates of sexual assault in the Nation. According to \nthe Anchorage Police Department in almost 80 percent of these cases \nalcohol and drugs were contributing factors to these crimes. In one \nrural area of Alaska, 97 percent of all the domestic cases involve \ndrugs or alcohol.\n  We must encourage our children to make better choices by making the \nsame commitment in our own lives. We as parents and leaders must set \ngood examples.\n  Our children are growing up in a community that continues to send \nconfusing and mixed signals. Our children are confronting difficult \nchoices on a continuous basis. The popular idols in the media, the \nmovies, television, and music often encourage them to make the wrong \ndecisions. The Red Ribbon Campaign is one effort to help our children \nmake the right decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this resolution to help \nillustrate the Senate's commitment to ensure our children are safe and \nto encourage all people to live a healthy drug-free life.\n\n\n                              S. RES. 456\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in support of designating \nOctober 14, 2004 as Lights On Afterschool Day. Next Thursday will serve \nas a national celebration of afterschool programming, a day to \ncelebrate the initiatives that offer quality afterschool programs in \nthe lives of children, their families and their communities. On\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nthis day, communities around our Nation will engage in innovative \nafterschool programs and activities to ensure that the lights stay on \nand the doors stay open for all children after school.\n  Quality afterschool programs provide safe, engaging and fun learning \nexperiences to help children and youth develop their social, emotional, \nphysical, cultural and academic skills. Such programs also support \nworking families by ensuring their children are safe and productive \nafter the regular school day ends. Afterschool programs also build \nstronger communities by involving our students, parents, business \nleaders and adult volunteers in the lives of our young people, thereby \npromoting positive relationships among children, youth, families and \nadults. The welfare of our children is also advanced because of the \nengagement of the families, schools and diverse community partners.\n  More than 28 million children in the United States have parents who \nwork outside the home, and 14.3 million of them have no place to go \nafter school. In addition, many afterschool programs across the country \nare facing funding shortfalls so severe that they are being forced to \nclose their doors and turn off their lights.\n  I implore my colleagues to support designating October 14, 2004, as \nLights On Afterschool Day, and ask the President to issue a \nproclamation calling on the communities of this Nation to engage in \ninnovative afterschool programs and activities for all children after \nschool.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 457\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I, Senators Collins, Mikulski, Bond \nand over 35 cosponsors are supporting a resolution designating the week \nof October 24-30, 2004 as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention \nWeek.\n  The need to combat the severe threat of lead poisoning to our \nchildren's health has never been greater. It is estimated that 25 \nmillion homes nationwide have lead hazards. Many of those homes were \nbuilt before 1950 when paint contained as much as 50 percent lead. \nPeeling chips and dust from deteriorating lead-based paint are the most \ncommon sources of childhood lead poisoning. According to the latest \nnational health estimates, nearly half a million children under the age \nof 6 suffer from lead poisoning, with these children eight times more \nlikely to come from low-income working families than wealthy families.\n  Unfortunately, except for severely poisoned children, there is no \nmedical treatment for this disease. Even then, for severely poisoned \nchildren treatment may only reduce the level of lead present in the \nbody, not reverse the harm already caused. Research shows that children \nwith elevated blood lead levels are seven times more likely to drop out \nof high school and six times more likely to have reading disabilities. \nIn addition, it costs an average of $10,000 more a year to educate a \nlead poisoned child.\n  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate childhood \nlead poisoning in this country. Designating the week of October 24, \n2004 through October 30, 2004 as ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning \nPrevention Week'' will help shine a light on this terrible problem, \nenergize the Federal Government into playing a more active role in \neliminating, and help improve local, State and Federal cooperation on \nthis issue. With concerted effort, we can eliminate the tragedy of \nchildhood lead poisoning so that no family in our country has to live \nin unsafe housing. I am committed to addressing this crisis, and I \nbelieve this resolution can encourage more communities to focus on \nsolving this terrible problem.\n\n\n                              s. res. 458\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, October 4, 2004, marked a historic \nmilestone in human space flight. On that day, SpaceShipOne became the \nfirst privately funded space vehicle to escape from and safely return \nto Earth twice within 2 weeks, thereby winning the Ansari X Prize. The \ncraft also broke the record for maximum altitude achieved by a plane, \nwhich was set by the X-15 in 1963. This is a truly landmark \nachievement, and its designer, Burt Rutan, as well as its test pilots \nMike Melvill and Brian Binnie, are to be commended along with the rest \nof the SpaceShipOne team for their extraordinary courage and ingenuity.\n  The Ansari X Prize was established to jumpstart the space tourism \nindustry, to inspire and educate students, to focus public attention \nand investment capital on this new business frontier, and to challenge \nexplorers and rocket scientists around the world. It has already \nachieved each of these goals, and without a penny of Government \nfunding. The $10 million prize was modeled after the $25,000 Orteig \nPrize won by transatlantic aviator and American legend Charles \nLindbergh in 1927. It should be noted that the Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency, DARPA, uses a similar prize model to \naccomplish many of its mission-oriented breakthroughs. So perhaps given \nthe success of this approach in unleashing the potential of America's \nbrightest minds, we should use it to tackle other areas of research \ncritical to our nation's future as well.\n  As for the cost, one of this competition's most amazing results is \nthe potential of a dramatically reduced price tag for human space \nflight. The total investment in SpaceShipOne was reportedly just over \n$20 million from the drawing board to yesterday's success, which is \ncurrently far less than the cost of a single Government-sponsored human \nmission. More affordable technology will lead to applications that \ncould only be imagined until now.\n  I eagerly look forward to the annual competition for an X Prize Cup, \nwhich begins in 2006 at White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces in \nmy home State of New Mexico. This competition will build on the success \nof the original X Prize to foster the early evolution of commercial \nhuman space flight, and make the dream of space travel a reality that \nanyone can achieve.\n  To commemorate the tremendous talent and vision demonstrated by the \nSpaceShipOne team, today Senators McCain, Hollings, Brownback, Domenici \nand I are introducing this Senate resolution. I hope that other Members \nof the Senate will join us in honoring their remarkable \naccomplishments.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 459\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nwith my colleague, Senator Lamar Alexander, designating November, 2004, \nas American Music Month.\n  Of all the creative and artistic contributions our Nation has offered \nto the world in its short history, our music is perhaps the most \ndefinitively American aspect of our culture.\n  America's vast and profound repertoire of music expresses our \ncountry's vital cultural and social identities and empowers us to \npreserve our past and pursue our future; it transforms our wondrous and \nharsh experiences into potent messages that freely declare democratic \nchoice and freedom of expression; it inspires social justice, enlivens \ncollective action, and reflects our Nation's dynamic social movements.\n  Senator Alexander and I ask our colleagues to join with us in \nrecognizing American musical heritage as an expression of this \ncountry's democratic freedoms and indomitable spirit.\n  Several prominent music organizations and their members have been \ncelebrating American Music Month in November for many years. The \ncontributions of these groups, in music education, preservation, \nscholarship, promotion and performance, should be highlighted during \nAmerican Music Month. They help us experience and appreciate our \nNation's musical heritage.\n  The Society for American Music, first named in honor of Oscar G.T. \nSonneck, early director of the music division in the Library of \nCongress and pioneer scholar of American music, strives to stimulate \nthe appreciation, performance, creation, and study of American music \nand its cultures in all their diversity.\n  The MENC: The National Association for Music Education was \nestablished in 1907 to advance music education by encouraging the study \nand making of music to celebrate and preserve our cultural heritages. \nToday it includes a membership of more than 100,000 active music \nteachers, university faculty and researchers, college students \npreparing to be teachers, high school honor society members, and music \nafficianados.\n  The College Music Society actively promotes music teaching and \nlearning, music research and dialogue, and diversity and \ninterdisciplinary interaction among cultural institutions.\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\n  The Music Library Association provides a forum for study and action \non issues that affect music libraries and assures that users of music \nmaterials are well served by their libraries.\n  The American Musicological Society was established in 1934 as a body \nof scholars devoted to the advancement of research in the various \nfields of music as a branch of learning and scholarship.\n  The organization Americans for the Arts, created in 1996 as a result \nof the merger of the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies and the \nAmerican Council for the Arts, is dedicated to representing and serving \nlocal communities and creating opportunities for every American to \nparticipate in and appreciate all forms of the arts.\n  The United States Marine Band was established by an Act of Congress \nin 1798 and represents America's oldest professional musical \norganization. Its primary mission is to provide music for the President \nof the United States and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. November \n2004 marks the sesquicentennial of the birth of John Philip Sousa, \ndirector of the Marine Band from 1880 to 1892. Sousa brought ``The \nPresident's Own'' to unprecedented levels of excellence and shaped the \nband into a world-famous musical organization. The band continues to \nmaintain Sousa's standard of excellence for the performance of America \nmusic today, through White House performances, public concerts, and \nnational tours.\n  In June of 2004, the Illinois House of Representatives adopted a \nmeasure similar to that which we offer today. Approval by the Senate \nwill be an important step toward the national recognition of this month \nof celebration. I urge the Senate to pass this resolution in a timely \nfashion so that we can properly honor American Music in all its forms.\n\n\n                              s. res. 461\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to support, with my friend \nSenator Dodd this resolution regarding National Character Counts \nWeek.'' Our resolution says the week of October 17th of this year will \nbe known across the country as National Character Counts Week.\n  Nearly a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt said the following \nabout character:\n\n       Character, in the long run, is the decisive factor in the \n     life of an individual and of nations alike.\n\n  I submit that character truly does transcend time as well as \nreligious, cultural, political, and socio-economic barriers. I believe \nour country is having a renewed focus on character and this sends a \nwonderful message to Americans, and will help those of us involved in \ncharacter education reinvigorate our efforts to get communities and \nschools involved.\n  I say that because a number of years ago we started this approach to \ncharacter education called ``character counts.'' Senators Nunn, Dodd \nand I first submitted the resolution that has now passed the Senate on \ninnumerable occasions. The resolution simply declares that for all of \nAmerica, one week during the year will be known as National Character \nCounts Week.\n  Frankly, we hear a lot about how we should help our young people \ngrowing up in this often difficult society. However, I believe the key \nis finding those ideas and programs that work. We all understand that \nthere are certain people who have the primary responsibility to care \nfor our children like mothers, fathers, siblings, and grandparents. We \nare not in any way talking about negating that responsibility of \nraising a child with good values. However, we have found the teachers \nin our schools have been yearning for something they could teach our \nchildren that for some reason had been eliminated from both the public \nand private school agenda curriculum. It is sometimes referred to as \ncharacter education.\n  I choose to speak about the ``character counts'' program that is \nbeing used in many public schools in our country, and certainly in my \nState of New Mexico where teachers embrace the six pillars of \ncharacter. The values comprising the six pillars are everyday concepts \nthat Americans across this land wish their children would have and hope \nAmerica will keep. They are simply: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They transcend \npolitical and social barriers and are central to the ideals on which \nthis Nation was built.\n  I could speak for hours about the 200,000 New Mexico schoolchildren \nin public, private and parochial schools learning about good character. \nAbout 90 percent of the grade school children, and a significant \nportion of the others, are now participating in character education \nprograms that simply and profoundly bring them into contact with each \nof these Pillars one month at a time.\n  So if one walks the halls of a grade school in Albuquerque, they \nmight see a sign outside that says, ``This Is Responsibility Month.'' \nAnd all the young people will be discussing the concept of \nresponsibility in their classrooms, and they will put up posters \nsaying, ``responsibility counts.'' At the end of that month they may \nhave an assembly where responsibility will be discussed by all the \nkids, and awards will be given to those demonstrating the most \nresponsibility. The next month it might be ``respect.'' The month after \nthat it might be ``caring.''\n  I could go on for quite some time talking about ``character counts'' \nin New Mexico. The bottom line is that I believe it is working in New \nMexico and other parts of the country. Consequently, I think we need to \nsalute the efforts already underway and encourage even more character \neducation across our country.\n  So today, Senator Dodd and I are here to submit a resolution to \naccomplish just that and hopefully our renewed effort will bring \ntogether even more communities to ensure that character education is a \npart of every child's life.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. today I join my friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, in support of a resolution declaring next \nweek National Character Counts Week. Senator Demenici and I have worked \ntogether for many years on the issue of character education and hope \nthat by designating a special week to this cause, students and teachers \nwill come together to participate in character building activities in \ntheir schools. In 1994, Senator Domenici and I established the \nPartnerships in Character Education Pilot Project and have worked \nregularly since then to commemorate National Character Counts Week. I \nam pleased that we are continuing our efforts today to help expand \nStates' and schools' abilities to make character education a central \npart of every child's education.\n  Our schools may be built with the bricks of English, math and \nscience, but character education certainly is the mortar. Character \neducation means teaching students about such qualities as caring, \ncitizenship, fairness, respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, and \nother qualities that their community values.\n  Character education provides students a context within which to \nlearn. If we view education simply as the imparting of knowledge to our \nchildren, then we will not only miss an opportunity, but will \njeopardize our future. Character education is not a separate subject, \nbut part of a seamless garment of learning. Taking this to heart, \nteachers and administrators at the Ivy Drive Elementary School in \nBristol, CT, incorporate the fundamentals of character education into a \nschool wide program. In its eighth year, the Character, Assets & \nResiliency Education, C.A.R.E, program integrates several pillars of \ncharacter into daily lessons and special events. This year Ivy Drive \nchose ``swimming to success'' as their theme to build on the previous \nyear's ``lets go fishing'' giving each child the opportunity to focus \non the fundamentals of character education.\n  Two Hartford, CT Elementary Schools, Burr Elementary and Kennelly \nElementary, recently demonstrated outstanding community service through \ntheir character education program. Supervised by their teachers, \nstudents raised close to $1000 in financial support for the family of a \nfifth grade student who died of leukemia. In doing so, they implemented \nthe character pillars of caring, citizenship, and diligence.\n  The New Haven Public Schools recently implemented a 4-year character \neducation curriculum within a pre-existing social development program. \nGrades K-3 experience the ``incredible\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\nyears'' curriculum, focusing on social skills and peer relations \nthrough service learning, community outreach, and teacher and parent \ntraining. A total of 700 character related lessons were taught in 2003-\n2004. Community service projects included visits to the central \nfirehouse, local animal shelter and elderly care home.\n  Character education programs work. Schools across the country that \nhave adopted strong character education programs report better student \nperformance, fewer discipline problems, and increased student \ninvolvement within the community. Children want direction, they want to \nbe taught right from wrong. The American public wants character \neducation in our schools, too. Studies show that about 90 percent of \nAmericans support schools teaching character education.\n  As all education policy should be, character education is bi-\npartisan. This year we have 31 cosponsors to our resolution, cosponsors \non both sides of the aisle. Character education is also actively \nsupported by a number of national education and youth organizations \nincluding 4-H and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Character \neducation can and is being incorporated into children's lives in and \noutside of the classroom.\n  This measure provides a helping hand to our schools and communities \nto ensure those children's future are bright and filled with \nopportunities and success. Character education not only cultivates \nminds, it nurtures hearts. While our children may be one quarter of our \npopulation, they are 100 percent of our future.\n\n\n                              s. res. 462\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nrecognizing the landmark Presidential elections that took place in \nAfghanistan on Saturday, October 9, 2004.\n  My colleagues Senators Lugar, Biden, Leahy, McCain, Sununu and Dodd \njoin me as original co-sponsors of this resolution.\n  The Government and people of Afghanistan deserve our praise and \nrecognition for their achievements since the emergency Loya Jirga of \nJune 2002. The process leading to this historic election has not always \nbeen easy. Warlords and Taliban members have sought to intimidate \nvoters and disrupt the process. But the government of President Hamid \nKarzai and the people of Afghanistan have not been deterred. More than \n10.5 million Afghan citizens have been reported registered to vote, \nreflecting the courage and commitment of Afghans to a democratic \nfuture. Over 40 percent of those registered are women.\n  The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, P.L. 107-327, expressed \nthe U.S. Congress's support for the development of democratic \ninstitutions and a fully representative government in Afghanistan that \nrespects religious freedom and the rights of women. The Presidential \nelection this week is a critical benchmark for America's commitment to \na long-term partnership with Afghanistan for responsible governance and \na more peaceful future.\n  America's interests in Afghanistan are linked to our wider regional \nobjectives in the war on terrorism, and in promoting security and more \nopen political and economic systems throughout the greater Middle East \nand Central Asia.\n  Presidnet Bush said on June 15, 2004, that ``the world and the United \nStates stand with [the people of Afghanistan] as partners in their \nquest for peace and prosperity and stability and democracy.''\n  I ask the Senate to recognize the historic achievement of the Afghan \npeople in holding Presidential elections this past Saturday, and to \njoin the co-sponsors of this resolution and me in expressing our \ncontinued support for the people of Afghanistan.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed; \nthe preambles be agreed to; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions (S. Res. 455 through S. Res. 462) were agreed to, en \nbloc.\n  The preambles were agreed to, en bloc.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S.

Res. 456\n\n       Whereas quality afterschool programs provide safe, \n     challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences to help \n     children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, \n     cultural, and academic skills;\n       Whereas quality afterschool programs support working \n     families by ensuring their children are safe and productive \n     after the regular school day ends;\n       Whereas quality afterschool programs build stronger \n     communities by involving students, parents, business leaders, \n     and adult volunteers in the lives of young people, thereby \n     promoting positive relationships among children, youth, \n     families, and adults;\n       Whereas quality afterschool programs engage families, \n     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the \n     welfare of children;\n       Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool!'', a national celebration \n     of afterschool programs on October 14, 2004, promotes the \n     critical importance of quality afterschool programs in the \n     lives of children, their families, and their communities;\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States \n     have parents who work outside the home, and 14,300,000 \n     children have no place to go after school; and\n       Whereas many afterschool programs across the country are \n     facing funding shortfalls so severe that they are forced to \n     close their doors and turn off their lights: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 14, 2004, as ``Lights On \n     Afterschool! Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the communities of the Nation to engage in \n     innovative afterschool programs and activities that ensure \n     the lights stay on and the doors stay open for all children \n     after school.\n\n                              S. Res. 457\n\n       Whereas lead poisoning is a leading environmental health \n     hazard to children in the United States;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 434,000 preschool children in the United States \n     have harmful levels of lead in their blood;\n       Whereas lead poisoning may cause serious, long-term harm to \n     children, including reduced intelligence and attention span, \n     behavior problems, learning disabilities, and impaired \n     growth;\n       Whereas children from low-income families are 8 times more \n     likely to be poisoned by lead than are children from high-\n     income families;\n       Whereas children may be poisoned by lead in water, soil, or \n     consumable products;\n       Whereas children most often are poisoned in their homes \n     through exposure to lead particles when lead-based paint \n     deteriorates or is disturbed during home renovation and \n     repainting; and\n       Whereas lead poisoning crosses all barriers of race, \n     income, and geography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of October 24, 2004, through \n     October 30, 2004, as ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning \n     Prevention Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     week with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 458\n\n       Whereas the Ansari X Prize was established with private \n     capital to jumpstart the space tourism industry, inspire and \n     educate\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n     students, focus public attention and investment capital on \n     this new business frontier, and challenge explorers and \n     rocket scientists around the world;\n       Whereas the $10,000,000 Ansari X Prize was modeled after \n     the $25,000 Orteig Prize won by trans-Atlantic aviator \n     Charles Lindbergh in 1927;\n       Whereas on October 4, 2004, SpaceShipOne, designed by Burt \n     Rutan and flown first by Mike Melvill and later by Brian \n     Binnie, won the Ansari X Prize by being the first privately \n     funded space vehicle to depart from and safely return to \n     Earth twice within 2 weeks;\n       Whereas SpaceShipOne broke the previous record for maximum \n     altitude achieved by a plane, which was set by the X-15 in \n     1963;\n       Whereas the SpaceShipOne flights represent a historic \n     accomplishment for humanity; and\n       Whereas future achievements in commercial space flight will \n     be stimulated by an ongoing annual competition for an X Prize \n     Cup, beginning in 2006 at White Sands Missile Range outside \n     Las Cruces, New Mexico: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the SpaceShipOne team led by Bert Rutan, \n     and test pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, for their \n     historic achievement in human space flight;\n       (2) recognizes the contributions of all members and \n     supporters of the X Prize Foundation and the SpaceShipOne \n     team, the efforts of which were instrumental in this \n     accomplishment; and\n       (3) encourages the continuation of efforts towards \n     practical commercial space flight through future X Prize Cup \n     and other competitions.\n\n                              S. Res. 459\n\n       Whereas the music of the United States embodies the \n     artistic reflection of the country's history and heritage and \n     the promise of its ideals and values;\n       Whereas the music of the United States transcends culture, \n     gender, race, class, and creed, and thrives freely as it is \n     continually reinvented, rearranged, transformed, and infused \n     by the personal experiences of men and women;\n       Whereas the music of the United States expresses the \n     country's vital cultural and social identities and empowers \n     the people of the United States to assert and preserve our \n     pasts for a future, transforms the wondrous and harsh \n     experiences of the people of the United States into potent \n     messages that freely declare democratic choice and freedom of \n     expression, inspires social justice, enlivens collective \n     action, and reflects our Nation's dynamic social movements;\n       Whereas the National Federation of Music Clubs (NFMC) and \n     its 17th president, Ada Holding Miller, building on their \n     efforts to create American Music week in 1924 with the aid of \n     Arthur Bodansky, conductor of the Metropolitan Opera, and \n     Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony \n     Orchestra, established ``American Music Month'' and the \n     ``Parade of American Music'' in February 1955 to recognize \n     music and its importance to the social, cultural, historical, \n     and educational development of the United States;\n       Whereas by action of the NFMC Board of Directors in 1998, \n     the celebration of ``American Music Month'' was changed to \n     the month of November in 1999 at the request of Sonneck \n     Society for American Music;\n       Whereas the leading arts and education organizations of the \n     United States, such as the Society for American Music, MENC: \n     the National Association for Music Education, the College \n     Music Society, the Music Library Association, the American \n     Musicological Society, and Americans for the Arts, continue \n     to strive to stimulate the appreciation, performance, \n     creation, and study of music in the United States;\n       Whereas the month of November has witnessed the births of \n     such artistic legends as Scott Joplin (1868), William \n     Christopher ``W.

Res. 460\n\n       Whereas the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church of Birmingham, \n     Alabama, was constructed in 1911 and served as a center for \n     African-American life in the city and a rallying point for \n     the civil rights movement during the 1960s;\n       Whereas on Sunday, September 15, 1963, segregationists \n     protesting the mandatory integration of Birmingham's public \n     schools firebombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church;\n       Whereas the blast killed Addie Mae Collins, age 14, Denise \n     McNair, age 11, Carole Robertson, age 14, and Cynthia Wesley, \n     age 14, all members of the Church, while they were preparing \n     for Sunday service;\n       Whereas September 15, 1963, has been called the darkest day \n     in the history of Birmingham and one of the darkest days of \n     the entire civil rights movement;\n       Whereas this act of terrorism raised national and \n     international awareness of the African-American civil rights \n     struggle and galvanized those dedicated to the cause of civil \n     rights;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n     (Public Law 88-352, 78 Stat. 241) and the Voting Rights Act \n     of 1965 (Public Law 89-110, 79 Stat. 437) in the wake of the \n     bombing;\n       Whereas the 4 men suspected of the bombing, Bobby Frank \n     Cherry, Herman Cash, Thomas Blanton, and Robert Chambliss, \n     were not immediately prosecuted because authorities believed \n     it impossible to obtain a conviction in the heated racial \n     climate of the mid-1960s;\n       Whereas Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley successfully \n     prosecuted Robert Chambliss 13 years after the bombing;\n       Whereas after the indictment and conviction of Robert \n     Chambliss, the bombing investigation was closed;\n       Whereas the bombing investigation was reopened in 1995 due \n     to the efforts of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special \n     Agent Rob Langford and local African-American leaders;\n       Whereas in 2001 and 2002, a joint Federal and State task \n     force, under the supervision of United States Attorney \n     Douglas Jones and Alabama Attorney General William Pryor, \n     successfully prosecuted Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry \n     with the assistance of State and local law enforcement \n     personnel; and\n       Whereas the bombing, the prosecution of the offenders, and \n     the cause of civil rights in general have become national and \n     international concerns: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion of the 40th \n     anniversary of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist \n     Church of Birmingham, Alabama--\n       (1) honors the memory of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, \n     Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley;\n       (2) recognizes the historical significance of the bombing \n     and the enduring impact it has had on the cause of civil \n     rights everywhere; and\n       (3) commends the efforts of the Alabama Attorney General's \n     office for its successful prosecution of Robert Chambliss in \n     1977, the efforts of the joint Federal and State task force \n     for the successful prosecution of Bobby Frank Cherry and \n     Thomas Blanton in 2001 and 2002, and the efforts of all other \n     law enforcement personnel who worked to bring the persons \n     responsible for the bombing to justice.\n\n                              S. Res. 461\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the Nation;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week beginning October 17, 2004, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to--\n       (A) embrace the elements of character identified by local \n     schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, \n     and activities.\n\n                              S. Res. 462\n\n       Whereas section 101(1) of the Afghanistan Freedom Support \n     Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7511(1)) declares that the ``United \n     States and the international community should support efforts \n     that advance the development of democratic civil authorities \n     and institutions in Afghanistan and the establishment of a \n     new broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive, and fully \n     representative government in Afghanistan'';\n       Whereas on January 4, 2004, the Constitutional Loya Jirga \n     of Afghanistan adopted a constitution that promises free \n     elections with full participation by women and establishes a \n     legislative foundation for democracy in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas on June 15, 2004, President Bush stated that \n     ``Afghanistan's journey to democracy and peace deserves the \n     support and respect of every nation . . . . The world and the \n     United States stand with [the people of Afghanistan] as \n     partners in their quest for peace and prosperity and \n     stability and democracy.'';\n       Whereas the independent Joint Electoral Management Body in \n     Afghanistan and thousands of its staff throughout Afghanistan \n     have worked to register voters and organize a fair and \n     transparent election process despite violent and deadly \n     attacks on them and on the purpose of their work;\n       Whereas more than 10,500,000 Afghans have been reported \n     registered to vote, demonstrating great courage and a deep \n     desire to have a voice in the future of Afghanistan, and more \n     than 40 percent of those reported registered to vote are \n     women;\n       Whereas the presidential election campaign in Afghanistan \n     officially began on September 7, 2004 and 18 candidates, \n     including one woman, are seeking the presidency;\n       Whereas on October 9, 2004, the people of Afghanistan will \n     vote in the first direct presidential election, at the \n     national level, in Afghanistan's history at 5,000 polling \n     centers located throughout Afghanistan, as well as polling \n     centers in Pakistan and Iran;\n       Whereas the United States, the European Union, the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the \n     Asian Network for Free Elections will send monitors and \n     support teams to join the more than 4,000 domestic election \n     observers in Afghanistan for the presidential election;\n       Whereas the United States and many international partners \n     have provided technical assistance and financial support for \n     elections in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), \n     led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and \n     coalition forces will join the Afghan National Army and \n     police in Afghanistan to help provide security during the \n     presidential election: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved that it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States applauds the steadfast commitment of \n     the people of Afghanistan to achieve responsive and \n     responsible government through democracy;\n       (2) the United States strongly supports self-government and \n     the protection of human rights and freedom of conscience for \n     all men and women in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) the United States remains committed to a long-term \n     partnership with the people of Afghanistan and to a peaceful \n     future for Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11017-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING PRINTING OF REVISED EDITION OF SENATE RULES AND MANUAL\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution (S. Res. 389), which was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 389\n\n       Whereas in 2004, it is estimated that approximately 230,000 \n     new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United \n     States, and nearly 30,000 men in the United States will die \n     from prostate cancer;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the second leading cause of \n     cancer death in men in the United States;\n       Whereas more than $4,700,000,000 is spent annually in the \n     United States in direct treatment costs for prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African-American men are diagnosed with and die \n     from prostate cancer more frequently than men of other ethnic \n     backgrounds;\n       Whereas increased education among health care providers and \n     patients regarding the need for prostate cancer screening \n     tests has resulted in the diagnosis of approximately 86 \n     percent of prostate cancer patients before the cancerous \n     cells have spread appreciably beyond the prostate gland, \n     thereby enhancing the odds of successful treatment;\n       Whereas the potential complication rates for significant \n     side effects vary among the most common forms of treatment \n     for prostate cancer;\n       Whereas prostate cancer often strikes elderly people in the \n     United States, men should have an opportunity to learn about \n     the benefits and limitations of testing for prostate cancer \n     detection and of treatment of prostate cancer, so that they \n     can make an informed decision with the assistance of a \n     clinician; and\n       Whereas Congress as a whole, and Members of Congress as \n     individuals, are in unique positions to support the fight \n     against prostate cancer, to help raise public awareness about \n     the need to make screening tests available to all people at \n     risk for prostate cancer, and to provide prostate cancer \n     patients with adequate information to assess the relative \n     benefits and risks of treatment options: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) national and community organizations and health care \n     providers have played a commendable role in supplying \n     information concerning the importance of screening for \n     prostate cancer and the treatment options for patients with \n     prostate cancer; and\n       (2) the Federal Government and the States should ensure \n     that health care providers supply prostate cancer patients \n     with appropriate information and any other tools necessary \n     for prostate cancer patients to receive readily \n     understandable descriptions of the advantages, disadvantages, \n     benefits, and risks of all medically efficacious screening \n     and treatments for prostate cancer, including brachytherapy, \n     hormonal treatments, external beam radiation, chemotherapy, \n     surgery, and watchful waiting.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution (S. Con.

Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of allotted \ntime. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report on \nthe American Job Creation Act of 2004. This conference report will \nprovide needed incentives for U.S. manufacturers and will take the \nfirst step toward ending EU tariffs on our exporters.\n  Most importantly for Kentucky, this bill will finally bring the help \nthat our tobacco growers have needed for years.\n  Because we are repealing the FSC/E.T.I. rules, the European Union \nmust remove the sanctions--now 11 percent--which they have levied on \nmany U.S. exports.\n  I have from employers back home about how they are struggling under \nthe weight of these tariffs, which are hurting their exports and their \nplans to expand their businesses.\n  By passing this bill, we make our exports more competitive again, and \nwe help our economy create new jobs.\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\n  It is a big win for my state and our Nation.\n  The tax centerpiece of this bill, of course, is a provision to \nprovide help to America's manufacturing sector.\n  This sector of our economy has been under serious pressure since \nearly 2000.\n  The jobs that manufacturing creates are good-paying jobs and we must \ndo what we can to ensure that these jobs will be here in the future.\n  This bill creates a new deduction for domestic manufacturers \nemploying American workers. That deduction cuts the tax rate for \ndomestic manufacturers who employ American workers.\n  This will help keep jobs here at home and make our manufacturers more \ncompetitive in the world marketplace.\n  I am pleased that we were able to improve one aspect of this \nprovision in conference. We were able to eliminate the ``haircut'' that \nwould have cut the benefits available to many businesses that employ \nworkers in the U.S. merely because those businesses also operate \nabroad.\n  I am glad that this bill recognizes the contributions to our economy \nmade by companies such as Toyota, Nestle, and Mazak that are in my \nstate providing jobs to hard-working Kentuckians every day.\n  While I am pleased that the conference report before us includes many \nother provisions that will have a positive impact on my state's \neconomy, including the horse, restaurant and railroad industries, I am \ndisappointed that the conference did not include the Senate energy tax \ncredits.\n  We have waited for a comprehensive energy bill for too long. America \nhas energy needs we must address today, and so we put a few energy \nprovisions in this bill.\n  Despite these clear needs and my best efforts, they were stripped in \nconference. This bill could have done more, but let me be clear about \none thing ---- we will be back.\n  Despite this shortcoming, I am pleased that the Soybean Biodiesel and \nCorn Ethanol Tax provisions are in the conference report.\n  These tax provisions will encourage the use of alternative fuels \nwhich will help Kentucky farmers and biodiesel manufacturers while also \nincreasing domestic energy production, boosting conservation, and \nlessening our dependence on foreign oil.\n  And most importantly, this is an historic day for Kentucky's tobacco \ngrowers. My growers will finally receive the relief they need and \ndeserve. We finally have a buyout.\n  Since Daniel Boone first came through the Cumberland Gap, farming has \nbeen both the economic and cultural backbone of the commonwealth.\n  The family farm is the basis of Kentucky culture and these farms rely \non tobacco.\n  For years, we in Kentucky have tried to diversify from the tobacco \ncrop. We have had some success and some failures.\n  But in the end, we come back to tobacco because nothing brings a \nhigher return.\n  The money farmers get from tobacco pays their mortgage and puts their \nkids through school and allows them to stay on the farm.\n  Outside of the western part of Kentucky, we do not have tens of \nthousands of acres of flat land.\n  We need a crop that grows on rolling hills and that thrives in our \nclimate. Tobacco does that.\n  But many forces have conspired against tobacco in the last few years.\n  The previous administration declared war on tobacco and, by \nextension, tobacco farmers.\n  The Asian economic crisis hurt exports. The master settlement \nagreement and state tax increases dramatically raised the price of \ncigarettes.\n  And although American tobacco is still superior, the companies have \ninvested so much overseas that the gap has narrowed between American \ntobacco and cheap foreign tobacco.\n  As most of my colleagues know, there are no direct payments to \ntobacco farmers, but we do have price supports and production controls.\n  Growers own quota which they can buy, sell or lease. The government \nadministers this program to get growers a fair price for their tobacco \nand make sure they only sell what they are allowed to.\n  If you grow too much, you can't sell it. However, the tobacco \nprogram, which has served Kentucky so well, now hangs like a millstone \naround growers' necks.\n  Burley tobacco quotas have lost 46 percent of their value since 1998. \nWe are looking at another 10 percent cut this year. We have lost a lot \nof growers, from 10,000 in 1988 to 32,000 in the year 2003. We have \nmany who are barely holding on.\n\n  Many of the tobacco quota holders are elderly and can no longer work \nthe land, so they lease their quota and that income becomes a major \npart of their retirement security. That quota is tied to the land. It \nhas a direct effect on the property taxes Kentuckians pay.\n  The conference report we have before us today will buy out those \ntobacco programs. We will give our growers relief and end the Federal \nprice support program. We will also have many growers whose average age \nis 62 retire and get out of the business. Dr. Will Snell of the \nUniversity of Kentucky estimates that 70 to 75 percent of tobacco \ngrowers will get out of the business with the buyout. We will allow \ngrowers to pay off their debts and have more certainty about their \nfuture.\n  I am also happy we were able to bring the bill out of conference \nwithout the FDA provisions. The House made it very clear in conference \nthey would not pass a bill with FDA regulations in it. I voted for FDA \nregulations on the Senate floor, but only as a means to get my growers \na buyout. But in the end, FDA regulation provisions have become a \nhindrance to the buyout. A buyout without FDA is the best of both \nworlds for Kentuckians. My growers will get their relief but without \nthe worry of having the FDA invade their farms.\n  In the conference, when we were forced to choose between my growers \ngetting relief or killing the bill by adding FDA, I chose the buyout, \nand I would do so again in a heartbeat. That is how important this \nbuyout is to Kentucky.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Grassley has 41 minutes 11 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there are several antifraud provisions \nin this conference report. Most of the focus in the media has been on \nthe tax benefits of this legislation, but an extremely important aspect \nof the bill is how it closes giant corporate tax loopholes. This \nlegislation, by closing them, obviously is going to bring revenue into \nthe Federal Treasury that is otherwise just going into the treasuries \nof corporations.\n  This legislation includes Enron reforms that Members have been \npushing for since Enron was exposed 3 years ago. Don't forget, for \nabout 5 or 6 years before that, before the year 2001, Enron was doing \ntheir dirty work. But we finally got it exposed in 2001, and we have \nbeen taking some corrective action through corporate governance \npolicies already passed by the Congress, and now we are taking action \nto close the abuse of the Tax Code by Enron-type executives.\n  It is a little ironic that many of those same Senators who have \ndemagogged the Enron scandal are now opposing this bill. They seem to \nbe more interested in something that is not in this bill than the very \ngood public policy of cracking down on fraud that is actually in this \nbill. I am proud of the fact that many of these antifraud measures in \nthis report stemmed from cases that were investigated and exposed by \nthe very capable staff of the Senate Finance Committee. With that staff \nworking for me and staff working for Senator Baucus, along with various \nwhistleblowers and informants, and now with the House of \nRepresentatives passing this bill, we are about ready to shut down \nthese Enron-type corporate tax abuses.\n  This has not been an easy process, but it is a real example of how \nour perseverance pays off. Back in July of 2001, the Finance Committee \nstaff first discovered what has become known as a huge fraud upon the \ntaxpayers, and that is the fuel tax evasion. This fraud is costing the \ntaxpayers at least $10 billion. So, No. 1, Enron-type fraud, abusive \ntax shelters; now we are talking\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nabout fraud that comes from people not paying the fuel tax on gasoline \nand diesel fuel that would be then spent on the highways.\n  The Finance Committee had a very important hearing exposing this type \nof fuel fraud tax scam. The problem has come to light in more recent \nprosecutions. One involved an alleged terrorist cell that was skimming \noff fuel and selling it, using the money for God only knows what. It \ncould have found its way into terrorist activity against the United \nStates.\n  In another case, in July, prosecutors charged 19 workers at the Miami \nInternational Airport with falsely classifying jet fuel as contaminated \nto avoid paying the fuel tax. They would then sell it on the sly, \nstealing 2.7 million gallons of fuel.\n  Another tax scam that my staff uncovered involves what is known as \nservice-in/lease-out, or SILO. These schemes were discovered by a \nFinance Committee major hearing, showing these fraudulent arrangements \nare put together by high-priced lawyers and accountants. In these \nscams, companies actually lease public works systems such as subways \nand sewers from cities, and then turn right around and lease them back \nto the same cities. The cities get upfront money, presumably under the \nargument that their municipal treasuries can use it, particularly in \ntimes when the economy is down. But here is what happens: The cities \nget a little bit of upfront money, but the companies get millions of \ndollars of tax writeoffs. So the taxpayer is left holding an empty bag \nunder this scheme.\n  That sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? But it is true. The bill we are \nabout to vote on puts a stop to this and saves the taxpayers over $27 \nbillion.\n  Let me also note that we have provisions in this bill that address \nother abuses, significant abuses in the donation of intellectual \nproperty, as well as the donations of cars.\n  Corporations have been reducing their tax bills by hundreds of \nmillions of dollars each year by taking intellectual property of little \nto no value and donating it to charity. This legislation ends this \nabuse by corporations while still encouraging the donation of \nlegitimate intellectual property that has real value for actual \ndevelopment.\n  We also ended the shady tax practice of people providing some junker \ncars to a charity and claiming thousands for it off their individual \nincome tax.\n  The reforms in this legislation will place no additional burden on \nthe donor, will not reduce the amount going to charities from the \ndonated car by a single dime, and will benefit all taxpayers by ending \nthis abusive scheme.\n  There has been noise coming from a few that this reform shouldn't \nhave been done on this bill. A lot of that noise is not coming from \ncharities but from middlemen who are the ones who really make the \nprofit off of this abuse.\n  To say we should have delayed this is nonsense. As my comments \nhighlight, it is very difficult and also uncommon for us to have a \nlegislative opportunity to address tax shelters and tax abuse.\n  This bill provides the most sweeping attack on abusive corporate tax \nshelters in an entire generation of this Congress. So we cannot pass up \nan opportunity to address an abusive corporate tax situation. It can \nvery well be years before another opportunity presents itself to the \nCongress to deal with the problem of people not paying their fair share \nof taxes. Forget about the word ``fair share''--just say paying taxes \nthat are due.\n  These efforts to address abuses in charitable donations are part of \nan ongoing bipartisan Senate Finance Committee review of nonprofits, \nsomething the Democratic ranking member, Senator Baucus, and I are \nworking on together.\n  I anticipate we will be addressing other areas in the future such as \nland donations and facade donations based on our investigations of the \nNature Conservancy and other land donation organizations.\n  But I do want to say, since I named some of these organizations, that \nI think some of these organizations have gotten the message and are \nmaking attempts to correct some of the deficiencies in their own \noperations that abuse the Tax Code.\n  I am very pleased that in this bill we deal with a situation where \nexecutives take corporate aircraft for personal travel. Legislation in \nthis bill will put significant limitations on corporations being able \nto write off such high living.\n  Again, based on the work of the Finance Committee, we were able to \nground a good number of these high-flying corporate executives. The \nFinance Committee initially placed limitations to deal with abuses that \nwere seen in the Virgin Islands and other U.S. territories. There were \nmany people going down there to the Virgin Islands to not only get a \ntan but also to avoid the taxman.\n  I am pleased that, working with Treasury and working with the Ways \nand Means Committee of the other body, we were able to further tighten \nthese limitations to address the tax problems we are seeing down there \nin the sunny islands of the Caribbean.\n  Finally, I am glad that in the conference committee we were able to \nadopt the Finance Committee's proposal championed by Senator Nickles to \nend the SUV deduction for businesses. Senator Nickles also was right \nwhen he said it would be an embarrassment if we couldn't deal with this \nabuse, and we did. That is around $50 billion of fraud which the \nFinance Committee uncovered, pursued, and that is in this bill. That \ndoesn't count the billions of dollars which I considered abuse but \nwhich the House of Representatives must not have considered abuse \nbecause they wouldn't agree to putting it in this bill. But I am going \nto continue to deal with corporate abuse.\n  I made this statement to the leaders of the Ways and Means Committee \nin our conference committee. I offered amendments to go further than \nthis conference report goes. The House conferees refused, but I made \nclear that where these corporate abuses aren't adequately handled and \ndealt with in this conference report, that come January I intend, if I \nam chairman of the committee, to pursue more closing of corporate tax \nabuses. If I am not chairman, Senator Baucus will be chairman, and I \nthink, although I shouldn't speak for him, he is as committed to this \nas I am because we have had 2 good years of working together on this \nissue.\n  The taxpayers are getting their money's worth out of this Senate \nFinance Committee. They are entitled to get more of their money's worth \nout of Senate Finance Committee when we continue to clamp down on these \ncorporate tax abuses.\n  The Constitution may say that revenue measures have to start in the \nHouse, but the fact is, they are being created in the Senate by closing \nloopholes and cracking down on fraud and abuse.\n  I thank the House of Representatives, and particularly the \ncooperative working arrangement we had on this conference report with \nChairman Thomas of the House Ways and Means Committee in getting as far \nas we have in closing down these corporate tax abuses.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has been so successful in rooting out \ntax fraud. We have more and more information coming to us over the \ntransom about newer, more crooked and creative scams being cooked up \nout there in the underworld of tax shelters. All I can say to this \nunderworld is, watch out, because we are coming after you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Ohio is yielded 10 minutes off the time which I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during my \ndiscussion this morning I be able to display several packs of \ncigarettes and a container of macaroni and cheese which I have in front \nof me.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues today at 1 o'clock to \nvote no on the cloture vote. The conference committee stripped out from \nthis bill the FDA regulation of tobacco. I think it was a serious \nmistake. It really represents a missed opportunity--a greatly missed \nopportunity--for us to cut health costs in this country and to save \nlives.\n  All of us come to this floor so many times and talk about saving \nlives. We come all the time talking about what has happened with health \ncare costs in this country.\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\n  There is nothing we could do which would be more important than to \npass the FDA regulation of tobacco. There is nothing we could do that \nwould be more important to save lives and to cut health care costs in \nthis country. Yet, unbelievably, the conference committee stripped this \nprovision out of the bill.\n  How long are we going to allow the tobacco companies to remain above \nthe law and outside the law?\n  What am I talking about? I talked about this a little bit on the \nfloor yesterday, but I want to explain it again.\n  When I say ``above the law,'' I really mean above the law. Macaroni \nand cheese--everyone knows macaroni and cheese. Kids eat a lot of \nmacaroni and cheese, at least mine do. The side packet has every piece \nof information anyone would want to know about it and a lot more: \ncalories, fiber, sugar, dietary fiber, saturated fat. It is all on \nhere. It includes citric acid, sodium phosphate; everything is listed. \nBut the same company that makes the macaroni and cheese also makes \nMarlboros. Guess what. Pick up a pack of Marlboros and there is no \ninformation about the contents. Why? Because there is a loophole in the \nlaw; Marlboros are outside the law.\n  How about claims made by tobacco companies? Marlboro Lights--it means \nnothing. When you have yogurt and it says ``light yogurt,'' it means \nsomething. You read on here ``one-third less calories.'' It is \nregulated by the Government. Not tobacco.\n  What about the other claims by the cigarette companies? When they \nmake a claim, it doesn't mean anything, unlike every other product in \nthe stream of commerce today. Take Advance Premium Lights. The back \nsays ``All the taste, less of the toxins.'' One would assume that means \nthey are safer. Who knows there are less toxins? No one checks this. \nThe Government does not regulate it. It is a dangerous product, and the \nGovernment does not regulate it. How crazy is this? How long are we \ngoing to put up with this?\n  Eclipse, another product. I read from the back what they claim:\n  Scientific studies show compared to other cigarettes Eclipse may \npresent less risk of cancer, bronchitis, possibly emphysema, reduces \nsecondhand smoke by 80 percent, leaves no lingering odor in hair or \nclothes.\n  More health claims, yet nothing to back it up.\n  The worst thing the tobacco companies do, the worst thing we allow \nthem to do, the worst thing this Congress continues to allow them to do \nis to target kids.\n  Skoal, a pinch better. Apple blend. Does anyone think longtime Skoal \nusers are using apple blend? Give me a break. Who is using this? Who \nare they targeting? Entry-level users. They are after kids with apple \nblend.\n  Cigarettes: Liquid Zoo, vanilla flavor. Give me a break. Kool, Mocha \nTaboo. Who is that after? Kids. Camels, Beach Breezer. Or this one: \nKauai Kolada. Do you think a 60-year-old longtime tobacco consumer of \nCamels is using this? Obviously not. Who is using this and who the \ntobacco companies are targeting is kids. That is who they want to use \nthis entry-level drug. They want to get them hooked. They get them \nhooked on something like this: Mandarin Mint Camels. That is what they \ndo.\n  We allow this to continue. The FDA regulation bill would have stopped \nit, the bill the conference committee inexplicably stripped out of this \nbill, a bill the Senate passed overwhelmingly and sent to the \nconference committee. The conferees turned their backs on children's \nhealth, turned their backs on public health, and stripped it out. That \nis the reason we all should vote no on this conference report.\n  We come to the Senate many times and we talk about health costs. We \nsay we need to do something about health costs. Let me state the \nfigures from my home State of Ohio. If we do not think the passage of \nthis bill would have done a lot, the annual health care costs in Ohio \nfor smoking, our annual health care costs, what it costs in Ohio, is \n$3.4 billion, and that is just my home State of Ohio alone. Our \nMedicaid costs, much paid for by taxpayers--Federal, State--$1.1 \nbillion. That is not even talking about the cost in human life. The \ncost in human life, adults in Ohio who die each year prematurely \nbecause of tobacco, 18,900; kids 18 years of age and younger in Ohio \nwho ultimately die prematurely from smoking, 314,000.\n  I have today with me letters from the American Heart Association, the \nAmerican Lung Association, the Ohio Children's Hospital Association, \nthe American Thoracic Society, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \nwhich I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Center for\n\n\n                                            Tobacco-Free Kids,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2004.\n     Re opposition to FSC/ETI bill without FDA jurisdiction over \n         tobacco.\n\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: We were profoundly disappointed by \n     yesterday's decision by the House/Senate conference on the \n     FSC legislation not to include provisions establishing FDA \n     regulation of tobacco products. An historic opportunity to \n     protect the nation's children and the nation's health was \n     lost.\n       Enacting FDA regulation of tobacco products is the single \n     most important thing Congress could do to reduce cancer, \n     heart disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and a host of \n     other diseases. It is the single most important thing \n     Congress could do to improve the health of our children and \n     protect our children from unscrupulous marketing by an \n     industry that produces a product that kills one out of two \n     long-term users. Close to 90% of all tobacco users start as \n     children. First and foremost, it is our children who were \n     ignored and who are the big losers by the decision not to \n     include FDA in the FSC/ETI legislation.\n       The tragedy is not only that an opportunity to prevent \n     disease has slipped through our fingers, but also that \n     literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of kids, \n     once addicted, eventually will die of these tobacco-related \n     diseases. And these deaths will be needless. They will occur \n     because of the actions of the House/Senate Conferees who \n     failed to include FDA in the original Conference draft and \n     who voted not to add it the final bill. Tobacco use is also a \n     leading cause of premature birth. If Congress had given FDA \n     authority over tobacco products, Congress could have \n     dramatically reduced the number of children born prematurely \n     with serious medical problems due to tobacco use.\n       Rarely does Congress have the opportunity to take an action \n     that will improve the lives and well being of millions of \n     Americans. This was such an opportunity. Tobacco companies \n     market candy flavored cigarettes, promote their products in a \n     myriad of ways that make them more appealing to children, \n     hide the truth about the dangers of their products and fail \n     to take even the most minimal steps to reduce the number of \n     Americans who die from tobacco use. By the decision not to \n     include the FDA provisions adopted overwhelmingly by the \n     Senate in this bill, Congress is doing nothing to stop them.\n       Not even our profound disappointment in yesterday's \n     outcome, however, can diminish the gratitude we feel for your \n     courageous efforts to pursue enactment of this legislation, \n     against all odds, in the face of countless setbacks, always \n     putting kids first. We commit to you that our struggle with \n     you to achieve lasting protection of our kids and our society \n     through regulation of tobacco products is not over.\n       Yesterday's vote by the FSC conference committee against \n     FDA authority over tobacco is a big victory for the tobacco \n     industry that will carry a heavy price in lives lost and kids \n     addicted to tobacco. The nation will also pay a price in \n     growing cynicism about government when Congress appears \n     willing to trade tax breaks for kids' lives. We urge all \n     Senators and Members of Congress to oppose the FSC Conference \n     Report until the FDA provisions are included.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Matthew L. Myers,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Ohio Children's Hospital\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Columbus, OH, October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I write today to express the terrible \n     disappointment felt among Ohio's children's hospitals that \n     Congress has lost an opportunity to protect the health of \n     America's children. It is my understanding that your efforts \n     to enact legislation granting the Food and Drug \n     Administration authority to regulate the manufacturing and \n     marketing of tobacco products has been thwarted by intense \n     tobacco industry pressures. This is a shameful waste of a \n     rare opportunity to take the bold action needed to reduce a \n     staggeringly dangerous health risk that hurts kids and \n     increases the cost of health care.\n       Ohio has been working hard to reduce youth smoking, and \n     children's hospitals have long been at the frontlines of this \n     battle to protect our children from the devastating toll that \n     tobacco exacts. But, for every step forward we take (youth \n     smoking in Ohio is down recently), we face a barrage of new \n     and cunning attempts by the tobacco industry to regain its \n     foothold with Ohio's children. The tobacco industry is \n     spending more than ever\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\n     to market its products in ways that appeal to children. As a \n     depressing example, we now face the prospect of candy-\n     flavored cigarettes.\n       Across the country, every day 2,000 more children become \n     regular smokers, one-third of whom will die prematurely as a \n     result.\n       FDA regulation of tobacco products represents the best tool \n     for combating the tobacco industry's reckless assault on our \n     children's health. We need the FDA to have the authority to \n     subject tobacco products to the same rigorous standards we \n     impose on other consumer products, including ingredient \n     disclosure, truthful packaging and advertising, and \n     manufacturing controls.\n       Senator DeWine, we greatly appreciate your work on behalf \n     of Ohio's children, and we only wish that the Congress could \n     have stepped up to its responsibilities to protect our \n     children from the tobacco scourge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Andrew Carter,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Thoracic Society,\n\n                                   San Diego, CA, October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: Congress is about to give the Big \n     Tobacco the one thing they want, continued access to the most \n     attractive market for their deadly products--our children. \n     Don't let Big Tobacco continue to peddle their products to \n     our children.\n       The best way to protect our nation's children from the \n     continuing disease and addiction caused Big Tobacco and their \n     deadly products is by granting the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco.\n       The bipartisan compromised reached in the Senate FSC bill \n     would have granted the FDA the authority needed to regulate \n     tobacco and reduce underage smoking throughout America. \n     Unfortunately, during conference the supporters of Big \n     Tobacco struck the one provision that would have given our \n     children a fighting chance against the pervasive marketing \n     power of tobacco companies.\n       If Congress fails to give FDA the authority to regulate \n     tobacco, our children will pay the price. Children will pay \n     the price through a lifetime of addiction to tobacco \n     products. Children will pay through the diseases associated \n     with tobacco addiction--lung disease, heart disease and \n     cancer. Children will pay the price, literally, with their \n     lives.\n       Senator DeWine, the 14,000 members of American Thoracic \n     Society thank you for your tireless efforts to protect \n     children from tobacco. Please don't stop now. Don't let the \n     opportunity to protect our nation's children from tobacco \n     addiction go up in smoke. We are counting on you and your \n     colleagues to exhaust every legislative tool available to you \n     to ensure that the FSC tax bill includes the provision \n     granting FDA the authority to regulate tobacco.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Sharon I.S. Rounds, MD,\n     President, American Thoracic Society.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                      Dallas, TX, October 7, 2004.\n       To the Members of the U.S. Senate: On behalf of the \n     American Heart Association's 22.5 million volunteers and \n     advocates, I write you to express our deep dismay over the \n     Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) conference vote that failed \n     to grant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to \n     regulate tobacco products. This represents a squandered \n     opportunity to protect the public against dangerous tobacco \n     products, a failure to protect our children from the \n     marketing of tobacco products, and also the adoption of the \n     wrong tobacco buyout plan. How can Congress explain such \n     neglect for our nation's health?\n       The original FDA legislation approved by the Senate and \n     introduced by Senators Mike DeWine and Edward Kennedy had \n     overwhelming support from both the public health community \n     and tobacco grower groups. In the Senate, true champions of \n     public health had fought for the success of this measure, \n     while others worked to derail efforts to reduce the death and \n     disease that result from tobacco use. A few members' blind \n     and unwarranted opposition to regulation that would save \n     lives will have a tragic result. Our chance to reduce tobacco \n     related deaths and disease has gone up in smoke.\n       Tobacco use is responsible for more than 440,000 deaths \n     each year, with more than one in three from heart disease or \n     stroke. Each day, 4,000 youth try their first cigarette and \n     2,000 become regular daily smokers. This FDA legislation \n     offered our best chance to reverse that trend and reduce the \n     senseless death and disease that results from tobacco use.\n       And sadly, the buyout that was adopted in conference fails \n     in many aspects. First, it provides far less assistance to \n     hard-hit tobacco farmers than the earlier Senate-approved \n     measure: $796 million less in North Carolina; $490 million \n     less in Kentucky; and, $141 million less in Virginia, to name \n     a few effected states. This buyout will only prolong the \n     cycle of economic misery too many of these farmers face. It \n     lacks incentives to encourage farmers to leave tobacco \n     farming. It neither restricts the amount of tobacco that can \n     be grown, nor does it limit where it can be grown. And \n     without price controls, the result will be more hard times \n     for tobacco growers trying to compete with cheap \n     international tobacco.\n       The American people deserve an explanation for the failings \n     of the current FSC legislation, and on behalf of our \n     association and our volunteers, I hope the responsible votes \n     are cast in opposition. As it stands, this bill is a raw deal \n     for our nation's health, our youth and tobacco farmers.\n\n                                                  M. Cass Wheeler,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                                  October 7, 2004.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: How can the Congress give $10 billion \n     to tobacco growers without requiring anyone to exit the \n     tobacco farming business and fail to do anything for public \n     health? This is unconscionable.\n       Over 440,000 people die prematurely from tobacco-related \n     illness each year and two thousand children become addicted \n     regular smokers every day. Nearly 90 percent of lung cancer \n     and 80 to 90 percent of emphysema and chronic bronchitis are \n     caused by tobacco use. Despite this deadly assault on lung \n     health, tobacco products are the most unregulated consumer \n     products on the market today.\n       Senator, the American Lung Association thanks you for your \n     steadfast commitment to America's children. Your leadership \n     on FDA regulation is laudable. Please implore your colleagues \n     to change course and include the FDA oversight of tobacco in \n     the FSC bill.\n       Tobacco companies continue to aggressively market their \n     products to our children, cynically targeting ``replacement \n     smokers'' for those who die or quit smoking. New flavored \n     cigarettes including R.J. Reynolds' Camel Exotic Blends Kauai \n     Koloda with ``Hawaiian hints of pineapple and coconut'' and \n     Kool Caribbean Chill and Mocha Taboo are aimed at young \n     people. The tobacco companies make health claims of ``reduced \n     carcinogens'' or ``less toxins'' without any oversight of the \n     veracity of the statements or their impact on health.\n       FDA regulation of tobacco would:\n       Ban flavored cigarettes.\n       Stop illegal sales of tobacco products to children and \n     adolescents.\n       Require changes in tobacco products, such as the reduction \n     or elimination of harmful chemicals, to make them less \n     harmful or less addictive.\n       Restrict advertising and promotions that appeal to children \n     and adolescents.\n       Prohibit unsubstantiated health claims about so-called \n     ``reduced risk'' tobacco products that would have the effect \n     of discouraging current tobacco users from quitting or \n     encouraging new users to start.\n       Require the disclosure of the contents of tobacco products \n     and tobacco industry research about the health effects of \n     their products.\n       Require larger and more informative health warnings on \n     tobacco products.\n       How many more children must become addicted to tobacco \n     before Congress regulates cigarettes? Senator DeWine, do not \n     allow the U.S. Congress to squander this opportunity to \n     protect the public health and provide the Food and Drug \n     Administration regulatory oversight over tobacco products.\n       Thank you again for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             John L. Kirkwood,\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n                                        American Lung Association.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. They all make the point that the FDA provision that was \nin this bill would have saved lives, would have made a difference, \nwould have protected our society.\n  Members may say: There are good things in this bill--I have to vote \nfor this bill--good things for my State. I simply point out to them at \nsome point we have to say enough is enough. At some point we have to \nsay the status quo is not acceptable. At some point we have to look at \nthe bigger picture than what is going on in this bill. Yes, there are \ngood things for Ohio, there are good things for your State, but the \nstatistics I cited, the tremendous health care costs in dollars and \ncents and human cost, have to be considered. At some point we have to \ntake a stand.\n  We may not win this battle today, but we will be back. We will be \nback to finally regulate this one product that is escaping the law, the \none product we are not regulating today, a product which, even when it \nis used as intended, is a dangerous product that kills many Americans. \nIt must be regulated. It must be brought under the law. We must stop \nthe tobacco companies from targeting our kids. We must stop them from \ngoing after children every single day, trying to make more children \naddicted, trying to kill more children. It is wrong. It is morally \nwrong.\n  This Congress, some day I hope in the not-too-distant future, will \nsay we have had enough; we are not going to stand for it anymore; we \nare going to do what we have to do to save our children. The fringe \nbenefit, besides saving\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\nlives, is going to be that we will dramatically slash health care costs \nin this country. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair in his capacity as the Senator \nfrom Alaska suggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has control of 13 minutes 25 \nseconds. There is no right to object.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for this entire year I have come to the \nfloor many times to tell my colleagues all the reasons this conference \nreport is a must-pass piece of legislation. I have talked about trade \nand I have talked about tariffs. I have talked about the necessity of \nstopping outsourcing, lowering the cost of capital to our corporations \nso they can be more competitive in international competition, keeping \njobs in America, reducing that cost of capital, as this bill does, by \nreducing the corporate tax rate for manufacturing in America--a direct \nincentive to produce here rather than producing overseas.\n  Now, that is what the main part of this bill is all about, but it has \nsome other aspects to it. I want to talk about $24 billion--$24 \nbillion--that may be gone forever if we do not pass this bill; $24 \nbillion to go into the highway trust fund. I do not serve on the \ncommittee that expends the money from the highway trust fund. I do \nserve on the committee, the Finance Committee, that provides how much \ngas tax we should have and other moneys that go into the highway trust \nfund. But for those who do deal daily with the highway trust fund, this \n$24 billion is the biggest single increase in highway trust fund income \nin over 6 years.\n  Now, where does the $24 billion come from? It does not come from new \ntaxes. Instead, we overhaul an outdated excise tax system to address \nour Nation's increased use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol.\n  In addition to overhauling the excise tax system that is outdated, we \ncrack down on big-time fuel fraud to make sure that bad guys are not \nrobbing our States of their much-needed highway money. But the only way \nwe can get all of that money is if we pass this bill, and do it right \nnow, because that will bring $24 billion into the trust fund--the only \nway.\n  You have to put the money into the trust fund today to build roads \ntomorrow. And you cannot start collecting any new money until we change \nthese outdated rules that keep this $24 billion from going into the \nroad fund. All of the Senators who are filibustering this bill are \ncosting every State new highway dollars.\n  To put this in perspective, my home State of Iowa, as an example, \nunder this bill could get an additional $900 million over 6 years, but \nonly if we pass this bill this year. So anybody from the State of Iowa \nvoting in the Congress of the United States ought to know if they vote \nno on this bill that they are costing the State of Iowa $900 million. \nEven if we postponed the rule changes until we pass a highway bill now, \nwhich is not going to be passed until next year, Iowa will still lose \n$140 million forever--never get that back.\n  How many roads can Iowa build with $900 million? How many bridges can \nwe repair with $900 million? I do not know why any Senator would \njeopardize the safety of every citizen in his State by failing to pass \nthe highway trust fund.\n  There are other Senators who do not want to put money in the bank \ntoday so we can build the roads for tomorrow. Every Senator, of course, \nhas their right to vote as they please, but every State also has the \nright to know what that vote will cost the highway bill and what it \nwill cost their State.\n  Let's look at California. They are going to be big winners in this \nVEETC and fuel fraud reform that is in this legislation. The estimated \nincrease in California's highway revenue is over $2 billion--$2 billion \nof new highway money. But the only way to get the full benefit of the \nestimate is to pass this bill now. So I would ask the California \nSenators to look at this legislation, put the money in the bank today, \nand then build roads tomorrow.\n  Illinois would be a big loser if Members of that delegation would \nvote no on cloture and no on this bill. The Illinois Department of \nTransportation knows exactly what they would lose if this bill does not \npass. It is close to $3 billion. That $3 billion can be put in the \ntrust fund today to build roads tomorrow.\n  I would hope no one comes whining to me as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee next year that we do not have enough money to fund \nthe highway bill, especially when you have an opportunity--right here \ntoday--handed to you on a silver platter to put $24 billion into the \nhighway trust fund, more money for your States. And you ought to \nconsider that not a silver platter, you ought to see that as some sort \nof a golden platter, a golden opportunity. But we have Senators who are \nbound and determined to deny every State department of transportation \n$24 billion. We never get an opportunity like this to put a package of \nhighway funding together. We may not get this opportunity again.\n  Vote no today, and every road, bridge, highway construction project \nis cheated. Vote no today and every highway job not only next year but \nuntil the year 2010 will be in jeopardy, running short of money. I do \nnot know if we can ever get this kind of funding package put together \nagain.\n  Let me suggest to you how tenuous it was on aspects of this. \nDisagreements between me and the House of Representatives a year ago \nlast summer--not differences involving Democrats and Republicans, \ndifferences involving Republicans, between me and the House of \nRepresentatives--to get this put together so this money would come into \nthe highway trust fund, so we would take care of this issue of fuel \nfraud.\n  The Vice President of the United States intervened to bring a \ncompromise together a year ago last June because, quite frankly, I \nthought a year ago now we were going to have the highway bill passed, \nand this was going to be part of the highway bill, to bring this $24 \nbillion into this road fund. You do not get opportunities like that \nvery often. You do not get strokes of luck like that very often to get \nto where we are today.\n  Now, the other thing about being where we are today is this bill \nbefore us is not a highway bill. The highway bill should have passed, \nbut I guess now it is going to go over until next year. That is not in \nmy area of responsibility, so I am anticipating what other Senators \nwould tell you. But we have the good fortune of people looking very \nbroadly at what is good for America or not good for America, and \nfeeling that this provision of $24 billion into the highway trust fund \nso we do not lose this revenue--and we have already lost some--we have \nthis opportunity now. We can do it in this JOBS bill as opposed to the \nhighway bill so we don't lose that revenue.\n\n  One other thing that is in dispute is why we don't have the \nregulation of tobacco in this bill. I don't know how the Senate Finance \nCommittee that deals with taxes and trade and Medicare and Medicaid and \nSocial Security and welfare and pensions and Customs and the IRS, all \nof those things, how we get saddled dealing with an issue that belongs \nin the Committee on Health or the Committee on Agriculture. But we got \nit dumped on us.\n  I don't know why the Health, Education, Labor Committee that has this \nin their jurisdiction, particularly when Democrats are complaining \nabout it not being in this bill, couldn't have passed that in the year \n2001 and 2002 when they controlled that committee. But, no, they dumped \nthis on us. Anyway, we have to deal with it, and it is not in there. It \nmakes some people mad, both Republican and Democrat.\n  I want everybody to know, even though it should not have been in this \nbill, I voted for it on the floor of the Senate to hasten this bill \nalong, to put it in here, and I offered it to the House of \nRepresentatives that it be included. I didn't offer it; one of my \ncolleagues offered it. But I supported my colleague because I thought \nregulation of\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nnicotine was legitimate. Now it is not here, and we had a lot of \nspeeches last night and today about it. So I want to speak about that.\n  I voted for this despite the growing problems that are coming to \nlight about the FDA falling down on its current responsibilities. And \nmy investigative staff has been in the middle of that, of buyouts, as \nan example, trying to get the FDA to recognize that their scientists \nare trying to tell us there is some danger out there. And they won't \nlisten to them; in fact, they tried to suppress it. Or antidepressants, \nas in the case of the FDA scientists raising questions about that and \nbeing stomped on for a year until finally the study committee studied \nit and voted 15 to 8 that there ought to be a warning put on \nantidepressants for children because they are committing suicide. Yet \npeople want to put more on the back of FDA when they have problems \nthere.\n  Anyway, that is a whole other issue. The FDA has come under \ninvestigation, including my own that I have just talked about, \ninvolving Vioxx, as we have been reading about within the last week. It \nwas revealed by my Finance Committee staff that it looked as though the \nFDA pressured employees to suppress negative findings regarding Vioxx.\n  In today's paper, we read about what looks like the FDA falling down \non the job in regard to the flu vaccine crisis.\n  So, I hope some around here aren't trying to mislead the American \npeople into thinking that FDA regulation is some kind of panacea for \nsmoking.\n  I heard one Senator from the other side say that we sided with the \ntobacco companies when the FDA provision failed. Well that is \ninteresting. That is surely what opponents would like you to think. \nBut, there is a dirty little secret involved here. Or, at least it is a \nsecret vis-a-vis the public.\n  The fact is, the tobacco companies are divided on whether there \nshould be FDA regulation. In fact, the largest tobacco company actually \nsupports FDA regulation, and has been lobbying heavily and pouring \nmoney into the effort to get it.\n  Why? Well, for one thing, a great deal of its business is overseas, \nand it will therefore be immune from FDA regulation. This will give it \na competitive edge against its competitors. So, the tobacco companies, \nor at least the biggest one, is much more in favor of FDA regulation \nthan against it.\n  Therefore, anybody trying to frame this as tobacco versus kids, or \ntobacco versus health groups, is just flatly misleading the public.\n  But, even for those of us who pushed for FDA oversight, our legs were \ncut right out from under us during the negotiations. And guess who cut \nthe legs right of from under us? The leadership of the Democratic Party \ncut the legs right out from under us. That's who.\n  The leader of the Democratic party, Senator Kerry, went down to North \nCarolina to talk to tobacco farmers. Guess what he said. He said he'd \nsupport a tobacco buyout with or without FDA regulation.\n  So, it looks to me like the senior Senator from Massachusetts didn't \ncommunicate very well with the junior Senator from Massachusetts--or \nvice-versa.\n  Moreover, we had the Democratic Senate Campaign Chairman saying the \nsame thing last week. He said he didn't need FDA regulation with a \ntobacco buyout.\n  And, he even had his candidate for the North Carolina Senate seat up \nhere lobbying right over in the conference committee room to get this \nbuyout through, with or without FDA. Can you believe that?\n  And, to add insult to injury to the Democratic Senators from \nMassachusetts, and Iowa, the Senate Democratic Leader even signed the \nconference report.\n  So, obviously, when the House leadership knew the votes were there in \nthe Senate for a buyout without FDA, they weren't about to agree to it \nin conference, and there's no way we could have successfully pushed it.\n  Now, what more does it take from their own leaders to undermine what \nthe Democratic Senators from Iowa and Massachusetts wanted to do? Seems \nto me they need to get their own house in order before criticizing \nothers.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Does that mean all the time we had remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 15 minutes, but it occurs \nlater in the allocated time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana has 30 minutes \nunder her control that is supposed to start about 11:40.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That time starts at 11:52.\n  Mr. REID. With the consent of the Senate, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Louisiana from the time of Senator Dorgan, who will not \nuse his time, and I would ask unanimous consent that her time begin \nnow.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Dorgan only has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Harkin has 5 minutes, so I will yield Senator \nHarkin's 5 and Senator Dorgan's 5 to her, and her time will start \nrunning now, for a total of 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Louisiana is recognized for a period of 40 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking Senator \nGrassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, for his hard work on this \nbill. It has been a very difficult and complicated process. He and his \nstaff, as well as Senator Baucus, have done an extraordinary job moving \na $137 billion tax benefit bill through the Senate and through the \nCongress over the last 2 years. We have been intimately involved in the \nbuilding and crafting of this bill. There have been literally hundreds \nof meetings, hearings, debates, and negotiations, some public and some \nin private, over the last 2 years to put together a bill that is $137 \nbillion.\n  My colleagues will note these bills that are on their desks that have \nbeen here since Thursday morning. This was printed Thursday morning or \nFriday morning and distributed to us, the first time that we have had \nthis in its entirety to read its contents and to understand what is in \nit. We had our version, but we sent it over to the House and then the \nconference version came back.\n  Mr. Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, and the Senator from Montana \nhave done a great job trying to provide a lot of good provisions in \nthis bill. I am going to speak about that specifically in a moment. But \nbefore he left the floor I wanted to commend him for his work.\n  I rise today to speak for 40 minutes and will continue to speak \nthroughout the course of the debate, which may go on for a day or two \nor three or four until we finally wrap up the business of this session. \nI will continue to rise and speak about one item that was conspicuously \nand unconscionably and unjustly left out of this bill. There was one \nitem that we had passed out of the Senate, a unanimously by voice vote, \nRepublicans and Democrats, unanimously sent over to the House, to \ninclude in this $137 billion tax bill an amendment for the Guard and \nReserve called the Guard and Reserve Paycheck Protection Act--the Guard \nand Reserve, the 640,000 men and women who have been called up since \nthe conflicts started in Afghanistan and Iraq, the men and women on the \nfront line supporting our Active troops, protecting us at ground zero \nof the war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  We had a provision in there to keep their paychecks whole. It was \ntaken out by the Republican leadership of the House.\n  Before I get into the details, let me just divert and say, to get off \non a little bit of a lighter and more positive note, I congratulate our \nLSU team, our Southern team, and our Grambling team for winning on the \nfootball field last night. LSU came back from a very dramatic game, \nwhich I got to watch part of after being here late into the night, and \nwon 24 to 21 over Florida. Southern beat Alabama 33 to 24, and \nGrambling beat Mississippi State 34 to 26. And Louisiana at Monroe beat \nIdaho--I am sorry to say to the Senator from Idaho--16 to 14. The teams \nfrom Louisiana won last night.\n  I feel strongly that the people of Louisiana would like us to make \nour best effort to make sure that we can win throughout this week, \nwhether the action is taken now or the action is\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\ntaken sometime in the near future, for us to win for our Guard and \nReserve on the front lines.\n  I don't know why the provision was left out, but I would like to \nshare a visual that is pretty dramatic. I have shared it before. I want \nto be clear: I have spoken on this on and off for several hours for the \nlast 5 days. I don't object to anything in this bill. Although there \nare other Senators on both sides, Senator McCain, Senator Harkin, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Kennedy, other Senators have expressed real \nconcern. I appreciate those concerns. But that is not my issue. That is \nnot why I have stood on this floor objecting.\n  I am objecting to the passage of this bill because it left out the \nmen and women who are on the front line of the war on terror, whether \nthey are at home as first responders or in Iraq or Afghanistan. Members \nof our Armed Forces were left out of a $137 billion tax credit bill. We \ncould not find one page, one paragraph, one sentence to include them \nin. You can sit here all day and read this bill. I am going to see how \nmany pages are in the bill. It looks like there are about 650 pages of \nprovisions. We refer to this around here as the FSC/ETI legislation. We \nhave been working on it for 2 years. It is supposedly a jobs bill. It \nsupposedly provides tax relief to good companies, large companies, \nsmall companies, companies that import and export, companies that \nperhaps deserve the relief.\n  The bill started out correcting a decision made by the World Trade \nOrganization to correct basically a $50 billion problem. But as you \nknow--because the President pro tempore is experienced and is chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee and one of the senior Members of this \nbody--tax bills have a tendency to grow. They keep growing and growing \nand growing and getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive \nbecause it is very tempting for individuals and corporations and people \nwho petition their Government who want relief or some special credit or \nwant some special provision or think they are not being treated \nfairly--they petition all of us.\n  Well, there was one group that sent some of us a letter. I would like \nto read from this letter, the statement they sent, the Reserve Officers \nAssociation of the United States of America, the men and women on the \nfront line. It was signed by Robert MacIntosh, who represents the major \ngeneral: We continue to support tax credits for employers of reservists \nand National Guardsmen.\n  This position is a result of a problem faced by employers of Reserve \nmembers who support our forces when they are mobilized. The extended \nmobilization and stop-loss authorities, which means basically a \nbackdoor draft, enacted by the President and the service Secretaries to \nsupport Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan \nhave served only to exacerbate these problems. Many employers want to \nextend pay and benefit coverage to the reservists but are finding this \nto be an unanticipated, long-term expense as operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan entail multiple years of mobilization. Reservists are \nfinding re-employment and employment difficult for the very same \nreason. As reservists' employers shoulder the burden of extra costs to \nsupport the employee's participation in the military, they become \ndirect contributors to our Nation's defense. Employer pressure is \nlisted as one of the top reasons for reservists to quit military \nservice.\n  The ROA is disappointed to learn of recent actions by the House that \ndefeated, by a voice vote, an attempt to revive amendment 3123 to \nSenate Report S. 1637, which would have provided a credit for the \nreplacement employees of ready Reserve and National Guard employees \ncalled to military active duty.\n  The Reserve Officers Association of America--I am going to paraphrase \nhere--represents the men and women who are carrying, in many ways, 100 \npercent of the risk, taking 100 percent of the bullets, leaving their \nfamilies for hours and weeks and months and days for their training and \ntheir deployment.\n  I am paraphrasing this to say that the ROA urges Congress to support \nthe employer tax credit as a means to eliminate civilian employment \nconflict and support recruitment and retention efforts.\n  It has come to the attention of some of us who have been involved in \nthe Armed Services Committee--I have served on that Committee for \nseveral years and continue to support provisions through my position on \nAppropriations, as the Chair does, and many other Members of this body, \nsupport for our troops. I have supported provisions that support the \nGuard and Reserve as well as our Active because of many reasons but one \nin particular, which is that in the last several years, as you can see \nfrom this chart, our Government--all of us, the past President, the \ncurrent President, the past Congress, this Congress, and Members from \nboth sides--has basically rewritten the policy of defense. We have said \nwe are going to have a total force structure, and it is going to be \ncomposed of 1.6 million Active-Duty officers--soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and Air Force--and we are going to have 1.2--that is the troop \nstrength of our Guard and Reserve.\n  One of the reasons we count on the Guard and Reserve is for the \nbenefit of the taxpayers, because it is not as expensive. They have \ncivilian jobs and they only go when called up. They don't have to \nsupport them 24-7, year after year. We ask them to be ready. The least \nwe can do is send them to Iraq with a full paycheck. We didn't do that \nbecause there are higher priorities in the bill. Every Member has come \nto say something about a priority in this bill. It could be any number \nof manufacturers. But for the record, for this Senator--and I know \nothers join me--there could not possibly be any higher priority in this \ncountry today, right now, than the men and women who are fighting on \nthe front lines in Iraq, Afghanistan, and their families who support \nthem.\n  As you know, Mr. President--and I do because I have visited many \nbases and spent a lot of time with our troops--the truth is that most \nof the soldiers are used to sacrificing. It is why they signed up in \nthe first place. They think it is a virtue. That is something we can \nlearn more about in this Chamber, including me. I don't sacrifice \nnearly as much as I should. They are quite an inspiration to us. They \ndon't mind making the sacrifice. I have not had one soldier bellyache \nabout anything, even those who lost their arms and legs. Most of them \nsay: Stitch me up and let me go back to the front line. That is \nadmirable. You would think we could honor their service with more than \npictures and words or by putting them in a bill.\n  They didn't ask for the whole bill or half of the bill or even for 25 \npercent of the bill. They asked for $2 billion out of $137 billion. We \ncould not find it anywhere. We could not find the time, the will, the \nattention, or the focus to give them a little percentage of this bill.\n  Let me tell you how many of them we call up. We seem to be able to \nfind their phone numbers when we call them to service but not to put \nthem in the bill. From 1953 to 1989, we called up 200,000 Guard and \nReserve. This was the traditional way we operated in our Government to \nprotect the country. We would call them up when we absolutely had to: \nduring the Berlin crisis of 1961, we called up 148,000 of them, and \n148,000 families stayed home and prayed for their safe return. During \nthe Cuban missile crisis, we called up 14,200, and 14,200 families \nstayed home and prayed along with their neighborhoods, churches, and \nplaces of employment for them to come back. You can go through this \nlist. There were 199,000 from 1990 to 2004, just in the last 14 years, \n8 of which I have been a Senator in this Senate and a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, so I know something about this. We have \ncalled them up time and time again and told them to leave their wives, \ntheir children, their employment, and go to the front lines. And they \ngo--proudly. They don't ask for much. They served in the Persian Gulf \nwar, 238,000 of them. They went to Haiti, 3,680. They went to Bosnia, \n29,670. They served in Operation Southern Watch, 2,038. They went to \nKosovo, 5,933. And they went to Afghanistan.\n  Today, before I came to the Senate to speak, I turned on television \nset and the headlines this morning across the Sunday shows is \n``Elections Going on in Afghanistan.'' Who do we think made those \nelections happen? Did we\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\njust wish for those elections to happen? I don't think so. Our troops \nmade those elections happen. They wouldn't be happening without our \nGuard and Reserve troops, and our Active Forces.\n\n  I don't care how many speeches we give. I don't care how many bills \nwe write. I don't care how many budgets we pass. The fact is, those \nelections would not be taking place today if it were not for these \ntroops. They are good enough to get those elections started, but they \nare not good enough to be in this bill? That is why I am standing on \nthis floor until the last possible minute that I can to delay these \nproceedings--not to be obnoxious, not to be ridiculous, not to be \nuncooperative, not because I don't support transportation, not because \nI don't support shipbuilding, but because I think we owe it to our \ntroops to stand up for them. And I plan to do it.\n  Now I am going to talk about a couple of arguments I heard.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 23 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. I want to talk about a couple of \narguments I have heard the last couple of days, directly and \nindirectly, about why some Senators would object.\n  I want to be very clear. I know, as sure as I am standing here, at \nsome later date I am going to have some sort of critic of mine, and I \nhave my share of critics, standing up saying: There goes Senator \nLandrieu again. She's against tax cuts. She's trying to slow up our \ntransportation bill. She's trying to slow up the highway bill. She \nnever supports tax credits.\n  I am going to keep saying for the record the only reason I stand \nhere, the only reason, is to try to get this Senate to do what it did a \ncouple of weeks ago, which was to send over to the House of \nRepresentatives a bill that would include the Guard and Reserve.\n  There is nothing I can do as a Senator to make the House Republican \nleadership respond other than to bring this to light, to urge my \ncolleagues to stand with me, Republicans and Democrats together, over \nhere in the Senate, and send the bill back to the House and ask for \nthem to consider it again. Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe they didn't \nrealize this was one of the items. I don't know. I am not on the \nFinance Committee.\n  I sent a letter. Twenty-one of us signed it. I put it in the Record \nbefore so I won't read the letter, but it is addressed to Chairman \nGrassley; to Ranking Member Baucus; to Bill Thomas, chairman of the \nWays and Means Committee; and to Charlie Rangel, the ranking member.\n  I see Senator Baucus has come to the floor. I know he supports this \nprovision, I know Senator Grassley supports this provision, and I know \nCharlie Rangel supports this provision. What I am not sure about is the \nchairman, Bill Thomas. I don't know, maybe he didn't realize it was \npart of the request. There were over 2,000 requests, as you can see. I \ndon't know how many items are in this bill, but it has to be thousands \nof items. I know it is difficult, so I am assuming he didn't know about \nit. That is why I am spending some time talking, so maybe the word will \nget there.\n  Twenty-one Senators signed this: Kit Bond of Missouri, a leading \nadvocate for the Guard and Reserve signed this letter, along with Mark \nPryor, Chris Dodd, Danny Akaka, Byron Dorgan and Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Murray, Senator Corzine, Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Nelson, Senator Tim Johnson, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Dayton, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Durbin, Senator Wyden, \nSenator Levin, and Senator Leahy. I am sure there will be other \nSenators on both sides who will let their views be known to the House \nRepublican leadership.\n  How in the name of heaven could the House Republican leadership put a \nbill together and leave out the Guard and Reserve? Tax cuts for fan \nimporters? I want the fan importers to know that I am not picking on \nthem. But I think this picture speaks a thousand words. For some \nreason--we could find a reason, and it may be a good one. I am sorry I \ndon't know the details of it. I can't talk about it. I understand there \nis a good reason. Maybe someone could explain it, about the fans. But \nthey are in the bill. The fans are in the bill, but the guys in Iraq or \nAfghanistan, where it is 105 degrees most of the time, in tents that \nare hot, carrying 50, 60 pounds of equipment and armor, who could use \nthese fans, can't even get a paycheck to buy the fans.\n  When they go to Iraq they leave their civilian paycheck at home. They \nleave the comfort of their families at home. The GAO report is that \nmost of them take a 41-percent pay cut. We couldn't find time to \nacknowledge that and say: My goodness, we are passing a tax bill, maybe \nwe can fit them in.\n  We can't fit them in the tax bill. We can't fit them in the \nTransportation bill. We can't fit them in the Homeland Security bill. \nWe can't fit them in the intelligence reorganization bill because, \nobviously, we don't think they have anything to do with our security.\n  Whether you think the front line, as I said, is in Iraq in the war on \nterror--which is an issue of debate, and I actually could debate that. \nMaybe it is not exactly the front line. But regardless of whether you \nthink it is the front line, the second line, the third line or the back \nline or whether you think it is in Afghanistan, the fact is, we sent \nthem there. We sent them there with half a paycheck, or 75 percent of \ntheir paycheck, so their families at home can lose their houses and \nlose their cars?\n  If anybody doesn't think that is true, please go to my Web site or \ntalk to me. I will most certainly give the information to you. You know \nit yourself. You have seen the reports about the sacrifices families \nare making.\n  There are some other arguments that were made about this. One of them \nwas Senator Landrieu and others are just complaining. They want to slow \nthe process down. I hope I have answered that argument. I hope my \ncolleagues and the leadership know I am not trying to be uncooperative. \nI understand people's schedules. I have two children, 12 and 7; I \nunderstand schedules. But my family supports it. They understand what I \nam doing, and I told them if it takes 4 days or 5 days or 3 days or 2 \ndays, it is going to take it. I am sorry. But I think I owe it to the \n5,000 men and women from my State who are serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan because I just went home 3 weeks ago and waved goodbye to a \nlot of them.\n  I have been to Fort Hood and Fort Polk, telling them I am with them, \ntaking pictures with them, and I'll be darned if I will take the \npictures with them and not stay in the Senate and fight for them.\n\n  One of the Senators came to the floor this morning to argue we had \neliminated the haircut provision--whatever that is. We support, in this \nbill, contributions of our industry. What about the contributions of \nthe employers, small businesses and large businesses, that are carrying \nthe extra burden of our defense by making those paychecks whole, \nsometimes at great difficulty to those businesses? What about these \ncompanies? I am going to provide a list in just a minute of some of \nthose companies, which I have for the Record, but hundreds of \ncompanies, thousands of companies are trying their best, in some \ndifficult times, to make those paychecks whole.\n  Why should we be giving tax credits to every other company? Some of \nthem may overlap, but there is no mention of that in this bill. There \nis no direct support to the many companies that are being patriotic, \nthat are doing the right thing.\n  Let me say something about these companies that are the beneficiaries \nin this bill. Again, many could be in shipbuilding, could be other \nmanufacturers--I don't think there is one company that benefits from \nthis bill, small or large, with 5 employees or 50,000 employees, that \nwould say to the Members of the Senate: Please put me ahead of the \nGuard and Reserve. I don't believe it. That is why I have confidence I \ncan stand here and I can talk about this. I do not think one industry \nin my State believes that in any way I am trying to take a penny away \nfrom them.\n  But for our Guard and Reserve, and their employers, in a time of war, \nat a time of great sacrifice, to ask to be included in the bill, I \nthink they will find it very difficult to explain why they are not.\n  I know the third argument people have made, and I think I heard the \nchairman talk about it, is this is a jobs bill. I know jobs are \nimportant. I would like to make more happen in my State to create \nprivate sector jobs, high-paying jobs, good jobs. I do believe there\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\nare some provisions of this $137 billion bill that will create jobs. \nBut what job could be more important to our security than the job of \nour men and women in uniform and their service to our country?\n  Again, let me put up a chart that shows how many have gone, how many \nare serving, and to ask what we might do for them.\n  There is a total of 690,000 Guard and Reserve who are, right now, on \nthe front line. Each of them, I presume, has some outside employment. \nMaybe some of them are working two jobs in their civilian life. These \nare doctors, lawyers, architects, truck drivers, policemen, firemen, \nnurses. There are 90,000 of them on the front line doing the work, but \nthey are not in the bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 13 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in all of our States this is the number \nof the National Guard on active duty or alerted. You can see here that \nit is a very high percentage in many places in the country.\n  In Louisiana I have almost 40 percent of our Guard and Reserve who \nhave been called up and activated.\n  In Washington State, 46 percent, almost half of their Guard and \nReserve, have been activated.\n\n  In the State of Texas, 28 percent have been activated.\n  We can see this in every part of this Nation from the east to the \nwest. In Hawaii, 57 percent--57 percent, almost 60 percent of the Guard \nand Reserve from Hawaii have been called up to serve.\n  These numbers may fluctuate as the needs of our military and the \ndecisions made by the executive branch, the President and the Pentagon, \nchange about where to shift these forces. But every one of these \npercentages represents thousands and thousands of families who are \ntaking the direct burden of this.\n  I know we have tried to help them with pay increases. I know we have \ntried in other bills to help them improve their pensions. I have been \npart of most of those fights. I am proud to say in most of those fights \nwe have been successful--but not always. My question is, Why do we only \nhave to help the Guard and Reserve or the Active Forces in the military \nbills, in the Defense bills? Why can't we help them in our health care \nbills, in our tax cut bills, in any way we can? If we can afford it, we \nshould step up to the plate. We should step up to the plate and do it.\n  I think I heard the chairman of the Finance Committee say earlier \nthis morning that he was very proud that the Vice President himself \ncould step in, and did step in--the Vice President of the United \nStates. I think he said he stepped in to help the negotiations on a \nTransportation bill so we could get highways built in this country. I \nhope the Vice President and the President himself would step in and \nsay, ``We made a mistake,'' or ``We just missed the issue,'' or ``We \njust missed the item,'' or ``We just didn't focus on it as we should,'' \nor ``The House leadership didn't focus, and let us make it up. Let us \nput it in this bill. Let us put it in another bill to help our Guard \nand Reserve.''\n  There are many ways that this could be corrected.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I have been listening to the debate. I \nam sure putting together legislation is a very complex matter right at \nthe end of the session. I need to make a comment and ask a question.\n  I could not agree more with the state of affairs as has been \ndescribed by the Senator from Louisiana. The Guard and Reserve are \nbeing used in historic fashion. Does the Senator realize that of all \nthe part-time employees who exist in the Federal Government, the Guard \nand Reserve is the only group that does not have full-time access to \nhealth care?\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am aware.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Does the Senator further realize that \nat least half of the people called to active duty from the Guard and \nReserve leave behind civilian jobs and thus have a reduction in pay, \nsometimes substantial?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I do believe that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Does the Senator agree with me that no \nmatter what happens in the last hours of this session, that next year, \nbecause 40 percent of the people serving on active duty in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and other places are going to come from the Guard and Reserve, \nthat we need to fix this, and whatever excuses exist today why we \ncan't, that the Senate and the House need to understand that thousands \nof families are going off to get in a fight, getting injured, getting \nkilled, and having their pay cut and no health care, and that the No. 1 \npriority of the Senate and House along with whomever is the President \nnext year is to rectify some of these problems?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I thank him \nfor his help and support. I work on many issues with him, and he is, as \na member of the Guard and Reserve, most certainly aware of these \nsituations. I know the Senator from South Carolina is not asking this \nfor himself because the situation with his family is probably stable \nand steady. I know the Senator understands that many of the men and \nwomen he serves with don't have that same kind of security.\n  So we are asking them to provide security for us, and we can't find \nthe time for a page or paragraph or a letter to find security for their \nfamilies. I don't understand it and my constituents don't understand \nit. Most certainly the men and women in the Guard and Reserve in \nLouisiana, 12,000 families, do not understand it.\n  And so I frankly do not want to go home. I don't know what I would \ntell them when I do go home, how we could pass a $137 billion tax cut \nbill and forget them. How could we possibly forget them?\n  I got something from Senator Dorgan which is extremely upsetting to \nme I will speak about later today because I plan to speak and I am \ngoing to connect these dots for people. Maybe one reason we forget them \nis because there are corporate network executives demanding affiliates \ntake the name of the dying soldiers off the reports at night. That is \none way Americans could forget them. We don't want to take pictures of \nthe funerals. We don't want to put their names on the screen, so we \njust forget they are dying. I understand that. Maybe there are good \nreasons. I don't want to get into that debate because it gets us into, \nwell, some of the families want it, some of the families don't. I \nunderstand that. But still, even if they are not being scrolled on the \ntelevision, if that is not the right thing to do, surely the Senators \nand elected leaders who represent them do not need to be reminded by \nthe scrolls on television of those who died.\n  Many of us have been over to Walter Reed Hospital and visited them \npersonally. Do we need to be reminded? I don't think I had to go stand \nat the conference committee and tell Chairman Thomas. And I am going to \nspeak later today about Chairman Thomas's district and about what his \ndistrict is like, and I am sure he knows that. I have done a little \nresearch myself about that, so maybe people in his district could get \nword to our colleague because while it is important what we say to \ncolleagues, what is most important, as you know, is what our \nconstituents say to us.\n\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The third argument that I have heard from some people \nabout why I should sit down and stop talking is because some people are \nopposed to tax credits. Some people don't like tax credits. Some people \nthink it is an inefficient way to operate the Government.\n  I am not on the Finance Committee. All I know is when I run for the \nSenate and when I talk to people at home, everybody likes tax credits. \nI have tried to provide as many tax credits and some relief for a \nvariety of different individuals, and all I hear every day from this \nadministration is tax cuts, tax relief, tax credits. I hear that all \nthe time whether we have a surplus or deficit, whether we are at peace \nor war, whether we need to spur the economy or slow it down. All I hear \nfrom the administration is about tax cuts and tax credits. But there \nare Senators who come to the floor, might come to the\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nfloor and say they are going to oppose them because they don't believe \nin tax credits. So I want to put nine of the tax credits that are in \nthis bill in the Record.\n  Section 221. Modification of targeted areas in low-income communities \nfor new markets tax credits is in this bill--$1$7 billion.\n  Section 245. Credit for maintenance of railroad tracks. Establishes a \nbusiness tax credit equal to 50 percent of qualified expenditures for \nrailroad track maintenance, capped at $3,500 per mile. So we have a \ncredit in here for railroads as they maintain their tracks, and we cap \nit at $3,500 per mile. Now some good staff person could calculate how \nmany miles of railroads we have and figure up how much that costs the \ntaxpayers. Maybe it is a good thing, Mr. President. I don't know. But I \nwill tell you what would be a higher priority for the constituents in \nmy State--to send 1 mile, 1 mile of the railroad tax credit to one \nfamily so they could pay their house note.\n  No. 5. Appointment of small ethanol producer credit. Provision \nclarifies that the small producers' tax credit flows through a member \nof a cooperative.\n  No. 6. Section 339. Credit for production of low-sulfur diesel fuel. \nProvides that a small business refiner may claim a credit equal to 5 \ncents per gallon for costs paid to comply with the EPA sulfur \nregulations. The total production credit is limited to 25 percent of \nthe capital costs to come from compliance with EPA requirements.\n  No. 7. Section 341. Oil and gas from marginal wells. Some of these \nare in the State of Oklahoma, some in my State of Louisiana. It adds \nthe marginal well production tax credit. The credit is $3 a barrel of \noil or .50 percent per thousand cubic feet of gas. The credit is not \navailable if the reference price of oil exceeds $18 a barrel. The last \nI checked it was $50 a barrel. So we can give tax credits to oil \ncompanies and gallons. We can't give a paycheck to the Guard and \nReserve to put fuel in their car.\n  Now, I am obviously upset, but I am going to try to be respectful, \nbut I have to tell the truth, and that is the ugly, unvarnished, \nunedited, uncensored truth about this bill, and so we are going to stay \nhere till Thursday. I am prepared to stay here morning, noon, and \nnight. I am going to be respectful. I am not going to get into any \narguments and I am not going to raise my voice above this level. I am \nnot going to be talked down. I am not going to be spoken down to \nbecause I am not speaking for myself. I am speaking for the 5,000 men \nand women who left Louisiana and are overseas, and if I don't speak for \nthem on this floor, they don't have anyone to speak for them, so I am \nnot leaving.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute 16 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So the last minute and 16 seconds that I have this \nmorning before we vote on cloture, which I will not be voting for, I \nwant to ask my colleagues, whatever they can do in the next 4 days to \nhelp this I would appreciate it. I understand schedules are tough, and \nI am not going to make a comment if no one else says anything or shows \nup or signs a letter because I understand we have a lot of things going \non, very important things, and I would not be the least bit \ndisrespectful to my colleagues in this Chamber. But I want them to \nknow, my colleagues, that that is why I am here, and I am not leaving. \nI am not leaving this Chamber. So I want to apologize ahead of time to \nanyone I inconvenience. I hope they understand.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Harkin still has 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Not yet. There is 7 minutes in between the \nSenator from Louisiana and the next time bracket.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Harkin has 5 minutes under the order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time used in making the agreements was \n3 minutes, so unless the time is extended, Senator Harkin has 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when we started this morning we asked \nunanimous consent that the time that was taken by the leader would be \nagreed to. That was clearly in the Record. Would the Parliamentarian \nconfirm that?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. Under the current \nsituation, Senator Kennedy has 5 minutes, Senator Harkin has the \nremaining time before 12:22, Senator Byrd has 20 minutes, and then \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus have 30 minutes divided.\n  Mr. REID. Is that right, how much time Senator Harkin has left?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does Senator Harkin have?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. He has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I don't understand that. Why did we lose that time?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator yielded, and in the course of \nthat the time was used. Does the Senator wish to extend the time to the \nSenator----\n  Mr. REID. Senator Graham will need 5 minutes, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that he get 3 minutes and Senator Grassley get an extra 3 \nminutes. So that will give Senator Graham 2 minutes of Harkin's time \nplus the 3 minutes that I have asked be on our side and 3 minutes extra \non Senator Grassley's side.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. And the time for the vote to be extended \naccordingly.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized for 5 minutes, followed by the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor 5 minutes, and following that time Senator Byrd for 20 minutes and \nthereafter Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus will have 30 minutes \ndivided, and after that time expires we will have the vote. Is there \nobjection to that recitation?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I want to express my admiration \nfor the very strong and effective case the Senator from Louisiana made \nabout what are our priorities, and that is the same issue I want to \nraise. I am going to talk about when these National Guard come home, \nwill they have a job?\n  The statistics are that we are losing on average 5,000 jobs per day \nto foreign countries. That is the extent of outsourcing which is \noccurring in this country, and if there is one issue I believe the \ncountry is united on, it is that while there are things we cannot \ndirectly affect--we cannot directly affect that other countries are \ngoing to have lower wage rates and lower working conditions, we cannot \naffect the fact that some countries are going to have lower \nenvironmental standards--those you could describe as the consequences \nof the marketplace--but, Mr. President, we sure do not need to \nsocialize the outsourcing of jobs by giving additional incentives for \nAmerican companies to take American jobs to China or to any other \nforeign country, and that is exactly what this bill does. It socializes \noutsourcing by increasing substantially the tax incentives to move jobs \nout of America.\n  This proposal contains $42 billion over 10 years for a dozen or more \nprovisions, all of which are aimed at moving jobs out of the United \nStates. The actual cost is substantially more than that. Mr. President, \njust one provision of this matter which represents one-third of that \ntotal, $42 billion, do you know does not go into effect until the year \n2009? You can imagine what the real 10-year cost of this proposal is \ngoing to be. This $42 billion in international tax changes to encourage \noutsourcing is greater than the net tax cuts we are providing to \ndomestic manufacturers, and yet the whole purpose of this enterprise \nwas to increase the competitiveness of American manufacturers.\n  Let me give you one example of what we are doing. We are going to \nprovide that U.S. multinationals which have taken jobs in the past \noutside the United States and have earned a profit and now want to \nbring that profit back to the United States, that they are going to \nhave a tax rate on those repatriated funds not at the 35 percent that \ntheir American counterparts pay when they give the work in the United \nStates. Can you believe it, Mr. President, that we are going to tax \nthose repatriated funds from foreign jobs, outsourced from America, at \n5\\1/4\\ percent? That is an absolute outrage. And let me just tell you a \ngroup that is not exactly averse to outsourcing because\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\nit has publicly supported it is the President's Council of Economic \nAdvisers. In a letter, which, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record, dated October 4 from the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Mr. John W. Snow, here is what the Council of Economic \nAdvisers says:\n\n     . . . analysis indicates that this repatriation provision \n     would not produce any substantial economic benefit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, October 4, 2004\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: As you work through the conference \n     on legislation to meet our World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     obligations and repeal the current foreign sales corporation/\n     extraterritorial income (FSC/ETI) tax benefit, I write to \n     offer the Administration's views on major issues raised by \n     this important legislation.\n       First of all, I applaud your efforts to replace the current \n     FSC/ETI benefit. This legislative process has been unique, in \n     that the impetus for the legislation was a WTO ruling and \n     subsequent EU sanctions. The Administration recognizes the \n     challenges of moving a large tax bill under these \n     circumstances and appreciates the efforts you have exerted to \n     succeed.\n       In our Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) to the \n     House and Senate, the Administration emphasized its broad \n     priorities for legislation to replace FSC/ETI. These include \n     ending the European Union (EU) sanctions and promoting the \n     competitiveness of American manufacturing and other job-\n     creating sectors of the U.S. economy. As you know, the EU \n     sanctions are escalating at a rate of 1 percentage point per \n     month and will inflict an increasing burden on American \n     exporters, American workers, and the overall economy. The \n     Administration is committed to working with conferees to end \n     these sanctions as quickly as possible.\n       The Administration believes that a conference report to \n     replace FSC/ETI should be budget neutral. Both the House and \n     Senate-passed bills include a myriad of special interest tax \n     provisions that benefit few taxpayers and increase the \n     complexity of the tax code. Legislation taking up more than \n     1000 pages of statutory language (or even 400 pages) goes far \n     beyond the bill's core objective of replacing the FSC/ETI tax \n     provisions with broad-based tax relief that is WTO-compliant. \n     The Administration will work with the conferees to eliminate \n     these narrowly crafted provisions.\n       The Administration will also work to make the tax relief in \n     this bill as broad as possible to benefit all job creating \n     sectors of the American economy.\n       The Administration has strong concerns regarding the so-\n     called ``haircut'' provision in the Senate bill which would \n     needlessly complicate the tax code and interfere with the \n     ability of U.S. businesses and American workers to compete in \n     the global marketplace. Worse, the provision would deter \n     companies operating internationally from investing and \n     creating jobs in the United States. More than 5 million \n     Americans work for international companies at facilities here \n     in the United States. The Senate haircut could endanger the \n     growth of direct foreign investment into the U.S. and the \n     jobs such investment creates in the U.S. The Administration \n     urges the conferees to eliminate this provision from the \n     conference report.\n       In addition to these provisions, the Administration also \n     has concerns regarding the fairness of the repatriation \n     provision included in both bills. This provision would offer \n     international corporations a partial ``tax holiday'' for \n     repatriating foreign income that is currently held overseas. \n     U.S. companies that do not have foreign operations and have \n     already paid their full and fair share of tax will not be \n     able to benefit from this provision. Moreover, the Council of \n     Economic Advisers' analysis indicates that the repatriation \n     provision would not produce any substantial economic \n     benefits. The Administration believes the $3 billion revenue \n     cost of this provision could be better used to reduce the tax \n     burden of job creators in the United States.\n       The Administration commends the House and Senate bills for \n     including many provisions that close corporate tax loopholes \n     and tax avoidance schemes. The Administration supports \n     elimination of the Sales-In/Lease-Out tax loophole, but has \n     concerns regarding efforts to apply this proposal \n     retroactively. The Administration opposes attempts to codify \n     the Economic Substance Doctrine. The Administration supports \n     complete elimination of the ``SUV tax loophole,'' except for \n     cases where there is a demonstrated legitimate business need \n     for a large Sport Utility Vehicle.\n       The President's FY 2005 budget included energy tax \n     incentives totaling $7 billion over ten years. These \n     incentives were dedicated to alternative and renewable fuels, \n     conservation, energy efficiency and emissions-free energy. \n     During the energy bill conference, the Administration \n     expressed additional support for certain tax provisions \n     supporting the Alaskan pipeline, and encouraging investment \n     in electric transmission. Finally, as part of the highway \n     bill discussions, the Administration has expressed support \n     for shifting the ethanol tax credit (VEETC) from the Highway \n     Trust Fund to the general treasury. The Administration is \n     concerned that the energy tax title in the Senate bill goes \n     far beyond these positions and includes provisions whose \n     revenue loss greatly exceeds policies that the Administration \n     has previously agreed to. Energy tax provisions in the final \n     bill, if included at all, should be limited to only those \n     provisions mentioned above that reflect the President's \n     priorities of environmental protection and energy \n     conservation and maintain needed fiscal discipline.\n       The Administration opposes the Senate amendments which \n     effectively vitiate the Department of Labor's new rules to \n     improve the nation's outdated overtime laws. The Department's \n     revised rule strengthens overtime protections for 6.7 million \n     low-wage workers by simplifying complex eligibility tests and \n     by raising salary thresholds that have not been changed in \n     almost 30 years. In contrast, the Harkin amendment would lock \n     in the old overtime standards and part of the new overtime \n     standards, requiring each job to be analyzed twice, once \n     under the old rules, which are no longer in effect, and once \n     under the new rules proposed by the Department of Labor which \n     would have been in effect for months. Consistent with past \n     Administration positions, if the Harkin amendment or other \n     limitations to the Department of Labor's rule making \n     authority is included in the final version of the FSCETI \n     legislation, the President's senior advisors would recommend \n     that he veto the bill.\n       The Administration is open to a tobacco buyout as long as \n     it meets certain conditions. We believe the buyout must end \n     all aspects of the tobacco program and not replace them, \n     should do so at a reasonable cost that is fully offset, and \n     should be consistent with WTO rules. The Administration \n     promises to work with interested parties to craft a tobacco \n     buyout that ends federal subsidies of tobacco growers while \n     meeting these criteria.\n       On behalf of the Administration, let me express our \n     willingness to provide assistance during the deliberations of \n     the conference committee. I look forward to working with you \n     to enacting legislation that removes the threat of escalating \n     EU sanctions and encourages economic growth and job creation \n     here at home.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John W. Snow.\n\n  The administration believes the $3 billion of revenue cost of this \nprovision could be better used to reduce the tax burden of job creators \nin the United States.\n  That is what the administration says about just one of these dozens \nof provisions.\n  I have been here for 18 years. Mr. President, you have been here much \nlonger, but I cannot imagine a proposal that would be more repugnant to \nthe American people and more averse to our long-term economic \ninterests.\n  We have a major challenge in this country. How does the United States \nremain globally competitive with a standard of living that in some \ncases is 10 times that of our competitors? We certainly are not going \nto do it by socializing with our tax dollars the movement of our jobs--\nthe jobs of those National Guardsmen who will be coming back from Iraq \nand other foreign countries.\n  This is only one of the many deficiencies in this legislation, but it \nis a core issue that goes to the global future of the economy of the \nUnited States and the future of those men and women who are returning \nto their jobs from Iraq.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, ours is a government of the people, by \nthe people and for the people. And we should be judged as U.S. Senators \nin fulfilling that commitment by how well we put the needs of average \nAmericans first. Middle class families are the backbone of America. Our \nfirst duty is to them--for a secure nation, for good jobs, for healthy \nfamilies, for good schools, and safe neighborhoods.\n\n  This bill betrays that solemn duty. On issue after issue, page after \npage, it puts the interests of big corporations ahead of the public \ninterest--ahead of the hopes and dreams and everyday needs of the \nmiddle class.\n  It puts the profits of big tobacco corporations ahead of the health \nof our children. The Senate adopted the proposal by the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. DeWine, to prohibit tobacco companies from marketing \ncigarettes to children.\n  There is absolutely no doubt that tobacco companies are spending $11 \nbillion each year to lure our children into smoking. Every day, 5,000 \nchildren smoke for the first time. More than one-third of those will be \nregular daily\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\nsmokers by the time they graduate from high school.\n  What future do they have to look forward to? Years of battling \ncancer? A painful and premature death? Never getting the chance to \nwatch their own children grow up and get married? Never living long \nenough to bounce their grandchildren on their knees? Is that what \nparents want for their children?\n  Tobacco use kills more Americans every year than AIDS, alcohol, car \naccidents, murders, suicides, and fires combined. Nearly 1 in 3 cancer \ndeaths, and 1 in 5 deaths from heart disease are tobacco-related.\n  In fact, smoking is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America. \nWe had a chance to bring to an end the largest disinformation campaign \nin the history of the corporate world. We had a chance to save our \nchildren from this scourage--to save them from the clutches of the \ntobacco companies. But the tobacco companies carried the day in \nCongress and the House leadership said no.\n  Is that what ``the people'' want? Is that government ``for the \npeople''? I don't think so.\n  The Senate passed an amendment by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \nto stop the Bush administration's misguided efforts to eliminate your \novertime pay. That is right. President Bush says to millions of middle \nclass workers that they no longer deserve the right to overtime pay. \nAnd the Harkin amendment would have stopped the Bush administration \nfrom doing that.\n  This comes from an administration that is already costing us jobs. In \nfact, we learned on Friday that President Bush will be the first \nPresident since Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression over 70 years \nago to lose jobs on his watch--a total of 1.6 million private sector \njobs. And now, on top of that, the President wants to reward his \nspecial interest friends by taking away overtime from more than 6 \nmillion hard-working Americans. On five separate occasions, the House \nand the Senate have voted to preserve overtime protections, but the \nWhile House stripped them from this bill.\n  Make no mistake--overtime cuts are pay cuts.\n  Is that what ``the people'' want? Is that government ``for the \npeople''? I don't think so.\n  Finally, this bill outsources jobs.\n  Middle class families across America live in fear every day that \ntheir good jobs will be shipped overseas. The people expect us to \nprotect their jobs. But this bill provides a stunning $42 billion in \nnew tax breaks for multinational corporations that will make it easier \nfor them to export your jobs.\n  Imagine that. You are working had every day, playing by the rules, \ntrying to provide for your family, and faithfully paying your taxes. \nAnd this bill uses your tax dollars to ship your job overseas.\n  This bill is of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the \ncorporations. It is a lobbyist's dream and a middle class nightmare. It \nis an embarrassment to representative government. I urge my colleagues \nto reject it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is now \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, the honorable Ted Stevens, a great \nSenator from the State of Alaska; as a matter of fact, the Senator of \nthe 20th century for the State of Alaska.\n  On this Sabbath Day in which the Senate convenes in an extraordinary \nsession, I read from the King James Version of the Holy Bible, Exodus \n35, verses 1 through 3.\n\n       And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of \n     Israel together and said unto them, These are the words which \n     the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them.\n       Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there \n     shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: \n     whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.\n       Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the \n     sabbath day.\n\n  I now read from the Ten Commandments, again King James Version of the \nHoly Bible, Exodus 20, verses 8 through 10.\n\n       Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.\n       Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:\n       But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in \n     it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy \n     daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy \n     cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:\n       For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, \n     and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: \n     wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed \n     it.\n\n  That is the Fourth Commandment passed down from God to Moses and from \nMoses to the Israelites. Those words are holy for people of many \nfaiths. Christians and Jews are bound to follow the Ten Commandments. \nMuslims, too, hold dear a similar lesson from the Koran, and scores of \nmillions from that faith also make strict observance of their own day \nof rest.\n  But today the Senate has been called into session despite the words \nof the Fourth Commandment. Moreover, the matter being debated today is \nno question of life or death. There is no dire emergency that brings us \nhere on this Sabbath Day. There is no emergency that demands the \nelected representatives of the American people place the pursuit of \ntheir work over the importance of their faith. No, the Senate has been \ncalled in on a Sunday for a mere procedural vote. What would be the \nconsequences if the Senate were not called into session today for a \nsingle vote on cloture? It would only mean that the matter before the \nSenate might take 1 day longer to complete. What a tragedy that would \nbe.\n  Must we ignore the sanctity of the Sabbath just to call the Senate \ninto session and have Senate staff come in from their homes throughout \nthe nearby area in order to cast one procedural vote? The Senate should \nnot be in this position. Our staffs and their families, our own selves \nand our families should not be in this position.\n  This Chamber, on the whole, has an excellent record for accommodating \nthe faiths of those who serve the American people. It has become \nroutine for the Senate to temporarily suspend its business so that \nSenators, both Christians and Jews, can carry out their religious \nservices and their religious observances. In fact, I suggested \nyesterday that all the Senate would need to do would be to delay the \nvote until Sunday, today. That would be in accordance with the \nobserving of the old Sabbath. That is when the Sabbath traditionally \nends. If only there were a delay in this afternoon's vote by 5\\1/2\\ \nhours, Senators would not have been forced to choose between our \nresponsibilities to our Nation and honoring our Sabbath, our day of \nrest and prayer. This suggestion was rejected.\n  What is the rush to have this particular vote on a Sunday afternoon? \nMost of us would like to have observed this Sunday afternoon and this \nmorning prior to noon with our families, would like to have observed \nthe opportunity to go to the church or the churches of our faith. What \nis the urgent need to keep Senators and our staffs away from their \nfamilies on this, a day of rest? What message does this send to the \nAmerican people?\n  I do not believe a Sunday session of the Senate for such a trivial \nmatter as a procedural vote sets a good example for Christians around \nthis country or Christians around the world. It does not set a good \nexample for anyone who wishes to observe the Fourth Commandment. And \nfor what?\n  The Senate has been thrown into too much confusion as we rush to \nfinish too much business in too short a time. I have said repeatedly \nthe Senate should not be rushed in its business, especially on complex \nmatters of great national importance. It is a disservice to those whom \nwe are elected to represent.\n  Now we see that there is another side of that coin. \nThe uncontrollable zeal to get business done as soon as possible has \nresulted in a decision that is a disservice to those who work in this \nChamber. Because of this poor planning, many of us and our families are \nbeing forced to give short shrift to our observance of the Sabbath. \nThat is not right.\n\n  I am a Christian. I don't claim to be the best Christian around. My \nmom and dad were great Christian people. They had never been to school \nvery much. I have heard someone on the campaign trail say he is the \nfirst in his family line to graduate from college. Let me say I am the \nfirst to enter the third grade in all of my line, my parentage, my \nancestor line.\n  I can say this, though: My old dad and mom who raised me--I was an \norphan at the age of 1; my mother died in the influenza epidemic of \n1918--the\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\nkind people who raised me were very religious. They didn't carry it \naround on their sleeve. They did not go around criticizing other \npeople. They practiced. I can remember many times after I had gone to \nbed hearing my Christian mother on her knees, down in another room, \npraying, praying, praying. That old coal miner dad who was my uncle--I \ncalled him my dad--he was the only dad I ever knew, really. He was a \ncoal miner. When he died and left this world he didn't owe any man a \npenny. He never criticized anybody else. I didn't hear him ever in all \nmy years use God's name in vain. So those were my Christian parents. I \nwas raised that way.\n  I profess today to be a Christian. I don't profess to be good. The \nBible says no man is good, so I don't say that I am good. But I am a \nChristian. And there are millions like me in this country and around \nthe world who believe that we should keep the Sabbath Day holy and \nremember it.\n  In this modern world of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week commerce and \nenterprise, keeping the Commandments and remembering the Sabbath, to \nkeep it holy, may seem an antiquated notion to some. But it is, \nnevertheless, a central pillar of many faiths, and it reflects the \nprinciple on which this Nation was founded: ``One Nation, under God.''\n  Now, I do not try to press my faith on anybody else. I am like Samuel \nAdams, a few years before the Constitutional Convention, when he said: \nI can listen to any prayer--any prayer. And so can I. I can listen to \nthe Muslim prayer. I can listen to the prayer of the Jewish people. I \ncan listen to the Catholics as they pray. I am willing to listen to any \nprayer. I do not attempt to press my religion on anybody else.\n  But I think we as a Senate, here in the eyes of the American people \nand the world on the Sabbath, do not give a very good impression. We \nought to set the example. We in the Senate ought to set the example.\n  Of course, if the ox or the ass were in the pit, as the Bible says, \nthen pull him out if it is on the Sabbath. But the ox is not in the \nditch. That is not why we are here. We are not here because of some \ndire emergency that threatens the lives of the American people. This is \nnot a dire emergency. This could easily have been put over until \ntomorrow.\n  I have been the majority leader of this Senate in some years past. I \nhave been the minority leader of this Senate in some years past. I know \nsomething about the rules. I may have forgotten more than some will \never learn, but I can remember the powers of the majority leader. And \nit is within any majority leader's power to put this matter over until \nMonday. It could have been done yesterday. And it could still be done. \nBut we are here. The staffs have been called out now. Senators are \nhere. And so we have to observe what the leadership has ruled. We are \nhere. But I would say, it was unnecessary.\n  I am sorry that the Senate is in today. We would not have lost \nanything by waiting until tomorrow. But it has been done.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator has 4 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot about religion these days. I say, let's \npractice a little of it here in the Senate and on the campaign trail. I \nhope the Senate in future years will not repeat this mistake of \nunnecessarily sacrificing the observance of the Sabbath on the altar of \npolitical expediency. We could have done better.\n  We waste a lot of time here. There were many days when we could have \nbeen in and we could have been doing the work of the people, the work \nof the Senate, but we chose not to be in. These are workdays I am \ntalking about, many of them throughout the year that is past, some of \nthem recent. The work could have been done. It was not necessary to \nback this work up to the point that we have to come in here on a \nSabbath--on a Sabbath--to vote. And for what? A mere procedural matter.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the current occupant of the Chair \nfor yielding me 5 minutes from this bill.\n\n\n                      Delay Of Conference Reports\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the Senate once more to ask that the Senate \nconsider what is delaying the Homeland Security bill and the Military \nConstruction bill which carry with them the money for the hurricane \nrecovery in the southeastern part of this country, including Florida.\n  I first want to say to my good friend from West Virginia, he reminds \nme very much of the comments my grandmother used to say to me about \ndoing things on Sunday. And we tried to observe the commands of the \nBible.\n  This is not the first Sunday since I have been in the Senate, in 36 \nyears, that we have had to meet. I, too, regret we have to meet on \nSunday. But we are meeting today primarily because of the objection of \none man. We should have taken up the Military Construction bill and the \nHomeland Security bill when it arrived from the House last evening. The \nHouse of Representatives had passed both of those bills in the course \nof about 2 minutes, and not one person spoke against those bills. It \nwas a unanimous vote on both those bills.\n  They came over here--and I congratulate the minority leader. \nYesterday, when we opened the Senate, he said, without question--\nwithout question--we should pass the Homeland Security bill and the \nMilitary Construction bill before we leave.\n  The impact of this is an astounding delay because of one Senator, the \nother Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, who is objecting because of an \noffset that was used in the Military Construction bill to enable us to \nproceed with the drought provisions in the bill.\n  For the first time, we are putting up money to assist the people who \nare suffering around the country, primarily farmers, from drought. We \nneeded an offset. This is the same offset we took once before. And we \nstraightened out the program after that borrowing of budget authority \nwas used effectively.\n  Now, I told the Senate last night I was informed that last evening \nFEMA ran out of money. On October 1, it had $836 million, including a \n$500 million carryover from fiscal year 2004. There was a $336 million \napportionment under the continuing resolution, which was intended to \nlast until November 20, but because of the demands in Florida, they \nhave run out of money. And we want to see these bills passed.\n  We and the leadership on both sides tried to clear this bill. We are \nprimarily here voting on this cloture now rather than tomorrow because \nwe had to come in in order to qualify cloture votes for tomorrow. We \nwill not vote on the Military Construction and Homeland Security bills \nuntil tomorrow because one Senator--one Senator--wants to delay them.\n  Now, I want the Senate to know--this is my last year as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee--we have worked hard with Congressman \nYoung on the other side, who is from Florida and is very disturbed \nabout the delay. We worked our committees, and worked them literally \nnight and day, particularly the staffs, to get these bills ready to \nmove. And the Senator from West Virginia says we should only be working \nif it is an emergency. Well, it is true there are emergency bills right \nbehind this bill.\n\n  I would hope we would get cloture and pass this bill as quickly as we \ncan so we can move to the Military Construction bill. We cannot \ninterfere now. We cannot call up the Military Construction bill or the \nHomeland Security bill until this process is over.\n  But I urge the Senate, every Member of the Senate, to talk to Senator \nHarkin and ask him not to delay these bills any longer. These bills \nwill take time to prepare and get what we call enrolled, and then they \nwill be signed by the Speaker of the House and by the Vice President or \nmyself, and they will go to the President. That could be done today. \nThat could be done today, if this one Senator will relent in this \nprocedure to delay these two bills.\n  I do not understand why the Homeland Security bill has been delayed \nat all. We were ready to put it in what we call wrap-up last night. The \nSenator from West Virginia and I and all those connected with it said: \nLet's just pass this. It has passed the House without objection at all.\n  The matter was reviewed by the Senator from Arizona. I am pleased to \nsay\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\nfor one time we are in total agreement. That bill does not have to have \nany re-specification of anything we put in that bill that would raise \nthe objection of my friend from Arizona. And he is my friend, despite \nour disputes.\n  But I tell the Senate, it is time to pass the Military Construction \nbill and the Homeland Security bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have 2\\1/2\\ minutes left.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, who is the President pro tempore and the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, this man has, throughout the year, \nsought to keep the Senate on schedule and to not only have the \ncommittee report out all of the 13 bills but to have the Senate pass \nthem. I think if all of us had worked as diligently as the Senator from \nAlaska to get the work done, we would not be here today.\n  Now, I hesitate to mention a Senator by name--the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska has done that--and that Senator is not on the \nfloor. But let me say, whether we like it or not, that Senator was \nwithin his rights.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, he was.\n  Mr. BYRD. And the Senator from Alaska might be in the same position \none day, and I may be.\n  The blame here should be placed in a manner on the whole Senate and \nparticularly, I have to say, the leadership of the Senate. The \nRepublican leadership is in control so I think they bear the greatest \nresponsibility. As I said yesterday, we all are at fault a little bit. \nBut my complaint is not against a Senator. My complaint is the way we \nhave done our work all year long. We dilly dallied, delayed, and had \nseveral days out of session when we could have been in, could have been \ndoing our work. That goes for our recent times as well.\n  I say there is where the overall fault lies. I am sorry that because \nof that, we have been backed up with our backs up against a timeline \nhere when we are about to go out for a Presidential election. And we \nshould not have been put in this position. We should have done this \nwork earlier. I say it was wrong to come in on the Sabbath Day. It \ndidn't have to be done. I regret it.\n  I thank the Chair and all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I want to speak a \nlittle bit about the conference report and maybe a little bit about \nSenator Landrieu's amendment.\n  First, I wish to compliment Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for \ntheir leadership on this bill. The FSC/ETI bill was a very complicated \nbill. The Senate provisions alone--there were 276 provisions--dealt \nwith about $180 billion of tax increases and tax cuts, a very \ncomplicated bill, very confusing bill. It had international provisions. \nBut it was very important that we move forward, and we moved forward to \nbasically--I started to say--become compliant with the World Trade \nOrganization because they were imposing sanctions on U.S. exports, fees \nof 12 percent escalating 1 percent per month going up to 17 percent. So \nit was important that we resolve that problem.\n  Most people think the conference report solves that situation. I \ncompliment them for it. The bill that came back from conference was a \nbetter bill than left the Senate--frankly, a much better bill. There \nare a lot fewer provisions. There were many amendments that were left \nout. I know the Senator from Louisiana is upset about her amendment \nbeing left out. There were hundreds of amendments left out, some of \nwhich have a lot of merit, some probably didn't have merit. I don't \nhappen to agree with her amendment, and I want to touch on that for a \nsecond.\n  First, I want to finish on the FSC/ETI bill. The underlying premise \nof the FSC/ETI bill--which I am going to support, and I urge our \ncolleagues to vote for cloture so we can finish this bill--is that we \nare going to give a benefit to manufacturers, a lower corporate rate \nthan other corporations. I happen to disagree with that. I used to be a \nmanufacturer. I used to run a manufacturing company, Nickles Machine \nCorporation. We made engine parts. We sold them around the world. \nManufacturers get a lower rate, and we do it in this bill in the form \nof not a rate reduction but in the form of an exclusion of income. I \nthink a rate would be a much simpler way to go, and I think it should \napply to all corporations.\n  What we do in this bill is, we give an exclusion for a certain amount \nof income, I think 3 percent the first 2 years, 6 percent the next 3 \nyears, and then 9 percent beyond that. The net effect of that for most \ncorporations is, the corporate rate would go into effect 34 percent and \nthen 33 percent and then 32 percent, if you are a manufacturer. If you \nare not a manufacturer but happen to be a corporation, in other words, \nyou do professional services, maybe an attorney or maybe a doctor or \nsomething, or you have an accounting firm or you have a financial firm, \nif you have financial services, you are going to be taxed at a higher \nrate.\n  I think we should have a uniform corporate rate. It is a mistake. You \nhave a lot of companies that do both. They are a manufacturer and they \nprovide financial services or they provide other services. So you are \ngoing to find them having to segregate their income--this part is \nmanufacturing, this part is financial or other services. That is going \nto mean asking for a lot of audits, a lot of confusion, and maybe \nproblems with the IRS and future Congresses. Future Congresses also \nwill be dabbling with the definition of manufacturer because there are \na lot of people defined in this bill as manufacturers that a lot of us \nwouldn't think of as manufacturers; i.e., individuals involved in \narchitectural engineering, or individuals or companies that are \nconstruction or software companies or oil companies or extraction \ncompanies. There are software companies, the film industry. You have a \nlot of industries that aren't normally thought of as manufacturing and \nare now defined as manufacturing.\n\n  When people realize there is a 10-percent lower corporate rate if you \nare defined as a manufacturer, my guess is you will have a lot of \nfuture interest and amendments. The lobbyists will be very big trying \nto make sure that whoever their client is is defined as a manufacturer. \nSo the number of manufacturing jobs, which has been on a fairly steady \ndecline for the last 40 years--it has bounced up in the last year--will \nincrease dramatically, not because there are more manufacturing jobs, \nbut because more jobs are defined as manufacturing. I don't think that \nis good policy.\n  I have mentioned that. I know Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus \nare well aware of my concerns. I tried to fight that fight along with \nSenator Kyl. We were not successful. We tried every way we could, but \nwe didn't win on that one. But it is important that we become WTO \ncompliant. It is important that we pass a bill. I don't think we are \ngoing to solve the problem I am talking about in differentials in the \nnext 3 months or, frankly, the next 6 months. So I urge our colleagues \nto vote in favor of it.\n  In relation to the Landrieu amendment, her discussion on it, I \nappreciate her passion. But no one on her side raised this amendment. I \nsat in the conference for days. She had her chance. There were hundreds \nof amendments that were not adopted. I don't happen to agree with the \nsubstance of her amendment. But everyone was entitled to have their \nchance. Chairman Grassley insisted on having the entire Finance \nCommittee represented in the conference. I compliment him for that. It \nwas a very open, fair conference. All Senators who were on the Finance \nCommittee were represented, were there, or could have attended. So \nagain, sometimes you don't win on your amendments.\n  I compliment again Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. I urge our \ncolleagues to vote in favor of cloture.\n\n\n                                recusal\n\n  Mr. KOHL. It has come to my attention that Section 886 of H.R. 4520, \nthe Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act, applies to the \nownership of sports franchises. As owner of the Milwaukee Bucks \nbasketball team, I have serious concerns that this provision creates a \npotential conflict of interest.\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\nWhile I was previously unaware of this provision as one of the many tax \nsimplifications included in the bill, I have decided to recuse myself \nfrom further votes on this issue.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage \nof the JOBS bill conference report. This legislation is a positive step \ntoward alleviating the pain put on the manufacturing sector by the \nWorld Trade Organization tariffs, providing domestic companies with a \nsizable tax deduction that will help to create jobs, and simplifying \nour international tax regime.\n  Most importantly, though, it pays for itself. By eradicating a number \nof abusive tax shelters, this bill does not add to our deficit; it \nplugs holes that have been exploited in the Tax Code while ensuring \nthis important tax relief is not at the expense of future generations.\n  I am also quite partial to a provision aimed at rectifying an \ninequity that has existed for over 18 years. The residents of the seven \nStates without an income tax have been treated unfairly under the Tax \nCode since 1986. I applaud the conferees for including a temporary 2-\nyear benefit for citizens of these States, allowing them to deduct the \nState sales taxes they pay from their Federal income tax liability. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to once again make this \nbenefit permanent, but I thank the conferees for including this \nimportant tax relief for the citizens of Florida and the other States \nwithout an income tax.\n  One part of the Senate-passed bill that did not make it into the \nfinal package would have dealt with our National Guard and Reservists \nwho are performing so admirably overseas. I am deeply troubled by the \nomission of tax relief for the employers continuing to pay the salaries \nof their employees who have been called to active duty in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This was inexplicably left on the cutting room floor in \nconference, and I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure this \noversight is remedied. We owe this tax relief to the patriotic \nemployers who have helped to ease the financial burden of serving \noverseas by continuing to pay their active duty employees.\n  I also am troubled by the absence of another Senate-passed component \nto the bill: FDA regulation for tobacco. This issue has received strong \nsupport in the U.S. Senate, so the House acted unilaterally, ignoring \nthe will of the Senate and the bipartisan agreement that any buyout \nalso would include regulation of tobacco.\n  Another aspect of this that disappoints me is the tobacco buyout \nassessment provision that emerged from conference. This rule places a \ngreater burden on Florida companies, specifically Florida cigar \nmanufacturers, than cigar manufacturers from other States. This new \nprovision creates an assessment on cigar manufacturers to pay for the \nbuyout of tobacco farmers even though they do not use the types of \ntobacco being bought out. It amounts to a $282 million price tag, \nleaving Florida companies to pay more than 75 percent of this \nassessment.\n  There are a number of other small issues in this bill that may be \noverlooked, but which mean a great deal to local economies. One that \nwill have a profound effect on Florida deals with motorsports \nfacilities. As you know, Florida is home to a great racing tradition \nand to the world famous Daytona International Speedway, as well as the \nMiami-Homestead International Speedway, and a host of other smaller \nrace facilities. For decades, these tracks have been allowed to \ndepreciate their property over 7 years. Recently, however, the IRS has \nquestioned this classification.\n  I am delighted the FSC/ETI bill encourages continued investment by \ncodifying the 7-year classification from the date of enactment through \nJanuary 1, 2008. This is an excellent start. I am hopeful the IRS will \nrecognize the legislative intent of this body and reconsider any new \ninterpretation of the law. The action taken in this tax bill indicates \nthe revenue procedures were not clear, so Congress acted to provide \nclarity.\n  I urge Congress to revisit this issue as soon as possible to provide \nthe ongoing certainty that is needed to plan substantial investments in \nnew track construction and expansion.\n  As with any conference report, I am not completely satisfied with \nthis package. It is not perfect. There are omissions. It does not go \nfar enough in some respects, and I would argue it goes too far in \nothers. But legislating is all about compromise, and all in all, this \nbill is a good compromise. It adhered to the tenets of the Senate-\npassed bill, and will achieve its stated goal--finally ending the \ntariffs that have so burdened American manufacturers.\n  I am comfortable rising in support of this tax relief package, and I \nam confident any inadequacies will be addressed in due time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate FSC-ETI bill contained $19 \nbillion in energy tax incentives that supported the diversification of \nthe Nation's energy supply, conservation, and efficiency.\n  Although few of those provisions survived the House-Senate \nconference, I am pleased that the conference report extends and expands \nthe Section 45 production tax credit for renewable energy resources.\n  My thanks to Senators Grassley and Baucus, as well as 36 Senators who \nrecently joined me in a letter to conferees urging the adoption of this \nvery important renewable-energy provision.\n  The Section 45 production tax credit works.\n  Siince its initial adoption in 1992, wind energy has become the \nfastest growing energy source in the world.\n  Other renewable energy resources like geothermal, solar and biomass \nenergy will now be able to enjoy that same growth potential.\n  We know that renewable energy can provide a steady supply of \nelectricity that is made in the USA.\n  We know it will spur economic investment and new technology, and \ncreate thousands of jobs.\n  According to the Department of Energy, tripling geothermal production \nby the year 2010 would stimulated $61 billion of domestic investment, \ncreate 1.6 million person-years of new employment, and add $180 million \nto State and Federal government treasuries from royalties.\n\n  The Western Governors Association projects the Department of Energy's \ninitiative to deploy 1,000 megawatts of concentrating solar power in \nthe southwestern area of the United States would create approximately \n7,000 jobs and estimated expenditures of more than $2 billion in the \nnext decade.\n  We know it can protect our environment and reduce global warming. And \nwe know it can help reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\n  The renewable energy resource is unlimited.\n  Once we build the facilities, the fuel is free.\n  In simple terms, ``batteries are included'' with renewable energy \nfacilities.\n  The sun will shine for a billion years, the wind will blow as long as \nour planet survives, and the heat of the Earth is the most abundant \nresource in the world.\n  My State and many others are rich in renewable energy.\n  Nevada is the Saudi Arabia of Geothermal energy.\n  I am proud that Nevada has set some of the highest goals in the \nNation for developing renewable energy. We are going to steadily \nincrease our electricity generated from renewable sources toward a goal \nof 15 percent by 2013.\n  The Section 45 provision in the FSC-ETI bill is an important step on \nthe road to diversifying the Nation's energy supply by increasing our \nuse of renewable energy resources, but our job is not done.\n  This provision only extends the Section 45 production tax credit for \n15 months.\n  We need to extend the Section 45 production tax credit for renewable \nenergy resources from 15 months to a minimum of 5 years.\n  It is also important that we work to include tradeable credits to \npublic power utilities and rural electric cooperatives, which serve 25 \npercent of the Nation's power customers, by allowing them to transfer \ntheir credits to taxable entities.\n  I will work to make that happen in the next session of Congress.\n  Once again, I want to thank the managers of this bill for shepherding \nthe expansion and extension of the Section 45 production tax credit in \nthis legislation.\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\n  We must diversify our Nation's energy portfolio with clean, renewable \nenergy resources. We must accept this commitment for the energy \nsecurity of the U.S., for the protection of our environment, and for \nthe health of the American people.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nconference agreement for H.R. 4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of \n2004. I voted against this legislation when it was reported out of the \nSenate Finance Committee and again when it was approved by the full \nSenate, so I would like to explain why I am reluctantly supporting the \nconference agreement.\n  I was a conferee for this conference agreement and am supporting it \nfor four reasons. First, the legislation makes necessary improvements \nto the way the United States taxes foreign-source income. These changes \nare a good first step at rationalizing the way we tax U.S.-based \nmultinational companies. Second, the conference agreement dropped many \nof the tax increases that were included in the Senate-passed bill that \nwould have inappropriately raised taxes on many U.S. businesses. Third, \nSenator Grassley has committed to work with me on broad-based corporate \ntax reforms next year. Finally, I am supporting the conference \nagreement because it is important to come into compliance with our \ninternational obligations.\n  The conference agreement includes some very worthwhile provisions. \nMost importantly, it reforms and simplifies the way we tax U.S.-based \nmultinational businesses. Under current law, U.S.-based multinational \ncompanies are subject to a tax system that was designed in the 1960s, \nthat we have failed to modernize as global business transformed and \ngrew, and that has only been modified when Congress needed to raise \nrevenues. As such, the system is inconsistent and inefficient and \nsubjects U.S.-based companies to double-taxation, all of which put our \ncompanies at a disadvantage vis-a-vis their foreign competitors. The \nconference agreement fixes a number of these problems.\n  First, the conference agreement addresses two very serious problems \nwith our foreign tax credit system. The U.S. tax system is a worldwide \nsystem, meaning we tax the income of U.S. taxpayers no matter where it \nis earned. The problem with such a system is that income is double-\ntaxed, once by a foreign jurisdiction and again by the United States. \nBecause many other countries only tax income that is earned within \ntheir borders, U.S. companies face double-taxation while many of their \nforeign competitors do not. To avoid this problem, the U.S. gives \ntaxpayers credits for taxes paid to a foreign jurisdiction, which are \nused to offset U.S. tax liability. If the system worked perfectly, the \nnet result would be that corporate income is taxed one time at the U.S. \nrate of 35 percent. The problem is that the system does not work \nperfectly; there are so many restrictions on the ability to use foreign \ntax credits that, in practice, foreign earnings are often double-taxed. \nFurther, under current law, unused foreign tax credits can only be \ncarried forward 5 years, after which time they expire, resulting in \npermanent double-taxation. The conference agreement does two things: \nFirst, it eliminates many of the restrictions on using foreign tax \ncredits by reducing the number of ``baskets'' that the different types \nof credits are segregated into from nine to two, making it much easier \nto use foreign tax credits. Second, the conference agreement extends \nthe carryforward period to 10 years so that taxpayers have twice as \nlong to use foreign tax credits before they expire. Both of these \nchanges are very important and are a big part of the reason I am \nsupporting the conference agreement.\n  The conference agreement also reforms the ``interest allocation \nrules,'' which can have the perverse effect of making it more expensive \nfor U.S. companies to build new U.S. facilities by restricting a \ncompany's ability to deduct interest payments used to finance the \nconstruction of such facilities. The conference agreement gives \ncompanies a one-time choice of how to allocate and apportion their \ninterest expenses so that if a company elects the new ``worldwide \nfungibility'' approach instead of current treatment, interest expenses \nincurred in the United States would only be allocated against foreign-\nsource income in certain restricted circumstances. This also makes it \nless likely that U.S. companies will have their use of foreign tax \ncredits restricted, thereby alleviating the problem of double-taxation. \nLike the foreign tax credit reforms I mentioned earlier, the interest \nallocation reforms are another reason I am supporting this legislation.\n  I want to express my disappointment with the centerpiece of this \nlegislation, however. I continue to be concerned that the manufacturing \ndeduction represents poor tax policy because it establishes for the \nfirst time a lower tax rate for one segment of our business community--\nmanufacturing--while continuing to impose the higher 35 percent rate on \nall other U.S. businesses. Sound tax policy should be fair and neutral \nand the manufacturing deduction is neither. I expect that this \nprovision will cause a great deal of ``game-playing'' as \ncompanies strive to define as much of their activity as possible as \n``manufacturing'' to more greatly benefit from the deduction. As a \nresult, I believe that the Treasury Department is correct when it \npredicts that we will see an increase in audits and litigation as a \nresult of this provision.\n\n  I noted that, for the first time, Congress has established a \nbifurcated corporate tax rate system in this legislation. Non-\nmanufacturing companies also create good jobs, contribute to our \ngrowing economy, and compete with lower-taxed foreign companies just \nlike U.S. manufacturers, yet these companies do not see tax rate relief \nin this legislation. It would have been far better to have provided a \ncorporate rate reduction across-the-board for all U.S. companies. This \nwould have avoided the game-playing, would have been far simpler for \ntaxpayers and the government to administer, and would have made the \nUnited States a more attractive place to do business. This last point \nis important. Our combined federal and state tax rate is 40 percent, \nwhile in Asia the rate is 30.4 percent, and in Europe the rate is 27.7 \npercent. Our trading partners have been aggressively cutting their \ncorporate tax rates. It is time the Congress stop trying to set \nindustrial policy through targeted tax preferences and confront our \nhigh corporate income tax rate directly. I urged my colleagues to take \nthis approach, and while many of my colleagues agreed with me, this \neffort did not prevail. I predict that, in time, Congress will repeal \nthe manufacturing deduction and replace it with a corporate tax rate \nreduction. Canada had a similar manufacturing deduction in place and \nfound it to be so complex, subject to abuse, and such a source of tax \ncontroversies that Canada eventually replaced it with a lower corporate \ntax rate.\n  Because of my serious concerns about the manufacturing deduction, I \nam pleased that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley has agreed \nto work with me on a review of our corporate tax structure, including \nnot only corporate income tax rates, but also on making the lower tax \nrates on dividends and capital gains permanent. I appreciate his offer \nand look forward to working with him on this important issue.\n  The conference agreement drops some of the special interest tax \nprovisions that were included in the Senate-passed bill. I am \ndisappointed, however, that other tax subsidies, such as various tax \nsubsidies for electricity production, were retained in the conference \nagreement. In this era of budget consciousness, I would much prefer to \nuse scare revenue offsets to enact meaningful, pro-growth, broad-based \ntax reforms that will have a positive effect on the overall U.S. \neconomy. While some of these provisions might be justifiable, we should \nalways keep in mind that the purpose of our tax system is to raise \nrevenue for the Federal Government in the most efficient means \npossible, and not to reward special interests. I firmly believe we \nshould focus on broad-based tax relief that provides growth-oriented \nincentives. This would make our system of taxing business income far \nmore efficient for the Federal Government and for taxpayers alike, and \nmost importantly, it would foster greater economic growth and help \nbusinesses create jobs. The conference agreement we consider today \nlargely provides the opposite result and thus accentuates the\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\ngreat need for tax reform. The President has expressed support for \ncomprehensive tax reform and I fully intend to work with him on that \nproject.\n  This conference agreement is revenue neutral, which, in itself is not \na bad thing, but should not be a prerequisite for tax legislation. \nRevenue neutrality means that there are as many tax increases as tax \ncuts, and we must be very careful about increasing taxes. I am pleased \nthat in the conference committee we were able to eliminate several of \nthe more troubling provisions we euphemistically refer to as revenue \nraisers, including the codification of the ``economic substance \ndoctrine'' and the taxation of certain settlements, fines and \npenalties. Quite simply, these are tax increases--sometimes warranted, \nif we are closing unintended loopholes, but tax increases nonetheless. \nCongress should approve tax changes to improve the conditions of the \neconomy and to leave more money with the taxpayers who earned it and \nshould not be bound by strict rules of revenue neutrality. We must \nremember that tax cuts and spending are not the same and do not have \nthe same effect on the economy or on the Federal budget. Tax cuts allow \nAmerican families, business owners, and investors to keep more of their \nown money, which encourages economic activity. Increased economic \nactivity brings additional tax revenues into the Federal government, \nthus improving our budgetary situation. Unlike tax cuts, new spending \nrequires the government to take control of a bigger slice of the \neconomy, which hinders economic growth. I encourage my colleagues to \nrefuse to be bound to ``revenue neutrality'' for its own sake, but to \npursue rational tax policies on their merits.\n  Finally, this legislation repeals our export tax subsidy that was \njudged to be illegal by the World Trade Organization, WTO. While I have \nserious concerns about the commitments made by our negotiators that led \nto this result, the United States nonetheless must abide by the \nagreements we make. Repeal of the export subsidy will bring the United \nStates into compliance with our international obligations and this will \nend the tariffs the European Union has imposed as a result of the \ndispute on many U.S.-made products, including products made in my State \nof Arizona.\n  While I am supporting the conference agreement, I want my colleagues \nto know that I am very serious about my commitment to pursue policies \nthat provide broad-based, pro-growth, supply-side tax incentives, \nrather than targeted tax preferences or misguided industrial policies.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee might respond to a colloquy. I specifically \nhave a question about the formula used to calculate the financial \nstatement limitation for computing the amount of permanently reinvested \nearnings eligible for repatriation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would be glad to entertain a question from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I believe the purpose of this provision is to determine \nthe amount of permanently reinvested earnings eligible for repatriation \nin the case in which a company discloses in its applicable financial \nstatements the incremental amount of U.S. tax that would be due on such \npermanently reinvested earnings if they were repatriated, rather than \nstating the actual amount of such earnings.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That seems to be an accurate interpretation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It would appear that the formula assumes that the \nincremental tax so disclosed would be at the full U.S. tax rate of 35 \npercent. Is it not correct that the amount of U.S. tax disclosed would \ninstead be a lesser amount that takes into account the amount of \nforeign taxes already imposed with respect to such earnings?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As I read the statute, a 35 percent rate is assumed to \napply only when a financial statement fails to show earnings \npermanently invested outside the U.S. but also includes an amount of \ntax liability attributable to such earnings. I believe that the formula \nis intended to produce an amount comparable to what would have been \nshown if the amount of earnings permanently invested offshore had been \nset forth on the financial statements. One shortcoming of the formula, \nwhich you have identified, is that the financial statements only take \ninto account the incremental U.S. tax liability that would be incurred \nif the company repatriates its earnings, which would be the 35 percent \nrate reduced by any foreign tax credits. I think you raise a very good \npoint that Congress should revisit in the future. In the meantime, I \nencourage the Department of Treasury to consider issuing guidance that \npermits taxpayers to more accurately reflect the actual amount of \nearnings permanently invested offshore.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator for his insights.\n\n\n                         Distribution of Films\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance an additional question regarding the American Jobs \nCreation Act of 2004.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would be glad to take a question from \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to confirm that footnote 30 of the statement of \nconferees, relating to the methods and means of distribution of films, \nshould not be read to create a negative inference with respect to the \nmeans of distribution of any other qualifying production property.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct. No negative inference was intended.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                        Civil Rights Tax Relief\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Grassley for \nassuring that the conference committee included Section 703, civil \nrights tax relief, in the conference report. As a member of the \nconference committee, I was very pleased to support this very important \nprovision, which enjoyed strong bipartisan support among Senate and \nHouse colleagues.\n  As I understand it, the case law with respect to the tax treatment of \nattorney's fees paid by those that receive settlements or judgments in \nconnection with a claim of unlawful discrimination, a False Claims Act, \n``Qui Tam,'' proceeding or similar actions is unclear and that its \napplication was questionable as interpreted by the IRS. Further, it was \nnever the intent of Congress that the attorneys' fees portions of such \nrecoveries should be included in taxable income whether for regular \nincome or alternative minimum tax purposes.\n  Is it the understanding of the chairman that it was the conferees' \nintention for Section 703 to clarify the proper interpretation of the \nprior law, and any settlements prior to the date of enactment should be \ntreated in a manner consistent with such intent?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct. The conferees are acting to \nmake it clear that attorneys' fees and costs in these cases are not \ntaxable income, especially where the plaintiff, or in the case of a Qui \nTam proceeding, the relator, never actually receives the portion of the \naward paid to the attorneys. Despite differing opinions by certain \njurisdictions and the IRS, it is my opinion that this is the correct \ninterpretation of the law prior to enactment of Section 703 as it will \nbe going forward. In adopting this provision, Congress is codifying the \nfair and equitable policy that the tax treatment of settlements or \nawards made after or prior to the effective date of this provision \nshould be the same. The courts and IRS should not treat attorneys' fees \nand other costs as taxable income.\n  As I stated in my May 12, 2004 press release summarizing this and \nother provisions passed by the Senate as part of S. 1637.\n\n       Tax relief gets the headlines, but part of tax relief is \n     tax fairness. It's clearly a fairness issue to make sure \n     people don't have to pay income taxes on income that was \n     never theirs in the first place. That's common sense.\n\n  Section 703 will help in well known cases, such as that of Cynthia \nSpina, an Illinois police officer that secured a settlement in a sexual \ndiscrimination case that left her owing $10,000 or more. There are \nliterally dozens of others like her in similar situations and it is my \nstrong belief that the courts and the IRS should apply the guidelines \nof Section 703 not only after the date of enactment but also to \nsettlements put in place prior to that time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself time that is allotted under the rule. I \nappreciate if the Chair would advise me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  The British historian Thomas Carlyle said all work is noble. And \nPsalm 97, attributed to Moses, the psalmist's prayer says: Establish \nthe work of our hands.\n  We all know the value and the meaning of work. It is so fundamental. \nHard work counts. It helps us do what we need to get done. It also is \ngood for the soul.\n  I am privileged in my State of Montana to have what I call workdays. \nI work at different jobs in Montana, show up early in the morning with \na sack lunch, work all through the day. I don't want to watch, don't \nwant to be told, shown what is going on. I would rather just do the \nwork. It is wonderful. I got the idea from Bob Graham of Florida. Bob \nhas done this for countless years, and I can tell the Presiding Officer \nit is one of the privileges of the job I have. I know other Senators do \nthe same. I would suspect the Presiding Officer has done that himself. \nHe knows what I am saying.\n  I can remember sitting on this very cold day outside of Butte, MT \nwith a pipefitter trying to cut pipes and fit joints together. And I \ndon't know how he did it, but he did it. I helped him. I probably \ncaused more problems and mistakes that he had to correct. It meant so \nmuch to me to watch this pipefitter who so appreciated the value of his \njob and doing a good job. He wanted to do a super job, and he did. He \nworked hard to get it done.\n  Another job I remember is in a mine outside of Columbus, MN, a \nplatinum and palladium mine. You go up in the shafts. I was working a \njack drill to try to drill holes into which charges are placed. I was \ntotally fouled up. I couldn't do it. This guy was so skilled. He was \ncreative. I mean he was a craftsman, setting that drill bit at the \nright spot, drilling those holes so the charges could be set. Or \nworking in a hospital with a nurse, watching her so completely \nconscientious, wanting to do a great job in making sure her patients \nfelt good and tending to her patients.\n  This bill is about work.\n  That is what this is. I am sure at one level it is about complying \nwith the WTO ruling to assure that the United States is in compliance \nand the United States is no longer assessed these fees. As one Senator \nsaid, it could go up to 17 percent, which is a huge burden on our \ncompanies.\n  So the bill before us is about work, it is about how we help more \nAmericans do the work they want to do, how they and their companies can \nmanufacture more products that are somewhat difficult to manufacture \nbecause of the onerous fees we are paying on your export-manufactured \nproducts, particularly to Europe.\n  On another level, this bill is about straightening out our Tax Code. \nThere are a lot of problems with the Tax Code and loopholes. They are \nhuge, massive. This legislation, to pay for the replacement \nprovisions--that is, the manufacturing deduction that will allow \ncompanies to manufacture more--are paid for with essentially loophole \nclosers, corporate loophole closers.\n  Some say this is a big corporate giveaway. That is just not accurate \nfor two fundamental reasons. No. 1, there are many billions of dollars \nin loophole closers, tax shelters, for example, where a corporation has \nto list very dubious transactions so the IRS can look at them closely \nto see whether they are accurate. Several other post-Enron corporate \nabuse shelters that are closed down are also in this bill. It is many \nbillions of dollars.\n  Second, there are provisions in the bill which help our international \ncompanies and are designed to achieve one purpose: avoid double \ntaxation. The international tax provisions are extremely complicated, \nvery complicated. Unfortunately, American companies often are taxed \ntwice. They are taxed by the foreign country in which they are doing \nbusiness and also, as they properly should be, by the U.S. Government.\n  We have a system, generally, where an international company is \noperating overseas but headquartered in the U.S., and it could \ngenerally take the taxes that are paid in another country and use that \nto offset taxes it pays in the U.S. to avoid double taxation. That is, \nthe American company is taxed on its worldwide operations but doesn't \nhave to pay twice, a second time, to that other country. There are many \ncases in the Tax Code where that doesn't work very well and, in effect, \nthe corporation is taxed twice.\n  So these provisions that some people are complaining about are \nessentially designed to prevent double taxation. There may be \nprovisions that Senators might argue with on the margin and split \nhairs, but, in the main, these provisions are designed to avoid double \ntaxation.\n  Also, this bill is revenue neutral. Unfortunately, our country has \naccumulated massive Federal deficits--$415 billion for this year. This \nis a big bill. It is very large. It is large because it appeals to this \nregime which the WTO organization says is illegal. It is large because \nit replaces it with a structure which, as I mentioned, is a deduction \nfor manufacturing done in the United States to help spur more \nmanufacturing, and that is massive; it is massive because it closes \ncorporate loopholes.\n  But in the end, when you add it all up, it is revenue neutral. It \ndoesn't add one cent to the Federal deficit. It is a responsible bill. \nIt accomplishes the objective of complying with the WTO, and it also \ncloses a lot of loopholes. It is massive. Also, it is fair because it \navoids corporations being double taxed.\n  This bill is not perfect. We all say many times around here that we \nshould not let perfection be the enemy of the good. It is a platitude, \nit is commonplace, and we say it all the time. I often remind myself \nthat sometimes the most trite things are the most true. That we should \nnot let the perfection be the enemy of the good is a principle that we \nshould apply here. We are 100 Senators, 435 House Members, and the \nPresident, and we cannot each have our own way. We have to work \ntogether and add up the pluses and minuses, and each Senator has to \ndecide whether the pluses outweigh the minuses. In my judgment, it is \nvery clear that the pluses here very much outweigh the minuses.\n\n  The FDA tobacco regulation is not in the bill. I wish it were. There \nwas a general agreement. I was not part of it, but there was a general \nagreement with those who worked with the companies and the farmers on a \ndesign where there would be a buyout. That is my understanding of the \ngeneral understanding. Unfortunately, the House was resistant. They \ndidn't want to put the FDA regulation in the bill. The question is, \nShould we kill this bill because that is not in here? That is a tough \nchoice for many Senators, as it is for me.\n  After all is considered, it is my judgment there is so much else that \nis good in the bill that it should pass. Unfortunately, we have to take \nup FDA regulation another day. I hope we do because I believe tobacco \nis a drug and it will help reduce a lot of deaths in the United States \nif that is properly regulated.\n  I am also a bit distressed about the provisions for Montana that are \nnot in here, particularly for Indian reservations. I have several ideas \non how reservations could get a better break. That is also not in the \nlegislation.\n  Let me say one more thing and I will close and save the remaining few \nminutes. I want to explain one major corporate abuse, which is closed, \nbut not sufficiently closed in this bill. The abuse is where an \nAmerican financial institution will enter into a long-term lease, like \nsay with the country of France, to build a subway system in France, for \nexample. Because of the long-term lease, the American financial \ninstitution treats that as if it owns it and is able to take deductions \nagainst the lease purchase.\n  Now, those are deductions that the financial institution can take \nagainst earned income. It lowers the income of that company. The net \nresult of that is this: In the end, the American company takes huge \ndeductions. The foreign government, in this case France, would own the \nsystem in the end, but the American taxpayers essentially are paying \nfor that subway system, not the French. In fact, there is a small fee \npaid by the French for the privilege of allowing the American financial \ninstitution to take the tax deduction. Americans are essentially \nsubsidizing that subway system and that fattens up the wallet of the \nU.S. company and\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nthe shareholders. Again, it is an extension of noncorporate \nshareholders as American taxpayers who are not shareholders of that \ncompany. It is an absolute outrage.\n  This legislation stops that from this day forward, but it does not \nstop it for ongoing, currently operating transactions. So, \nunfortunately, America will still be subsidizing this. There are many \nof these instances overseas and in America, but I am most concerned \nabout overseas, where there are municipal construction projects--\nsubways, streets, you name it. I think that is wrong. I wish closing \nthat down were in the bill. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, this bill passes an ultimate test \nthat any bill has to pass that is of consequence.\n  This bill passes one of the strictest tests that something must pass \nin the Senate in order to get something done, and that is, it is \nbipartisan. It is bipartisan because of the leadership of Senator \nBaucus, and I thank him.\n  We have been hearing quite a bit about this legislation. Most of the \ncomplaints have been about what is not in the bill. I would like to \nhave those who are complaining to focus on what is in the bill. \nEveryone needs to know that a vote against cloture is a vote against \nthe items in this bill. This is a recorded vote, for which we will all \nbe held accountable. The conference is closed. The House has voted \noverwhelmingly for this bill. If this bill does not get cloture, it is \na dead bill.\n  Vote to end the Euro sanctions against U.S. exporters. They are now \n12 percent. They will be 17 percent by March. Those sanctions hit farm \nproducts, timber, paper, citrus, and manufacturing. There are people \nbeing laid off because of these sanctions against our exports. A vote \nagainst cloture is a vote to continue the sanctions.\n  Farms and businesses shoulder this burden because Congress has failed \nso far to act. The manufacturing tax cut to create jobs in America that \nis in this bill goes to large and small corporations, family-held S \ncorporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, farmers, and co-ops. \nThis $76 billion portion of this bill is only for manufacturing in the \nUnited States. It is not creating jobs offshore because it does not \nbenefit manufacturing offshore.\n  Are you going to vote against giving individuals a deduction for the \nState sales tax against their Federal income tax that is in this bill? \nThis bill is the most comprehensive agricultural, small business, and \nrural community incentive tax package ever. A vote against cloture is a \nvote against benefits in this bill that will help value-added \nagriculture.\n  The bill contains VEETC; 37 of our 50 States will receive more \nhighway money because of the provisions in this bill. VEETC and this \nbill's provisions that shut down fuel tax fraud will put over $24 \nbillion into the highway trust fund alone. This provision alone will \ncreate 674,000 new jobs across the country. A vote against cloture is a \nvote against highway money for your State.\n  A vote against cloture is a vote against highway jobs for \nconstruction of highways in your State. The energy package in the bill \nincludes new incentives for biodiesel. This provision means jobs in our \nheartland, over 150,000 new jobs.\n  The bill accelerates production of natural gas from Alaska and the \nconstruction of a pipeline to carry it to the lower 48 States. This \nwill create nearly 400,000 jobs in construction, trucking, \nmanufacturing, and other sectors.\n  This bill devotes over $2 billion to section 45, renewable \nelectricity production credit. This was a high priority for Senators \nBingaman, Smith, Daschle, Hatch, Baucus, Snowe, Breaux, Lincoln, \nConrad, Bunning, and Gregg. \n  The small business package in this bill extends small business \nexpensing for another 2 years, and contains significant S corporation \nreforms. S corporation reform has always been a high priority in the \nSenate because it helps family-owned businesses.\n  A provision in this bill expands the new markets tax credit to help \neconomic development in rural counties.\n  We have included also the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act. We included \na National Health Service Corps loan program to enhance the delivery of \nmedical services to rural areas.\n  The bill provides all these benefits, nearly $140 billion worth, and \nthis is a revenue-neutral bill, which means this bill does not add one \ndime to the Federal deficit.\n  It is all paid for by shutting down corporate expatriation to \nBermuda, tax shelter leasing abuses by corporations, and ends all the \nEnron-type tax shelter deals. This is the most tough antitax shelter \nmeasure since 1986.\n  This bill contains some of the most important international tax \nreforms in decades, bringing foreign earnings home for investment in \nthe United States instead of investing overseas, hence creating jobs in \nthe United States.\n  We have heard complaints from Senator Landrieu because the bill does \nnot contain her reservist amendment. I would like to make it clear that \nSenator Baucus and I offered that amendment on her behalf. We came up \nwith a way to pay for that. All Senate conferees, Republican and \nDemocrat, voted for it. The conference was open to the public. There \nwere no backroom deals. The House, the other body, rejected it.\n  Voting down this bill will not bring back the reservist amendment. \nThe conference is closed.\n  There is a great deal of good in this bill. We can rescue the \nmanufacturing sector; we can end European Union sanctions on our \nfarmers; we can respond to the recent rise of gas prices by supporting \nrenewable fuels, and we can shut down every known tax abuse. Vote to \nfinish the job. Vote for cloture. It is time to pass this very \nimportant bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the \npending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 4520, a bill to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to remove impediments in such Code and \n     make our manufacturing, service, and high-technology \n     businesses and workers more competitive and productive both \n     at home and abroad.\n         Bill Frist, Chuck Grassley, Ted Stevens, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Conrad Burns, Thad Cochran, Norm Coleman, \n           George Allen, Larry Craig, Trent Lott, Mitch McConnell, \n           Jon Kyl, Craig Thomas, John Cornyn, Ben Nighthorse \n           Campbell, Elizabeth Dole, John Talent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call \nhas been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that \ndebate on H.R. 4520, the American JOBS Creation Act of 2004, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nCampbell), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from \nTexas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), the \nSenator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), the Senator from Pennsylvania, \n(Mr. Specter) and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Sununu) are \nnecessary absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Texas \n(Mr. Cornyn) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from California, (Mrs. \nBoxer), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Corzine), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Leahy), and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Thank you, Mr. President. May I have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I am not going to speak until \nwe have more order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Please take your \nconversations to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana has an hour. She deserves to be heard. The Senate is \nclearly not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for the \npurpose of making a unanimous consent request?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am sorry, Mr. President, no, I won't. Maybe in a few \nminutes but not at this point.\n  As my colleagues know, we have been working toward this point, \nactually on this particular bill, for over 2 years, so there have been \nmany meetings, many votes, many debates, many conferences. I understand \nthat. I know we are to the very end of this discussion, and we have a \nbill before us with $137 billion worth of tax cuts. This is a bill that \nstarted out 2 years ago because of a decision by the World Trade \nOrganization that called to our attention that our Tax Code was not in \norder and that if we did not straighten some things out in our Tax \nCode, some of our businesses could be penalized. So 2 years ago, an \neffort was undertaken to correct that.\n  Some of us, knowing that effort was going to be undertaken, crafted a \nprovision to give tax relief to the Guard and Reserve and their \nfamilies, to the members of the Guard and Reserve who are on the front \nline, by saying to all the patriotic companies in America, large and \nsmall: As you continue to give that paycheck to the men and women on \nthe front line, we thank you, we appreciate that effort. We know it is \ndifficult for you. We know it is tough for you. And we want to provide \na 50-percent tax credit to you to help your Guard and Reserve to keep \ntheir paychecks whole.\n  Because a lot of paychecks in America are going to get fattened, a \nlot of dividend checks are going to be improved, and a lot of benefits \nare in this bill, some of us thought, and the whole Senate voted, \nDemocrats and Republicans, that one of the paychecks we should make \nsure was complete and whole was for the men and women taking the \nbullets on the front line.\n  Mr. President, 640,000 men and women have been called up since 9/11, \nand when we called them up, they have gone.\n  Mr. President, may I have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I know that tempers are short \nbecause it has been a difficult process, and I am trying to be as \ncooperative as I can. I do not mean any disrespect to anyone in this \nChamber, and I do not mean any disrespect for the managers of this \nbill, who have done a magnificent job under very difficult \ncircumstances, but I have, since Wednesday, been trying to make this \npoint.\n  When this bill left the Senate, there was a provision that gave a tax \ncredit to the men and women on the front line in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwherever they serve, to keep their paychecks whole by giving a 50-\npercent tax credit to the thousands of employers, large companies and \nsmall companies, who send their civilian paychecks to the front \nline, not so much for the benefit of the soldiers. Many of these men \nand women who are fighting on the front line understand sacrifice. That \nis why they joined. If we understood sacrifice a little bit more in \nthis Chamber--and I include myself. I don't understand the sacrifice, \nbut I can tell you the men and women in uniform understand it. But this \nis not really all for them. It is for their families, their spouses and \nchildren, to keep that one paycheck whole.\n\n  For some reason, we passed a bill out of the House of \nRepresentatives, crafted in large measure by Chairman Thomas, that left \nthem out. They couldn't find $2 billion in $137 billion to put in for \nour troops.\n  We have ceiling fan importers in the bill. We have the gambling \nindustry in the bill. We have the oil and gas industry in the bill. \nThere are many industries in this bill that are important to me. But I \nhave confidence--complete confidence--that not one business in \nLouisiana, not one industry in Louisiana thinks they deserve to be in \nline before the Guard and Reserve and the employers that are keeping \ntheir paychecks whole--not one. If there is a company in Louisiana, if \nthere is a company anywhere that thinks the tax credit in this bill is \nmore important than the paychecks going to the men and women on the \nfront line, please contact me, because I don't understand it, and maybe \nit is something I have missed.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I am only going to speak for the \nfirst few minutes, and I have an hour reserved. I am going to speak \nthroughout the 30 hours, use a little bit of my time as we go on.\n  It is really not that complicated. My colleagues understand this \nissue. I don't think I have to go into any more detail about the \namendment, what it did, how much it cost, and the fact there were 100 \npercent of the Senators, Republicans and Democrats, who supported the \nissue. It was moved over to the House. I think they understand it was \nthe House Republican leadership primarily that crafted this bill and \nevidently did not think it should be included.\n  Let me spend a few minutes about what I am going to do so we can be \nclear about the schedule. I do not take this move lightly. I understand \nwe are at the end of the session. I understand people have commitments. \nI understand there are elections going on. I know there is a \nPresidential election going on and elections for many of our colleagues \nin the Senate. But I am going to use all the parliamentary procedures \navailable to me as a Senator to fight for the 5,000 men and women in \nthe State of Louisiana who are currently activated and have gone to the \nfront lines and don't get a whole paycheck. They get their Army or \ntheir Navy or their Reserve paycheck, but they leave a lot of pay on \nthe table because they don't get their civilian paycheck.\n  Here is a tax bill that could have allowed their employer to get a \n50-percent tax break, thereby encouraging them to continue that \npaycheck.\n  I am going to stand here and fight for them. I can't extend this \ndebate past Thursday. I don't think there is anything in my power to do \nthat. But I can and intend to use all the parliamentary procedures \navailable to me until the\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nend of this debate. If I have to stay on the floor for the next 4 days, \nI am prepared to do that. It is with the greatest amount of respect \nthat I let my colleagues know this.\n  The solution is something I have offered to my colleagues which I \nwant them to consider. I know this bill cannot be amended. I understand \nthat. I am not asking for that. There is a bill, H.R. 1779, that is in \nthe Finance Committee now. Amazingly, because I didn't have anything to \ndo with this bill, I can't believe the bill addresses exactly the same \nsubject that I am discussing. It is a House bill that came over here \nfrom the House from the Committee on Ways and Means, the same committee \nthat cut them out of this bill. There is another bill that came over \nfrom the Ways and Means Committee that is in the Finance Committee now. \nSo by unanimous consent of the Senate, without even a rollcall vote, \njust if all the Senators in this body would agree, we could amend this \nprovision into that bill and simply send it back to the House.\n\n  I understand I am only one Senator. I know the Senate can do its \nwill, and we can't force the House of Representatives, but we can go on \nrecord to say, this bill is important. We can amend the bill.\n  I would like to spend a moment just to say what the bill is because \nthere is a little bit of irony about the underlying bill. There is an \ninteresting irony about the underlying bill. I will tell you who the \nauthor is in a minute. But it is an interesting bill that came over \nhere to give the Guard and Reserve a tax benefit. The tax benefit \ndescribed in that bill is to waive the 10-percent penalty for the Guard \nand Reserve taking money out of their IRAs so, presumably, they could \npay a house note or a car note. In other words, there is a bill that \ncame over to us from the Committee on Ways and Means to give a tax \nbenefit to Guard and Reserve members to allow them to waive the 10-\npercent penalty so they could take money out of their retirement \naccount to make ends meet while they are taking the bullets for us.\n  I have to hear objection for our amendment supported by many \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, that would actually keep their \npaychecks whole so they could put some money in their IRA. What do you \nput in your IRA if you don't have a paycheck to put in your IRA? If \nanybody can explain to me what goes in an IRA other than money from a \npaycheck, maybe if somebody is lucky to have a dividend check or some \npassive investments or some capital gains, but most people I know take \ntheir paychecks and out of their paychecks, after they have paid their \nrent, after they have paid their car note, after they pay health \ninsurance for their family, after they pay their food bill, after they \npay their insurance bill and everything else they have to pay for, if \nthere is anything left, they put it in their IRA. Because most \nAmericans I know try to do their very best to manage their money.\n  So I have to have the insult of having the House send us a bill \nsaying they want to waive the 10-percent penalty for the Guard and \nReserve, but they won't help put an amendment on to give them a full \npaycheck so they have money to put in it. This Senator finds that quite \nobnoxious.\n  The irony of it is unbelievable. I asked the staff, go find me any \nbill, any Finance Committee bill that wouldn't get blue-slipped. They \ncame back and said: Senator, you will not believe it; it is a bill \nabout the IRA.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I will not yield.\n  So we have this bill that is over here. All I have asked my \ncolleagues is this. As the leader knows, I am not even asking for a \nrecord vote. Even though I think our guardsmen and reservists deserve a \nrecorded vote, because I think we should go on record, but I am not \neven asking for that. I am asking for a voice vote--a voice vote, not a \nrecorded vote--to take that IRA bill, put this amendment on it and \nsimply send it back to the House. This filibuster will be over. That is \nall I am asking.\n  Let me say one other thing. I am not opposed to one item in this \nbill--not FDA, not the pork issue.\n  I have tried to be respectful of other Members. I would ask that same \nconsideration.\n  I am not opposed to any provision in this bill. There is $137 billion \nin this bill. This bill was supposed to be about $50 billion. Of \ncourse, when you open a tax bill, everyone in America would like to be \nin it. They have done a good job because everybody is in here. The only \npeople who are not in here are the men and women taking the bullets on \nthe front line. Six hundred and forty-three thousand Americans on the \nfront line, and we couldn't find one page, not one line, not one \nparagraph for them. This is disgraceful.\n  It is not our fault. The Senate did not do that. But somewhere \nbetween the Senate and the House, the papers got lost. I don't know why \nthey get lost. I don't know why we can't remember them in the tax bill \nbecause we sure remember them in photographs. We sure remember them in \nthe parades. We sure have them all over our ads for those running for \noffice.\n  I am not up for reelection now. I will be up for reelection in 4 \nyears, and I am certain I will hear from every industry in here about \nhow I didn't help them with their tax credits. I will say it again. I \nam not opposed to any tax credit in this bill, not one. What I am \nobjecting to is how we could, in the middle of the war, with no end in \nsight, no real plan for the peace, no understanding of when our troops \nmight get home, no understanding of how long they are going to have to \nbe there, we cannot keep the paychecks going to their families.\n  When is somebody going to tell me we don't have enough money? What is \nthis? This issue is not complicated. This is very simple. That is why \npeople are responding because it is not complicated. I am trying to \nexplain to my colleagues that it is very simple. I am not even asking \nfor a record vote. I didn't want people to stay here until Thursday. I \nhave 2 children; one is 12 and one is 7. I have had to make \narrangements for the next 4 days for them and for my husband. I \nunderstand that. I have canceled everything on my schedule. I am not \nlooking for awards or sympathy. I am not asking for anything \nunreasonable. If these guys can go to the front lines and leave their \nfamilies for a year or 2 years, can't I stand here for a few days? Can \nwe not work for a few hours to try to voice vote, in the air-\nconditioning of this building, and send this bill back over to the \nHouse and mark it up as they just were not clear about what they were \ndoing? They just didn't realize what they were doing? When they come \nback in November, they can fix it. That is all I am asking.\n  One more thing about the tax credit, and then others may have \nquestions. Maybe I haven't been clear. Here is the list of the tax \ncredits. The only arguments I have heard against what I am trying to do \nare two. One was given by one of the House Ways and Means Committee \nmembers when I called to let them know ahead of time I was going to do \nthis. I tried not to surprise anyone. I called them as soon as this \nbill was printed and came here Wednesday. I called members of the Ways \nand Means Committee and asked them: What could have possibly happened?\n  The only comment they gave back that was reported in the newspaper \nwas the House did not like our offset. Forgive me, I am not a member of \nthe Finance Committee. I don't know all of the details about offsets. I \ndon't think our Guard and Reserve know about offsets. I don't think the \npeople we represent know about offsets. But I will tell you, somebody \nin this Chamber knows about offsets because there is $137 billion worth \nof offsets right here. Did anybody think we could find $2 billion for \nthem? So I am sorry I am not an expert in offsets.\n  The only other argument I have heard from anybody--maybe there are \nothers and I haven't heard them, and I have been here 3 days--is I \ndon't think we should have tax credits in this bill. Somebody might \nobject philosophically to tax credits. That surprises me because, from \nthe day I got to the Senate, all I have heard from the Republican \nleadership is tax credits, tax cuts, tax relief. If they don't say it a \nthousand times every day, it is amazing. Just tax credits, tax relief \nfor everybody, whether we have money in the Treasury or not. That is \nall I hear about. So it is amazing to me that someone could say we \ndon't like it because, technically, it is a tax credit.\n  Let me read the nine tax credits that are in the bill. I want the \nGuard and Reserve to listen; they got left out. I\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nwill tell you the ones in this bill. Section 221: There is a \nmodification of targeted areas of low-income communities for new market \ntax credits. That is probably very good. It is for new markets. I am \nsure it will help everybody in low-income areas. I think that is great.\n  Section 245, credit for maintenance of railroad tracks: It \nestablishes a business tax credit equal to 50 percent--Mr. President, I \nam losing my voice having to speak over the conversations.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Section 245, a credit for maintenance of railroad \ntracks, establishes a business tax credit equal to 50 percent of \nqualified expenditures for railroad track maintenance, capped at $3,500 \nper mile. Maybe there is a staffer or somebody who can calculate how \nmany miles of railroad tracks we have and multiply it by 3,500 because \nthat is a tax credit that is in this bill. We may need to do that. I \nhave tons of railroads running through Louisiana, but not one railroad \ncompany in this country thinks their tax credit should come before \nmaking the paychecks of the Guard and Reserve whole.\n  Biodiesel income tax credit: Provides a 50-cent-a-gallon income tax \ncredit similar to the present law ethanol benefits for each gallon of \nbiodiesel used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture used \nor sold as fuel. I am fine with that, but you would think the tax \ncredit some of us had and thought was important, which gave them a \npaycheck so they could buy gas, is equally important to this.\n  Section 339, credit for production of low sulfur diesel fuel; section \n341, oil and gas for marginal wells--I know in Oklahoma they have a lot \nof marginal wells. I have some in Louisiana myself. I am very aware, as \na member of the Energy Committee, of the importance of this tax credit, \nbut again, not before the men and women taking 100 percent of the \nbullets.\n  Expansion of credits for electricity produced from certain renewable \nsources and then certain business credits allowed against regular \nminimum tax.\n  This is what I was given this morning. Perhaps there are more. I know \nthese are nine tax credits in the bill. The rest of this bill has to be \nsomething else that they don't call tax credits. But it is tax \nbenefits. I am not sure I know the title of it. Maybe I am not exactly \ncorrect. But these are the tax credits, which is the same thing I asked \nto be in this bill, and many of us asked, and it was left out by the \nHouse Republican leadership.\n  So, again, I am prepared to stay here until Thursday. I am not going \nanywhere. I am only asking for a voice vote--not a rollcall vote--on a \nbill that is already over here, that is already in our Finance \nCommittee, to put this amendment on and send it back to the House. Then \nwe can all go home and talk about it and we can say we supported it, \nwhich we did, and we did a great job, and then people can talk to House \nMembers about are they going to accept this bill or amend this bill or \nkill this bill. Let the House Members answer that question.\n  All we can do here is take care of the Senate's business. This is the \nSenate's business, Mr. President. If we don't stand up for these guys \nand gals, if we don't fight for their families, who is going to fight \nfor them?\n  Let me ask the Chair how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 38 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida might \nhave a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as I direct my comments to the \nSenator from Louisiana, this is one of the most impassioned personal \nstatements that I have heard on the floor of the Senate, and I suggest \nthat our colleagues take heed. The Guard and Reserve have had to carry \nthe burden in Iraq. That is one of the main points of discussion in \nthis Presidential race. It has been one of the main points of \ndiscussion in our Senate Armed Services Committee, headed by the \nesteemed chairman, who is on the floor.\n  Do we have enough active duty? We have concluded that we do not have \nenough active duty, and we have seen that the Guard and Reserve are \nbeing asked over and over again, on several rotations, to take up the \nslack because of the needs.\n  It was called by Senator Kerry the other night in Missouri a backdoor \ndraft. So I ask the Senator, does this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only yielded for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. He is asking a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am sorry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may only yield for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, did I not just ask a question \nright then? Would the Parliamentarian please advise if I was not asking \na question right at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did ask a question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  Would the Senator please point out if she thinks that this is \nimportant to the Guard and the Reserve given the fact that so much of \nthe load has been put on our National Guard and our Reserve?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Florida for his comments, and \nI would be happy to answer his question because he is exactly correct. \nAll members of this Chamber are aware that since 9/11, 640,000 \nguardsmen and reservists have been called up from Florida--and I see \nthe Senator from Arkansas--from her State, other Senators who are here \nthis morning and will be here through the debate--from all of our \nStates. The Senator is absolutely right. The large measure of the \nburden has been placed on them and their families. The Senator from \nFlorida knows they do not ask for much. These guys and gals are used to \nsacrifice. They do not ask for much and they really do not like to \ncomplain. They are the last ones to stand in line and come ask to be \nincluded in this bill, but we should ask on their behalf. That is why \nthis amendment is so important.\n  If we were not passing a tax cut bill and we did not have any money \nto give anybody credits or tax cuts, then they would be the first to \nsay: Please do not include us. But how can we, in good faith, stand \nhere and pass a $137 billion bill and leave them out and leave out \ntheir employers, small businesses from Florida, Arkansas, and Louisiana \nthat are digging deep, sending that paycheck to the front line even \nthough the man or woman is not in the office or in the manufacturing \nplant, trying to help their families? Surely we could have found some \nroom in this budget for them.\n  I thank the Senator for the question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator from Louisiana recall for us \nif she has had a similar experience in her State as this Senator has \nfrom my State of Florida in talking with members of the families of the \nNational Guard who are at an enormous financial sacrifice when they \nhave to leave their civilian job and are activated, especially if it is \ntwo or three rotations they have to go to, and if their employer--I am \ncurious if the Senator has heard from the employers in her State of \nLouisiana, as I have in my State of Florida, if her employers who want \nto help the Guard men and women and who want to help the reservists and \nwant to pay them, why they should not receive some financial incentive \nthrough a tax break? Would the Senator recall for us her experience, \nand is it similar to the experience I have had talking to employers and \nreservists and Guard men and women?\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Florida raises a very good question to \nme, and the way I would like to answer that question is with an e-mail. \nIt is wonderful that I received this e-mail this morning. I have \nreceived hundreds of e-mails from families all over the United States \nwho have been keeping up with this issue, but because this answers the \nSenator's question--this is from Bossier City, LA, and he writes: \nFirst, I would like to give you a little background on myself. I was \nraised as a military brat. My father served in the Air Force for 28 \nyears, and we were stationed at Barksdale Air Force base\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nthree times. He and my mother retired in Bossier City. We had a good \nlife growing up in the military, and in my opinion it brought us closer \ntogether as a family, but there were many, many, many times when things \nwere tough financially for a family of five. I watched you today on C-\nSPAN, and I was proud that you have represented us and our State and \nour military families. I think it is extremely important for funding to \ncompensate our military families, especially now when there are no \nclear answers on how long our troops will be required to be in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. I have many friends whose spouses have lost \nsignificant amounts of income due to activism. Not only do they worry \nabout their spouses on the front lines, they have to worry about how to \nmake ends meet here in the States. Please keep fighting for their \ncause. By the way, this should not be a Republican versus Democratic \nissue. My parents are conservatives and I am a liberal, but we consider \nthis matter a matter of patriotism.\n  I say to the Senator from Florida and other Senators, I have received \nhundreds of e-mails just like this, and so I want to make one more \npoint. I do not think this is a Democrat versus Republican issue. As I \nsaid, the amendment we are fighting for already passed the Senate by \n100 votes. The Senator was a cosponsor. The Senator from Arkansas was a \ncosponsor. I see other Senators in the Chamber who were cosponsors. We \nwanted this amendment in the bill, and it was in the bill. It went over \nto the House, and in the negotiations it was dropped. My question is, \nwhy? How could we afford to give a tax credit to everybody else but not \nthe Guard and Reserve?\n  I thank the Senator for his question. I will yield for another \nquestion in a minute but to the point in answering the question: This \nis a page out of the handbook that the Guard and Reserve receive from \nour Government. This is the handbook they receive, ``Family Readiness \nParadigm.'' The center of this says ``self-reliant families.'' ``Self-\nreliance'' is a powerful word. I like to think I am self-reliant. I \nlike to encourage my children to be self-reliant, self-sufficient, \nindependent, hard working. So we send out a memo just to sort of \nreinforce to our Guard and Reserve that we expect them to be self-\nreliant. We provide reunions for them. We help them with their \ndeployment, tell them what is going to happen. We try to help them set \nup health care plans. We arrange telephone calls. We do the training \nand mission. The only thing we do not do is send a paycheck.\n  Then we have the President saying:\n\n       The National Guard and Reserves are a vital part of \n     America's national defense.\n       [They] display values that are central to our Nation: \n     character, courage and sacrifice, [and demonstrate] the \n     highest form of citizenship.\n       And while you may not be full-time soldiers, you are full-\n     time patriots.\n\n  Evidently, they do not deserve a full paycheck?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I will not yield. I am sorry.\n  That is what the argument is about. Again, I am not asking for a \nrollcall vote. I know this bill cannot be amended. It is against the \nrules. There is nothing I can do to amend it. But the bill that is \nright now before the Senate, I am asking our leadership--I am asking my \ncolleagues to please join with me; I know many do, but I need \neverybody, I need 100 percent--to agree to amend this bill and send it \nback to the House and give the House time to reconsider this position. \nI am fairly certain they did not know the specifics of it. I am going \nto give them the benefit of the doubt. I do not know that they \nspecifically looked at this and said: These people do not deserve it. I \ndo not think that happened. All I know that happened is that it came \nback without it in it, and we have time to fix it. We cannot fix it \ntoday, we cannot fix it tomorrow, but if we send a bill back to the \nHouse, whenever the House comes back, in October, November, December, \nor January, they could fix it.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will yield to the Senator from Florida and then \nperhaps to the Senator from Oklahoma at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from \nLouisiana if her experience in Louisiana, in talking to the Guard \npeople as well as the reservists, that often she finds, as I have found \nin Florida, that many of them, their employers, the fact that they are \nfirst responders, that they are local law enforcement or they are \nfirefighters or they are EMS personnel-- if she has found that, as we \nhave seen today on the front page of the Washington Post, that a lance \ncorporal in the Marine Corps went into the Marines because he wanted to \nget revenge after 9/11? He was a firefighter in New York, and that is \nthe patriotism, as it has been expressed by so many of these first \nresponders. Would the Senator, if she has had that similar experience \nas I have had in Florida, would she explain that her provision also \ninvolves a tax credit for the employers of first responders?\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator and will respond to his question by \nsaying: Yes, in this amendment, besides what I have described, there is \na portion of the amendment--that was actually led by Senator Boxer--\nthat would allow this tax credit to be applied by local governments to \ntry to keep the paychecks whole for firefighters and police officers \nwho have gone to the front line.\n  Think of the irony. The Senator from Florida understands this issue \nwell. In the case he described, a firefighter who fought the fire in \nNew York on 9/11, maybe one who went up into the building, put his life \non the line or her life on the line on that day--and we know what \nhappened. We don't have to go back and replay that memory in our head. \nThen he is in the Guard or Reserve and he signs up to go to Iraq to \nfight, to take the bullets. Because we left this amendment out, he has \nto send his family back half a paycheck, and we can't find the money in \nthis bill, $137 billion, to help them keep that paycheck whole? It is a \ndisgrace. It is shameful. It is unjust. It is unconscionable. That is \nwhy I am going to stay here until Thursday. I understand it may not \nwork. I understand the session may adjourn. But it is going to adjourn \nwith me speaking about this, and I hope all of us, saying the Senate \nhas already spoken on this. Our leadership, Republican and Democratic, \nsaid if we are going to have a tax bill, a tax cut, a tax break, the \nGuard and Reserve should be a part of it.\n  If we could find other things to help, I am happy to do that as well. \nI put this particular thing together with some of us. There are many \nother items I am sure could be put in a comprehensive package. In fact, \nI have spoken to many of the colleagues who have said to me: Senator, \nwe could put together a more comprehensive package. I am working on \nthat with them as well. However, there is no reason and no excuse and \nnothing anyone can say to me to convince me that before we adjourn we \nshould not take the action, with not a rollcall vote but a unanimous \nconsent, and at least send this bill back to the House. Then we will \nhave all the time in the world--October, November, December, all next \nyear. I am going to be here at least 4 more years unless I get \nrecalled. My election is not up for 4 more years. I will work on it \nwith anybody who wants to for the next 4 years and come up with a \ncomprehensive package. I know that.\n  But I want the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Mississippi \nto know, we don't have to wait for a comprehensive package. We don't \nhave to have it all neat and pretty. We don't have to have a commission \nthat could decide let's do this and let's do this. This is what is \nbefore me right now. This is what is before me--$137 billion of tax \ncuts, and not one page, not one paragraph, not one tittle, not one \nscribble for the Guard and Reserve.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I will not.\n  So that is my issue at this moment. I am hoping to put a package \ntogether. I don't expect this bill to be amended. But I have asked the \nleadership to allow a unanimous vote--not even on the record--to put \nthis Paycheck Protection Act on the IRA.\n  How do you have an IRA without money to put in it? I don't know. So \nit makes sense to put my paycheck bill\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nwith the IRA bill, so then they could actually have an IRA to take the \n10-percent credit if they had money in it. You can't get the 10-percent \ncredit unless you have money in your IRA, so this matches pretty \nperfectly. You get the paycheck, put the money in your IRA, take the \nIRA out, and you don't have to pay your 10-percent penalty. That would \nbe terrific.\n  Then on that bill, also an amendment, there is a possibility there \ncould be some hurricane relief. But I want to be clear about one thing. \nI didn't ask for that although my State will benefit from it. The \nSenators from Florida, Senator Graham and Senator Nelson, rightly led \nthat. I am a cosponsor of that. That would fit nicely on that \namendment. We have to give help to the hurricane victims as well. So we \nhave the Paycheck Protection Act. We have the hurricane help.\n  Right now, as I speak, I have flooding in my State. I woke up this \nmorning and turned on the television and, besides seeing Donald \nRumsfeld in Afghanistan, the next I saw was a levee break in Louisiana. \nSo there is money in this tax bill that I am talking about to help \nFlorida, Mississippi, Alabama, and everybody who is flooding, help this \npaycheck protection, and do this IRA provision which, again, was not my \nidea but I support it. I think it was a good one.\n  All I need is for 100 Senators to say it is OK. Evidently I don't \nhave 100 Senators. I might have 98, 99, 89. We don't have a rollcall so \nI don't know. All I know is I don't have 100, because if I had 100 this \nfilibuster would be over. So that is where we are.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will yield to the Senator from Florida and then the \nSenator from Oklahoma, after one more question from the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I think the Senate, in my question to the \nSenator from Louisiana, better take note of the passion and the \nintensity of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I would ask the Senator from Louisiana, Why is it that certain \nmembers of the leadership on the other side of the aisle are blocking \nyour attempt to help the National Guard and Reserves on a House bill \nthat has already been sent here from the Ways and Means Committee, that \nis a very logical, underlying piece of legislation because it gives a \ntax break by allowing people to take money out of their IRA to help \nthem with their expenses as a member of the Guard and Reserves, with \npaying the 10-percent penalty?\n  Why in the world would somebody be blocking the Senator doing that? \nThere is no guarantee it is going to pass when it gets down to the \nother end of this Capitol. So at the end of the day they might still \nkill it. Why in the world would they be blocking such a logical thing, \nto help out the National Guard and the Reserves?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you. That is actually the question of the day. It \nmay take all day or tomorrow to get the answer to that, but I don't \nknow the answer to that. Maybe some Senator could give us the answer to \nthat. I do not know why, but that is what this debate is about.\n  Is there any compelling reason we could not do that, end this \nfilibuster, move on? These bills are very important to do. I am not \nobjecting to anything in this bill. I am not objecting to anything in \nthe military construction bill. I am not objecting to anything in the \nintelligence reorganization bill. Surely there are things in here I \ndon't particularly like, but that is the process. That is the process. \nI cannot write this bill perfectly. There are things in here my \nconstituents would find absolutely laughable. But I have to tell them \nwe have to laugh sometimes, that is the way it is. That is the process. \nI have been a legislator for 25 years. I know the process. But this is \nmore than process. This transcends all issues, in my mind. This is \nabout whether this Senate, Republican and Democratic leaders, will \nstand up for the men and women on the front line--yes or no.\n  It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I need to know a little bit more about the amendment. \nThe tax credit goes to the employers. Is there any guarantee that \nmoney, the tax credit--let's say $20,000 for the service man or woman--\ngoes to the service man or woman. How do we know that happens? Is there \na delay before they would benefit from those dollars?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to respond this way. I have the greatest \nrespect for the Senator from Oklahoma. I actually like him very much. \nHe and I have worked on some important issues--the issue of child \nwelfare, adoption, foster care. I respect him as a Member who \nunderstands the details of the finance and tax system and the Budget \nCommittee. He chairs the Budget Committee.\n  All I can say in answer to that is we drafted the amendment as \ncarefully as we could to make sure that, in fact, that happens. I \nassure him that there are people wiser than myself, smarter than \nmyself, who have worked here either as a Member or a staffer who could \ncarefully craft such an amendment. I know they crafted this whole \nentire bill of 600 pages to help the railroads maintain their tracks, \nfor ceiling fan importers so they can keep the fans on, but the troops \nin Iraq can't afford a fan. Their families can't buy one.\n  The Senator can talk about whatever. I am respectful of his question. \nI am completely convinced that the amendment could be written in such a \nway.\n  Does the Senator have any other questions?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am not sure it is written that way. I am not sure it \nis a requirement that an employer has to give the money immediately to \na service man or woman. I suspect that is your intent. I don't believe \nthat is the way the amendment is written. I would like to know more \nabout it.\n  I have a different question. If the amendment were agreed to, you \nwould be paying substantially more for a man or woman serving side by \nside--let us say in Iraq or Afghanistan in combat a situation, the \nFederal Government would be paying significantly more for that \nreservist than they are for the Active-duty. How much differential \nshould we pay? Is that equitable for the thousands of people who are \nActive-Duty to be paid less than the Reserves when their lives are at \nrisk equally, when they are in the same trenches doing the same job?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator's first question, in my opinion, doesn't \nhave a lot of merit. The second one does have a lot of merit, and I \nwould like to respond to it.\n  There is an argument that comes out of the part of the Pentagon, not \nthe whole Pentagon. There is something unsettling to a man on the front \nline, some active and some Reserve, when both are driving in a truck in \nIraq, that they should get the same paycheck. They both should get \n$30,000 no matter what. No matter if the reservist makes $70,000 in the \nUnited States in their regular work, when they drive the truck in Iraq \nthey should make $30,000. I don't hold to that position. I will tell \nyou why.\n  Our Government benefits significantly financially, and the taxpayers \nbenefit by not having to keep that Guard and Reserve full time, 24-7, \nyear after year after year. We benefit as taxpayers, so we have more \nmoney to give out in tax cuts to everybody else. We benefit by not \nhaving to keep a force. We have 1.6 million Active-Duty, and we have \n1.2 million Guard and Reserve who are now 40 percent of our force and \ngrowing every day. You can see during World War II, in the 1940s, we \ncalled up everybody. We had to fight the war. We called up everybody \nwho would go, and even those who didn't want to go because they were \nforced to go under the draft. Our Active Forces are down at the lowest \nlevel since 1941.\n\n  I hope everybody can see this. Our Active Forces are down to their \nlowest level since 1941. You know who makes up this gap? After the \nterrorists attacked the World Trade Center and we are in a war, do you \nknow who makes up this gap? The Guard and Reserve. They go to the front \nlines.\n  All I am talking about is since we asked them to go, just let their \npaychecks follow them by giving a tax credit to the thousands of \nbusinesses, large and small, in this country that are doing the \npatriotic thing, as acknowledged by our President and our\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\nSecretary of Defense and the leadership. Can't we give a tax credit to \nkeep their paychecks for their families? This isn't for the soldier. \nThis is for their families. I think the men and women, active, \ntraditional units, understand that. They get health benefits. They get \nother benefits when they are Regular Army or Reserve. The reservists \ndon't even have a matching 401(k) savings plan. The reservists don't \neven have TRICARE. The reservists have very little, and we are blocking \nthem from keeping the one paycheck they do have.\n  Some Senators don't think they should be able to get the employers' \ntax credit to keep bread on the table and keep their mortgages paid. \nThis is the issue.\n  I understand the Pentagon disagrees with that. I understand their \nposition. I don't agree with it. I think, yes, we should pay a \ndifferential, or at least allow reservists, when they go to the front \nlines, to keep as much of their pay as possible, even if they are in a \nfox hole next to a 10-year, full-time Army soldier. The full-time, \ntraditional soldier gets other benefits and other compensation. They \nmight get free housing. They understand that.\n  I think the active Army and the active military support this \namendment. I am convinced of it. They are not jealous about the \nReserves.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. For one more question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand the Senator didn't like my first question \nbecause she is trying to give the Guard and Reserve additional \ncompensation and additional pay but through a tax credit which goes to \ntheir employer which may take some time to get directly to the \nguardsmen or reservists who have been activated. If you want to pay \nthem more, why don't you pay them more? Why don't you move an amendment \nthrough the DOD authorization bill? We did just last night under the \ngood work of Chairman Warner--or pay more through the Appropriations \nCommittee so they would be paid on a monthly basis. I am not sure I \nagree with the Senator that there should be a differential. She may \nmake an eloquent argument, but if she feels compelled they should be \npaid more, pay them more. But don't you think there is something lost \nby giving a tax credit that may or may not be funneled to the \nemployees? It may take some time. There may be some lag. There may be \nsome fraud, or it might not happen. But if you want to pay them more, \npay them more.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to answer the question. First of all, the \nSenator has drafted many amendments in his career. If he wants to help \nme modify this amendment, I would appreciate his help. It clearly is my \nintention to get this direct tax credit in a way that makes sure that \nthese companies can take tax credits for the Guard and Reserve.\n  If we can write $137 billion worth of instructions to other companies \nabout how this would apply to their tax credit, we could most certainly \nwrite a law or rule that allows these companies to be able to cover the \npaychecks, which they are doing already. This is totally voluntary. \nThese companies don't have to do it. But if they are going to do it--\nsome in Oklahoma and some in Louisiana are digging deep--they have \nbudgets to meet. They are paying the guys on the front line and then \npaying to replace them in their offices.\n  I will tell you why I don't want to put it on the Armed Services \nbill. I see the chairman on the floor, the Senator from Virginia. What \nhappens is--and the Senator from Oklahoma knows this--under our rules, \nthe Defense Department gets just so much money. Why should I ask my \nsoldiers to make a choice: Do you want a paycheck for your wife, or do \nyou want a covered Humvee for your battalion? I am not asking them that \nquestion. You might want to; I am not. Do you want a paycheck for your \nwife, daycare for your children, or do you want a covered Humvee for \nyourself? How would you like to answer that question? That is why I \nobject to putting it on the Defense bill.\n  This is a tax package bill. I don't have to take one Humvee away from \nthem. I don't have to take one rifle away from them, or one helmet away \nfrom them. All I have to do is put them in this bill. And I am going to \nstand here until 100 Members of the Senate agree to do it, and if not \nwe will be back here next year.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the amendment, \nboth in substance and on procedure, and procedure may be more \nimportant.\n  First, on the substance, I question the wisdom of whether we want to \nhave in our active combat forces and our Reserve forces who are \nfighting side by side a significant pay differential for doing the same \nthing. Senator Landrieu wants to. We have not done that in the past. I \ndon't think that is a smart thing to do. We have benefits for Regular \nArmy and we have benefits for the Guard and Reserve.\n  I used to be in the Guard, but to say we want to have a significant \npay incentive if a guardsman or reservist is activated over and above \nthe soldiers who are full-time active duty, I question the wisdom of \nthat. That is debatable.\n  I have no doubt in my mind if we are going to compensate them, and we \nare talking about compensation for our men and women who are fighting, \nwhether they are Guard and Reserve or whether they are Active, that \nshould be done in the Armed Services Committee. That should be done in \nthe Appropriations Committee, not compensate them through the Tax Code. \nThe Tax Code was not written to be, yes, we will finance their pay. We \nhave a Tax Code that is favorable for people who are in combat \nsituations. It is tax free. They do not pay income tax. That is for \nGuard and Reserve or Active Duty. If they are in a combat area, they do \nnot have to pay taxes. That is fine. That is the way it should be.\n  The Senator wants a differential. The Senator wants to pay them more, \npay them more. The Senator from Louisiana is on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and we have the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nthe Defense Subcommittee. If it is necessary to have a differential to \nmake it work for our Guard and Reserve, have an amendment to pay them \nmore. If it is 10 percent, if it is $10,000 or $20,000, the substance \nof the amendment is we will give a tax credit to some employers--some \nget a $15,000 tax credit and some employers get $20,000, some would be \n50 percent and some are 100 percent. It is confusing. How are we sure \nthat tax credit gets to the individual, and will it get to the \nindividuals and/or their families immediately? I don't think that \nconnection has been made.\n  My point is that is not the right way to do it. If you want to \ncompensate them, compensate them through the appropriations process. \nPay them more. We passed an authorization to increase pay for men and \nwomen.\n  Substantively, the amendment leaves a lot to be desired. \nProcedurally, it is worse. Procedurally, this was an amendment in the \nSenate; it was not in the House. I happened to be a conferee.\n  I heard my colleague from Louisiana say she called up House conferees \nand asked: Why didn't you accept this? A couple of comments. The \nSenator needs to call up conferees before the conference is closed. Not \none Member raised this issue in the conference individually. I \nunderstand Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley put it in a package of \namendments and sent it to the House, and the House rejected that entire \npackage. But we also considered dozens and dozens of amendments \nindividually that people felt strongly about. Some were passed. I had \nsome pass and I had some defeated. That is the legislative process. No \none raised this amendment individually. The House did not reject this \namendment individually. It was not sent to the House.\n\n  No Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Democrat or Republican--we \nhad 23 members of the conference committee. Anyone, Democrat or \nRepublican, could have offered this amendment. My guess is it would \nhave passed the Senate conference. It would not have had my vote, but \nit would have passed the Senate. Conferees would have sent it to the \nHouse, but no one did.\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\n  That is the way we work a conference. Sometimes you win and sometimes \nyou lose. To say, wait a minute, my amendment was not adopted, so \ntherefore I will try and tie the Senate up for 3 or 4 days until you \npass my amendment by unanimous consent--there are hundreds of \namendments that were not adopted in that conference, hundreds. Every \nmember of the conference had an amendment they wanted to have passed \nthat did not pass. That is part of the legislative process. If we all \ncame up and said, wait a minute, I feel so strongly about that \namendment that did not pass I will hold the entire Senate up for a few \ndays to bring that to the attention of the Senate, that is not a very \neffective way of legislating. There are effective ways to legislate.\n  If Members really want to increase the compensation of Guard and \nReserve, they need to be talking to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. They need to talk to the authorizing committee. They need to \ntalk to the Pentagon. They need to ask, How can we make this work? Not \nhave a system that says, Well, some companies get a tax credit, a \nbigger tax credit, and maybe it will flow to the employee or maybe flow \nto the employee a year later--that is not a good way to compensate \nthem. Compensate them directly, as we should, not through refundable \ntax credits that may or may not get to the family. Try and work it out \nin a way that would be of benefit, not to say, yesterday they were \ntrying to pass this as a freestanding tax bill but automatically it \nwould be blue-slipped in the House. They will not even consider that. \nThat does not help the cause.\n  Procedurally, this approach of demanding we pass something by \nunanimous consent because it was not included in the conference when no \none even raised it in the conference is just not the way you legislate. \nI can think of any number of Senators who were disappointed they did \nnot get what they wanted in conference, and they could try the same \nthing. I don't think that is effective in legislating. I don't think it \nwill work.\n  I make those comments. Substantively, the refundable tax credit going \nto employers is not the correct way to do it. The correct way to do it \nis, if the individuals who spend a lot of time on how much we should \ncompensate our men and women in the armed services, Regular Army and \nregular military, as well as Guard and Reserve, if they are convinced \nwe should have a differential for people serving side by side, then we \nneed to be working to implement that through their committees and make \nit direct compensation so the men and women serving receive that \npaycheck immediately, not some deferred way that might come through an \nemployer and might be subject to abuse.\n  I make those comments. The procedure is fatally flawed and \nsubstantively the approach is very well intended, but unfortunately I \ndon't think substantively the amendment is the correct way to \ncompensate the men and women who are serving both Active Duty and in \nthe Guard and Reserve. We have to keep in balance what we are paying \nActive and what we pay Guard and Reserve, and having a big differential \ncould cause a lot of problems.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was very pleased with the total \ncooperation on both sides of the aisle. We passed yesterday the annual \nauthorization act in honor, by the way, of Ronald Reagan. We named it \nin his honor. However, it was a stack about three times the size of \nthis when it reached the Senate.\n  I saw my distinguished colleague from Louisiana, who, incidentally, \nserved on the Armed Services Committee with great distinction. She does \nhave a keen knowledge of the needs of the military people. I respect \nthat greatly.\n  In that bill we have made some progress this year on a very delicate \npackage of benefit increases for the Guard and Reserve and made inroads \nto the TRICARE situation and made an impression on that in this bill. \nIt is a balance we constantly have to watch between the active \nservice--that individual, he or she, 365 days a year on call, their \nfamilies likewise--and then the contribution of the Guard and Reserve, \nwhich has absolutely been extraordinary, as the distinguished colleague \nfrom Louisiana points out.\n  I can speak from some personal experience. Never before has the \nUnited States relied so heavily on the Guard and Reserve since, the \nSenator pointed out, World War II. I see my distinguished colleague \nhere from Alaska. He had a very heroic career in World War II, and I \nhad a far less distinguished career. I was 17. We did what we had to \ndo. I saw it swelled to 16 million men and women in the Armed Forces. \nThe chart also showed how we are down to a level of 1941. The reason \nfor that is the spectrum of threats against this country--the standing \narmies and navies of other nations don't anywhere near approach what we \nhave, and the weapons are so different. One ship today can do the work \nof four ships we had during World War II. So there is a reason for that \nleveling off.\n  The point I wish to make in conclusion is every time a pay in benefit \nis brought up for any one of the Active or the Reserve, it goes through \nenormous formulations in the Department of Defense by people who spend \ntheir total careers trying to maintain a fair and equitable balance \nbetween the Guard and Reserve and to meet their needs and to have that \nstanding Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force that is required for \n365 days of the year, and then proudly to have the Guard and Reserve, \nwhich can respond in time of need.\n  So with all due respect to my colleague from Louisiana, I would hope \nthis type of legislation again would be analyzed in the normal course \nof the authorization and appropriations bills. I say to the Senator, \nyou were so active as a member of our committee. That way, we can have \naccess to that tremendous infrastructure within the Department of \nDefense and elsewhere that has the knowledge as to how best to \nstructure the benefit package for the Active as well as the Reserve \nForces.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments and question by \nmy colleague from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n  Unanimous Consent Request--Conference Report To Accompany H.R. 4567\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate now has before it two of our \nappropriations bills. The first is the homeland security bill, H.R. \n4567. That bill has $6.5 billion, among a lot of other money, for FEMA. \nThat is to be used for those disasters that were not part of the \nhurricane disaster but for those such as the tornado damage and flood \ndamage, the things that spun off from the hurricane. That money is \ngoing to be particularly used for that.\n  We sought to add some money to that bill for that purpose. We urged \nto let FEMA do its work and see how much would be needed, and if we \nhave to have a supplemental next year we will have it.\n  We also have the military construction bill, H.R. 4837, before us. It \nhas some $9.1 billion in it in the supplementals that were included in \nthat bill that are primarily aimed at recovery from the four hurricanes \nto hit the Southeast, particularly Florida. There is no question that \nmoney is vitally needed, also. That money, by the way, would have been \nin the $6.5 billion had the homeland security bill passed, as we should \nhave been able to do by October 1. It would have been available \nimmediately and there would not be the emergency in that area now.\n  But homeland security has been traveling on a continuing resolution. \nAs I pointed out this morning, the moneys that were allocated to FEMA \nunder the continuing resolution since October 1 are supposed to last \nuntil November 20. They ran out last night.\n  I have not seen two bills of this type, of this magnitude, passed by \nthe other body as rapidly as they passed these two yesterday. They \npassed them in less than 2 hours. There was not one single vote in \nopposition, not a single word opposing it. As a matter of fact, every \nMember of the House voted for each of those bills.\n  Now, we tried last night, when the bills were received here, to \nproceed with the homeland security bill, and that was not possible \nbecause of an objection.\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that this \nprocedure under cloture on the FSC bill be put aside so that we may \nconsider the homeland security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I would say to my friend \nfrom Alaska that the precipitating cause of why we are here was the \ninsistence of OMB, I am sure with the concurrence of the White House, \nand with the acceptance by the majority party on the Appropriations \nCommittee, to fundamentally change an authorized bill in the \nAgriculture Committee under purview of the Agriculture Committee that \nwould treat those who were hurt by the hurricane differently than \nfarmers would be compensated in Iowa or Ohio or Pennsylvania or \nWisconsin or a number of other States. And so it is not fair--\n  Mr. STEVENS. Regular order. Is there objection to my motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nSenator, what is the unanimous consent request before the Senate right \nnow? What is that unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is to proceed with the homeland security bill, H.R. \n4567. And if it is brought before the Senate, I intend to ask unanimous \nconsent that it be immediately adopted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nSenator if he is willing to modify his request as follows: that \nimmediately upon passage of the homeland security appropriations \nconference report, the Senate agree to include in the military \nconstruction conference report a provision prohibiting the use of farm \nbill funds to offset disaster assistance in that same report?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator accept the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is it possible for me to amend the conference report, as \nthe Senator requests, by unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a hypothetical inquiry, but the Chair \nbelieves you cannot amend a conference report.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I had some conversations \nwith the majority leader about this, and I would hope perhaps some \nfurther discussions could take place on resolving this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there an objection, Mr. President?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not want to interfere with the chairman's right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am about ready to make another motion pertaining to \nthe bill from the subcommittee that the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi chairs.\n  I want to point out that the military construction bill, as I said, \nhas the moneys for the immediate repair and assistance to the people \nwho have been severely harmed in the wake of these hurricanes. And we \nwould like to get that, too, before the Senate. So unless the Senator \nhas some objection--\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to \npoint out the fact that this was a bill that was taken up in our \ncommittee back in June, and approved unanimously by the Committee on \nAppropriations, to fund the Department of Homeland Security. I want to \nlend my support and encouragement to the Senate to go along with the \nchairman of the full committee. It no longer contains any language to \nwhich there had been some objection posed by other Senators. So I hope \nthe chairman of the full committee will be respected by the Senate and \nthat his unanimous consent request can be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the request of the Senator from Iowa is \nthat we amend the conference report. The conference report contains a \ndirected scoring concept that we put in there to assure the Senator \nthat the program that he authored, against which we have sought to \noffset some of the budget authority required for this military \nconstruction bill, would be taken so we could proceed with that \nprogram. The drought program is not specifically authorized by law. The \nHouse of Representatives required, as is their right, an offset to the \nmoneys that would be appropriated within the military construction bill \nfor the drought program. And it was the House of Representatives that \nmade this proposal.\n  In conference we did as I said, put in a directed scoring provision, \nand it was the directed scoring provision that the staff of the Senator \nfrom Iowa requested.\n  Now, it is that provision the Senator is using as a basis for \nobjecting to consider even the homeland security bill. The homeland \nsecurity bill does not have the drought program. He has objected to \ntaking up the homeland security bill because we will not change the \nmilitary construction bill.\n  Now, to me, in view of the crisis that faces this country, \nparticularly in regard to the use of FEMA funds, I find that \nappalling--just appalling. And I am going to come back again and again \nand again.\n  I repeat the request. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \nplace before the Senate the homeland security bill. It does not contain \nthe drought provisions. It does not contain the provision the Senator \nobjects to. I know of no other Senator who is objecting to that bill. \nSo I ask unanimous consent it be brought before the Senate and the \ncurrent procedure be put aside so we may consider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n  Unanimous Consent Request--Conference Report To Accompany H.R. 4837\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, now to the military construction bill. \nThe President has asked us on repeated occasions to bring matters \nbefore the Senate and the Congress as a whole to deal with those \ndisasters caused by the hurricanes. Those hurricanes came so fast, as \nwe got one request, we got another request, we got another request, so \nwe decided to put them all together and move them all.\n  I credit the wisdom of the distinguished chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Chairman Bill Young, for the ingenuity in \ndoing that because we might have been facing separate bills on all of \nthose supplemental requests had we not put them all together. We \nrequested the Military Construction Subcommittee in conference to allow \nus to add that coalition, that combination of those hurricane \nsupplementals, to put them on that bill.\n  That military construction bill passed both Houses. And obviously \nthat is the quickest way to get the money to Florida and those other \nStates. That money, some $9.1 billion in particular for the hurricane \nareas, is of extreme importance.\n\n  I point out that in that bill is directed scoring that shows the \nprovision we put in this bill to obtain the budget authority that we \ndid not have available to our committees--we borrowed in effect from a \nprogram that has budget authorities extending out until 2012--we have a \nprovision in this bill that says that program cannot be impacted by \nthis offset from now until the year 2007. So there is ample time to \ndeal with how we adjust, if we wish to, the impact of this money on the \nprogram that Senator Harkin authored. That offset is $2.8 billion \nagainst a program that is currently estimated to cost $8.9 billion, \nnotwithstanding the fact that its original estimate was $2 billion. But \nit won't affect the program.\n  The Senator has 2 years before there will be any diminution at all. \nNo one\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\nwould be hurt in any way. This is an accounting mechanism. We used \nbudget authority and outlays. We had the outlays. We need the budget \nauthority. So we borrowed, as we did 2 years ago, from that fund. It is \nan enormous fund, a noncontributory, mandatory program that builds and \nbuilds and builds.\n  I think the Senator has called attention sufficiently to this \nprogram. Many of us are going to examine that program in real depth. I \nknow of no other program, even Medicare, that has contributions from \nthe public at large, from people who are benefited by employees. It is \nnot just taking of money directly from the taxpayers' funds, from the \nTreasury, and spending it without regard to any consideration at all as \nto cost.\n  Again, this MILCON bill must pass. I ask unanimous consent that the \nexisting procedure for cloture on the FSC bill be put aside so that \nH.R. 4837 may be placed before the Senate for the purpose of \nconsidering it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much do I have left of my hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 47 minutes left.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I reserve the remainder of my time. I will be back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to say how disappointed I am that \nwe are holding back vitally important pieces of legislation in the \nSenate for in some respects--I understand the political shows that we \nall put on before elections. I understand that. But we are holding back \nmoney from States such as Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Florida, and others \nthat right now need resources to help recover from the hurricanes that \nhit us in the eastern part of the United States. We have individuals--\nnot just one, now two--who are holding us from passing that legislation \nto get those needed resources the Senator from Alaska suggested are \nvitally needed for FEMA now to get those resources to people who need \nit now.\n  I was on the phone the day before yesterday with my Governor. We were \ntalking about the concern over the shortage of funds, the concern about \nthe ability for FEMA to respond and get some of these businesses \naffected by floods in Pennsylvania up and going. The bill we have here \non the floor right now, we could pass it right now and get this money \ninto the hands of people in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South \nCarolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and other \nStates that have been affected by the hurricanes over the last couple \nof months. We are being blocked because someone doesn't like a \nprovision that takes money out of a program that was overfunded, that \nis spending enormous amounts more than what it was intended to spend.\n  So we have a program that was supposed to spend a couple of billion \ndollars, now is spending four or five times that amount. And the author \nof the program doesn't want to put any fiscal constraint on it. As a \nresult of that, we are not getting flood relief. We are not getting \nhurricane relief.\n  This is the kind of pettiness in the Senate, partisanship, that gives \nthis institution a bad name. This is the kind of stuff people sit at \nhome and wonder: What are we thinking here. There are people hurting. \nThe money that is being taken out of this program that is the reason \nfor this bill not passing, most of that money isn't for 6, 7, 8, 9 \nyears. The Senator from Iowa can come back next year and get his money \nback. If there is enough support in this body to get the money back in \nthe program, come back next year and put the money back in the program. \nYou want the money, prove to the Members here that this is an important \nenough program to get the money put back in next year. If it is that \nwonderful, if it is that broadly supported, come back with an amendment \nto an appropriations vehicle and get the money put back in.\n  But don't stop people who are in desperate need, who have to have \nfurnaces for their homes as the weather turns cold in our area of the \ncountry, from having the resources necessary to respond to this \ndisaster.\n  The money being taken out of this program is over the course of the \nnext 8 years. We are holding up vital funds for people in need today. I \ncan understand how people get upset with this place. Because a lot of \nthe things we do around here don't make a lot of sense. It can be one \nperson. If anybody doesn't think one person can make a difference, one \nperson can make a difference here in the Senate, positively and \nnegatively.\n  I will let you decide whether a program whose funding was cut over \nthe next 7 or 8 years is as important, no matter what it is, as getting \nresources to people who are suffering now in America. You decide.\n  Then we have the issue on a bill, the tax bill that is before us. We \nhave the Senator from Louisiana who is upset that she didn't get a \nprovision in the tax bill. I would like to tell the Senator from \nLouisiana and every other Senator, I have a long list of things I did \nnot get in this tax bill. I spent two full days sitting over in the \nHouse of Representatives Ways and Means room, pleading with the \nCongressman from California and others for provisions I thought were \nvitally important to the economy, to average working people, to people \nin my State, to people in other States, energy provisions.\n  I understand the Senator from Louisiana didn't get her provision in \nthe bill. By the way, this is a bill having to do with foreign tax \ncredits, foreign sales corporations. Everyone complains about putting \nextraneous provisions on. This is probably an extraneous provision to \nthe core of this bill. I would make the argument that the provisions I \nwas arguing for, which was the Baucus amendment--he offered a single \namendment on this, the 5-year net operating loss carryback--to me that \nwas important. There are businesses in my State that can't hire people \nbecause of the way the Tax Code works and unfairly treats them when \nthey have a good year versus bad. It averages it out to keep things \ngoing smoothly. It is a vitally important provision, from my \nperspective, to create jobs and employment opportunities. It was \ndefeated. The House defeated it. We passed it in the Senate. We pass \nlots of amendments in the Senate, and the House defeated it.\n\n  I had an amendment that was vitally important for me in my State and \nfor the neighboring State of Ohio. I worked diligently on that \namendment. It wasn't a $2 billion-plus provision; it was for $30 \nmillion. I look at the Senator from Mississippi, who may be thinking: \n$30 million? We worry about $30 million over 10 years--$30 million? I \ncould not get a $30 million provision in this bill. It could have meant \nthousands of jobs for my State and neighboring States, and I could not \nget it in the bill.\n  Yes, I could grandstand before the people of Pennsylvania and \ngrandstand before the people of America and say I am going to fight \nthis bill and stand up for everything, and I am going to get my \namendment passed and we are going to send it back to the House, and the \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is a rotten guy. I could \ndo that stuff, and I could act like a hero and make great political \nheadlines. But do you know what. That is not going to get my provision \npassed, and I can guarantee that the chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee is not going to pass my provision if I call him names \non the floor of the Senate, which has been done over the last 24 hours, \nand particularly if they don't agree with the substance of the \nprovision. They are not going to pass it when they see political \ngrandstanding at its worst a few weeks before the election.\n  What are they holding up? They are holding up a provision that--right \nnow, this bill being held up stops tariffs from being levied on \nbusinesses in America, which is hurting jobs today. If we pass this \ntoday and get it to the President that much quicker, we would stop \nthose tariffs. We hear so much complaining about how we need to be \ncompetitive internationally. This is a bill that will end unfair \ntariffs that are being imposed on American businesses. We are holding \nit back for this provision. Is it worthy? I will get into the \nworthiness in a moment. Even assuming it is the most worthy provision \nin the world, we are holding back something that is a vitally important \npiece of business that will get our businesses\n\n[[Page S11048]]\n\nhelp and help people be competitive in a world with a global economy.\n  We have political grandstanding going on. Let me assure anybody who \nthinks they can play this game on any amendment they may like and they \nare going to hold up the show because they didn't get their provision, \nwhich wasn't even offered by any individual Senator, an amendment that \nwas so important--I understand it was so important to one particular \nMember, but I can tell you not one Senator on either side of the aisle \noffered this as a singular amendment to be passed.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma said, I sat there for two days. If it \nwas that important of an amendment, I can tell you there was a whole \nenergy bill in there that is very important. You want to talk about \nimportant for national security and for economic security and \nstability? How about passing an energy bill when you have $53-a-barrel \noil? You bet I wanted to get that done. Am I upset that we did not \ninclude that? You bet. Part of the legislative process is that you have \nto make choices.\n  This was a bill very narrow in scope. There were a lot of things we \npassed in the Senate that we didn't pay for, or we did pay for but the \n``pay fors'' probably had more objections than the underlying \namendments. When it came over to the House, all these ``pay fors'' went \naway. We had a requirement in this body on both sides of the aisle that \nthis was going to be a revenue neutral bill. So there we are. We had to \ncut out provisions in the Senate bill. The provision of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana got cut. My provision was cut. The energy bill got cut. \nA whole list of very good pieces of legislation got cut. I wish they \nhad not. I wish we could have found a way to pass them. We could not. \nHere we are.\n  Are we going to end tariffs and give our businesses the opportunity \nto compete globally? Are we going to grandstand and talk about how we \nare going to keep people here all night long? The Senator from Missouri \nwill have to sit here all night long and other Senators have to sit in \nthe chair all night long just to show how tough we are, how we are \ngoing to stand up and fight for our men and women in uniform.\n  Let's see. The Senator's amendment provides a tax credit for \nbusinesses who have employees who are guardsmen and reservists \noverseas. As the Senator from Oklahoma said, that seems to be a rather \nindirect way of increasing pay for Guard and Reserve. Also, I make the \nargument it is a very inefficient way. I have the magazine of the \nReserve Officers Association of the United States in my hand. This \nmagazine surveyed the Fortune 500 companies. I commend the article to \nmy colleagues.\n  This was published in the January-February 2003 edition. What this \nsaid--by the way, obviously, I don't have an updated copy. I don't know \nwhether they have done another survey. When they did the last survey, \nwe found that, in 2003, only 17 of the Fortune 500 companies did not \nprovide additional compensation for guardsmen and reservists who were \ndeployed. In fact, well over a hundred--154--provide full compensation. \nIn other words, they pay them fully, every penny of their salary--not \njust what the Senator from Louisiana suggested, $15,000, but fully pay \ntheir salaries. The rest pay some or most of their salary and benefits \nfor the individuals and their families.\n  What are we going to do with this legislation? We are going to enrich \nthe Halliburtons of this world and the other big Fortune 500 companies \nthat are already providing these benefits. We are now going to give \nthem a tax credit. We are going to spend $2 billion-plus to give tax \ncredits to Fortune 500 companies and a lot of other companies that \nalready are providing these benefits. Is that a very efficient, cost-\neffective way, in a time of big deficits, to pay Guard and Reserve a \nlot of money? I argue that is about as inefficient a way as possible to \ndo this.\n  Who are we benefiting here? Certainly the Fortune 500 companies. Are \nwe benefiting the reservists or the Guard person when all but 17 of \nthese companies are giving benefits now in excess of their pay that the \nGovernment pays them? So if we send those companies that money, all the \ncompany has to do is say: Thank you for the money. We are already \npaying them, but we could use the money. We can increase our profits a \nlittle bit. Thank you very much. There is no obligation in this \nlegislation that they have to take that money and pay even more \nbenefits. In fact, 154 of the companies already pay full benefits. They \ncould not pay any more benefits.\n  I understand the Senator from Louisiana wants her provision included. \nWe all like to get our provisions included. We also would like to go \nhome. We would all like to get our business done. We would all like to \ngo out and get in touch with our constituents and find out what they \nreally think instead of what we think here is best for them. We do a \nlot of that around here--what we think is best for everybody. I argue \nthat this provision, which is going to enrich a lot of Fortune 500 \ncompanies, is the most inefficient way possible to solve this problem. \nIf you want to pay guardsmen and reservists more, talk to the Senator \nfrom Virginia, talk to the Senator from Alaska, talk to the new \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Mississippi, \nand you ask them whether we can structure something so that we are now \ngoing to compensate Guard and Reserve more than we are going to \ncompensate Active Duty people. That is a legitimate issue. I believe we \ncan have that debate.\n  But to make all this fuss about how we are going to stand up for all \nour guardsmen and reservists and fight for them until the end, let me \nassure the Senator from Louisiana, at 7:40 tomorrow we are going to \npass this bill. If the Senator from Louisiana wants to make everybody \nsit here until 7:40 tomorrow night, we can wait until then, and at 7:40 \nthis bill will pass and her provision is not going to be on it, and her \nprovision is not going to become a Senate bill passed by the Senate \nbetween now and then. We can wait until that time. We can wait and let \nthe tariffs continue to be levied another day on our workers here in \nAmerica.\n  We can wait and have provisions having to do with energy such as the \nAlaska pipeline another day; we can wait so we can have the political \nopportunity to talk about how important Guard and Reserve members of \nour military are; but this is an inefficient and costly way of solving \nthe problem.\n  I argue that is as much a reason why it did not pass as anything \nelse. The idea that someone believes their provision is so much \nsuperior to everybody else's, I think that probably every Member of the \nSenate had a provision they wanted or they would like to have seen in \nthat bill that they did not get.\n  The thing about legislating is we do the best we can. We work hard \nand live to fight another day, and we do so in a way that builds \nrelationships, tries to get things done in a collegial way. I make the \nargument that keeping Members here on Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and \nTuesdays during recesses when people had scheduled events, when their \ncampaigns are, obviously, at this point very much underway, when \nnothing substantively that they are proposing is going to happen, is \nnot the most effective way to win friends and influence people.\n  Now, if I were for the Senator's provision--I do not know whether I \nwill ultimately end up voting for it, but I ask her, if I were a \nsupporter, to please give this proposal a chance instead of making it a \nproposal that has fostered some ill will around this place. We have an \nopportunity to do something right, pass three pieces of legislation \nthat should be passed. We have disaster assistance that should be out \ntoday, as well as homeland security. I wish I had a nickel for \neverybody who talked about how much more money we need for homeland \nsecurity. We listened to the debate the other night where it was said \nwe were not spending enough on homeland security.\n  Well, we have a Homeland Security bill. The subcommittee chairman is \nin the Chamber. I do not know what the increase is for homeland \nsecurity in this bill from last year, but I suspect it is substantial. \nThat money is not being spent. We are in the next fiscal year right \nnow. We could be spending that money right now. We could be securing \nour homeland right now.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. In fact, I can answer that question partially. I looked \nat the legislative notice that was published back in September when we \nhad the bill on the Senate floor. We are increasing by 9.2 percent the \nspending\n\n[[Page S11049]]\n\nthat goes to the Department of Homeland Security overall. So by \nwithholding this funding--we are into the new fiscal year as the \nSenator points out--we are allowing individual programs administered by \nthe Department of Homeland Security to suffer. We are requiring them to \ngive up, in effect, the increases that have already been approved by \nthis Senate and in the conference report on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill.\n  Some of the programs, for example, that have been increased \nsubstantially are Project Bioshield, the Transportation Security \nAdministration activities, the U.S. Coast Guard. Those are fully funded \nat the administration's requested level, which were substantially \nincreased over the last fiscal year.\n  So this is causing real harm, and the Senator makes that point.\n  I point out specifically how it is causing the harmful results: new \ntechnologies to enhance security of our country by identifying people \ncoming into the country who are using visas. We have new technologies \nnow that can be used to screen and to make sure people are who the visa \nsays they are. This is something that is not going to be utilized for \nthis period of time in the new fiscal year because the increases in \nfunding are not being made available. So this is really serious. We \nneed to pass this Homeland Security appropriations conference report as \nsoon as possible. We need to do it today. We needed to do it when it \nwas ripe for consideration yesterday.\n\n  It does not contain any provision that is being opposed by the other \nside.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Mississippi, is there any \nprovision in this bill that is being objected to by anybody, that the \nSenate is aware of, on either side of the aisle?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. There is no objection that I have heard from any \nSenator. There is a disaster provision that was included in this bill. \nIt has now been taken off the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It \nhas been added to the Military Construction appropriations bill. This \nbill is clean of any provision that any Senator had opposed, to my \nknowledge.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I then will reiterate, if there is no objection to this \nbill, I ask unanimous consent that--I yield to the Senator from Alaska, \nsince he is the chairman of the committee, and ask if the Senator would \nlike to make a unanimous consent request because I think this is \nimportant. Since we have now established beyond a shadow of a doubt \nthat there is no objection by any Senator to this bill on either side \nof the aisle, I ask the Senator if maybe this would be an opportunity \nthat we could have to pass this bill and get these needed funds for \nhomeland security purposes. At a time of war when our threat has been \nelevated, where they talk about all the danger that is in front of us \nas we lead up to this election, not to be able to pass this Homeland \nSecurity bill at this time would be unconscionable, so I would be happy \nto yield to the Senator from Alaska to ask for the opportunity to pass \nthis bill since nobody is objecting to any of the substantive \nprovisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. \nWe have heard no objection. As a matter of fact, we have a wrap-up \nprocedure, is what we call it--and the Senator is familiar with that--\nat the end of each legislative day. This Homeland Security bill was in \nthat. We know that absolutely no one objected to the Homeland Security \nbill in the first instance and later the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, \ncame back and objected. So this bill is held up apparently because the \nSenator from Iowa wanted to have some other thing in the way of getting \non Military Construction.\n  I am happy to renew the request.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator would yield just to clarify, the Senator \nfrom Iowa came back and objected not to any particular provision in \nthis bill; there was no objection to the underlying Homeland Security \nbill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know of no objection any Senator has raised to the \nHomeland Security bill. The Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely \ncorrect about that.\n  I renew the request, and that is that we set aside the current \ncloture procedure and that the Homeland Security bill be laid before \nthe Senate, H.R. 4567; that the conference report be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Iowa just objected again to this bill, \nwhich nobody objects to, being passed. Again, it is 3:30 eastern time \non a Sunday and I suspect the viewing audience of this debate is not \nparticularly high, but I would also suspect that those who are viewing \nare sitting there with furrowed brow asking: What was that all about? \nNo one objects to this bill, yet there is an objection.\n  Our country is at war. Our country is at war. There are threats to \nthe homeland. We have the Democratic nominee for President, a Member of \nthis body, who I suspect might have some say about what Members on his \nside of the aisle will do in a few weeks before the election, who \ncomplains constantly that we are not spending enough money on homeland \nsecurity, that we have not defended the homeland as vehemently as we \nshould have. Where is the Senator from Massachusetts today to put those \nwords into action, to get this bill passed so we can get this money \nspent now?\n  It is all a bunch of smoke and mirrors: Oh, yes, we are for all this \nstuff but a provision having to do with land conservation that is \nspending four and a half times more money than was originally intended \nto be spent over a 10-year period of time, the money in the outyears of \nthat program have been reduced to pay for immediate drought assistance \nin almost the very same area of the country, and it is in a separate \nbill than the Homeland Security bill and that is why homeland security \nis not going to pass right now. That is why our homeland will go less \ndefended today than it could be. The furrowed brows are justifiable in \nthis case. This is wrong.\n\n  We may be lucky. We may be lucky. The 5 days or 4 days I understand \nwe are talking about, maybe Thursday before we can potentially get the \nbill passed, the 5 days--we could have passed it yesterday by consent, \nso Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday--6 days. The 6-day \ndelay may not cost anybody's life in America. It may not cost a life. \nWe might not have resources that are deployed because 6 days sooner we \nwould have signed this bill and those resources would have been \navailable to maybe protect somebody in America. We will never know \nthat--or maybe we will. But the fact is, to hold up a piece of \nlegislation that is a vital national security interest, for a very \nsmall piece of legislation where money was to be taken from it years \ndown the road, I think, reflects the worst of what people see in \nWashington, DC.\n  I am hopeful the persistence of the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the persistence of the chairman of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee over the next 24 hours that we will be here, or 27 hours \nthat we will be here, will eventually pay off. I know there are Members \non the other side of the aisle who are working diligently to try to \nconvince the Members on that side to move America's business forward. \nLet me assure everybody--I think we all know this--that the \nlegislation, the homeland security legislation, the drought and \ndisaster relief, the hurricane relief money, and the FSC/ETI bill, the \nJOBS bill having to do with foreign sales--all three of those are going \nto pass just as they are. There will be no amendments. They are not \nallowed under the rules. There will be no separate deals that will \nallow other provisions to pass to make everybody happy.\n  They will all pass. They will all pass as if, in fact, we just stood \nup here and called for the vote on them right now. There will be no \ndifference.\n  The question is how long are some individuals going to make the \nSenate wait. But candidly, I complained about not being able to be with \nmy family today. It is Sunday. Usually I take Sundays off and try to be \nhome with my six children. I will tell them, they might be watching, I \nwill be home soon, I hope.\n  But that is a minor inconvenience. That is meaningless. Our job is to \nbe\n\n[[Page S11050]]\n\nhere to do the job we have to do to get what we need done for the \nAmerican people. The reason I am here today and the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Alaska \nand the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Hawaii--we are here \nbecause we want to get the people's business done. We want to cut those \ntariffs. We want to eliminate them. We have a chance to do that today. \nWe want to get that money out for disaster assistance. We have a chance \nto do that today. We want to get that money to the law enforcement \nagencies and the transportation agencies to protect people here at \nhome. We can do that today.\n  But, because of two individuals, we are not. They may stand here and \ngive speeches about how heroic their effort is, and how important their \njob is to get these provisions they have worked so hard on, but we \ncould all be doing that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of all of the amendments considered in the Finance and Ways and \nMeans Committee conference report on October 5 and 6.\n  There is a whole page of them. There are 23 amendments on the first \nday and another 10 amendments on the next day. We had 33 amendments \nalso considered. I would argue the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana was not offered, except that at the end of the markup all the \namendments that no one wanted to offer that were in the Senate bill, \nthat were not offered individually, we threw them all together in one \nbig package and offered them, and her amendment was in the big package \nthat no one thought was important enough to offer individually.\n  I will not argue her provision is not important. It is, obviously, \ncertainly important to her. But not one member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Republican or Democrat, House or Senate, offered it. And we \nare being held up on the Senate floor. I don't know why. It is not \ngoing to become law. At some point you have to say, getting those \ntariffs off the backs of American business is more important than even \nthe most important provision in your heart. Trust me, I had some of \nthose amendments. It is time for responsible legislating. It is about \ntime we get serious. Let's get our job done. Let's get our job done for \nthe American people. It is decided. Nothing is going to change. It is \njust a matter of when we are going to do it.\n  I hope through the good work of the Democratic and Republican \nleadership--I know Members on both sides are working diligently to try \nto work through this--that we stop the tariffs that are making us \nglobally uncompetitive; that we start funding homeland security at the \nlevels the President and this body said they wanted; and that we start \ngetting the resources to people all throughout the eastern part of the \nUnited States, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, get the \nresources into the hands of the small business people and homeowners \nwho have been hurt by the floods and storms of the last couple of \nmonths. That is what this is all about, those three things, three \nvitally important provisions, three bills that could pass in 5 minutes. \nIn 5 minutes we could call those bills up and pass them.\n  I feel like ``Name that Tune.'' I bet we could do it in 4 minutes, \nmaybe even in 3 minutes we could pass all these bills. And, by the way, \nthey are going to pass. They may not pass tomorrow--well, one of them \nwill pass tomorrow. Maybe Wednesday. Maybe Thursday. They are going to \npass. So what are we accomplishing? We are hurting the American public. \nWe are costing jobs. We are adding insult to injury to people who have \nbeen devastated by natural disaster, and we are making our country more \nvulnerable by not having increased homeland security protection at \nhome. That is what we are accomplishing.\n  Congratulations, Senate. Good job. Keep those tariffs high. Make us \nuncompetitive. Don't give that money to people who suffered through \nnatural disasters. Let's keep it here in Washington because we have \nsome political points to make.\n  I have some political points I need to make. You know, you can wait. \nYou can wait, Transportation Security Agency, for that additional \nfunding. You can wait, Coast Guard, for that additional funding. You \ncan wait, because politics here in the Senate comes first. \nOpportunities to show the folks back home I am fighting for you, that \ncomes first. Amazing. Amazing.\n  The most amazing thing is it is a futile fight. All three bills will \npass without changes. Do you know why? Do you know why I am certain, \nwhy the Senator from Mississippi is certain? Because that is the rules \nof the Senate. They cannot change. They are conference reports. They \ncannot be amended. So what is this all about? It is about putting \npersonal political interests above the interests of those hurt by \nnatural disasters, those who are being hurt by high tariffs, and those \nwho would like to feel more secure in our country with increased \nhomeland security spending. That is what it is about. Let's tell the \nstory. Let's tell the story about what is going on here on a Sunday \nafternoon in the Senate. Everyone is safely at home, we hope, watching \ntheir football games or the league championship series. What is going \non here in the Senate is political demagoguery at its highest level. \nLet's call it for what it is. We need to stop this. We need to get our \njob done. We need to go home and talk to our constituents and work on \nproblems.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, again, on the issue of homeland security, \nthat we call up the Homeland Security conference report that has not \nbeen objected to on any substantive ground, that we call up the \nHomeland Security Subcommittee appropriations conference report and \npass that bill by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndisaster assistance conference report and the Military Construction \nconference report be called up, and I ask unanimous consent they be \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the FSC/ETI conference \nreport be called up and passed by unanimous consent to stop the tariffs \nfrom being imposed on our workers across the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Mississippi \nthat we could have done that in less than a minute. If we had not heard \nthe word ``objection'' three times, those bills would be passed right \nnow.\n  By the way, mark my word. All three will be passed just as they are, \nbut we are just going to have to wait a while because while the \nbusiness of the Senate is done, the talking isn't done. While the \nbusiness of the American people has been done, the politics isn't over \nyet.\n  At this point I yield my time, and let the show begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to respond to \nthe Senator from Alaska who said this bill would not affect the program \nbecause it took funds out of the outyears. That is not true because \nthis is a contractual program. Farmers have to sign 5- to 10-year \ncontracts. If you take money out of the outyears, of course, that \naffects how the programs operate today, the ability of USDA to sign 5- \nto 10-year contracts today.\n  The Senator also said he did not know of any other program like this, \nwhich is a mandatory program without a fixed spending limit. I am \nsorry, but there are a lot of programs like that in our agriculture \ncommittee. The programs are like that. I see our chairman sitting here. \nThe commodity programs are exactly like that. Apart from agriculture \nthere are a lot of programs that operate that way.\n  I will respond to my friend from Pennsylvania. Regarding getting \nmoney out, I will point out that my friend from Pennsylvania said there \nare not too many offices open in Pennsylvania today. I also point out \nthat he may have forgotten that Columbus Day\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\nis a national holiday, and I don't think there will be many offices \nopen in Pennsylvania that day either.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania went on with quite inflammatory-type \nlanguage about getting these bills done. I will point out that the \nMILCON bill passed the Senate on September 20. I never heard--maybe I \nmissed it--the Senator from Pennsylvania speak so heatedly after \nSeptember 20 about the necessity of getting this bill done. It has been \nout of here since September 20. Yet I only heard him talking about the \nnecessity of passing it today. I never heard about it before. This is \nall politics. That is all it is.\n  I point out that homeland security passed September 14. I have not \nheard the Senator from Pennsylvania complaining before about how we \nneed to get the House to act and get that done in a hurry. I had not \nheard it until today. It is just politics. We all know that.\n  Again, I am somewhat surprised that the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nwilling to take money out of the pockets of Pennsylvania farmers and \nuse that money to pay for farmers in Texas or Colorado or Wyoming or \nMontana. He is willing to do that.\n  I will point out again that the Senator talked about going back to \nappropriations to get funds for conservation back later. But we passed \nthis conservation program in the farm bill, not in appropriations.\n  I also point out to the Senator from Pennsylvania that just \nyesterday, on a resolution that was before this body, 71 Senators voted \naffirmatively that this disaster money ought to be emergency spending \nand not offset out of farm programs. Mr. President, 71 Senators voted \nyes; 14 voted no. I guess it comes as no surprise that the Senator from \nPennsylvania was 1 of the 14 who voted no. So he is in favor of taking \nmoney out of the farm program to pay for disasters. Surprise, surprise. \nMaybe it is not a surprise for some.\n  But I point out that Pennsylvania, the State he represents, is in the \nhurricane assistance package. They get the hurricane assistance without \nhaving an offset, along with Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, and a \nfew other States.\n  One can be selfish about things and one can look upon disaster \nassistance as a national priority.\n  I note that a number of Senators from other States that were affected \nby the hurricane voted the other way. The Senators from Virginia, \nFlorida, Georgia, the Carolinas, to cite some, all basically voted to \nsay: Yes, we are happy that the hurricane money comes to us. But you \nare right, other disaster money ought to be emergency. But not the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. He voted to take it out of the farm program \nhimself.\n  I wish he would follow the lead of some other Senators who are \naffected by hurricanes in other States. They said unselfishly: Yes, we \nneed help. I believe they do, too, and it ought to be an emergency. But \nI also believe that farmers who suffered from drought or flooding in \nIowa, floods in North Dakota, suffered from tornadoes in Oklahoma, hail \nin Minnesota, wind damage in Wisconsin, pest infestation in \nPennsylvania, they too suffered a disaster.\n\n  That ought to be taken out of emergency spending just as we have done \nfor the last 50 years, with one exception 2 years ago. That was \ncorrected right away.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania stands in a small minority who believe \nthat disaster money ought to be taken out of the farm program.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania went on talking about how much money \nthis conservation program costs. He said it will cost four and one-half \ntimes what it was supposed to. That is a guesstimate. We really do not \nknow exactly and for certain what it is going to cost, and I don't \nthink it is going to cost that much. But, nonetheless, he went on about \nthis program. I will check the record. I could be wrong in my \ninterpretation. But I believe he said we should not have programs like \nthat, that we ought to come back and get appropriations for them.\n  I just wonder. Of course, the Senator from Pennsylvania is no longer \nin the Chamber, but I am sure someone will tell him what I said. I \nwould like to ask the Senator from Pennsylvania whether he wants the \nsame rules to apply to the milk income loss program. Would the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania like the same rules he is trying to put on the \nconservation program to apply to the milk income loss program? I bet he \nwouldn't because that affects his dairy farmers in Pennsylvania.\n\n  We put the milk income loss program in the farm bill. It was \nestimated to cost $1.7 billion through fiscal 2005. Later, CBO said it \nwould cost more than $4 billion. Already it has cost $2 billion. I \ndon't hear the Senator from Pennsylvania griping about that and saying \nthat is not right, that if it was supposed to have cost $1.7 billion, \nthat is where we should have capped it.\n  But the milk loss program will be coming back and we will see if the \nSenator from Pennsylvania would like to apply the same rules to that. \nIn fact, the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to extend the milk loss \nprogram. He does not want to just let it expire but wants to extend it. \nHe does not care how much it costs because it is uncapped. It is \nanother one of those uncapped entitlement programs, I point out to the \nSenator from Alaska, that is paid for by the taxpayers of this country. \nThere is no cap on that program. It is an entitlement program paid for \nby the taxpayers. Again, I point that out to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, maybe he would like to go in there and get some money \nfrom that program.\n  I will talk about the conservation program for a few minutes. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania said what gives us a bad name around here--I \ndon't remember all that he said--is the procedure of the Senate , like \nthis afternoon. What gives us a bad name is when we agree to do \nsomething, enact it, and our constituents rely upon that, and then we \ncome back later and a few people, exercising their power, run roughshod \nover the will of the majority and change the program we had promised to \nthe people, We have enacted this program for you.\n  In the farm bill, we fought out these issues. We hammered them out \nand made agreements and we created this Conservation Security Program. \nOur constituency--farmers, conservationists and environmentalists and \nothers around the country--were told, OK, you can rely on these 5- to \n1-year contracts.\n  Now a few people have come back to thwart the will of the majority. \nAs I pointed out, 71 Senators voted against taking an offset for \ndisaster assistance, not to take it out of conservation. That is \noverwhelming. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly supported \nthis program, but OMB, under the guidance of the White House, and with \nthe concurrence of a few people in the House leadership and \nAppropriations Committee, were able to change it. That is what gives us \na bad name around here, that a few people can thwart the will of the \nmajority and change those programs.\n  Again, this is a program that was historic, the whole conservation \ntitle of the farm bill. When the President of the United States signed \nthe farm bill in May of 2002, he said one of the main reasons he was \nsigning it was because of the historic increase in conservation, an 80-\npercent increase. We had a lot of programs in there for conservation, \nand we had a new program called the Conservation Security Program. \nEveryone said good things about it, including the President.\n  Unlike other conservation programs, the Conservation Security Program \ntook a comprehensive approach to conservation. It not only encourages \nthe adoption of new practices, it rewards those who are already \nimplementing important resource-conserving practices. CSP, as it has \ncome to be known, the Conservation Security Program, was designed \nspecifically as an open national program, equivalent to the commodity \nprograms except instead of being paid in relation to farm commodity \nproduction, farmers and ranchers are now going to be paid for producing \nenvironmental benefits such as cleaner air, cleaner water, saving soil, \nenhanced wildlife habitat, and the adoption of energy-\nconserving practices.\n\n  The CSP is also clearly a way to provide all producers across the \nNation the tools and opportunity to implement conservation practices \nand to lessen the need for environmental regulations. It also provides \nincentives for producers to create and adopt innovative conservation \npractices.\n  Again, those who would severely restrict this program and kill it, as \nthey\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\nhave been trying to do, are opening the door for environmental \nregulations. The people of this country want cleaner air. They want \ncleaner water. They want to stop soil erosion. They want to clean up \nour rivers and our streams and our lakes. They want to stop what is \nhappening in the Gulf of Mexico with sediment and nutrients coming down \nthe Mississippi. That is what this program is designed to do, to \nencourage farmers on a voluntary basis to implement these practices.\n  The funding for CSP was like that for a commodity program. We were \ngoing to make producing conservation benefits much like a commodity. \nThe commodity programs have no fixed cost limit, no cap, I say to the \nSenator from Alaska. They are uncapped programs, just like the milk \nincome loss program is an uncapped program. There are a lot of these. \nWe do this in the Agriculture Committee and in other committees, a lot. \nThey are restricted not by an arbitrary cost limit but by the \neligibility requirements.\n  In order to get these payments, a farmer has to carry out substantial \npractices that will produce real conservation benefits. If you will do \nthose things, you qualify. But you have to save your soil, protect your \nwater, have cleaner air, enhance wildlife or conserve energy and those \ntypes of things. Then you qualify.\n  What a few people did under the guidance of the President was to come \nin and take a lot of money out of the conservation program. I was \nsurprised at this because two nights ago in the debate in St. Louis the \nPresident proclaimed his strong support for conservation. I said, wait \na minute, as I was watching this debate. At the very moment the \nPresident was saying he supported conservation, he had his people up \nhere on the Hill taking over $2.8 billion out of conservation, gutting \nconservation, taking out the money.\n  The President cannot have it both ways. You cannot on television tell \nthe American people you are for conservation and have your people up \nhere taking the money out of conservation. That is exactly what the \nPresident and his people are doing. We all know it. That is what this \nfight is about.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I am here to fight for \nfarmers. I am here to fight for a cleaner environment. I am here to \nfight to help save and improve our nation's soil, clean our water and \nour air, enhance wildlife. I am here to fight to give our nation's \nfarmers and ranchers the tools they need to be better producers, to be \nbetter stewards of their land. I am here to fight for our farmers. I am \nhere to fight for the farmers of Pennsylvania, too. Even if the Senator \nhimself won't fight for them, I will fight for them. I don't want to \ntake money away from the farmers in Pennsylvania to send to Iowa or to \nsend to Wyoming, Oklahoma, or anywhere else there is a disaster.\n  Just as all taxpayers of this country are giving some of their taxes \nto help the victims of the hurricane, so, too, should we all, as we \nhave for the last 50 years, provide assistance for those who suffer \nfrom tornados, floods, hailstorms, drought, and everything else. It is \na national problem.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania may want to take money away from his \nfarmers. I guess he did that yesterday when he was 1 of 14 who voted to \ntake money away from his own farmers to send to those who suffered a \ndisaster.\n  I point out that Pennsylvania is in the hurricane assistance bill. \nThey are going to get help and it will be emergency spending. Farmers \nin Wisconsin and Minnesota, farmers in Ohio and Missouri and other \nplaces, were not affected by that hurricane. What about them? Why \nshould they be treated differently? Their disaster hurts them as much \nas the hurricanes hurt people in Florida, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. We \nought to care as much about the farmers who were hit by a tornado or a \nmud slide or hail storms, acts of nature over which they have no \ncontrol.\n\n  Our farmers work hard. They produce the food and the fiber for our \ncountry. We have the best, most bountiful, cheapest food supply \nanywhere in the world, thanks to our farmers. They control a lot of \nthings, but one thing they cannot control is the weather. Yes, there \nare crop insurance programs, but they do not cover all crops equally or \nsufficiently in so many situations.\n  We have always said, when you get hit by a disaster, we will be there \nto help, just as we are for people in Pennsylvania. But I would hope \nthe people of Pennsylvania--I know the people of Pennsylvania. They are \nnot a selfish people. The people of Pennsylvania would want to help \nfarmers in Iowa or Missouri or Wisconsin or Ohio. They would want to \nhelp farmers who lost a crop because of a flood in North Dakota. They \nwould want that. They would want the Nation to do it, just as we are \nhelping them.\n  I am sorry that the Senator from Pennsylvania does not see it that \nway. I am sorry he can't be 1 of the 71 who voted to treat disaster \nassistance as an emergency and not take it out of the pockets of \nfarmers. Our farmers work hard. They do not deserve this kind of \ntreatment.\n  The dairy farmers in Pennsylvania who got money under the milk income \nloss program, well, we put that in the farm bill for those dairy \nfarmers in Pennsylvania. It does not affect my State as much as it does \nPennsylvania.\n  Well, I suppose you could say: We got ours. It is almost as if the \nSenator from Pennsylvania--it is almost as if I hear the words: Well, \nwe got ours. To heck with everybody else.\n  Well, look, we are all part of this country. We are all part of this \nNation. When a disaster strikes someone in Hawaii, we ought to be there \nfor them. Or Alaska, if there is an earthquake in Alaska, you bet we \nought to be there for them. We should not take it out of Alaska's \nhighway money, or we should not take it out of money that goes to \nHawaii for medical care, or something like that. We should not do that.\n  But evidently that is what some people around here are thinking. We \nshould not say to the poor people in Florida: Look, I'm sorry. We'll \ngive you hurricane assistance, but we are going to take it out of your \nhighway money; we are going to take it out of your Medicare; we are \ngoing to take it out of other Federal programs that go into your State. \nThat is not a caring kind of country if we do something like that.\n  So I would hope that we could be a little more caring and considerate \nof those who have suffered disasters in this country and make sure that \nthey, too, are treated just like we are treating people in Florida and \nPennsylvania and the other States that got hit by the hurricanes.\n  That is why I am here. That is why I am holding this up. That is why \nI wanted to get this corrected. I will fight--I will use every rule--I \nam not breaking any rule of the Senate, and I will not break any rules \nof the Senate--but I will use every rule I can of the Senate to stand \nup for farmers and for conservation and to stand up for people who were \nhit by disasters, to stand up for the agreements that we reached in the \nfarm bill.\n  We voluntarily and knowingly reached all of these agreements in \nwriting the farm bill and we stayed strictly within the budget we were \ngiven for it. We signed the conference report on the dotted line. Both \nthe House and Senate passed it by strong bipartisan majorities. The \nPresident signed the bill. Now the President and others want to come \nback and say: Well, everything is OK except this one program. We will \ntake out this one.\n  I am sorry, that is what gives this place a bad name. You cannot give \nyour word you are going to do something and then you go back on it. You \ncannot do that around this place. The President has sent his people up \nhere to do that.\n\n  If the President really wants to support conservation, he ought to \ntell his people: Look, put that disaster assistance in the emergency \nspending package just as you did the hurricanes. That is the fair, the \njust, the reasonable, and the compassionate way of doing it.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining of my hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 38 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for \npermitting me to go ahead of him.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Iowa for his\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\nstalwart stand for the farmers of America. He has been a strong Member \nof the Senate for our farmers over the years. I commend him for his \nstatement.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my views on the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4520, the Jumpstart Our Business Strength Act, to be on \nrecord as to why I voted against cloture. On balance, although the \npackage contains a number of helpful provisions, it ultimately falls \nshort of what we owe to the people of my State and the people of this \ncountry.\n  Initially, I would like to thank my colleagues for their hard work on \nthis bill, which contains some good provisions to help American \nbusinesses and works toward ending harmful tariffs currently placed on \nmany of our exports. The conference report also contains some much-\nneeded boosts for renewable energy and renewable fuels. It will expand \nproduction tax credits to include renewable sources of electricity, \nsuch as geothermal and solar energy, landfill gas, trash combustion, \nand open-loop biomass. It will provide a per-gallon excise tax credit \nfor ethanol blended by refineries and a 50-cent-per-gallon income tax \ncredit for each gallon of biodiesel used or sold as fuel. As a longtime \nadvocate for renewable and alternative energy sources, I believe these \nincentives are important to help our renewable energy businesses in \nHawaii increase the amount of renewable energy used to produce \nelectricity.\n  However, there is much more that the final conference agreement lacks \nthat leaves me no choice but to oppose the measure. For example, I am \ndisappointed that some of the measures in S. 476, the CARE Act, which \npassed the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 95 to 5, did not make it \ninto the bill. In particular, section 310 of the Senate's CARE Act bill \nis important for our teaching hospitals. The provision allows support \norganizations to utilize debt to improve teaching hospitals' real \nestate endowment. This would assist charitable teaching hospitals in my \nState of Hawaii and other States as well. Regrettably, this provision \nwas not incorporated into the conference report.\n  I supported another provision in an amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, that the Senate accepted by voice \nvote. This amendment sought to improve the credit for employers of the \nmen and women in the Ready Reserve or National Guard who have been \ncalled to active military duty. In light of large deployments underway \nin my State of Hawaii and other areas of the U.S.--as the Senator from \nLouisiana said earlier, about 57 percent of Hawaii's Guard and Reserves \nhave been called up--this was a very significant amendment to show that \nwe honor the commitment that the Reserves and Guard have made to our \ncountry. I am very disappointed that this amendment was stripped in \nconference, despite a strong show of support by this body.\n  I understand that there may be efforts to try to rectify this \nproblem, and I hope that we get somewhere, but it should have been \nremedied during conference on this measure.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes long-awaited provisions to shut \ndown certain abusive tax shelters. However, as meaningful as some of \nthose tax loophole closers are, the Senate had sought a stronger \npackage to further restore faith in corporate America. Although this \nrepresents a missed opportunity, I hope that we will revisit the matter \nin the next Congress.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the conferees heeded calls for fiscal \nresponsibility and used provisions such as those ending tax shelters to \nfully offset the package. However, depending on whether the leadership \nof our Nation or this body changes next month, we may face tremendous \nadditional costs years from now when tax cut extensions and expansions \nin the package are further extended or possibly made permanent. I hope \nthat we are able to stick to fiscal prudence when working on future tax \ncut measures, given important domestic and international priorities \nthat could continue to suffer from further major decreases in Federal \nrevenues.\n  I also oppose this bill because it represents a missed opportunity \nrelated to the U.S. Department of Labor's overtime regulations. Since \nthe Department published its proposed overtime regulations in the \nFederal Register in March 2003, Members of Congress have been trying to \nimprove the regulations to ensure that all workers are not adversely \naffected by these changes. However, our concerns have not been heard by \nthis administration. Rather, this administration continues to disregard \nthe wishes of the majority of the Members in this Chamber that believe \ncertain portions of the overtime regulations will take away overtime \nprotections for some workers. On May 4, 2004, the Senate passed an \namendment introduced by Senator Harkin that would allow for full \nimplementation of any regulations that expanded or improved overtime \ncoverage, but would prohibit the Department of Labor from implementing \nany new rules which would take away overtime protections currently \nguaranteed. And, once again, in conference, the provision was taken \naway.\n  Finally, an extremely important provision has been omitted from the \nconference report. By an overwhelming vote of 78 to 15, the Senate \napproved an amendment offered by my colleagues Senators Kennedy and \nDeWine to provide the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, with the \nauthority to regulate tobacco products. I appreciate their leadership \non this critical issue.\n  For too long, the FDA has not been provided with the necessary \nauthority to regulate a substance that causes so many lives to be lost. \nThe Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, American Heart Association, \nAmerican Cancer Society, and American Lung Association sponsored the \neducational campaign piece behind me. As you can see, it features a \nyoung child, likely no older than 8 or 9 years old. Yet, children this \nage are too often the target audience of cartoon-like tobacco \nadvertising that seeks to exploit them as part of a target market for \ncigarettes. According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, smoking is \nthe leading cause of preventable deaths, killing approximately 400,000 \npeople each year. The FDA must be provided with the authority to \nregulate tobacco products to help prevent children from becoming \naddicted and to make tobacco products less harmful than they are in \ntheir current form.\n  It is estimated that 2,000 children are hooked on tobacco every day. \nFlavoring cigarettes is one of the tactics used to entice children and \nteenagers to start smoking. Right here, you can see an example of the \nmarketing that was employed in this campaign. This summer, R.J. \nReynolds Tobacco Company produced flavored cigarettes that used images \nof my home State of Hawaii and the name of one of our islands in an \nattempt to make smoking more attractive. One of the cigarettes, which \nwas named Kauai Kolada, is flavored with ``Hawaiian hints of pineapple \nand coconut.'' I don't know if you can see this, but let me point it \nout right here. Another lime-flavored cigarette is featured in the same \nmarketing campaign.\n  I am outraged that a manufacturer of such a deadly product would \nexploit and, therefore, taint images and names from Hawaii in their \nattempts to lure children into smoking. It presents a false promise of \nparadise. The DeWine-Kennedy amendment would have prohibited flavored \ncigarettes, such as the Kauai Kolada, and restricted tobacco \nadvertising.\n  Any buyout for tobacco farmers must include FDA regulation. It is \noutrageous that this current Congress will fail to take necessary and \njustifiable steps to help protect our children and improve the public \nhealth of our country. It appears that certain tobacco companies want \nto continue to cultivate another generation of smokers so that they can \nincrease their sale and reap more profits at the expense of the health \nand well-being of our families.\n  Coming from a State that does not have a large manufacturing base, \nthe bulk of this conference report will not apply. Given that fact, I \nstill find it my duty to help American manufacturers for the good of \nour country, and I applaud the provisions in this conference report \nthat do so. It is our manufacturers that help us maintain our status as \nan economic powerhouse in the world.\n  However, as occurs with other large bills, there are enough things \nwrong with this final package and enough missed opportunities that I am \nunable to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McConnell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a provision in the \npending tax bill that will benefit tens of thousands of families, \nmostly African-American families, a provision based on the Sickle Cell \nTreatment Act, S. 874, that I introduced last year with my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  Before I discuss the provision, I thank the leader and also our \ndistinguished majority whip for their hard work in advocating for the \ninclusion of this provision in the conference report. It is very \nimportant legislation. Certainly, it is bipartisan and bicameral \nlegislation, designed to help treat and find a comprehensive cure for \nsickle-cell disease, a genetic disease that affects primarily, but by \nno means exclusively, African Americans.\n  I am very pleased that the provision enjoys the strong support of \nmany prominent children's health groups, African-American groups, union \ngroups, church groups, and medical groups in general.\n  Why does the bill have such broad-based appeal? Because it would make \na real difference in the lives of families who have struggled with this \ndisease, as well as others who are high risk for getting it.\n  Here are a few statistics about sickle-cell disease: About 1 in 300 \nnewborn African-American infants are born with sickle-cell disease. \nMore than 2,500,000 Americans have the sickle-cell trait. They do not \nnecessarily have the disease but they have the trait and therefore may \npass the disease on to their children. Sickle-cell disease is the most \ncommon genetic disease that is screened in American newborns. People \nwith the disease have red blood cells that contain abnormal types of \nhemoglobin and therefore the shape of the cell changes into a sickle-\nlike shape, hence the name of the disease.\n  Blood cells with that shape have difficulty passing through the blood \nvessels or carrying the nutrients or oxygen the body needs. Tissue that \ndoes not receive a normal blood flow eventually becomes damaged and can \ncause potentially life-threatening complications.\n  There are many side effects or complications because of the disease. \nStroke is probably the most feared effect of sickle-cell disease, \nespecially for children. It may affect infants as young as 18 months \nold. The important thing to remember is that sickle cell is a sneaky \ndisease. It can show up in ways one would not normally associate with \nthe disease.\n  I have spoken, for example, with parents whose kids had periodontal \ndisease that was very difficult to treat because it is treated with \nantibiotics and the blood does not carry the antibiotics as well to \naffected areas when the patient has sickle cell.\n  While some patients live without symptoms for years, many others do \nnot survive infancy or early childhood.\n  There are often severe episodes of pain for people suffering with the \ndisease.\n  I became personally involved with the effort because of a doctor from \nSt. Louis--a hero, I may add--Dr. Michael DeBaun, who treats children \nwith sickle-cell disease. When I met him and his patients, I was struck \nby the hardship the disease places on not only the patients but the \nfamilies of the patient members as well, and primarily on the children \nwho must receive blood transfusion after transfusion to stay alive.\n\n  About one-third of children with sickle-cell disease suffer a stroke \nbefore age 18. These children require frequent blood transfusions, \nsometimes 15 to 25 units a year, in order to prevent subsequent \nstrokes. I think especially of a young man I have come to know in the \ncourse of working on this legislation, Isaac Cornell Singleton.\n  Isaac is about 10 years old. He is from Missouri. He is one of Dr. \nDeBaun's patients and he attends fifth grade at Gateway Elementary \nSchool in St. Louis.\n  Every 4 weeks Isaac goes for blood transfusions at St. Louis \nChildrens Hospital with Dr. DeBaun. In fact, he has a permanent port \ninstalled in his chest to allow for the transfusions, which is one of \nthe reasons he has to limit playing contact sports like basketball and \non the playground with other children. If anyone knows Isaac, they know \nthe limitations on his activity and playing sports is, for him, \nprobably the worst aspect of the disease with which he is afflicted.\n  Last school year, Isaac missed school for several weeks at a time, \nincluding because of three hospitalizations, because he had severe \nepisodes of pain associated with the disease. Sickle cell affects his \ndecisions every day. He takes medication daily. He has to drink a lot \nof water to lubricate his cells. He is careful not to overexert \nhimself, and he gets plenty of rest.\n  After spending time with Dr. DeBaun in his clinic and after \nconsulting with him about how Medicaid deals with sickle cell, I knew \nwe could make the system better for kids such as Isaac. So last April \nSenator Schumer and I introduced the Sickle Cell Treatment Act. Our \nfriends and colleagues, Congressman Danny Kay Davis from Chicago and \nCongressman Richard Burr from North Carolina, introduced the companion \nbill in the House.\n  I cannot overemphasize the outpouring of support we have received for \nthis bill. I knew this disease had affected communities of people for \ndecades, but I had no idea how deep the impact was or how great the \nneed was people felt for help in trying to struggle with this disease. \nIn fact, one of the problems is there has been so little visibility \nwith regard to sickle cell, so little attention paid to it, that there \nis a lot of ignorance even within the African-American community about \nwhat the disease does and how to deal with it.\n  I think one of the greatest aspects of the bill so far has been to \nraise the level of attention to the disease. I think that already has \nhelped and the legislation itself will help in informing people. I will \ngo into that in a minute.\n  As an example of the kind of communications I received, Allyce Renee \nFord of Blue Springs, MO, wrote, and I am paraphrasing her a little:\n\n       I was so pleased to read of your bill to increase Federal \n     funding for treatment of sickle cell disease. My twin sons \n     were born with sickle cell in 1973. They suffered with this \n     debilitating disease for all of their lives. They both lost \n     the battle to painful complications of sickle cell related \n     problems in 2002.\n       Please believe me, Senator Talent, it is a very painful, \n     life constricting disease, both for the victim and for \n     their families.\n       Even though I do not have any other children to lose to \n     this disease, I mourn for all the other parents who will lose \n     their children in the future . . . today, tomorrow, some day, \n     they will lose them.\n       Thank God there will be some help for sickle cell disease \n     victims.\n\n  Why are so many people, so many groups, so many medical personnel \nsupporting this bill? Because it is critical to help the historically \nunderserved population, many of whom may not know they carry the trait \nor have the disease until it has already affected them.\n  The underlying legislation has the support of dozens of African-\nAmerican children's groups, health advocates, as well as union and \nchurch groups. I am not going to read the whole list but it includes \nthe Congressional Black Caucus and the Sickle Cell Disease Association \nof America--I thank the Sickle Cell Disease Association for their \ntremendous help in writing this bill and getting it passed--the \nAmerican Medical Association, the Catholic Health Association, the \nNational Association of Childrens Hospitals, the National Baptist USA, \nthe NAACP, and many other groups as well.\n  These advocates know this legislation will make a difference in the \nlives of sickle-cell-disease children and their families in four key \nways. First, the bill increases access to affordable quality health \ncare. The provision that is in this tax bill provides funding to \ncurrently eligible Medicaid recipients for physician and laboratory \nservices targeted to sickle-cell disease that either are currently not \nreimbursed or are underreimbursed by Medicaid. The bill enhances \nservices available to sickle-cell patients. A provision in the bill \nallows States to receive a Federal 50/50 funding match for nonmedical \nexpenses related to sickle-cell treatments such\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\nas genetic counseling, community outreach, education, and other \nservices. This is crucial because right now to get compensated for \ncounseling, education, or outreach regarding sickle cell, the services \nhave to be provided by the physician.\n  Unfortunately, there are not very many physicians in this field. They \nare extremely busy. They do not have the time to sit down and do this \nkind of counseling with the patients. Many of them heroically make the \ntime, but there are limits to the number of hours they have in the day. \nSo if this counseling can be provided by nonphysicians, other personnel \nwho are thoroughly familiar with the disease in various outreach \ncenters and places, we can reach out and let people know what this \ndisease is, whether they should get screened for it, what the symptoms \nare, how they can manage their diet and their lives so as to minimize \ncomplications, and many other things that are crucial.\n  This disease management provision allows hospitals and clinics to do \noutreach with nonmedical personnel to educate high-risk communities \nabout the disease. It also allows nonmedical personnel like counselors \nto spend time with sickle cell families and spend time discussing how \nto manage the disease. In particular, I have talked with parents who \nhave this problem. This will help experts in this field assist families \nin navigating through the health care maze so they can get the services \nthey need.\n  The bill also creates 40 sickle cell disease treatment centers around \nthe country. It authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services \nto distribute grants for up to 40 health centers nationwide at a cost \nof about $50 million for the next 5 fiscal years so we can have \noutreach centers in all parts of the country where there are \nsubstantial concentrations of people who are at high risk for the \ndisease. It could mean a health center grant in almost every State. The \ngrant money could be used for purposes including education, treatment, \ncontinuity of care for sickle cell disease patients, and for training \nhealth professionals.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a sickle cell disease research \nheadquarters. It creates a national coordinating center which will also \nbe operated by the Department of Health and Human Services to \ncoordinate and oversee sickle cell disease funding and research \nconducted at hospitals, universities, and community-based \norganizations.\n  This will focus on efficiency so we can share information about the \ndisease and about outcomes around the country, and accountability to \nmake sure taxpayer dollars are being spent properly in funding good \nresearch on sickle cell disease.\n  Taken together, the components of this bill will make a real and \ntangible difference in the lives of thousands of American families. I \nhope this bill is a first step. We have once again Senator Schumer and \nI and Congressman Davis and Congressman Burr and all those who have \nhelped us with this, and we ended up with more than a majority of the \nSenate sponsoring this bill, divided almost evenly between both sides \nof the aisle.\n  We look on this as a first step. This bill is going to begin laying \nthe infrastructure for outreach centers, for advocates, for counselors \naround the country to help families who are struggling with this \ndisease, and to lay the basis for the next step--whether it is \nadditional funding for research or helping people who are coping with \nthe disease so these families and these patients who are struggling \nwith sickle cell disease know they are not alone.\n  It is one of the more important things Congress has done this year. I \ncan tell you based on my personal experience that it will encourage the \nmany thousands of people around the country who have felt so alone as \nthey struggle with sickle cell disease.\n  Today, we have truly done something for the public good in including \nthis in the conference report. I am hopeful at some point we will have \na chance to vote on it, and I am confident we will pass it.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your personal assistance, and I thank \nthe Senate for indulging me in these comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The distinguished majority leader.\n\n\n                           The 108th Congress\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the next few minutes I would like to \ntake a pause--in the sense that we have a lot going on as we finish \nmuch of the work of the 108th Congress--and sort of look back as to \nwhat we have faced and what we, indeed, have accomplished over this \nperiod of the 108th Congress.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their tremendous hard work over the \npast 2 years. People have shown dedication to the people's business, \nand indeed we have made real progress with regard to the Nation's \nbusiness. It is an honor to serve in this body alongside such talented \nmen and women.\n  The events of 9/11 changed all of our lives. It transformed the \nworld, and a transformed world cried out for reform. And reform this \nCongress has delivered. One often hears the word ``historic'' to \ndescribe legislative achievements. In some cases, it is true. In the \ncase of the 108th Congress, it is no understatement to say we have made \ntruly historic progress for the American people. During the 108th \nCongress, the Senate passed sweeping reforms of not one but two major \nprograms that ultimately affect every American's life.\n  We passed the most far-reaching reforms of Medicare, our second \nlargest entitlement program, since its inception almost 40 years ago. \nThis week, we passed the most comprehensive reforms\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\nof the intelligence community in 50 years. We were able to do all of \nthis while also enacting in this Nation's history the third largest tax \nrelief package for hard-working women and men.\n  Now, because of the President's jobs and growth package, the economy \nhas generated nearly 1.9 million jobs since April 2003. Every month for \nthe past 13 months, we have seen job gains. The unemployment rate has \nhit historic lows--lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and \n1990s. Home ownership is at an alltime high. America's standard of \nliving is on the rise. Our economy is strong and growing.\n  I want to underscore that passing one major reform bill in a \ncongressional period is remarkable; passing two makes this Congress \ntruly unique. In both cases, efforts at reform had been stymied for \ndecades. In this Congress, we finally broke through. For the first time \nin its 40-year history, Medicare will offer voluntary, comprehensive \ncoverage for lifesaving prescription drugs. Until we acted, seniors \nwere denied coverage under Medicare for outpatient prescription drugs, \nthe most powerful tools in the arsenal of modern medicine to prevent \nillness and to fight disease. Because we acted, over 40 million seniors \nand individuals with disabilities will soon enjoy true health security. \nThis worthy program, because of our actions, will finally be able to \nkeep pace with modern medicine.\n  In the nearly four decades since Medicare was created, the American \nmedical system has transformed from one focus on treating episodic, \nacute illnesses in hospitals to one characterized by increasing \nemphasis on managing and preventing chronic disease. In contrast to \nlong hospital stays, patients are increasingly treated in outpatient \nsettings with advanced medical technologies and prescription drugs. Our \nmedical and scientific knowledge, along with it our ability to treat \nillness and disease, have improved dramatically over the past four \ndecades, and now, because of our reforms, Medicare will be able to keep \nup.\n  All seniors will have the opportunity to get prescription drug \ncoverage and improved benefits. Already real help is in place. Over 4 \nmillion seniors are getting substantial savings right now. Over 100,000 \npeople every week are signing up for the new prescription drug cards. \nThrough this new Medicare prescription drug discount program, seniors \nare saving, right now, an average of 10, 15, 20, 25, or even 30 percent \noff of the cost of their prescription drugs. Millions of low-income \nseniors, in addition to that 25-percent discount, get $1,200 over the \nnext 15 months in prescription drugs.\n\n  On Tuesday, my staff and I will spread across Tennessee to engage in \na six-city effort to enroll eligible seniors in the prescription drug \ndiscount card. Our focus, in particular, will be to enroll as many low-\nincome Tennessee seniors as possible in this new savings program. We \nwill be partnering with local public health officials, doctors, \nhospitals, and patient advocacy groups to help register patients, to \nhelp seniors who need the help the most get those prescription drug \ncards. I encourage seniors who might be listening as I speak to call \nthat number, 1-800-MEDICARE, right now to obtain your drug card and get \nimmediate discounts on your medicines.\n  I am deeply grateful for the cooperation and hard work and dedication \nof my colleagues to overcome years of partisan gridlock and finally \noffer America's seniors the security they need and the choices they \ndeserve through the Medicare Program. There is much more to do, but all \nof this is a strong start.\n  The Medicare law created health savings accounts. These health \nsavings accounts allow Americans to have more control over their health \ndecisions, over their health care choices, and over their hard-earned \ndollars. Tax deductible health savings accounts put patients and \nconsumers in charge of their own health care. They own it. They own \ntheir health care. They own their accounts. They control these \naccounts. They invest it. They can take it from job to job. It is \nportable, wherever they might go. In these health savings accounts, you \nhave choice, you have that freedom of choice. You choose your doctor, \nyou choose your hospital, and you choose your health care plan. And \nthis reform, again, had alluded us for years and years, but the 108th \nCongress delivered.\n  I am proud of President Bush's leadership on health savings accounts \nand Medicare. I am proud of our health care accomplishments in this \nbody, and I am proud that these accomplishments provide a strong \nplatform for the next steps to making health care more affordable, more \navailable, and more dependable for all Americans.\n  In addition to passing major reform of Medicare in the 108th, we \nundertook the urgent task of reforming our Nation's intelligence \ncommunity. We delivered. The reforms we passed through the executive \nbranch are the most comprehensive and the most far-reaching and \nsweeping since the National Security Act of 1947. Under the leadership \nof President Bush, we have worked to meet the greatest challenge of our \ntime: fighting the war on terror.\n  I commend the President for his bold and steady leadership and his \ncommitment to making America safe. After the 9/11 attacks, he \nrecognized immediately that we were at war. The President made tough \ndecisions. He made the right decisions. Every day, he is following \nthrough on those decisions to use the full range of our resources to \ncombat the enemy, to find them where they live and to defeat them. In \nthe 3 years since the 9/11 attack, we have learned much about our \nNation's vulnerabilities, about our strengths, and the steps we must \ntake to protect ourselves.\n  In July, the Democratic leader and I set the process in motion for \nthe Senate to respond legislatively to the 9/11 Commission Report on \nour intelligence community. The report identified a number of serious \nfailings that required immediate action. We asked the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, in close consultation with the other relevant \ncommittees, to carefully evaluate the Commission's proposals regarding \nreorganization of the executive branch and determine how best to \naccomplish those reforms.\n\n  Over the August recess, the committee held two dozen hearings, and \nthe Senate committees heard testimony from multiple witnesses. We had \nhearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Commerce Committee, and the Armed Services Committee. \nEach carefully examined the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission's \nreport. That work came to fruition this past Wednesday night in a \nhistoric, near unanimous vote to overhaul the intelligence community. \nThe Senate voted 96 to 2, with 2 Senators absent, to coordinate the \nefforts of our 15 military and civilian intelligence agencies.\n  Critically, this legislation seeks to establish a new national \nintelligence director to set and carry out intelligence priorities. It \nalso calls for the creation of the National counterterrorism Center and \nNational Counterproliferation Center to improve our ability to gather, \ncoordinate, and analyze the intelligence data.\n  We know the intelligence community generates massive amounts of \ninformation. In the aftermath of 9/11, this point became tragically \nclear. There had been clues, there had been arrests, analyses, and \nwarnings, but these pieces of information were scattered across the \nagencies; they were not properly shared. They became missed \nopportunities.\n  This legislation will reform the system from one that focused on a \nneed to know to one focused on a need to share.\n  Also in the bill are initiatives to strengthen our safeguards at \nhome, including national standards for issuance of drivers licenses, \nramped-up no-fly and other terrorist watchlists, and improved screening \nat ports and borders. We have seen over and over again that the enemy \nis willing to commit any barbarity to achieve its twisted aims. The \nenemy is capable of shooting toddlers, of lacing a schoolhouse with \nbombs, beheading innocent hostages and, as we all saw on 9/11, rejoices \nin the devastation of these attacks.\n  The steps we are now taking to strengthen our intelligence community \nand homeland security will help America defeat the enemy and make \nAmerica safer and more secure. Strengthening America at home and \nabroad, moving America forward in pursuit of freedom and prosperity, \nthese have been the driving motivations of the 108th Congress.\n  When the 108th Congress began, we faced some enormous challenges. \nFirst,\n\n[[Page S11057]]\n\nthe previous Democrat-led Congress had failed to pass a budget, so we \ngot to work immediately passing 12 of the 13 spending bills left undone \nby the previous Congress. We passed 11 of those bills in only 3 weeks. \nWe also passed a budget to establish a blueprint for creating jobs, \ninvesting in homeland security, investing in education, providing \nMedicare prescription drug coverage, and offering health insurance for \nAmerica's children.\n  With that unfinished business of the last Congress complete, we \nturned our attention to the President's jobs and growth agenda. Under \nthe President's leadership, we passed $350 billion in tax relief, the \nthird largest tax cut in history. We cut taxes across the board for 136 \nmillion hard-working Americans. For America's families we increased the \nchild tax credit from $600 per child to $1,000 per child and we made \nsure those rebate checks were sent out immediately. Last year we \nreturned $13.7 billion in taxes to families across the country, and we \ncut these taxes because we believe taxes are the people's money, not \nthe Government's money. We think Americans pay simply too much. Our \ngoal was to put more money back into the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans for them to save, to invest, and to spend.\n  Small business owners got a major boost from the tax package. Twenty-\nthree million small business owners who pay taxes at the individual \nrate saw their taxes fall. We quadrupled the expense deduction for \nsmall business investment to spur growth and development.\n  Small business owners are the engine of the American marketplace. \nThese innovators create 60 to 80 percent of new jobs nationwide and \nthey generate more than 50 percent of the gross domestic product. By \ncutting taxes and encouraging investment, we help to unleash their \ntremendous economic power.\n  Taken together, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are providing an \nastonishing $1.7 trillion in tax relief over the next decade. We acted \nand we are seeing the results.\n  In the midst of the fastest economic growth since Ronald Reagan was \nPresident, consumers have more money in their pockets and businesses \nare optimistic about the direction of the economy. In more good news, \nthe national home ownership rate has hit all-time highs. Minority home \nownership, too, is setting new records. This is great for families, and \nit is great for the economy.\n  When a family buys a home, it not only benefits the community, but it \nsets off a whole chain of purchases that help fuel the economy. Folks \nbuy living room furniture, bedding, kitchen appliances, curtains, \nwashers and dryers. Homeowners have a greater stake in their \ncommunities, in how they live and in how those around them live, and \nbuilding equity across lines opens doors to broader financial \nopportunities.\n\n  We believe in the American dream, and we believe the American dream \nshould be accessible to all Americans. That is why in this Congress we \npassed the American Dream Downpayment Act. This particular act provides \n$200 million a year in downpayment assistance for low-income, first-\ntime home buyers. It also increases the value of loans which the \nFederal Housing Administration may guarantee in disadvantaged areas.\n  We are committed to helping the American family achieve their \naspirations, and home ownership is an integral part of achieving the \nAmerican dream.\n  Meanwhile, this month we voted to extend key parts of the President's \ntax relief plan for middle-class families. We extended the marriage \npenalty tax relief. We extended the full $1,000 per child tax credit \nthrough the year 2010. We made sure low-income Americans will continue \nto benefit from the 10-percent tax bracket, and we also made strides in \nsimplifying the Tax Code. This is all just the beginning.\n  In the next Congress, we will be looking at fundamental tax reform, \nincluding major simplification of the Tax Code and making tax cuts \npermanent. This will save families time. It will save them money. It \nwill save them stress. We are determined to make the tax system more \nstraightforward so families can count on keeping more of their tax \ndollars for years to come.\n  We are committed to a strong, profamily agenda. It is reflected in \nour home ownership plan and our tax relief plan. It is also reflected \nin our legislation to protect the family and its most vulnerable \nmembers.\n  In the 108th Congress, we passed the partial-birth abortion ban, \nwhich the President signed into law. We also passed the Unborn Victims \nof Violence Act, the Laci and Conner Peterson law. We passed the \nPROTECT Act to strengthen laws against child pornography. This law also \nexpands the President's initiative to provide national coordination for \nthe AMBER Alert.\n  Yesterday, we passed landmark legislation under the leadership of \nChairman Hatch that expanded the rights of crime victims. It helps \nclear the backlog of more than 300,000 rape cases and other crime scene \nevidence awaiting analysis, and expands access to DNA testing for rape \nvictims and prison inmates.\n  We authorized the child nutrition and school lunch programs in the \nlast Congress so kids can get healthy meals at school, particularly \nchildren from economically disadvantaged families.\n  In an act of true vision and compassion, we passed a historic school \nvoucher plan for students right in the Nation's capital. The DC Choice \nProgram is the first school choice program to receive Federal dollars. \nThe DC school system is receiving 40 million new dollars to launch this \nprogram. DC schools were in crisis. Mayor Anthony Williams came to this \nSenate floor, the first time a mayor had been on the Senate floor in a \nquarter of a century, to ask specifically of this body for help. We \nresponded and we acted for the service and to the service of DC \nschoolchildren. There was a bitter debate and some tried to block this \nprogress. Some argued vociferously to maintain the status quo and to \nnot change, but in the end the District of Columbia schoolchildren won \nout. Principle trumped politics, and today DC's kids are climbing the \nfirst rungs of the academic ladder.\n  In this Congress, we extended unemployment benefits and welfare \nreform to help families through tough times and challenging \ntransitions. We believe the proper role of Government is to protect the \nsafety and well-being of families, give them the tools they need to \nmeet their responsibilities and to move their families forward. We \nbelieve hard work should be rewarded and we worked hard in this 108th \nCongress to help America's families succeed.\n  The 108th Congress saw big reforms and bold action on the domestic \nfront. We also saw major action on foreign policy, starting with \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. In the spring of 2003, America, under the \nleadership of President Bush, took the extraordinary action of toppling \nSaddam Hussein and his terrorist-sponsoring regime. In 3 short weeks, \nthe men and women of the U.S. military, with the support of 49 nations, \nswept into Baghdad, ending three decades of ruthless Baath Party rule.\n\n  In the months since, our soldiers have worked tirelessly under \ndangerous conditions to help the Iraqi people build a democracy. Our \nsoldiers have rebuilt schools, hospitals, electrical grids, pipelines, \nand roads. They are training Iraqi police forces to patrol the streets \nand hunt down terrorists. Every day our troops are helping the people \nof Iraq and Afghanistan move toward becoming free and open societies. \nAfghanistan had its first Presidential election in history just \nyesterday, without incidents. And that is democracy.\n  To support our military efforts, we passed the President's $87 \nbillion for reconstruction and equipment for our troops. America's \nsecurity depends on fully supporting our Nation's defense. The \nappropriations bill for 2005 grants the Defense Department over $416 \nbillion in new spending authority to keep America safe. Military \npersonnel will also receive a 3.5-percent pay raise.\n  We are taking the battle to the enemy, but we must remain vigilant at \nhome. That is why we passed the Homeland Security appropriations bill \nand added $1.6 billion in funding for increased security, enforcement, \nand investigations.\n  This spring the Senate also passed, and the President signed into \nlaw, Project Bioshield. This far-reaching legislation will improve our \nability to develop cutting-edge countermeasures\n\n[[Page S11058]]\n\nagainst biological and chemical and radiological threats, those 21st \ncentury weapons of mass destruction.\n  We also passed the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act. This new law \nwill allow current and retired police officers to carry a concealed \nweapon in any of the 50 States. America will now have throughout the \nadded security of tens of thousands of trained and certified law \nenforcement officers serving and protecting us all across the country \nand even into their retirement.\n  These precautions are absolutely crucial to the security of our \ncountry, but, as the President has said, ultimately our greatest \ndefense against terror is the spread of democracy.\n  In the 108th Congress, we have worked to promote freedom around the \nworld. In this session, we passed the Burmese Freedom Act and the Clean \nDiamond Act to promote peace and freedom around the world.\n  We also took that historic action of dedicating $15 billion to drive \nback that HIV/AIDS virus, arguably one of the most moral, humanitarian, \nand public health challenges of our time. As a Senator and as a doctor \nand as one who participates frequently on medical mission trips, I am \nespecially gratified by the Senate's demonstration of compassion on \nthis issue to fight the HIV/AIDS virus, both here at home and around \nthe world. Our work in passing this critical legislation demonstrates \nwe are a country that, indeed, places a high value on life. History \nwill judge how we chose to respond. We can proudly say that, under \nPresident Bush's leadership, we made the right choice and took the \nnecessary actions to put an end to one of the worst plagues in recorded \nhistory. But our work against this virus has just begun.\n  Free trade is another way we project our values and promote freedom \nand democracy around the world. We passed, and the President signed, \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act. Not only has this legislation \ncreated new investment opportunities for American businesses, but it \nhas helped create 150,000 new African jobs. It has helped pump more \nthan $340 million into African economies. It has helped forge a place \nfor Africa in the global trade market. A stable and growing Africa is \nin everyone's interest.\n  In addition, this Congress passed the Morocco and Australia Free \nTrade Agreement, which will open markets for U.S. goods and create jobs \nfor American workers.\n\n  We made great strides in the 108th Congress, but there have also been \ndisappointments, the biggest of them being the unprecedented \nobstruction of the President's judicial nominees. A partisan minority \nis attempting to change 225 years of congressional history and \nundermine the constitutional process. They are subverting the clear \nmeaning of the Constitution and preventing the Senate from carrying out \nits basic duty, to give advice and consent under the Constitution. \nAdvice and consent for the Senate simply means an up-or-down vote on \nthe President's judicial nominees, and that has been denied.\n  Prior to this Congress, with the exception of Abe Fortas, who did not \nhave majority support and withdrew his own nomination, no judicial \nnominee brought to the floor failed to get an up-or-down vote as a \nresult of a filibuster. Two centuries of precedent upheld the \nseparation of powers and protected the constitutional process. During \nthe 108th Congress, however, we have seen precedent replaced with \npartisanship and respect for the separation of powers tossed aside. In \nthis Congress, the other side has filibustered not 1 but 10 of the \nPresident's judicial nominees. Janice Rogers Brown, Richard Griffin--\nfilibustered; Carolyn Kuhl--filibustered; David McKeague--filibustered; \nWilliam Meyers--filibustered; Priscilla Owen--filibustered; Charles \nPickering--filibustered; William Pryor--filibustered; Henry Saad--\nfilibustered; Miguel Estrada--who, by the way, finally withdrew his \nnomination after more than 2 years of partisan wrangling and seven \ncloture votes--filibustered.\n  All 10 of these honorable, hard-working people enjoyed the support of \na bipartisan majority in the Senate and would have been confirmed if \nallowed a simple up-or-down vote. But they were denied this basic \nright. That cannot be tolerated.\n  In total, the President has nominated 34 circuit court nominees, \nnearly a third, 1 out of 3, have been denied on this floor a simple up-\nor-down vote. They didn't all have to be approved. They didn't have to \nget an ``up'' vote or a yes vote, but they have been denied the \nopportunity of even having that vote. That is wrong.\n  In addition to blocking these nominations, the other side has engaged \nin an unprecedented campaign to obstruct dozens and dozens of \nnominations to our Federal agencies. We are talking about \nnoncontroversial agencies such as the Coast Guard or Amtrak or the \nHarry S Truman Scholarship Foundation. These nominations are being \nobstructed.\n  What should be a smooth, bipartisan process has become politicized \nand caught in these jaws of obstruction. It is unprecedented and unfair \nto the men and women who are caught in limbo. These individuals, all of \nwhom are willing to put themselves up for public service, are being \ndenied that opportunity to serve. These individuals deserve fair and \ntimely consideration. In the next Congress, we will keep pressing to \nend the obstruction. All we ask for is simple fairness.\n  Today, as we have seen over the course of the day here on a Sunday \nalmost evening--it is 6 o'clock, historical in the sense that we very \nrarely meet on Sunday and very rarely vote on Sunday, but here we are, \ntoday, once again being filibustered, being obstructed. Today it is on \nlegislation important to 290 million Americans. Everyone listening to \nme has a vested interest in the legislation that is being filibustered, \nobstructed on the floor of the Senate. We wouldn't have been here all \nday yesterday, or be here today or tomorrow, if this legislation \nweren't critical to Americans. Yet we have the other side saying, No; \ndelay; filibuster. Obstruction--more of the same.\n  What is interesting to me is the issues that are being filibustered \ntoday, on this Sunday and Saturday and over the last several days, are \nissues such as homeland security. We are talking about money being \ninvested in our communities to secure our safety being filibustered and \nblocked on the floor of the Senate. We are talking about disaster \nassistance, whether it is for droughts, which are occurring throughout \nthe West and areas of the South--that money, it is here. It is ready to \nflow now, but it is being obstructed on the floor of the Senate by the \nother side.\n  We saw the devastating hurricanes. Many of us have been to Florida \nand seen the wrath which these hurricanes have created. And right now \nthat money is being stopped on the Senate floor because of filibuster \nand obstruction by the Democrats.\n  On the military construction bill, which is critically important to \nthe country, we are ready to move. We were ready to move yesterday--or \ntoday and as soon as possible. Yet it is being blocked for no reason we \ncan see. That has nothing to do with drought, or homeland security, or \nhurricane relief, but military construction. We see the delay and we \nsee the obstruction.\n  We have seen obstruction in this country in the area of lawsuits and \non lawsuit abuse reform, something we have attempted again and again. \nTime and time again, the other side has blocked consideration of things \nsuch as medical liability reform and class action reform, despite the \nfact it has been made clear--at least it has on this floor--that out-\nof-control litigation is costing this country dearly, not only in \nhealth care but in class action. We see it in asbestos; we see it where \nbroad reform of our tort system is being cried out for. Countless jobs \nare being destroyed, companies are going bankrupt, and doctors in my \nown profession are fleeing the profession because of the out-of-control \nlitigation and the frivolous lawsuits.\n  In the field of class action lawsuits, we have seen the number of the \nclass action lawsuits explode. State court class action filings have \nskyrocketed. They have increased by 1,300 percent in 10 years. The \nresult of this glut of claims is to clog the State courts, to inject \ninefficiencies and waste into the system, to clearly waste taxpayer \ndollars, and ultimately inhibit the innovation and the entrepreneurship \nwhich is so crucial to job growth. Money is wasted. The cost of all \nconsumer goods with these class action lawsuits goes\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\nup. It touches everybody. Every consumer ends up paying the price. When \nit comes to medical liability and frivolous lawsuits, it pushes \neveryone's premiums higher and higher needlessly because of the waste.\n  I receive letters from doctors all over America, in part because I am \na doctor, I guess. But as I go around and do town meetings and travel \naround the country, this problem has surfaced to be one of the major \nproblems facing our health care system today and indirectly our economy \nas the cost of these premiums which people are having to pay goes up \nand up.\n  I think people understand the medical liability crisis. It is real, \nit is spreading, and it is increasing. Thus, we have the responsibility \non this floor to act. Yet, three times over the past Congress we have \nattempted to bring medical liability reform to the Senate, but we were \nobstructed in each and every case.\n  The medical liability challenge and the lawsuit abuse as it applies \nto the medical field is having a direct impact not only on costs but \nnow on the availability of health care. It drives doctors out of the \npractice of medicine. It is sending a signal to the next generation of \npotential physicians that I am not going to be going into that field \ngiven the obstruction it is causing to the profession. It is not only a \nmatter of cost, but now people are realizing it hurts quality of care \nand access to care. It is threatening the fundamentals of our health \ncare system at the same time it is costing this country billions \nof dollars.\n\n  As you travel around the country, women are telling us again and \nagain they are losing their obstetrician who, because of the \nskyrocketing cost of premiums, is having to stop delivering babies. \nThey may continue in medicine, but maybe not continue in medicine. \nPregnant women have to switch to another obstetrician. Women living in \nthe country are having a hard time finding obstetricians because they \nhave stopped delivering babies.\n  Trauma centers are threatening to close down. And still, three times \ntrying to bring reform to this body or trying to bring a bill that \nengages medical liability reform, we have been thwarted.\n  If you look at the cost, the numbers are always hard to calculate \nspecifically. But if you put the well-researched reports together, they \npredict that if we reform the medical liability system with commonsense \nreform, we will save the economy $70 billion to $126 billion per year. \nIf you look at the Federal Government alone, savings would be \napproximately $14.9 billion over 10 years, if you only look at savings \nin Medicare and Medicaid.\n  What that means is if we had appropriate reform, that $70 billion to \n$126 billion--which everyone is paying because that is what forces in \npart the cost of health care to go up--would be saved, and with that \npremiums could come down and the rate of growth costs would diminish \nover time. This is wasted money. It does absolutely nothing in that \ndoctor-patient interaction to improve health care of the patient. It is \ntotally wasted money. But at the same time, it makes the cost of all of \nour premiums--everybody listening to me--it makes their premiums go up, \nup, up, waste, abuse of the system. I would say it is almost fraud \nwithin the system that can be eliminated to lower your health care \ncosts.\n  When it comes to out-of-control litigation, another field that is \nimportant for us to address, asbestos litigation, the torrent of \nlitigation in this field is wreaking havoc on victims and jobs, and all \nof that gets reflected into devastation in sectors of our economy. The \napproximately 600,000 claims that have been filed have already cost $54 \nbillion in settlements and judgments and litigation costs. The current \nasbestos tort system has become almost nothing more than a litigation \nlottery.\n  I say that because some of the people with mesothelioma of the lungs, \nor lung cancer, are receiving adequate compensation but with a huge \ndelay. But money is not going only to those who deserve it, it is once \nagain being wasted on far more people than the few who are getting the \nmoney who deserve it. There are many more who are suffering long delays \nof unpredictable compensation, of inequitable awards, if they are lucky \nenough to receive anything at all.\n  The only real winner in this whole asbestos system, I think, are the \nplaintiffs' trial lawyers. They take anywhere from 30 percent, 40 \npercent, sometimes 50 percent of every dollar that should be going to \nthe victims, the patient, the person who might get cancer, the person \nwho has cancer because of this asbestos fiber. That is where the money \nshould be going. And yet, 30, 40, 50 of these billions of dollars are \ngoing into the pockets of the trial lawyers. While they collect their \nfees, at the same time asbestos-related bankruptcies have already led \nto more than 60,000 Americans losing their jobs. As you can see, this \nasbestos litigation lottery must be fixed.\n  Also costing Americans jobs and money are rising energy prices. This \nweek we saw in the news that oil prices have hit $52 a barrel. Winter \nheating costs are expected to rise as a result, and it is critical that \nwe have in response to this need an energy plan so vital to America's \nfamilies who are facing higher bills because of delay. It is vital to \nour national security which is threatened by this overdependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Again, the Energy bill was filibustered and blocked on the Senate \nfloor.\n  By passing the Energy bill, not only will we lower energy costs but \nwe will save jobs and create thousands more. It is estimated that the \nEnergy bill will create at least a half million jobs.\n  Reforming the litigation system and passing the comprehensive energy \nplan will lower consumer costs. It will stimulate the economy. It will \ncreate jobs. It will improve our health care system and it will grow \nthe economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to set aside obstruction tactics and help \nAmerica move forward.\n  When we return in the 109th we will clearly have a full agenda, from \nstrengthening the safety net to helping Americans secure their future. \nWe will have a number of major themes emerge in the 109th Congress. We \nwill continue to bring programs up to date through today's challenges \nand to face those challenges. We will continue to press for reforms and \ngrow the economy, reforms that will create jobs, and we will continue \nto support the creativity, ingenuity, and productivity of the American \npeople who are, after all, what make this country great.\n  I am sure we will have an opportunity to talk more in the coming \ndays, or hopefully coming hours if we are not here too long, to look \nback over the last 2 years of this Congress. It has been a pleasure to \nbe able to help move America forward by advancing the agenda that we \nset out initially with many accomplishments of which we can all be \nproud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had not intended to come to the Senate \nto respond to the distinguished majority leader, but I feel compelled \nto do so.\n  He had mentioned the disagreements that are currently pending with \nregard to completion of our work on Homeland Security and the Military \nConstruction bill, the so-called FSC bill, and I think my response to \nhis lament, publicly, is to say that really is the metaphor for the \nwhole Congress. Our situation today involving these particular bills is \nno different than the situation we faced on so many other pieces of \nincomplete action. In those instances when we have been able to work \ntogether, legislation has passed. That is the essence of good \nlegislative achievement, coming together, finding common ground, \nresolving the differences, and enacting the law.\n  But on so many pieces of legislation, in spite of the fact we would \nmove in a bipartisan way, with overwhelming votes in the Senate, we get \nto conference, and for various reasons--in large measure because of the \nRepublican leadership in the House--those bills that passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan consensus in the Senate were made impossible to \npass once they got through conference.\n  That is true of the highway bill. It is true of the energy bill. It \nhas been true of countless legislative experiences over the last 2 \nyears.\n  That is in essence why we find ourselves here today. I am confident, \nin fact, we are very close, perhaps, to reaching an agreement that will \nbreak the impasse on the pending bills.\n  I understand completely the anger, the frustration expressed by both \nmy\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\ncolleagues, Senator Landrieu and Senator Harkin, when the conferees \ntook the actions they have to make it as unfair to segments of our \nsociety that they believe very strongly ought to be defended.\n\n  In Senator Harkin's case, it is the double standard we are forcing \nfarmers and ranchers to endure as a result of a decision made by the \nconferees to make farmers take the very assistance they are going to \nget for disaster out of their other pocket.\n  Many have talked about this already, and I don't think it needs \nelaboration, but that double standard, that unfairness, simply cannot \ngo without an objection. In the case of the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, her concern, rightly so, has been fair tax treatment for \nmembers of the National Guard.\n  If we can find ways with which to address the marriage penalties--and \nwe should and did--find ways to address the childcare tax credit--we \nshould and we did--her view is that those brave fighting men and women \nin Iraq today ought to have the same consideration, the same \nappreciation for a recognition of their sacrifice. It is not enough to \nsimply say ``thank you.'' We ought to find a way to say ``thank you'' \nwith more meaning. That is all she is suggesting.\n  On those two issues, even though I am increasingly optimistic we may \nbe able to break this impasse, it could have been avoided if simple \nfairness would have been reflected as we face our responsibilities in \nthe conference committee.\n  As to other issues involving our Senate experience over these last 2 \nyears, the distinguished majority leader again went back to the \nfrequent criticism, unfair criticism, of the way judges have been \nhandled in this Congress. I have to say, for the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand how anyone could not be satisfied with a 95-percent success \nrate.\n  Mr. President, 201 judges have been confirmed. That is more than in \nthe Bush 1 administration in the early 1990s; more than in the Reagan \nadministration in their first term in the 1980s; it is more, by far, \nthan the Clinton administration in the second term when the Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate. Ninety-five percent.\n  In baseball, in almost any other walk of life, 95 percent is an A. \nYet we hear the constant criticisms and totally erroneous assertions \nthat this has never been done before. It has been done on many \noccasions before. Most troubling is it was done during the Clinton \nadministration prior to the time their nominees even came to the floor. \nWe had over 65 judges who never even got a vote in the committee. Every \nsingle one of these judges got a vote. In some cases, it was a cloture \nvote. In some cases it was up or down, but it was a vote in the Senate. \nThat is a lot more judges than the previous experience in the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The majority leader mentioned the liability reform matter, and we can \ndebate that over and over. I have said from the beginning and continue \nto believe that federalization of our tort system does not make sense, \nbut there are ways with which to address improvements and changes in \nthe way the system works. We all oppose frivolous lawsuits, and we \nought to get rid of them and find ways in which to address that. \nInstead of working with us, instead of finding common ground, their \ninsistence was, ``our way or the highway.'' They lay a bill down, fill \nup the tree, and say: You either vote for it or against it, but you \nwill have no choice.\n\n  Regarding the majority leader's assertion that this is somehow going \nto control costs in health care, virtually every single objective \nanalysis has said the limits they are proposing would mean less than \none-half of 1 percent reduction in health costs overall. We all \nrecognize there are serious issues involving malpractice insurance \npremiums we have to address. We want to do that. We have ways with \nwhich to do that, including reinsurance, including tax credits and tax \nrelief for those who are paying those premiums, including dealing with \nmedical reviews and finding ways to bring down the costs. But, again, \nour colleagues on the other side simply refused to work with us to make \nthat happen.\n  There are also many illustrations of their lack of ability to \naccomplish a legislative agenda in large measure because of huge \ndisagreements on their side. Their lack of ability to address the \nbudget was a disagreement on their side having to do with taxes and \nappropriations. Their inability to pass appropriations was because of \ndisagreement on their side because of that budget problem. Their \ninability to deal with energy and transportation and reimportation, in \nlarge measure, was as a result of disagreements on their side.\n\n  The Energy bill is another classic example, as I said a moment ago, \nof putting the Senate in a position where failure was the only option \nbecause of their insistence--their insistence--on special interest \nprovisions that the Republicans opposed.\n  So there is a lot to be said about the ongoing debate about \nachievements and about obstruction, about the lack of ability to find \ncommon ground. But, again, I go back to examples where it has happened.\n  As the majority leader noted, he and I reached an agreement in July \non how to deal with the reaction and legislative response to the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. We delegated the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee with the responsibility, and it worked. We established a task \nforce to ensure we have a legislative reorganizational response, and it \nworked, thanks in part to the effort of our distinguished assistant \nRepublican and Democratic leaders.\n  So we can work together. We have demonstrated that. My only \ndisappointment is that on so many occasions, when we could have found \ncommon ground, the majority chose to take the political course. It is \nfor that reason, and only for that reason, we have not been a more \naccomplished Congress in the 108th.\n  There is still time to address a number of issues: asbestos, energy, \nmental health parity--again, a commitment made by the Republican \nleader, by others, that we would take up this legislation and pass it. \nThat has not happened, in large part, almost exclusively, because of \ndisagreements, again, on the Republican side.\n  So there is still hope we can reach some common ground. I hope that \nwill be the case.\n  I yield additional time to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The Chair will inquire, how much \ntime is the Senator yielding?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the distinguished Senator from Louisiana an \nadditional 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielded an additional 15 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the leader, Senator Daschle, for \nhis comments and for the respectful way in which he has addressed the \nsituation we find ourselves in now, because the Members of this body \nhave been working very hard the last couple of days on very important \nmatters. As you know, each and every one of these matters is extremely \nimportant to our constituents from our own States, but some of these \nmatters transcend our own States and our districts. Some of these \nmatters transcend individual industries.\n  Actually, the matter that is before the Senate, and the main reason \nfor the filibuster--or one of the reasons; there are two or three--but \nthe one I have been coming to the floor and speaking about, with \nseveral of my colleagues, is the fact we are in the process of passing \na bill--if I can pick it up; it is quite heavy--a bill with about 600 \npages in it of tax cuts, $137 billion that includes almost every \nindustry you can imagine, large and small, in every part of the \ncountry, but the one group of people that is not in here, even if you \nread from the first page to the last, and even the small print, the one \ngroup of people who you will not find in this bill is the 643,000 men \nand women of the Guard and Reserve and the families they represent. \nThere is not one sentence of tax relief for them.\n  So I took the floor on Wednesday and said there must have been some \nmistake, because when it left the Senate 100 Members of this body--all \nthe Republicans and all the Democrats--had supported a provision. It \nwent over to the House, but something happened on the way back from the \nHouse. It was omitted. I did not read every page, and I trusted the \nsummary. But when I scanned the 500 items in here and did not find it, \nI came to the floor.\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\n  I went to the Republican leaders, I went to the Democratic leaders, \nand I said: Please know that I cannot accept passing a $137 billion tax \nbill that fattens the paychecks of many people in America, some of whom \nare, I am sure, deserving, but keeps the paychecks of the Guard and \nReserve--the men and women who are taking 100 percent of the risk \ntoday, the families who are making almost all the sacrifice, and the \nmen and women who are actually losing pay--I cannot for the life of me \nunderstand, and no one in my State can understand, how they were left \nout.\n  So I have made it clear that I am prepared to stay here until the \nvery end, whether that end is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. \nI know I cannot keep this whole Senate here forever, but I can keep the \nSenate here for the better part of this week. It is not my intention. I \nam respectful of all the Senators' schedules. I am respectful of their \nother commitments. I am very respectful that a third of them are in \nreelections. I am not up for reelection, and I understand the tenseness \nof this election time. And we actually have a national election.\n  But my leader knows I do not come here with any small request. I do \nnot come here with a Landrieu request. This is not even a Louisiana \nrequest. This is a national plea on behalf of the 645,000 men and women \nwho have been called up to serve, to support us in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand all places in between. How do we have the nerve to pass a tax bill \nand leave them out? So that is what the filibuster is about.\n  Let me be clear, I enjoy working with many Members on the Republican \nside. I see my good friend from Alabama here, Senator Sessions. He and \nI have worked together on coastal erosion issues. We have worked \ntogether on Armed Services before. I think he is going to have some \ncomments about the work he has done which has been tremendous on the \npart of the Guard and the Reserve.\n\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you and I just passed one of the few \nappropriations bills. People said it would never happen; it cannot \nhappen; the DC appropriations bill will not pass; it will be \ncontentious. If I may say, pat myself on the head, and you, too, we did \na pretty good job of getting our bill through under a lot of odds that \nwere against us. That bill is already gone, on the President's desk to \nsign. It strengthens schools, strengthens child welfare agencies in the \nDistrict, for which the Presiding Officer deserves a lot of credit.\n  So please, I am not here to obstruct. I am not here to slow things \ndown for no good reason. There are other provisions I did not get in \nthis bill that I asked for. Fine, they are not in there. But I cannot, \nin good conscience, not speak and not stand on this floor for as long \nas it takes to get something done for them. I am representing many \npeople, not myself, in this Chamber.\n  Let me say the good news in the 5 minutes I have left. We made some \nprogress today. Several Members who had questions about the amendment \nin question have been working with their staffs. We may be coming up \nwith a way that we could together get this amendment intact as much as \nI have already described it and get it connected to another bill that \nwe can send back to the House.\n  I wish I could control what the House of Representatives does. I \nwould like to go over there and give them a piece of my mind on their \nfloor. But I am not allowed to do that. I am not. All I can do is stand \nhere in the Senate, urge the Senators to stay strong and firm--we all \nvoted for this amendment--and get it on a bill and send it back to \nthem.\n  And when the leadership over there decides--because they can control \ntheir floor action. Our leadership cannot really control us that much. \nThey can put a lot of pressure on us, but we are Senators and we can \nspeak; and I intend to. The Members over there cannot speak freely \nbecause of the Constitution and the rules of the Congress, but the \nleadership will get this bill and they can decide, in October, \nNovember, December, or January, in this Congress or the next Congress, \nwhat they want to do about it. But what we can do is get this amendment \nnegotiated.\n  I thank the Senators today who have been working on this. I feel not \nconfident, but I feel encouraged. I feel encouraged that some parts of \nthe amendment I have talked about that will help our Guard and Reserve \nto be a part of tax relief that we pass out of the Senate could be \nincluded. So I thank my leader.\n  Mr. President, I inquire, how much time of the 15 minutes do I have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 20 seconds left of \nher total time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. So I have about 6 minutes, because I had 7 under my \nprevious order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. That is the total time \nthe Senator has left.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have 8 minutes left. I would like to take those 8 \nminutes, and then I will reserve the last 7 minutes I have because that \nis all I have. Would the Chair inform me, please, at 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will take the 8 minutes I have left to read a couple \nof e-mails I have received from people all over the country to give \ncourage and support to the colleagues that are negotiating this. I \nthink they can see this is important to a lot of people.\n  This is from ``Nobody.'' That is how they signed it. The name is \nJanice.\n\n       I have three Nephews and two Nieces that are in our \n     National Guard, and they are being sent over to Iraq. I am so \n     angry at the Congress and the Senate today but I pray they \n     never have to see their Sons or Daughters go to this war. Let \n     alone their Grandchildren. My Nephews and Nieces have left \n     behind 11 children without any health coverage, let alone \n     monies needed to survive. Yes, survive! Today my Husband and \n     I . . . are taking care of three children of our loving \n     Niece. It is hard on us as we are retired and living on a \n     fixed income.\n       Might I add that I do not have health coverage any longer \n     as the monthly payments became too much for us.\n       Please continue your fight for our Soldiers! We love you \n     Senator for your Grace . . .\n\n  Another e-mail:\n\n       Thank you for standing there bravely for all of our \n     Americans who are becoming more powerless with each passing \n     day.\n       I am a disabled person barely able to stand on my own two \n     legs, so I really appreciate that you are standing there for \n     me and all of our National Guard troops.\n       I am watching you on CSpanII today. I know you are fighting \n     for us and I am moved to thank you [for trying].\n       I will be watching. I will be waiting, and I appreciate it. \n     Your desire to assist those individuals points to a bigger \n     problem--military pay. Service members deserve better, all \n     servicemen deserve better. Your efforts to help will create a \n     situation in which reservists and National Guardsmen receive \n     higher compensation than that of the full-time personnel.\n       The resolution to this problem is not providing a way to \n     help reservists and National Guard make up income. It is \n     helping them make up income and increasing the compensation \n     for all service personnel.\n\n  He goes on to say that he supports our efforts.\n  Again, I will just share that in the last 14 years since 1990, we \nhave called up 690,000 troops. In the previous 30 years, from the \nBerlin crisis to the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam war, we only \ncalled up 100,000. Our policies have put more pressure on the Guard and \nReserve to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Active members. I agree, \nwe need to improve the pay and compensation across the board, but I \ncan't provide tax relief for the Active Reserve in the same way I can \ndo it for the Guard and Reserve in this bill.\n\n  There are other benefits that are being provided. If we can explore \nthe possibilities in the amendment I am supporting, I will be happy to \ndo that. But it is for all of our troops that we stand here and try to \nwork on an amendment that will give a tax credit to the companies that \nare being patriotic, doing the right thing, trying to keep the pay \ntheir reservists were making when they were homeside and now are losing \nsometimes 40 percent of that pay when they go to the front line. Many \nof our employers are picking up the difference.\n  The tax credit we have argued for will help those small companies--\nsome of them struggling--to continue to pay their guardsmen and \nreservists. It is clear. It is convenient for the accounting systems of \nour companies, and we most certainly can afford it.\n  Again, $137 billion of tax relief getting ready to be voted on. I \nsaid I can't vote for this bill, but a majority of the Members will. I \nam not faulting them for that vote, but I am going to stay as long as \nit takes to get this amendment into this bill or at least get it \nattached to another bill so that we can say, as\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\nSenators, that we did our job and we did the best.\n  I am happy to say the negotiations are going on, and they look \npromising. I thank my colleagues for being so open and for working \nthrough this today. I know it is unusual that we are in on a Sunday, \nbut I thank them for their patience, and I retain the balance of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I \nrespect her commitment to this issue. It is something I have been \ngiving a lot of thought to. I was a reservist for over 10 years in \nAlabama. I worked closely with the National Guard in the last month. I \nspent 2\\1/2\\ hours with the entire leadership team of the Alabama \nNational Guard to discuss with them how best we could make the lives of \nour Guard and Reserve more meaningful, make it better, to help them and \ntheir families. I came away with a list of 11 things that I believe \nwere good. I tried to get them in the Defense authorization bill--some \nof which we did, some of which we got positive, at least, reference in \nthe bill. That is the right way to go about it.\n  The tax benefit for employers is a matter worthy of very serious \ndiscussion. It could indeed be a good way to help our Guard and \nReserve. I don't dispute that. I don't dispute at all the sincerity of \nSenator Landrieu and her commitment to this issue.\n  I will just say this: What we need and what I have personally told \nthe Secretary of Defense and Dr. Chu, the personnel director there, \nChairman Warner and Senator Levin, chairman of Armed Services and our \nranking member, what we really need is to look at our Guard and Reserve \ncarefully, to analyze what problems they are facing and help them.\n  As I told the leadership in the Defense Department, and I talked to \nthe generals in charge of the Army National Guard, the Air Force \nNational Guard, I have asked them also to think about how we can best \nhelp their members because we want to be generous to those citizen-\nsoldiers who are in harm's way and have been in harm's way to help us \ncarry out what I believe to be the national interest of the United \nStates of America. Sometimes, unfortunately, that requires people to \nput their lives at risk.\n\n  I will note that the unit I used to be a member of, the 1184th \nTransportation Terminal, not long after I got out of it--about 10 years \nin that unit--a couple of years later they were activated and spent 9 \nmonths in Kuwait during the first gulf war. They came home, and under \ntheir new commander, COL Janet Cobb--she was at least at that time the \ncommander--they were recalled to Kuwait to operate the port there in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I know those people. I was there \nwhen they went away. I have been at National Guard units when they went \naway.\n  I have friends in the Guard and Reserve in Alabama. When I was in \nIraq in July, we came through Kuwait, and there was the 375th \ntransportation unit--``motor transport'' I believe is the appropriate \nname. The 375th was a superior unit to mine. They evaluated us and were \nheadquartered also in Alabama in the same Reserve center which I \nattended.\n  I saw in Kuwait John Cherry, an assistant U.S. attorney in the office \nI used to be a U.S. attorney in; Charles Coat, who used to work for me \nas an assistant U.S. attorney and now is assistant inspector general \nfor TBA. I saw Randy Spier, who is an attorney in Mobile, AL, who I \nknow and respect. I know how stressful it is for them and their \nfamilies. I know and appreciate them very deeply. I had a lot of \ndifferent ideas I wanted to get passed. I wished we could have gotten \nthem in this bill. And some tax credit also was not a bad idea to help \nthem in whatever appropriate way we do it. We have a limited amount of \nmoney and we have to make sure it goes out not in an aberrational or \nunprincipled way, but in a way that is best designed for fairness and \nto help the most members of the Guard and Reserve we can.\n\n  I believe that strongly. I think we are bouncing about here with \npeople coming in with this idea and that idea, and I have my ideas. We \nneed to get together seriously and think about what we can do to make \nlives better for our Guard and Reserve. They are critical to the \ndefense of America. So I am putting a great deal of hope in section 513 \nof the Defense Authorization bill we passed yesterday, or today, called \nthe Commission on National Guard and Reserves. It will be a 13-member \ncommission, a bipartisan commission. It will do a number of things. \nTheir duties are listed as follows:\n  To carry out a study of the following matters:\n  A, the roles and missions of the National Guard and other Reserve \ncomponents of the armed services.\n  B, the compensation and other benefits, including tax benefits--I \ninserted a tax benefit, but it goes on to say: Including health care \nbenefits that are provided for members of the Reserve components under \nthe laws of the United States.\n  Subparagraph 2: In carrying out the study, the commission shall do \nthe following:\n  A, assess the current roles and missions of the Reserve components \nand identify appropriate potential future roles and missions for the \nReserve components; assess the capabilities of the Reserve components \nand determine how the units may be best used to support military \noperations.\n  C, assess the Department of Defense plan for implementation of \nsection 115(b) of title X, United States Code.\n  D, assess the current organizational structure of the Guard and \nReserve.\n  E, assess the manner in which the National Guard and other Reserve \ncomponents are currently organized and funded for training, and \nidentify an organizational and funding structure for training that best \nsupports the achievement of training objectives and operational \nreadiness.\n  Skipping F.\n  G, assess the adequacy and appropriateness of the compensation and \nbenefits currently provided for the members of the National Guard and \nother Reserve components, including the availability of health care \nbenefits and health insurance, and the effects of proposed changes in \ncompensation and benefits on military careers in both Regular and \nReserve components of the United States.\n  H, identify various feasible options for improving compensation and \nother benefits available to members of the National Guard and members \nof the other Reserve components, and assess the cost effectiveness of \nsuch options--that is a good idea--and the foreseeable effects of such \noptions on readiness, recruitment, retention of personnel for careers \nin the Regular and Reserve components of the armed services.\n  I, assess the traditional military career paths for members of the \nGuard and the other Reserve components and identify alternative career \npaths that could enhance professional development; and assess the \nadequacy of the funding provided for the National Guard and other \nReserve components.\n\n  And it says further on, at the conclusion, that the Secretary of \nDefense shall annually review the Reserve components of the Armed \nForces with regard to the roles and mission.\n  B, the compensation and other benefits, including health care \nbenefits, that are provided for members of the Reserve components under \nthe laws of the United States; and the Secretary shall submit a report \nof an annual review, together with comments and recommendations that \nthe Secretary considers appropriate to the Committee on Armed Services \nof the Senate and the Armed Services Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Well, this is not certainly what I would like in the sense that I \nhave a number of ideas I want to see put in this. So they didn't adopt \nin this bill the ideas I specifically suggested, although it did \ncomment favorably on some. But it does put in a mechanism, I say to the \nSenator from Louisiana, and maybe together we can beat on some of these \nfolks and maybe we can continue to press the issue hard, because I \nbelieve this Congress wants to, and will, increase benefits for the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  We obviously have a certain limited amount of money, but I think we \nwill be generous about it. We ought to be. And then what we do spend, \nhowever, does need to be carefully studied. We should get the best \ninsight from the most people and then we make those expenditures in a \nway that gets maximum impact on the members of our Guard and Reserve, \nwho serve our country so very well.\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\n  I yield for a question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield for a question, I appreciate \nthe Senator's comments. I look forward to working with him. He has been \none of the leaders in supporting the Guard and Reserve. The question \nis, is he familiar with--if he is not, we can send it over--a letter \nfrom Secretary Bill Cohen on March 17, 1998, that says to the then-\nchairman of the Committee on National Security in the House--and this \nwas in 1998--is the Senator aware that back in 1998, the former \nSecretary of Defense sent a letter noting:\n\n       With the increased use of the Guard and Reserve, \n     particularly for unplanned contingency operations, employers \n     of the Guard and Reserve members are often faced with the \n     unplanned absences of their Reservist employees. They may \n     incur additional business expenses associated with the \n     unplanned absences.\n\n  Does the Senator from Alabama know this report that was sent to us in \n1998--3 years before September 11, 2001, and 3 years before 643,000 \nGuard and Reserve were called up, and that the Department of Defense \nhas been petitioning Congress to provide some tax credit for employers \nwho are picking up 100 percent of the expense? Does the Senator know \nthat, and would he like to comment about our ongoing efforts?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There is a great deal to be said for that. I know the \nSenator has that letter from the Secretary of Defense in 1998. It does \nconclude by saying:\n\n       Tax or other incentives for employers might help to \n     ameliorate some of their problems. Any such plan, of course, \n     must compete for resources. . . .\n\n  We simply have to figure out how we can best utilize it. A tax credit \nis, in a sense, an expenditure of our money. It is a reduction in the \namount of money that would come into the Treasury. If this is the best \nway to do it, as I know the Senator believes deeply, I will be \nsupportive of it, too.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield, the Senator is correct. It \nwill compete for resources, and that is why those of us who have worked \non this will be careful to request it at the appropriate time. We \nunderstand there is competition among resources. That is why I have \ntaken the opportunity of talking, when we were about ready to pass this \nbill--$137 billion in tax credits. Surely, we could have found $2 \nbillion out of this as we spread out the scarce resources. I would not \ncall $137 billion scarce, but it is $137 billion out of which we could \nhave found $2 billion.\n  We cannot amend that bill, but did the Senator know there might be \nanother bill that already passed the House of Representatives, which is \nover here, that we could amend and send back to the House? It would not \nbecome law on this, and I know he knows that. But we could send it to \nthe House, and if they pass it and send it to the President's desk, it \ncould become law on a different bill?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was not aware of that. I would be surprised if that \nwere the case. I would simply say I thank the Senator for pushing this \nissue. I have my list of 11 other issues I want to see. We did pass \nadditional tax deductions several years ago for the Guard and Reserve \nthat they can claim themselves when they have to travel extended \ndistances. Many people, to be promoted or stay in the Guard and \nReserve, often have to go to Reserve centers 200 or 300 miles away, and \nthis is so they won't be forced out and they will be able to stay in \nand retire.\n  I think we ought to be helpful to them in that regard also. I would \njust again say that it is a tough question. Here is an example I have \nthought of--it makes me think we need to be careful--I think of an \nexecutive in a business with 30 or 40 people on the shop floor. The \nexecutive is making $100,000 a year. The guys on the shop floor are \nmaybe making $30,000 or so. They are all activated, three or four of \nthe shop floor people and the executive. For the lower income salaried \nworkers, they may well be receiving just as much on active duty as they \nwere in the Guard and Reserve, and we would be therefore helping pay a \nguy more money than we are the lower income people. In other words, \nmaybe there is unfairness there, I do not know, but I do think it is \ngreat that so many of these businesses are willing to pay this \ncompensation. I salute them for it. If we can assist them and encourage \nthem to do more, I would.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would the Senator yield for just one more question? He \nis so patient.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would yield for one more question.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for yielding. Did the Senator \nknow--because he raises an excellent point. We would not want to create \na tax credit that basically allowed a $100,000 or $150,000 salaried \nworker to continue on the front line because it would inadvertently \nbenefit the higher end. So did the Senator know that we crafted our \namendment with a cap which we thought was reasonable so in the example \nthat he gave, in the amendment that is being discussed now, that the \n$100,000 salaried worker who went over to Iraq would receive $30,000 in \nReserve pay, according to our amendment, if his employer wanted to pay \nhim up to $45,000 only, and they would get a $15,000 credit. So he \nwould receive, on the front line, $45,000 instead of the $30,000, but \nhe would still be losing $55,000 in income. So the family back home \nwould still be losing $55,000 in income, which is a tough thing for \nthese families.\n  I am not trying to help people who could otherwise help themselves, \nbut that is still a pretty significant loss of income, as the Senator \nknows. But we do have a cap because of that purpose. We did not want to \nunfairly benefit those at the top end.\n  I will say that many employers are covering that gap now, and they \nare absorbing that difference now. We would only be subsidizing the \nfirst basically $15,000 of that. I would, frankly, be open to \nsubsidizing more, but too many Members objected to that. So as a \ncompromise, we sort of settled on this cap.\n  I understand what the Senator is saying. I just wanted to ask him if \nhe was aware that we did have a cap on this amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I did understand that. I do think that the Senator is \ncorrect to say that this was not a thrown-together amendment, that the \nSenator thought about a lot of these tough issues that are in here. As \nI say, it may work for a rather small amount of compensation. We could \nencourage a lot more businesses to step forward and make this match or \nmake up the difference, which would be good.\n\n\n                   Historic Elections in Afghanistan\n\n  Speaking of what our military does, the United Nations does a lot of \nthings, as well as NGOs, Americans, and other countries do a lot to \nhelp around the world. But I do think our military deserve great credit \nfor a lot of the things they do that help in a humanitarian way and \nhelp in ways that could not be accomplished otherwise.\n\n  Yesterday was a great day for the good people of Afghanistan. After \ndecades of war, disruption, destruction, starvation, millions of people \nfleeing their homeland as refugees to Pakistan and other places, these \nwonderful people came together by the millions to cast their ballots \nfor the first free nationwide election in Afghanistan's history.\n  The U.N. appointed joint electoral management body, Vice Chairman Ray \nKennedy said this: The JEMB--that is his entity--is encouraged that the \nvoters of Afghanistan have turned out in large numbers and the process \noverall has been safe and orderly.\n  That is a good fact. Many people predicted that we could not have \nelections, that elections could not be held on time in Afghanistan, \nthat they could not be held effectively, and that is not what was said \nthere. In fact, I think most people worried there would be a great deal \nof violence in Afghanistan. We thought the elections would go forward \nanyway, that the people were motivated to go out and vote, that they \ncared about it.\n  But I thought and was afraid that we would have bombings at polling \nplaces and things like that, which scared us. I am sure a lot of the \nAfghan people were somewhat afraid that if they went they might be \nattacked by the radical Taliban remnants that still desire to wrest \ncontrol back of that country.\n  Another U.N. spokesman, Manual de Almeida de Silva said this: \nOverall, there was massive participation in the election.\n  It is especially gratifying that there was a large number of women \nvoters who cast their ballots. They made up 40\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\npercent. The distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Dole, who was the \nchairman of the Red Cross, traveled the whole world on a regular basis \nand knows the difficulties women have had around the world at various \ntimes and certainly had in Afghanistan under the Taliban when they \ncould not even go to school and they had to, by law, wear these burqas \nand were beaten if they did not, and they could not work.\n  Forty percent of the 10 million people who registered to vote in \nAfghanistan were women, and they cast ballots all over that country.\n  An article in today's Washington Times quotes a Kabul shopkeeper as \nsaying this: For the first time, Afghans are able to choose their own \nleader.\n  He added: From today, things will only get better in our country.\n  And can we not hope so for those people who suffered so much over 20 \nyears of destruction, war, warlords, religious hostility and violence?\n  Things are going so much better. I do not know what the figure now is \nof the number of refugees who returned, but within not too many months \nafter the conclusion of this operation in Afghanistan a million \nrefugees returned home to Afghanistan. They were voting with their \nfeet. They believed that life was going to be better, safer. Yes, we \nhave had dangers, we have had bombings, we have had resistance from \nmany of these groups that are determined to hold onto their power, but \nthe people are voting in these elections, and it is something that we \nshould celebrate.\n  The people took the election seriously. I am sure many of them had to \nconsider that they were at risk when they went to vote. They took \nseriously the hanging chad foul-ups--maybe I will call it that--that \noccurred. They apparently did not ink the right finger in the right way \nor caused a disturbance and some of them protested and their protests \nwere taken seriously, but the people voted.\n  Some say, well, you should not even vote. We ought not to vote \nbecause they did not ink the finger right. But the people voted, and \nthey voted in record numbers. It is going to be a healthy thing for the \nfuture, and they are going to be heard. Their complaints will be \nlistened to and I believe they are unlikely to ever occur again.\n  It is particularly dicey, in these first election times. Some people \nwant to boycott the election. They realize they are losing. If they \njust go and vote and cast their ballots and only get 5 percent or 10 \npercent, then what do they tell their supporters, that we were \nrejected? That is what happens in the United States. Everybody in the \nwhole world sees you get whacked. But what often happens in developing \ncountries that do not have experience with democracy, they will say: I \nam going to pull out. I will ask my people not to participate. So when \nthe votes are counted they can try to say to their supporters: See, we \nwould have gotten a lot of votes except we pulled out. So you had some \nof that in this election, I am afraid.\n  But the numbers are so strong, the number of women are so strong, it \ncan only be asserted, as the U.N. did, that it was a tremendous success \nas an election.\n  Yesterday was a historic and peaceful demonstration of democracy in \nAfghanistan. It is a day of great significance for them and the world \nbecause the world participated with American leadership in bringing \nthis about. Yes, people were killed in the hostilities that occurred in \nAfghanistan. But I want you to know there were millions--well over a \nmillion, maybe several million Afghan people living in refugee camps \naround the world, over a million in Pakistan--they are able to come \nhome because we moved militarily, decisively, and effectively. The \ncountry is going to now have a democracy. Their economy has a chance to \ndevelop. I could not be more proud for them.\n  When I was in Afghanistan in July, I had the honor to meet, for my \nsecond time in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai. He has to be \nconsidered, in my opinion, one of the world's great leaders. Under this \ntremendous stress and difficulty, where his life is in jeopardy, he \nseems to have captured the spirit of the Afghan people. He told us the \nAfghan people are ahead of the politicians. They know they need to have \na good government for their entire country. They know that warlords \nthreaten their stability. They know that warlords will hold back their \nprogress. They want progress. They want freedom. They want prosperity. \nThey want democracy. And President Karzai, in his address to the joint \nsession of Congress, was so eloquent on that point. Speaking in \nbeautiful English, he described his goals and visions for the people.\n  I don't know how the election will come out. Most people are \npredicting he will do very well in the election. We will see. The votes \nhave not been counted yet. But I have been so impressed with his \npersonal courage, his personal understanding of the historical moment \nof which he is a part. He is putting his life on the line for his \npeople. Indeed, if this thing continues and he continues his successful \nrole, he could certainly be considered the George Washington of \nAfghanistan.\n  One Afghan citizen, Mr. Amari, said:\n\n       What is important is that we are on our way to becoming a \n     democracy.\n\n  Aren't those great words? ``We are on our way to becoming a \ndemocracy.'' I think President Bush was correct the other day to say \ndemocracy is on the march around the world.\n  We have had a very difficult time in Iraq. We are going to have other \ndifficult days in the future in Iraq. The circumstances there are just \ndifficult. We have determined adversaries, various groups of them. They \nare together sometimes, and sometimes they are independent. You get one \nto agree, and there is another one unhappy. So it is difficult to make \nas much progress as rapidly as we would like there. But we are seeing \nthe electoral process go forward in Iraq, and we are going to see it \ncontinue to progress, I believe.\n\n  I would like to share what was in today's paper. This was Mariam \nKarouny of the Reuters News Agency who wrote an article about what has \nhappened in Iraq today. This is today's paper. People are so negative \nabout everything, saying everything is wrong. They see only the bad. \nThey only see the difficulties. We had difficulties after World War II. \nWe had difficulties in trying to help South Korea. Now they have \n500,000 troops and they build an automobile. A Hyundai automobile plant \nis in Alabama. I was pleased to see in USA Today that complaints \nagainst their automobile is the lowest of any automobile except Lexus. \nThat was a country that had a lot of difficulties 50 years ago. We have \n37,000 troops in South Korea today. They have 650,000. But they are a \nbooming, progressive democracy. So things don't happen overnight.\n  Let me read to you what was in today's newspaper, Reuters News \nAgency, about Iraq. The lead paragraph.\n\n       Baghdad--Iraq's plan to hold elections in January gained \n     traction yesterday after a Shi'ite militia agreed to disarm \n     in Baghdad and delegates from the rebel-held Falluja [the \n     center of resistance] said the Sunni Muslim city wanted to \n     vote in the elections.\n\n  It goes on.\n\n       The progress came in separate sets of talks with the Iraqi \n     interim government and U.S. officials.\n       The Mahdi's Army militia, led by radical Shi'ite cleric \n     Sheik Muqtada al-Sadr, agreed to hand over weapons to Iraqi \n     police beginning tomorrow under a deal that could defuse the \n     Baghdad flash point of Sadr City.\n\n  That is the core of the Baghdad danger area, the area where the \nviolence is occurring. This is really rather remarkable. Will it all \ncome to pass? I don't know. But just the fact that the Mahdi Army's \nmilitia has agreed to hand over their weapons, even if they all don't \ndo it, that is something new. And they announced they wanted to do \nthat. They announced they will participate in elections. Those are \ndramatic steps, I believe, and leaves them far less able to generate \ncontinuing violence against the interim Government of Iraq, the \nprovisional Government of Iraq, if they already are admitting that they \nare prepared to turn in their weapons. That is a tremendous event.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Karim al-Bakhati, a tribal leader negotiating for people in \n     Sadr City, said U.S. forces had promised to stop bombarding \n     the vast Shi'ite slum area with immediate effect.\n       ``We have agreed that starting from Monday, the Sadr \n     movement will hand over its weapons to the Iraqi police,'' he \n     said, adding that collection points would be chosen in the \n     next day or two.\n\n  Al-Sadr aides--this Muqtada al-Sadr, the most prominent leader of the \nmilitias that have conducted violence against the central government \nand\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\nthe United States--this is what it says about him:\n\n       Al-Sadr aides said the agreement would apply initially only \n     to Sadr City, not to other restive Shi'ite areas of Iraq.\n       Falluja delegates--\n\n  This is the delegates from the center of resistance, the Sunni area \nof Falluja--\n\n       Falluja delegates said the city wanted to take part in the \n     elections and could accept the return of Iraqi security \n     forces.\n       ``A delegation from Fallujah is now discussing the entry of \n     Iraqi national guards to the city with the Defense \n     Ministry,'' chief Fallujah negotiator Khaled al-Jumaili said.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The people of Fallujah support the elections and want to \n     vote in them.\n\n  Isn't that great news? The people of Fallujah support the election. \nThey believe that a new government can be formed in Iraq. Otherwise, \nthey will not support elections. They support them and want to \nparticipate in them. This is the core of the resistance. Some people \nare under some doubt about how we should handle Fallujah. Some have \nsaid we need to send in troops and some say we should negotiate, maybe \na combination of the two that was chosen, and a lot of people want to \ncomplain. But maybe just a little restraint, maybe a wise application \nof power here, the combination of that, has brought their town around. \nSo we have a much better chance than we would have thought.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       ``The people of Fallujah support the elections and want to \n     vote in them,'' said Mr. Al-Jumaili, a mosque preacher who is \n     a member of the lawless city's Mujahideen shura, or council.\n\n  I don't know whether all of that will come, but I believe that any \npeople in the world given the opportunity to choose democracy and \nfreedom over totalitarianism and oppression will choose good government \nover a corrupt and abusive government.\n  We have undertaken by a vote of three-fourths-plus Members of this \nSenate, after weeks and indeed months of debate and discussion, a war \nto overthrow Saddam Hussein, and we committed to work to help them \nestablish a good government. We cast that vote, and we have some people \nwho cast that vote who now want to complain about this and that and see \nnothing but the negative and comment inadvertently, which I believe can \nmake progress more dire. Some of them have been negative. But we made a \ncommitment. We voted.\n  We had the same basic intelligence which the Presiding Officer also \nhad when she attended the secret briefings, which we all had and which \nthe President had. The fundamental thing they told us was the same as \nwas told to the President of the United States by former CIA Director \nTenet, who was appointed to that position by President Clinton. \nAccording to Mr. Woodward's book, he raised his hands when the \nPresident of the United States asked if we would find weapons of mass \ndestruction and with clarity said, ``a slam dunk.'' That is what we \nwere told. That is what the President was told.\n  We had every reason to believe there would be weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq. Why? Because he had them before. He had used them \non his own people. He had used them on the Iranian people in that \nhorrible war he started that resulted in the deaths of 1 million \nIranians.\n  I talked to a man from Iran just the other day. He drove that number \nhome to me. He said the people of Iran never supported Saddam Hussein. \nHe said: We supported his overthrow. He said: He killed 1 million of \nour people in a stupid war that had no justification whatsoever as well \nas that stupid war he undertook against Kuwait, which former President \nBush had to send in troops and boot him out of Kuwait.\n  It was a difficult time, I remember, after that war. What happened \nwas Saddam Hussein essentially sued for peace. He asked us to stop \nmoving into Baghdad, and if we did so he would cease to be a threat to \nhis region, he would renounce his weapons of mass destruction, \ndemonstrate that he did not have them and was not pursuing them, would \nmake his country open to United Nations inspections, and he would not \noppress the different ethnic groups in his country.\n\n  He didn't adhere to any of that. After the war, he was in violation \nof 16 United Nations resolutions. He was counting on the embargo in the \nOil for Food Program. Many of the countries that voted against the war \nwere corruptly involved in that Oil for Food Program. The United \nNations' hands are not clean with regard to the Oil for Food Program \nfor sure. It was good in concept, but it was being abused greatly. He \nwas determined, as Mr. Duelfer told us the other day in his testimony, \nto break that embargo and recommence the building of his weapons of \nmass destruction. That was his goal, of which there can be little \ndoubt.\n  This country is better off with him gone. We are making progress, as \nI just read, in establishing a more decent government in that country, \nhelping them to overcome this violence. I believe as time goes by we \nwill continue to make progress. It is not going to be easy, \nunfortunately. There are resistance groups that are tough and \ntenacious. But it is great to see leaders of the more radical groups \nlike Al-Sadr's militia talking about turning in their weapons and \ncooperating.\n  It is great to see the people of Fallujah and their representatives \nsaying they want elections and they want to participate in them and \nmake us believe those soldiers we sent there, our Guard and Reserve who \nhave been sent there, have served our country well. They placed their \nlives at risk for us in a policy we adopted, and they have successfully \ncarried it out in a way that has given us an opportunity to do \nsomething good now in Iraq. Certainly we are seeing great progress in \nAfghanistan.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Stem Cell Research\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we are currently in conversations about \nthe schedule for tonight and tomorrow, and as that discussion \ncontinues, I will spend the next few minutes talking about an entirely \ndifferent topic, and it concerns stem cell research.\n  I bring to the floor this whole discussion of stem cell research \nbecause it has been so much of the news of late in part in the \nPresidential debate and in part comments made by scientists and \npatients who look to the future promise of stem cell research. I really \nwanted to take the opportunity before we departed to clarify remarks \nthat have been made by certain constituencies and also to reflect on \nwhere I think we are today, in part to restate what the President's \npolicy is.\n  Senator Kerry, our distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, has \nmade some remarks earlier this week on the issue. As in the past, the \nSenator from Massachusetts was not completely accurate in his comments \nto my mind, and I would like to explain why I feel that way.\n  There were some key facts about the science of stem cells that were \ndeliberately excluded from those comments, and I think there have been \nsome deliberate mischaracterizations made by the Senator from \nMassachusetts about President Bush's record on this issue. It is a \ncritically important issue, a hugely promising field that we are going \nto be hearing a lot more about as the rapid advances in medical science \nare made.\n  It is important for the American people to be fully informed and to \nbe accurately informed about stem cells and the President's stem cell \npolicy, about the facts of the science so we can together participate \nin this debate.\n  There are several points I would like to make. First, what does the \nscience entail, what are the basics?\n  First, scientists today are engaged in two basic types of stem cell \nresearch. One is adult stem cell research with cells taken from fully \nmature cells, for the most part. It might be cartilage or it might be \nbone marrow. The other type of research is embryonic, and that is where \nthe cells are taken from human embryos. Embryonic stem cell--and this \nis really everything else--or adult or nonembryonic research. We think \nof it as embryonic and adult.\n  The adult stem cell research, which really doesn't have any real \nethical\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\nproblems with it at all, has already led to successful human treatment. \nEmbryonic stem cell research has not. Adult human stem cell research \nhas promising but real treatments today.\n  Some examples. Researchers have treated diabetic patients with islet \ncells from the pancreas of deceased human donors. More than 80 percent \nof those treated were able to stop their insulin shots for more than a \nyear. That is an adult stem cell type of research.\n  Adult bone marrow cells have been used successfully to heal chronic \nskin blemishes in patients.\n  Adult bone marrow stem cells also have shown promise in my own field \nof heart disease. In the journal ``Circulation'' this past March, \npatients showed significant improvement in heart function for several \nmonths after receiving injections of their own bone marrow stem cells. \nAgain, these are all adult stem cells. Bone marrow stem cells, blood \nstem cells, and immature thigh muscle cells, all of which are adult \nstem cells, have been used to grow new heart tissue in both human \nsubjects, as well as, of course, animal subjects. All of these human \ntreatments are with adult stem cells. None are with embryonic stem \ncells.\n  Two, as policymakers and as scientists, we absolutely must be careful \nnot to oversell the science of embryonic stem cell research. The \ntendency out there, and it is cruel to patients, is to overpromise and \nsay with embryonic stem cell research you can be cured. We should not \noverpromise. As a physician, you never give a patient a false sense of \nhope. You want to give them real hope, but you do not want to give them \na false sense of hope. That is wrong. Doctors should not do it. \nScientists need to be very careful in making these promises to \npatients. Policymakers should not do it.\n  Both adult stem cell and embryonic stem cell research do hold \npotential promise. Yet the embryonic stem cell is still in its infancy, \nwhere adult stem cell is much further along. That is why we see these \nhuman treatments today. Embryonic stem cell research science offers \nhope. That is the hope for potential future advances that can be made \nin treating debilitating and life-threatening diseases, chronic \ndiseases, and disabilities.\n  However, politicians and scientists have to be careful about \noverselling this science, about manipulating that hope that is out \nthere way off in the future into hype or political gain. That is wrong. \nIt is unfair to patients. It is unfair to humankind. We have to avoid \nthis hyperbolic rhetoric. Giving false hope is wrong. It is wrong for a \ndoctor to do it. It is wrong for a politician to do. Neither should \ncruelly exploit the hopes of patients and their families.\n  I have to give one example because it is one that is most commonly \nused. When President Ronald Reagan died earlier this year from \ncomplications probably associated with Alzheimer's disease, some who \nsupport unlimited embryonic stem cell experimentation rushed to suggest \nAlzheimer's could be cured with embryonic stem cells.\n  As a scientist, as a policymaker, as a physician, I have to say that \nis wrong. It is disingenuous. It is untrue. It gives people a false \nsense of hope. The science is not there today.\n  Today, there are far more promising avenues of research for the \ndiscoveries of treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's \ndisease is a plaque on top of cells and therefore the study formation \nand manipulation is not where the most promising areas of research are \ntoday. If you ask any scientist working in the field of Alzheimer's \ndisease, they will tell you treatments involving embryonic stem cells \nare among the least likely fields of research to yield cures. They will \nalso tell you even the most promising developments, none of which \ninvolve any type of stem cells, will not yield a cure for years, and \nmaybe even a decade or more.\n  I mention Alzheimer's because it is the one most commonly used to \ngive this false hope. As a physician, it hurts me to see that because \nit is wrong.\n\n  Stem cell research, both embryonic and adult, does hold real promise \nfor a whole range of diseases, including certain types of diabetes, \nspinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease. We should aggressively \npursue both embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research. \nWe need to do so vigorously, and we are, both embryonic and adult. \nHowever, we have to do so in a framework that respects ethical \nconsiderations and moral considerations. It does not matter what you \ncall it, but put a framework around human research as we have done in \nevery other field of human experimentation.\n  In my own field of heart transplantation, where you define brain \ndeath for the first time and you are removing living tissue from a body \nand transporting it to another body to give this body life, that whole \nfield of experimentation has a framework of ethical and moral concerns \nthat has to be defined with certain guidelines that are not crossed, no \nmatter how promising that moving of tissue or transplantation might be. \nWe call that human subjects protections. It is not unusual and thus \ndoing so in the field of stem cell research is nothing new for a \nscientist or for a physician or for someone interested in medical \nresearch. There are ethical guidelines that we as a society must, \nshould, and actually do establish for any type of human research.\n  The third point, President Bush's stem cell policy, what is it? \nPresident Bush's stem cell policy supports and encourages scientific \ndiscovery. It does so within an ethical framework. First, President \nBush's policy funds all types of stem cell research, both embryonic and \nadult. He is the first President in history to fund embryonic stem cell \nresearch. All embryonic stem cell lines created before August 2001 are \neligible for unlimited Federal funding.\n  Two, there are no funding limits on adult stem cell research \nwhatever. That is the type of stem cell research, as I mentioned, that \nhas yielded real results in human patients. Adult stem cell research is \nthe type that is free of any sort of ethical concern. I will come back \nto the embryonic stem cell concern, what are the ethical concerns, in a \nmoment.\n  The National Institutes of Health is spending record amounts for both \nembryonic stem cell research this year as well as adult stem cell \nresearch.\n  Four, the President has placed no limits or restrictions whatever on \nthe private funding of embryonic and adult stem cell research. Private \nfunding is legal and totally unrestricted.\n  Fifth, because this whole field of embryonic stem cell research is \nyoung, it is emerging, it is a relatively new science, and because it \ntakes very specialized skill, highly trained skill and expertise, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has engaged in a number of \nactivities. It has developed a stem cell clearinghouse or a stem cell \nbank of eligible lines. It has devoted substantial efforts to sharing \nthat technical, specialized expertise with researchers around the world \nso the stem cell science will advance as rapidly as possible. The \nNational Institutes of Health is establishing three stem cell, what we \ncall centers of excellence. It has created a stem cell task force.\n  While we are vigorously searching for cures with stem cell research, \nunder the President's policies, we are also showing respect for the \nmoral significance of human embryos. The President has reached a \ncareful balance. Pursue promising medical research, devote \nunprecedented Federal resources to health care breakthroughs with stem \ncells, allow unlimited private funding, but do not use Federal taxpayer \ndollars to destroy human life or create human embryos solely for the \npurpose of experimentation.\n  Fourth, there is no ban on stem cell research. I say that directly \nbecause our distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, \nclaims the President has put, in his words, a ``sweeping ban'' on stem \ncell research. Those are his words, sweeping ban.\n  Last Monday he accused the President of ``sacrificing science for \nideology and playing politics with people who need cures.'' Then he \nadded that treatments ``could be right at our fingertips'' were it not \nfor the--these are his words--``stem cell ban.''\n  Now, I just have to ask the Senator--I know he is not here now--but \n``at our fingertips''? That is not right. ``Stem cell ban''? Wrong \nagain, Senator Kerry. There is no ban.\n  President Bush is the first President, as I mentioned, in history, to \nfund embryonic stem cell research. The President is funding stem cell \nresearch, as I mentioned, at record levels. There is no limit on stem \ncell research or funding in the private sector.\n  These are the facts. Senator Kerry is playing politics with the \ntruth. Even\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nworse, he is playing politics with the hope of those today who are \nsuffering and their loved ones and their families. That, I believe, is \nirresponsible. It is cruel to play politics with people who need cures.\n  My fifth point, and last point, has to do with the moral significance \nof embryonic--of really the human embryo and why this ethical framework \nis so important and why this balance that the President achieved is so \ncritically important.\n  It boils down to the fact that embryos do have moral significance, \nand they do deserve moral respect. The President believes we should \nconduct this research with the highest moral and ethical standards. The \nPresident has struck a balance. We must carefully weigh the potential, \nas far off as it might be, but the potential for saving lives against \nthe reality of destroying life.\n  I say that because an embryo is biologically human, it is living, and \nit is genetically distinct. Thus, it deserves moral respect. Thus \ndestruction of living human embryos for experimentation is not a \nmorally neutral act.\n  In closing, these times are extraordinary for many reasons. In part \nit is because, as a physician, I see the tremendous advances that are \nbeing made in science, in my own field of heart disease and lung \ndisease, but for arthritis and for spinal cord injuries, and a whole \nrange of illnesses, really every illness. But the times are \nextraordinary, probably most profoundly because of the pace of change \nin our own lives.\n  Nothing is changing our lives quicker and with greater sweep than \nscience today, and in particular, the scientific discovery within the \nfield of medicine. It gives hope. It gives cures. It gives treatment. \nScience is moving more rapidly than ever, and the race will quicken. \nEvery day it will quicken in the future.\n  I believe we have an obligation to vigorously support this progress, \nbut we must do so in an ethically appropriate framework. No doubt, stem \ncell research shows great progress; it shows great promise. The \nPresident's policy harnesses that promise, and it also strikes a \nbalance with the values of our people.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Dr. Frist for his comments. It \nhas just clarified, for me, this issue. It was, as he explained it, \nbasically as I thought the situation was. But the Senator refreshed our \nrecollection. So the statement Senator Kerry made the other night \ncriticizing a ``sweeping ban'' on stem cell research is not correct \nbecause there is no ban at all on stem cell research; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, indeed, in response, through the Chair, \nto the distinguished Senator from Alabama, there is no ban. There is \ncertainly no ``sweeping ban.'' Yet you see in the headlines of \nnewspapers references made to this ban, which reflects the words of \nsomeone who is running to be President of the United States, which I \nfind unconscionable because of the impact it has on patients, people \nwho do deserve real hope, and not a cruel hope of rhetoric which now \nhas become hyperbole.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I thank the Senator and would ask one more \nquestion. I agree with you, that an embryo has all the characteristics \nthat result in an adult human being. They deserve moral respect. I \nthink that was an appropriate phrase you used.\n  I want to ask again, now: There is Federal funding for certain \nongoing embryonic research; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in response, there is Federal funding for \nembryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research, embryonic \nstem cell research at record high levels, and adult stem cell research \nat record high levels, by the President of the United States using \nFederal taxpayer funds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Did I understand you to say that, to date, the \nembryonic stem cell research has produced no medical treatments that \nare proven efficacious, but the adult stem cell research, which is \nfully supported in every way by our Government, is showing some medical \nprogress?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, that is exactly right. Again, both have \npromise. Embryonic stem cell research is in its infancy and today has \nyielded no treatments for human disease. Adult stem cell research, \nthere are numerous, I would say probably about 150 or 160 different \nareas of treatment using adult stem cells.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee.\n  As we all know, he is not just a Senator; he has been a physician, \nand not just a physician but one of America's finest physicians, a \nheart/lung transplant surgeon at the great Vanderbilt University School \nof Medicine. I think we ought to listen to his comments on this \nimportant issue. I thank him for sharing those comments with us.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, let me just close with that comment, that \nthe importance of the human subject type protections and having this \nethical framework is because that human embryo is living, it is \nembryologically distinct in terms of a genetic formulation, and it is \nbiologically human, and therefore deserves the respect that the \nPresident has given it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Working On The Sabbath\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, earlier today, I was pleased to hear \nSenator Robert Byrd suggest we ought not to work on Sunday, on the \nSabbath, lightly. He expressed his concerns about us having a session \non a Sunday and quoted the Ten Commandments and Scripture, as he noted \nfrom the distinguish King James version of the Bible, telling us we \nought to avoid this basically.\n  I think as a country we would be a lot better off if we were more \nscrupulous about that. I thank him for sharing that. I think since I \nhave been in the Senate there have been very few days that we have \nworked on a Sunday. I know Senator Frist is a man of faith, and he \nwould not call on us to do so did he not think it was important and had \njustification consistent with the faith of most Americans and \nChristians. I know he is a Christian. We have other faiths here in the \nSenate, also.\n  I would just quote another part of the King James version that refers \nto the story of Jesus going through the cornfields on the Sabbath day. \nI am looking at Mark, Second Chapter, 23rd Verse:\n\n     . . . and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the \n     ears of corn.\n       And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the \n     sabbath day that which is not lawful?\n       Jesus answered unto them, Have ye never read what David did \n     when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were \n     with him?\n       How he went into the House of God in the days of Abiathar, \n     the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which it is not \n     lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them \n     which were with him?\n       And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and \n     not man for the sabbath:\n       Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.\n\n  Then it goes on, chapter 3, continues right on:\n\n       And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a \n     man there which had a withered hand.\n       And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the \n     sabbath day; that they might accuse him.\n       And he said unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand \n     forth.\n       And he said unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the \n     sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But \n     they held their peace.\n       And when he had looked round about on them with anger, \n     being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said unto \n     the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out; \n     and his hand was restored whole as the other.\n\n  I think that is authority for us also. We have a hurricane relief \nbill and other challenges facing America today. I don't think we need \nto make this a habit. I think we ought to be careful about what we do. \nI think under the circumstances, this is a justified day today. I \nwanted to share those thoughts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11068-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, I want to express my gratitude to a \nnumber of our colleagues who have worked with us to accomplish the \nmultifaceted agreement that has now been put into place. I know this \nhas been a very difficult and trying time for the entire Senate, and I \nknow that my colleagues who have been to the floor and have expressed \nthemselves over the last several days did so with the very best intent.\n  I think this is the best resolution to accommodate the very \nunderstandable concerns they have, but also to allow the Senate to \ncomplete its work. We have much more that needs to be done when we come \nback, and obviously we are going to be working on that. But this does \nallow us to move forward on what I think has been a very consequential \nweek. The FSC bill, the military construction bill, the Homeland \nSecurity bill, the 9/11 conference report, the legislative \nreorganization, we have been able to do a good deal of work in a very \nshort period of time. This will culminate our effort to complete the \nwork and to move forward.\n  I appreciate very much their cooperation and their willingness to \nallow us to enter into this resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be recognized tomorrow \nto speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, while the Democratic leader is here, I \nwant to again thank both him and the assistant Democratic leader and my \nassistant leader as well and all the parties who have had to \nparticipate in bringing the agreement we just reached together. What it \nmeans is that tomorrow at noon, we will be having a rollcall vote and \nthat the remainder of the bills I mentioned would be handled by voice \nvote tomorrow. But we will have a single rollcall vote tomorrow at \nnoon.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I would concur it is our understanding \nthat these matters will be handled by voice except for the FSC \nconference report. While we do not have it before the Senate at the \nmoment, we will also be asking that Senator Boxer be recognized for 30 \nminutes and that a resolution having to do with a provision she has \nbeen very involved with be taken up as well. But that would be \nmomentarily. Again, I appreciate her cooperation, along with that of \nmany others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11068-4", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11068-S11087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT AMENDING FAIR LABOR \n                         STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the \ndesk to be passed under a previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, S. 2974 and S. 2975 \nare read the third time and passed en bloc, and the motion to \nreconsider is laid on the table.\n  The bills (S. 2974 and S. 2975) were read the third time and passed, \nen bloc, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Smoking Prevention \n     and Tobacco Control Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 6,500,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 2,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2001, the tobacco industry spent more than \n     $11,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nabout 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am so pleased to be on the floor and \nto thank our leadership: First, Senator Frist, our majority leader, \nfrom Tennessee; Senator Daschle, the minority leader; and Senator Reid, \nwho has worked so tirelessly today. Reasonable minds came together on \nsome of these issues. I particularly thank the Senator from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, for working throughout the day with us on this very \nimportant amendment for the Guard and Reserve; and particularly, \nSenator Kit Bond, who was one of the leaders on the Republican side; \nSenator Jeff Sessions for his kind remarks today; Senator Jeffords, who \nsigned the letter to the President; Senator Nelson of Florida and \nSenator Akaka, who came to the floor; Senator Murray for her strong \nsupport of the amendment; Senator Boxer for being an original cosponsor \nof the amendment, along with Senator Durbin and\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\nSenator Kerry. There may be others I can mention in the next few \nminutes because this truly was a success for all of us and the Senate, \nfor the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership of the \nSenate, to be able to come to a reasonable agreement to pass a tax \ncredit for members of the Guard and Reserve, to pass a significant tax \ncredit for businesses in this country, particularly small businesses \nthat are really struggling to make ends meet and are doing the \npatriotic thing.\n  Madam President, I had submitted this for the Record several days \nago, so I will not repeat it. I call attention to the hundreds of \nbusinesses--potentially thousands--that will benefit directly from this \ntax credit, but most important, it is the guardsmen and reservists \nwhose paychecks will continue, whose families will be supported, who \nwill be the direct and most important beneficiaries of the agreement \nreached tonight. I thank my colleagues, and I will speak in more detail \ntomorrow about the benefits.\n  Because we worked together and kept working in good faith and because \nwe kept them in our minds, the Senate tomorrow at some time will pass, \nby unanimous consent, according to the agreement just reached, a tax \ncredit for businesses. It won't technically be in this huge bill I have \nbeen holding up for 3 days. As I started this discussion, there was \nnothing we could do to get it in this bill. The only thing that could \nhave happened to get it in the bill is if we pass it, the President \nwould veto it, send it back, and tell us to rewrite it. The chances of \nthat happening were not good. So we negotiated the next best thing, \nwhich was passing a stand-alone tax credit for the Guard and Reserve \nout of the Senate again, as we have already done with 100 Members of \nthe Senate--Republicans and Democrats--and sent to the House.\n  Now the focus will be on the House leadership. Now the focus will be \non the House. Is the Republican leadership in the House going to stand \nup for the men and women in the Guard and Reserve? Are they going to \ninclude them or leave them out of their tax bill? That is something the \nHouse leadership will have to discuss.\n  I am so proud tonight of the Senators. Again, many Senators helped. I \nwill go into more detail in the morning about that.\n\n  Let me make sure that I have included in the Record the Military \nOfficers Association, representing 376,000 members. I will submit for \nthe Record the Reserve Officers Association. In the morning, I will \nsubmit many other documents we have received from Active and Reserve \nmilitary organizations for members of the military coalition thanking \nus for standing strong for them to get a tax credit for them. If \nanybody deserves a tax credit--and if we can afford $137 billion for \nmany other interests in America--nobody deserves it more than the \nemployers, particularly the small employers of under 500 or a thousand. \nThat is not that small, but in the definition of small business, \nsomething under 500 is technically called a small business. In my \nState, we think of a 10- or 15-employee company as small. But \nparticularly for those small- and medium-sized businesses that are \ndoing the patriotic thing, keeping the paycheck whole for the Guard and \nReserve while they are on the front line and also hiring replacements \nfor them to run the factories, the businesses, the architectural firm, \nor drive a truck, et cetera.\n  So I am just as proud as I can be tonight to thank my colleagues for \nworking so well together. It has been a pleasure particularly working \nwith Senator Daschle, who has the patience of a saint on many of these \nissues and in the way he has negotiated with Senator Frist to bring \nthis to a good end.\n  I will yield back the remainder of my time tonight and, of course, \nreserve the right to speak again in the morning on this important \nsubject.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would particularly like to thank the Senator from \nIowa. There is a long list of Senators, but I need to particularly \nthank the Senator from Iowa, for the two of us have been on the floor \ntogether for the last 2 days. He has been very generous in terms of \nhelping with this issue, and he is a cosponsor of this amendment as \nwell. He has been a tremendous supporter.\n  The Senator from Iowa has also, our colleagues know, had other issues \nwhich he will speak about in a moment, very important to farmers, \nactually in my State as well as Iowa and States all over the Nation, \nbut I would be remiss if I did not thank the Senator from Iowa who has \nbeen arguing, holding the floor, making our points so we could get our \ncolleagues to focus on this issue, which has been done, and now we have \na bill we can send to the House. So I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. Let me return the \nbouquet. I thank the Senator from Louisiana on behalf of all the \nfriends I have who are reservists--I was a reservist once myself in my \nyounger years--all the National Guard people and the employers, the \nsmall businesspeople who try to do their best. These people are called \nup. They go to Iraq. Many times they try to give them some \ncompensation, but they are leaving their families behind, their kids, \ntheir communities, and all the Senator has been asking for is to treat \nthem fairly and decently, to help these employers make up that \ndifference in income, many of whom are trying to do their best. But \nlet's face it, a lot of them are small businesses. They cannot do it.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for standing up for small \nbusinesses, for standing up for our Guard and Reserve people who have \ngiven so much to this country, making sure they are treated equitably \nand fairly. I thank the Senator for doing this. This is an issue that \nhas to be resolved, and again every guardsman and every Reserve person \nin the United States owes the Senator from Louisiana a great debt of \nthanks.\n  I have to say this: If I am ever in a foxhole someplace, I want the \nSenator from Louisiana on my side because I know I will never have to \nworry about my backside if the Senator from Louisiana is there. She has \nwhat we call real grit. I am proud of her and thank her for being here \nthis weekend and for never backing down. I thank her for standing up \nfor our people in uniform in this country who are in the Guard and the \nReserves.\n  I also want to thank those on the Republican side, Leader Frist and \nothers, who have worked to try to get accommodations made and \nreasonable agreements worked out. This is a place where there must be \ncompromise. It is not your way or my way all the time. It is trying to \nwork out compromises, trying to work out reasonable solutions to \nthings. I thank those on the other side of the aisle who have worked \nthis weekend with us.\n  I especially want to also thank our leaders, Senator Daschle and \nSenator Reid, again for their willingness to work hard to try and work \nout these agreements with the leadership on the other side.\n\n  These are contentious things, but we know that. Sometimes around here \nwe are not the masters of our own fate. I know the administration comes \nin and they want things a certain way. Sometimes it is hard being a \nmember of the majority party whose President is in the White House. It \nis tough. I know that because a lot of times we may want to do things \none way and the White House wants it the other way and they make it \nvery tough on Members of their party. I understand that. I have been \nthere before.\n  People of good reason can come together and work together to work \nthese issues out. I know people took me to task today on the other side \nof the aisle. That is all right. I do not mind that. We have been \naround this place a long time. I want people to know I am going to \nstand here and fight for my farmers. They do not have many people \nfighting for them. They are a minority in this country. We got through \na good farm bill in 2002 and the President signed it, touted \nconservation, and now twice conservation has been invaded, taking the \nmoney out of\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\nour farm program. It is not right to do it that way.\n  So I am glad that when we come back in November to finalize our \nappropriations bills for next year--we have a continuing resolution \nuntil November 20 so we have to come back to finish that. Under the \nagreement we worked out, there will be an instruction to the conferees \nto undo what we did on the omnibus, to right what we did here and to \nmake the conservation program whole again. That can be done. It can be \ndone in November and, quite frankly, not too much will be upset in 1 \nmonth. We can live with that. We will get it straightened out in \nNovember.\n  I am glad we have reached this kind of a resolution and we will come \nback in November and try to get things straightened out at that time.\n  I want to thank those who have worked so hard to reach this \nagreement. I guess, as it goes now, we will be finished tomorrow and \npeople can get back to their homes and campaign.\n  I also want to publicly thank all of the people at the desk, the \nclerks, the reading clerks, our Parliamentarians and others, the floor \npeople on both sides, Republican and Democrat. They have had to give up \ntheir family this weekend. I know that. I want to thank them publicly \nfor being here and working long hours on Saturday, Saturday night, and \nSunday. It is now 8 at night. They provide a tremendous public service \non both sides of the aisle. I know a lot of times they could probably \nget a lot more done if we Senators were not around. The staff can work \nout things.\n  I also want to thank our reporters who are here. They have also \nworked long hours this weekend and given up their family time. I have \nto mention the pages, too. The pages probably had a nice weekend \nplanned. We thank them for being here and permitting us to do our job.\n  These are things sometimes that take a long time to work out. We try \nour best and we have our debates. We go back and forth, but we could \nnot do our job without all of these wonderful people. They do make the \nSenate a wonderful place in which to work. It is 20 years that I have \nspent here. I never would have imagined in my younger life I would have \nhad such an opportunity or an honor to serve my constituents in Iowa, \nindeed all of the people in this country, as a Senator. All of you who \nwork and labor here do not get much glory. Nobody ever writes about you \nand you probably do not get on television, you do not get to speak on \nthe Senate floor like we do, but we could never do our job without you. \nI want you to know I appreciate each and every one of you, Republican, \nDemocrat, and those of you who do not have a party who are here in a \nnonpartisan capacity. You do make this place function well, and I thank \nyou for it. I thank you for letting us do our job on the weekend.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be delighted to yield to my leader. I paid homage \nto him earlier and I will pay it again most respectfully. I cannot say \nenough good things about Senator Reid's strength and character, about \nhis own personal attributes of honesty and forthrightness. When Senator \nReid gives his word, go to the bank. One does not have to worry about \nit.\n  He has a tough job. He has to deal with us and then he has to deal \nwith the other side and try to work out these agreements. These are \nvery tough negotiations. I could not ask for a better friend, a better \nperson, to negotiate and work things out and get these compromises \nmade. I could not ask for a better friend and a better person to do it \nthan Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, I \nhave a State that is rapidly growing. It has, as you know, the tourism \ninterests and the mining, and we have some ranching. There is limited \nagriculture, but we have some. But the State of Iowa is agricultural \nbased. It is hard for a lot of us who come from big cities to \nunderstand. Nevada is the most urban State in the Union, with Las Vegas \nand Reno making up about 90 percent of the population. So it is hard \nfor a lot of us to understand the passion that someone like Tom Harkin \nhas for farming and farmers. It is hard for me to understand that. But \nI have come to learn the passion and the depth of feeling that the \njunior Senator from Iowa has about farmers and farming--agricultural \nmatters.\n  I hope the people of Iowa have some understanding, which I know they \ndo, about how you fight for farmers, family farmers. I have learned a \nlot about family farmers because of listening to the Senator talk. It \nis not only listening to him talk, it is how he talks. I think it is so \ngood that we have in this body people like Tom Harkin, who believe in \nsomething, who have a knowledge of agriculture, but not only is it a \nbroad-brush knowing a lot about agriculture, you care about the people \nwho are involved in it.\n  What we have gone through in the last few days--and when I say gone \nthrough, as I told Senator Harkin as I was going home last night, I had \na Harkin headache--I feel good being one of 100 here and knowing that I \nserve with people like Tom Harkin who believes so deeply in a subject. \nNot only does he express, personally, his feelings, he wants everyone \nhere to know.\n  When the history books are written about agriculture and what has \nhappened legislatively with agriculture, Tom Harkin's chapter in that \nbook will be in bold print.\n  I don't know much about this program that Senator Harkin feels so \nstrongly about, but I was there when he got it done. And I know how \ngood he felt about having accomplished this farming conservation. I \nhave some understanding of what it is but not the knowledge that \nSenator Harkin has--how he felt about this. When this was accomplished, \nit was like somebody hit a home run. I have had some legislative \nvictories and I know how good it feels. And I know how bad it feels \nwhen someone tries to take that away from you. That is what has \nhappened here, a legislative victory that is significantly important to \nthe farmers of this country, in Tom Harkin's mind. He proved to me that \npeople were trying to take that away from him. And by taking it away \nfrom him, they were taking it away from American farmers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That's right.\n  Mr. REID. So I say to my friend, Senator Harkin, thank you very much \nfor being a believer, for being a believer in something that is \nimportant to this country, family farms.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend. I thank my friend for those very kind \nand overly generous words. I again say to Senator Reid, you do me a \ngreat honor. I don't think there is any higher honor than to have \nsomeone that you respect and that you admire say those kinds of things. \nI hope the Senator from Nevada understands the depth of my feeling \nabout him personally--personally and professionally. Personally, as \njust a good, decent, wonderful human being, someone who cares deeply \nabout people and making our Government work for people, making sure \nthat people have the same kind of opportunities we had when we were \nkids.\n  A young kid from Searchlight, NV, and a young kid from Cumming, IA, \nknowing what our parents were like, poor--we see the two things we have \nin common. We were both born in small houses in small towns to poor \nparents. But we had a country that gave us an opportunity.\n  I know the Senator feels very deeply that he wants to pass on to his \nkids, and his grandkids, a country that gives them the same kind of \nopportunities the country gave us; for the Harry Reids of today who are \nborn in some little house in some unknown town someplace out in the \nmiddle of nowhere, that they, too, have the same opportunity that this \nHarry Reid had to succeed in America.\n  That is the kind of America I know the Senator wants to leave. That \nis why I admire him so much. He is just a great human being.\n  I am glad you are our assistant minority leader, hopefully our \nassistant majority leader in the next term.\n  I thank you for those kind words, and thanks for your words on behalf \nof our farmers. We couldn't have gotten where we are without your great \nhelp and your great leadership. Even though you may not have a lot of \nfarmers in Nevada, you have a lot of farmers who are your friends from \nIowa, the Midwest, Ohio, and everywhere else.\n  I thank you for that very much.\n  Mr. President, I understand I have some time tomorrow to speak \nfurther on the issue. I will at this time yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a \nperiod of morning business with Senators speaking for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, during my years in public service I have \nlearned a great deal about the severe effects of hunger in our Nation \nand around the world. My passion for this issue has significantly grown \nover time, so much so that I chose the topic as the focus of my maiden \nspeech in the Senate. My hope is to shine a light on the devastating \nplague of malnourishment and severe hunger in our country and around \nthe world.\n  October 16 is World Food Day, which was established 25 years ago by \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Since its \ninception, the day has been recognized annually in more than 150 \ncountries and I am proud to share my support today.\n  In truth, hunger affects millions of individuals across the globe. I \nknow this to be true from my previous years of public service and my \ntime at the Red Cross where I saw first hand the devastation of hunger. \nThat is why I have made it a mission to fight this battle not only in \nour country, where I believe we can have a hunger free America, but \naround the world, where the issues of hunger so often become a useful \nstrategy in developing relations with other governments and their \npeople.\n  As a leader in agricultural production, the United States has long \nrecognized its responsibility to assist in alleviating world hunger \nthrough food donations, financial aid, and technical assistance. As \nmany of you know, the United States, the world's leading provider of \nfood assistance, began providing food aid in the 1920s. That is why I \nam involved in the McGovern-Dole program which builds off of this \nimportant and proud tradition.\n  The McGovern-Dole program was named in honor of two former U.S. \nSenators, Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, who worked tirelessly \non behalf of U.S. school feeding, and more recently, for a global food \nfor education program. The major objectives of the program are to \nreduce hunger and improve literacy and access to primary education, \nespecially for girls.\n  The focus is on low-income countries striving to ensure an education \nfor all children. The World Food Program estimates that there are more \nthan 300 million chronically hungry school-age children in poor \ncountries. Of these, perhaps 170 million go off to school hungry. \nAnother 130 million children--60 percent of them girls--do not attend \nschool.\n  An estimated 2.2 million beneficiaries received meals and take home \nrations under the fiscal year 2003 program, which is still ongoing in \nsome countries. These resources, together with the $50 million Congress \nappropriated for the fiscal year 2004 program are reaching an \nadditional 1.5 million beneficiaries. Given the program's success and \nhigh demand, the Bush administration requested an increase above the \n2004 funding levels for fiscal year 2005, which I supported. After \nworking with the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am proud to report \nthat the bill voted out of committee includes a 50-percent increase \nabove the fiscal year 2004 levels, bringing the fiscal year 2005 \nfunding levels for McGovern-Dole to $100 million.\n  Reducing hunger and improving literacy are global challenges, and \nmeeting those challenges will require a global effort. We have \nexperienced some marked successes in our efforts to involve other \ndonors in helping achieve our goal of global school feeding and the \nMcGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition \nProgram has made a positive contribution to those efforts to combat \nhunger and illiteracy.\n  It is my belief that this program will do more than just feed those \nin desperate need of food and improve the nutrition of children. It \nwill bring hope and opportunity through education to some of the \nworld's poorest children, improving their future and making the world a \nsafer place for all of us.\n  Mr. President, on World Food Day, I congratulate those who are \nfighting the battle to end hunger, and ask my fellow Americans to stand \nwith me in this vital and important effort.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, like all of my colleagues I have been \nwatching the presidential campaign with great interest, and I have \nnoticed that the Democratic nominee has been making comments, \nparticularly in the Midwest, which can not be reconciled with his \nrecord here in the Senate.\n  The Democratic nominee says coal should play an important role in \nAmerica's energy future. He wants to ``forge new ways to draw cleaner \npower from coal.'' But his record tells a different story--his votes \nand policies are aggressively anti-coal. On every issue of importance \nto coal and coal miners, he has sided with environmental extremists, \nwho, like the Democratic nominee, view coal as a ``dirty energy \nsource'' that must be eradicated.\n  Last year, the Democratic nominee voted for the Climate Stewardship \nAct, S. 139, a bill very similar to the Kyoto Protocol, which would \ndestroy the coal industry. Unions for Jobs and the Environment, a group \nthat includes the United Mine Workers, called S. 139 ``a bad idea,'' \nand believe that passage of S. 139 ``would be tantamount to adoption of \nthe Kyoto Protocol.''\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, the bill causes \nsteep declines in coal use and production and eliminates thousands of \ncoal jobs. S. 139 would: cut coal-fired electricity by 80 percent; cut \nbituminous coal production by 69 percent; destroy 56,000 coal industry \njobs; and cause existing coal plants in West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, \nand Pennsylvania to shut down. ``In the S.139 case, a large proportion \nof existing coal capacity is projected to be retired. It is simply not \neconomical to continue operating these plants.''\n  Along with running mate John Edwards, the Democratic nominee is a \ncosponsor of the Clean Power Act. This legislation would impose heavy \nburdens on coal, forcing many plants to switch to natural gas or shut \ndown.\n  This bill is so hostile to coal that the Ohio legislature, by an \noverwhelming bipartisan margin, passed a resolution condemning it. The \nresolution states:\n\n       The carbon dioxide emissions cap in the bill needlessly \n     eliminates a significant component of electric generation in \n     the United States by effectively removing coal as a fuel \n     source. The bill will cause electric utilities to switch from \n     coal to natural gas because the electric utilities would no \n     longer have the option to economically generate electricity \n     from coal. . .\n\n  The United Mine Workers, the Utility Workers, the Boilermakers, and \nother labor unions oppose the bill. In testimony before the committee I \nchair, the Environment and Public Works Committee, Eugene Trisko of the \nUnited Mine Workers stated:\n\n       The union is strongly opposed to efforts to use the Clean \n     Air Act as a vehicle for regulating greenhouse gas emissions \n     . . . Limits on carbon emissions would require switching from \n     coal to natural gas or other higher-cost energy sources, with \n     potentially devastating impacts on the economies of coal-\n     producing states.\n\n  Further, according to independent analysis, the bill: cuts coal-fired \nelectric generation by 55 percent and coal production by 50 percent, \nEIA analysis of the Clean Power Act; destroys 32,000 coal jobs; and \nforces many coal-fired power plants to shut down, ``resulting in \nsubstantial economic impacts.''\n  The Democratic nominee has routinely criticized President Bush for \nrejecting Kyoto. As he said last year, ``Instead of renegotiating the \nKyoto Treaty to improve it, he simply repudiated it.'' And the Vice \nPresidential nominee, when asked in February by the San Francisco \nChronicle whether he would support Kyoto, responded with a direct, \n``Yes,'' and said his running mate agreed with him.\n  The Democratic nominee says the U.S. should ``reengage with the \ninternational community'' to forge a new global warming agreement, but \nthe question remains: What would the agreement look like? And how could \nany agreement calling for strict reductions in C02 emissions \nnot harm coal?\n  Now they say they oppose Kyoto, describing its timetables and \nmandates\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nas ``infeasible.'' ``The Democratic nominees believe that the Kyoto \nProtocol is not the answer. The near-term emission reductions it would \nrequire of the United States are infeasible, while the long-term \nobligations imposed on all nations are too little to solve the \nproblem.''\n  But the Democratic nominee's environmental group supporters know \nwhere he stands on Kyoto. ``We don't have doubts that this issue is at \nthe top of his to-do list when elected, or his re-do list,'' said Betsy \nLoyless of the League of Conservation Voters, which endorsed him for \npresident. Saying, ``there is no doubt in our mind that he will re-\nengage in Kyoto.''\n  Further, the Democratic nominee tried to save Kyoto in 2000 during \nnegotiations with the EU. Quoting from a UPI article at the time:\n\n       Instead, one senator who accompanied him to Vietnam, John \n     Kerry (D-MA), entered the fray. Senator Kerry, an aggressive \n     promoter of the United States, was ubiquitously huddled over \n     notepads and scribbling aides, attempting to develop U.S. \n     offers on certain mechanisms that its counterparts would \n     accept.\n  Not only did he try to save Kyoto, but he opposed efforts by the \nClinton administration to ease U.S. compliance with the treaty. \nAccording to an AP article:\n\n       U.S. Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been \n     involved in environmental legislation, said he also had \n     problems with the U.S. position. Instead of cutting its \n     emissions by 7 percent as agreed at Kyoto, he said, the sinks \n     proposal would allow the United States to pump at least 1 \n     percent more greenhouse gases than it did in 1990. ``Some \n     sinks clearly must be counted, but they should be in line \n     with the spirit of the Kyoto agreement,'' he said. ``Any \n     retrenchment diminishes our credibility on other proposals'' \n     and raises ``understandable suspicion that they are mere \n     loopholes.''\n\n  According to a Grist Magazine article this year:\n\n       The Democratic nominee is no casual Kyoto detractor--he has \n     attended a number of Kyoto conferences over the years and \n     tried to push negotiations forward, and he has a long record \n     of consistently voting in favor of policy measures to curb \n     global warming, from stricter CAFE standards to mandatory \n     greenhouse-gas regulations.\n\n  I want everyone to understand, Kyoto would eliminate coal use. \n``Under the Kyoto Protocol, coal consumption would be phased out over \nthe period 2010 to 2020. The result would be massive dislocations in \ncoal producing areas. . .''\n  Kyoto would eliminate nearly 50,000 jobs in Ohio; 40,000 jobs in \nPennsylvania; and 22,000 jobs in Michigan.\n  Kyoto would be disastrous for West Virginia coal. According to a \nstudy by West Virginia University, Kyoto would cause a 25.5 percent \ndecline in coal mining; destroy 42,800 jobs; reduce state GDP by over \n$3 billion; and reduce per capita income by $393.\n  The West Virginia and Ohio legislatures passed resolutions rejecting \nKyoto and preventing State agencies from implementing any part of the \ntreaty.\n  According to his website, the Democratic nominee says he will spend \n$10 billion over the next decade on clean coal technologies. But as the \nabove demonstrates, you can't have clean coal without coal. Moreover, \nhis policies would obstruct installation of clean coal technologies, \nplacing further burdens on the industry in meeting new Clean Air Act \nrequirements.\n  The Democratic nominee opposes President Bush's New Source Review \nreforms that allow utilities to upgrade their facilities with clean, \nenergy efficient technologies, avoiding the complex, burdensome, and \nenvironmentally counterproductive permitting process unleashed by the \nClinton EPA.\n  He supports lawsuits filed by environmental groups now blocking \nPresident Bush's NSR reforms.\n  He even joined in the junior Senator from New York's anti-NSR reform \nlegal brief.\n  He voted last year for his running mate's amendment to delay \nPresident Bush's reforms and vows to ``immediately reverse the Bush-\nCheney rollbacks of the Nation's Clean Air Program.''\n  Most critically, returning to the Clinton NSR program would thwart \ninstallation of clean coal technologies. According to the National Coal \nCouncil, uncertainty over the Clinton NSR policy ``has had a direct and \nchilling effect on all maintenance and efficiency improvements and \nclean coal technology installations at existing power plants.''\n  The Democratic nominee also missed the vote on last year's energy \nbill, and later said that had he been present, he would have voted \nagainst it. Yet the bill included several provisions and substantial \nfunding for clean coal technologies: Authorizes $200 million annually \nfor fiscal years 2004 through 2012 for clean coal research and coal-\nbased gasification technologies; authorizes funding to the Secretary of \nEnergy for loans, and authorizes the Secretary to make loan guarantees \nfor a variety of clean coal projects around the country; directs the \nSecretary of Energy to carry out a program to facilitate production and \ngeneration of coal-based power and the installation of pollution-\ncontrol equipment; and creates an investment tax credit for facilities \nretrofitted, repowered or replaced with clean coal technology.\n  ``Where we see a beautiful mountaintop, George Bush sees a strip \nmine.'' This is the Democratic nominee's view of mountaintop mining, \nwhich employs 15,000 people and provides $21.8 million in revenue for \neducation in West Virginia, according to a study by Marshall \nUniversity.\n  In 1999, he voted against the senior Senator from West Virginia's \namendment to overturn a Federal court decision that threatened to end \nmountaintop mining in West Virginia.\n  According to the senior Senator from West Virginia said the goal of \nhis amendment was ``to allow for the continuation of our coal industry \nand the jobs it provides while better protecting the mountains and \nhollows of the state we love.''\n  I would point out that the United Mine Workers of America strongly \nsupported the amendment.\n  He even joined forces with then Vice President Al Gore, who, after \ninitially supporting the amendment, threatened to veto any \nappropriations bill that included it.\n  A recent Federal court decision, issued by U.S. District Judge Joseph \nGoodwin a Clinton appointee, halted 11 mountaintop mining projects in \nsouthern West Virginia. The economic impacts, according to West \nVirginia economists, could be devastating. The question is: where does \nthe Democratic nominee stand on this decision?\n  Economist Michael Hicks and Cal Kent, former dean of Marshall \nUniversity's business college, said the ruling could slow the \npermitting process for mountaintop mining by 2 years, resulting in a 40 \npercent decline in coal production.\n  ``That decline the economists predicted, could lead to layoffs, \nstunted investment in West Virginia--particularly in the southern \nCoalfields region--and less revenue for the state. And the impact could \nbe felt as soon as this fiscal year,'' they said.\n  The Democratic nominee has a unique view of the Clean Air Act. \nAccording to him, when the act was passed in 1970, there was a \nconsensus that existing coal-fired power plants had a remaining life-\nspan of 10 to 15 years. Beyond that time, according to this view, they \nwould be forced to install costly new pollution controls or simply shut \ndown.\n  Nearly 46 percent of coal-fired capacity in Ohio was built before \n1970. In West Virginia, nearly one-third of capacity was built prior to \n1970. Additionally, over 75 percent of coal-fired capacity in Ohio and \nWest Virginia was built between 1970 and 1974.\n  According to the Democratic nominee, these plants must install \nexorbitantly expensive pollution controls, which would force many \nplants to close, or simply shut down altogether, causing massive \neconomic dislocations, job losses, and higher energy costs in Ohio and \nWest Virginia.\n  According to the NSR legal brief, which the Democratic nominee \njoined, the Clean Air Act ``created a limited and qualified grace \nperiod within which existing plants could continue to operate. \nAccordingly, the 1970 CAA set up a simple choice for existing sources: \neither upgrade to new source standards or shut down.''\n  In conclusion, Kerry-Edwards is the most anti-coal presidential \nticket in American history. Yes, even worse than Clinton-Gore.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11089-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11089-S11090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n                          JUSTICE FOR ALL ACT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate \nfor its actions yesterday in passing the Justice for All Act of 2004, \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation I sponsored along with Senator Hatch \nand others. And I commend the other body for swiftly acting in passing \nthe same legislation last evening. I hope the bill will now be signed \ninto law without delay. This is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation I have ever introduced and one of the most important things \nthe Senate will consider during the 108th Congress.\n  As I have said many times, DNA has become the guilty man's worst \nenemy and the innocent man's best friend. It is a two-edged sword which \nwe must use to both put criminals behind bars and exonerate anyone who \nhas been wrongfully convicted. I started looking at the issue of \nimproved prosecution of sexual assault crimes almost two decades ago \nwhen I began drafting the Violence Against Women Act. This legislation \nis the next step, a way to connect the dots between the extraordinary \nstrides in DNA technology and my commitment to ending violence against \nwomen. We must ensure that justice delayed is not justice denied.\n  For 3 years now, I have called on Congress to enact this important \nlegislation. In 2002, I introduced with Senator Specter, S. 2513, the \nDNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2002. That Senate unanimously passed \nthat bill during the 107th Congress, but the House failed to act. That \nbill grew out of a series of hearing I chaired in the Judiciary \nCommittee which focused on the crisis involving untested rape kits \nsitting in police evidence bins around the country, each one containing \nthe key to solving a sexual assault crime and putting a rapist behind \nbars. My hearings included testimony estimating that there were 300,000 \nto 500,000 untested rape kits nationwide.\n  In some of the most moving testimony I have heard in my 32 years in \nthis body, we listened to Debbie Smith describe the horror of being the \nvictim of sexual assault, followed by an additional 6 years of terror \nwhile awaiting the apprehension of her rapist. As I will discuss in a \nmoment, the key to Debbie's road to recovery lay in an untested rape \nkit connected to her assault. Finally, that rape kit was tested, her \nassailant was identified and convicted, and she began to find closure.\n  In followup to the Senate's passage of S. 2513, I introduced at the \nstart of the 108th Congress with Senator Specter S. 152, the DNA Sexual \nAssault Justice Act of 2003. That legislation built upon S. 2513 from \nthe prior Congress and was again joined by over 20 bipartisan \ncosponsors. The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2003 provided the \nhundreds of millions of Federal dollars desperately needed by state and \nlocal crime labs around the country to clear out the backlog of \nhundreds of thousands of untested DNA evidence kits from sexual \nassaults and other violent crimes.\n  An important provision of S. 152 allowed the Justice Department to \nbring ``John Doe/DNA'' indictments against an unknown or unnamed \nperpetrator of sexual assault in any case where a DNA sample from the \nsuspect was recovered from a crime scene. This innovative procedure \nwould allow prosecutors to investigate and indict sex crimes, even \nwhere the victim could not identify her assailant, thus preventing the \nstatute of limitations from expiring before the perpetrator could be \nidentified and charged. My ``John Doe/DNA'' indictment provision became \nlaw in 2003 as part of the Protect Act/Amber Alert Act, S. 151/H.R. \n1104.\n  Last year, Senator Hatch and I introduced S. 1700, the Advancing \nJustice Through DNA Technology Act of 2003, which contained most of the \nkey elements of S. 152. We were joined by Senators Specter, Leahy, \nDeWine and Feinstein and dozens of other cosponsors in this \nlegislation. For the last year, disagreements over a specific title of \nS. 1700, the Innocence Protection Act, held up consideration of the \nbill. Members from both sides of the aisle were supportive of my DNA \nSexual Assault Justice Act, which was included in other titles of the \nbill. I am pleased that we finally reached a compromise on the very \nimportant title addressing post-conviction DNA testing, which cleared \nthe way to consider the entire bill. We have also added into the \nlegislation important victims' right provisions, resulting in the newly \nnamed Justice for All Act of 2004.\n  The bill we passed yesterday, a combination of the Advancing Justice \nThrough DNA Technology and the victims' rights legislation, harnesses \nthe power of DNA to give prompt justice to victims of sexual assault \ncrimes and to free the wrongly convicted. This bill takes every \ncomponent of DNA technology and makes it accessible and more useful to \nFederal, State and local law enforcement, to prosecutors and defense \nattorneys, to medical personnel and to victims of crime.\n  Promoting and supporting DNA technology as a crime-fighting tool is \nnot a new endeavor for me. A provision of my 1994 Crime Bill created \nthe Combined DNA Index System, CODIS, which is an electronic database \nof DNA profiles, much like the FBI's fingerprint database. CODIS \nincludes two kinds of DNA information--convicted offender DNA samples \nand DNA from crime scenes. CODIS uses the two indexes to generate \ninvestigative leads in crimes where biological evidence is recovered \nfrom the scene. In essence, CODIS facilitates the DNA match. And once \nthat match is made, a crime is solved because of the incredible \naccuracy and durability of DNA evidence.\n  Mr. President, 99.9 percent--that is how accurate DNA evidence is. \nMr. President, 1 in 30 billion--those are the odds someone else \ncommitted a crime if a suspect's DNA matches evidence at the crime \nscene. Twenty or 30 years--that is how long DNA evidence from a crime \nscene lasts. Just ten years ago DNA analysis of evidence could have \ncost thousands of dollars and taken months; now testing one sample \ncosts $40 and can take days. Ten years ago forensic scientists needed \nblood the size of a bottle cap, now DNA testing can be done on a sample \nthe size of a pinhead. The changes in DNA technology are remarkable, \nand mark a sea change in how we can fight crime, particularly sexual \nassault crimes.\n  The FBI reports that since 1998 the national DNA database has helped \nput away violent criminals in over 9,000 investigations in 50 states. \nHow? By matching the DNA crime evidence to the DNA profiles of \noffenders. Individual success stories of DNA ``cold hits'' in sexual \nassault cases make these numbers all too real. During just the last \nseveral months, DNA evidence pinpointed a suspect in 3 rapes in Miami, \nFlorida, caused a man to be charged in a 20-year-old Missouri rape \ncase, proved critical in convicting a New York man accused of \ncommitting 9 rapes over a decade, helped charge a man in a 28-year-old \nSan Francisco rape and homicide case, and resulted in the charges \nagainst a Virginia man in a 23-year-old rape case. All across this \ncountry, rapists and murderers are getting caught for crimes which are \noften years or even decades old. Crime solved, streets safer.\n  Undoubtedly, DNA matching by comparing evidence gathered at the crime \nscene with offender samples entered on the national DNA database has \nproven to be the deciding factor in solving stranger sexual assault \ncases--it has revolutionized the criminal justice system, and brought \nclosure and justice for victims. A laboratory expert testified that \nVirginia has a 48 percent hit rate because the State collects samples \nfrom all convicted felons and aggressively analyzes crime scene \nevidence with no backlog. This means that almost 1 out of every 2 \nviolent crimes could be solved by the national DNA database.\n  In light of the past successes and the future potential of DNA \nevidence, the reported number of untested rape kits and other crime \nscene evidence waiting in police warehouses are simply shocking--the \nJustice Department recently estimated the number to be as many as \n500,000. One woman in particular has reminded State and Federal \nlawmakers that we cannot ignore even one rape kit sitting on a shelf \ngathering dust. That woman is Debbie Smith. In 1989, Mrs. Smith was \ntaken from her home and brutally raped. There were no known suspects, \nand Mrs. Smith lived in fear of her attacker's return. Six years later, \nthe Virginia crime laboratory discovered a DNA match between the rape \nscene evidence and a state prisoner's DNA sample. That ``cold hit'' \ngave Mrs. Smith her first moment of real security and closure, and \nsince then she has traveled the country to\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\nadvocate on behalf of assault victims and champion the use of DNA to \nfight sexual assault.\n  The bill approved yesterday provides over $755 million over 5 years \nto eliminate the backlog in rape kits and other crime scene evidence, \neliminate the backlog of convicted offender samples awaiting DNA \ntesting, and improve state laboratory capacity to conduct DNA testing. \nI am pleased that the backlog elimination grant program in this \nlegislation is entitled, ``The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grants.'' It is \na fitting tribute.\n  The Justice for All Act of 2004 is a natural extension to the \nViolence Against Women Act, which required the Attorney General to \nevaluate and recommend standards for training and practice for licensed \nhealth care professionals performing sexual assault forensic exams. So \nI knew that any DNA bill aimed at ending sexual assault must include \nresources for sexual forensic examiners. This bill provides \n$500 million in training grants to help ensure that nurses, police and \nparamedics know how to best collect and preserve DNA evidence in sexual \nassault cases, and to help local law enforcement agencies put the DNA \nprofiles of convicted felons into state and national databases.\n\n  The bill also expands the CODIS database by mandating the inclusion \nof DNA samples from all convicted federal felons, and by permitting \nstates to include the DNA samples from suspects arrested for and \ncharged with a crime. At the same time, our bill retains important \nprovisions to expunge DNA samples from the database for those whose \nconvictions are overturned or against whom criminal charges are \ndropped. The bill also contains tough new penalties for the improper \nuse or disclosure of DNA samples.\n  Today's bill also makes two small, but important, amendments to the \nViolence Against Women Act. First, it amends the law to include legal \nassistance for victims of dating violence, and it amends the \neligibility criteria for discretionary programs so that tribal domestic \nviolence and sexual assault coalitions can directly receive grants \nfunds, including those funds unreleased from past fiscal years.\n  I am also gratified that this legislation includes the Innocence \nProtection Act, which I cosponsored last Congress with Senator Leahy. \nThis section will immeasurably improve the administration of justice in \nour legal system, particularly where justice is most important, and \nwhere we can least afford to make mistakes--imposition of the death \npenalty. Those who support the death penalty also have a duty to ensure \nthat it is fairly administered. The advent of DNA testing has provided \nus with a wealth of opportunities to make certain that we are \nprosecuting the right people. This legislation makes post-conviction \ntesting to federal inmates who assert that they did not commit the \ncrime for which they have been imprisoned. It also incentivizes States \nto take similar measures to ensure that individuals have a proper \nopportunity to prove their innocence. It also mandates proper \npreservation of DNA evidence so that the DNA can be tested if \nappropriate.\n  As for competent counsel in death penalty cases, nobody can look me \nin the eye and tell me that our system for representation in capital \ncases works as it should. This bill will take a big step toward fixing \nthat by providing money for grants to States to improve their systems \nof representation, on both the prosecution and defense side, in capital \ncases.\n  In closing, I would be remiss if I did not pause to thank some of the \nmany people who have helped bring about the introduction of this bill. \nIn particular, I wish to thank Senator Hatch, the chairman the \nJudiciary Committee, for devoting so much time and effort to work with \nme in developing this legislation, along with his chief counsel Bruce \nArtim and his counsels Brett Tolman and Mike Volkov. I also commend \nSenator Leahy, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, and \nhis chief counsel Bruce Cohen and senior counsel Julie Katzman, who \nhave worked tirelessly on this bill, and is the principal sponsor of \nthe Innocence Protection Act. I also thank our other principal Senate \nsponsors, including Senator Specter and his chief counsel David Brog; \nSenator DeWine, and his counsel Rob Steinbuch; and Senator Feinstein \nand her chief counsel David Hantman.\n\n  I also commend our colleagues in the other body who led the fight in \nthe House of Representatives to enact this important legislation. Their \nefforts were instrumental in achieving the final bill both bodies \npassed yesterday. Specifically, I commend Representative Sensenbrenner, \nthe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his staff, including \nPhil Kiko, Jay Apperson, and Katy Crooks. I also thank Ranking Member \nConyers and his staff, including Perry Applebaum and Bobby Vassar. I \nalso thank Representative Delahunt for his leadership, and his counsels \nMark Agrast and Christine Leonard.\n  Finally, I thank my own staff who have worked diligently over the \nlast 3 years to pass this important legislation, including Louisa \nTerrell, Jonathan Meyer, and Neil MacBride.\n  Mr. President, yesterday's action by Congress were a long time \ncoming, and I join my cosponsors in thanking our colleagues for passing \nthis legislation. I now hope the President will quickly sign this bill \ninto law, so that we can finally tackle the untested rape kits and \nstart bringing hope and closure to victims of sexual assault.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11090-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n             Jeffords):\n       S. 2974.

A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food \nand Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts; considered and passed.\n  Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Smoking Prevention \n     and Tobacco Control Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 6,500,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 2,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2001, the tobacco industry spent more than \n     $11,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\n     restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco \n     products contained in such regulations will lead to a \n     significant decrease in the number of minors using and \n     becoming addicted to those products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 458\n\n       Whereas the Ansari X Prize was established with private \n     capital to jumpstart the space tourism industry, inspire and \n     educate students, focus public attention and investment \n     capital on this new business frontier, and challenge \n     explorers and rocket scientists around the world;\n       Whereas the $10,000,000 Ansari X Prize was modeled after \n     the $25,000 Orteig Prize won by trans-Atlantic aviator \n     Charles Lindbergh in 1927;\n       Whereas on October 4, 2004, SpaceShipOne, designed by Burt \n     Rutan and flown first by Mike Melvill and later by Brian \n     Binnie, won the Ansari X Prize by being the first privately \n     funded space vehicle to depart from and safely return to \n     Earth twice within 2 weeks;\n       Whereas SpaceShipOne broke the previous record for maximum \n     altitude achieved by a plane, which was set by the X-15 in \n     1963;\n       Whereas the SpaceShipOne flights represent a historic \n     accomplishment for humanity; and\n       Whereas future achievements in commercial space flight will \n     be stimulated by an ongoing annual competition for an X Prize \n     Cup, beginning in 2006 at White Sands Missile Range outside \n     Las Cruces, New Mexico: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the SpaceShipOne team led by Bert Rutan, \n     and test pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, for their \n     historic achievement in human space flight;\n       (2) recognizes the contributions of all members and \n     supporters of the X Prize Foundation and the SpaceShipOne \n     team, the efforts of which were instrumental in this \n     accomplishment; and\n       (3) encourages the continuation of efforts towards \n     practical commercial space flight through future X Prize Cup \n     and other competitions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 459--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2004 AS ``AMERICAN MUSIC \n   MONTH'' TO CELEBRATE AND HONOR MUSIC PERFORMANCE, EDUCATION, AND \n                    SCHOLARSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 459\n\n       Whereas the music of the United States embodies the \n     artistic reflection of the country's history and heritage and \n     the promise of its ideals and values;\n       Whereas the music of the United States transcends culture, \n     gender, race, class, and creed, and thrives freely as it is \n     continually reinvented, rearranged, transformed, and infused \n     by the personal experiences of men and women;\n       Whereas the music of the United States expresses the \n     country's vital cultural and social identities and empowers \n     the people of the United States to assert and preserve our \n     pasts for a future, transforms the wondrous and harsh \n     experiences of the people of the United States into potent \n     messages that freely declare democratic choice and freedom of \n     expression, inspires social justice, enlivens collective \n     action, and reflects our Nation's dynamic social movements;\n       Whereas the National Federation of Music Clubs (NFMC) and \n     its 17th president, Ada Holding Miller, building on their \n     efforts to create American Music week in 1924 with the aid of \n     Arthur Bodansky, conductor of the Metropolitan Opera, and \n     Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony \n     Orchestra, established ``American Music Month'' and the \n     ``Parade of American Music'' in February 1955 to recognize \n     music and its importance to the social, cultural, historical, \n     and educational development of the United States;\n       Whereas by action of the NFMC Board of Directors in 1998, \n     the celebration of ``American Music Month'' was changed to \n     the month of November in 1999 at the request of Sonneck \n     Society for American Music;\n       Whereas the leading arts and education organizations of the \n     United States, such as the Society for American Music, MENC: \n     the National Association for Music Education, the College \n     Music Society, the Music Library Association, the American \n     Musicological Society, and Americans for the Arts, continue \n     to strive to stimulate the appreciation, performance, \n     creation, and study of music in the United States;\n       Whereas the month of November has witnessed the births of \n     such artistic legends as Scott Joplin (1868), William \n     Christopher ``W. C.'' Handy (1873), Aaron Copland (1900), \n     Coleman Hawkins (1904), and Mary Travers (1937) of the folk \n     song trio Peter, Paul and Mary; the premiers of the New York \n     Symphony (1878), the Philadelphia Orchestra (1900), Jerome \n     Kern's musical, Show Boat, in Washington, DC (1927), Frede \n     Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite in Chicago (1931), and the first \n     broadcast of the newly-organized National Broadcasting \n     Company (1926);\n       Whereas November 2004 marks the sesquicentennial of John \n     Philip Sousa's birth on November 6, 1854, and is an occasion \n     to celebrate his monumental contributions to the musical \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas John Philip Sousa's music continues to embody the \n     unflagging spirit of the United States and, as a product of a \n     renaissance in the art and technology of the United States, \n     affirmed the previous generation's contagious patriotism and \n     profound love of country even as they witnessed the \n     brutalities of a Nation at war; his music was a fanfare about \n     and for all men and women of this United States and his \n     rousing melodies celebrated the best and worst of the diverse \n     cultures and emerging histories of the United States; even \n     today, Sousa's music conveys our Nation's indomitable spirit \n     to the world; and\n       Whereas John Philip Sousa, as Director of the United States \n     Marine Band from 1880 to 1892, brought ``The President's \n     Own'' to unprecedented levels of excellence and shaped the \n     band into a world-famous musical organization, and through \n     White House performances, public concerts, and national \n     tours, the Band continues to maintain Sousa's standard of \n     excellence for the performance of the music of the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 2004 as ``American Music Month'' to \n     celebrate music performance, education, and scholarship in \n     the United States;\n       (2) recognizes that the musical heritage of the United \n     States should be honored, celebrated, and preserved for \n     future generations as expressions of this country's \n     democratic freedoms and indomitable spirit; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe ``American \n     Music Month'' with appropriate ceremonies and programs to \n     honor the contributions of the music educators, performers, \n     scholars, conductors, composers and arrangers, librarians, \n     archivists, and curators of the United States for their \n     tireless efforts to foster greater understanding and \n     preservation of the diverse music and cultures of the United \n     States through active performance, education, and cultural \n     engagement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 460--HONORING THE YOUNG VICTIMS OF THE SIXTEENTH \nSTREET BAPTIST CHURCH BOMBING, RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE \n  OF THE TRAGIC EVENT, AND COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT \n  PERSONNEL TO BRING THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS CRIME TO JUSTICE ON THE \n                    OCCASION OF ITS 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Shelby) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 460\n\n       Whereas the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church of Birmingham, \n     Alabama, was constructed in 1911 and served as a center for \n     African-American life in the city and a rallying point for \n     the civil rights movement during the 1960s;\n       Whereas on Sunday, September 15, 1963, segregationists \n     protesting the mandatory integration of Birmingham's public \n     schools firebombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church;\n       Whereas the blast killed Addie Mae Collins, age 14, Denise \n     McNair, age 11, Carole Robertson, age 14, and Cynthia Wesley, \n     age 14, all members of the Church, while they were preparing \n     for Sunday service;\n       Whereas September 15, 1963, has been called the darkest day \n     in the history of Birmingham and one of the darkest days of \n     the entire civil rights movement;\n       Whereas this act of terrorism raised national and \n     international awareness of the African-American civil rights \n     struggle and galvanized those dedicated to the cause of civil \n     rights;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n     (Public Law 88-352, 78 Stat. 241) and the Voting Rights Act \n     of 1965 (Public Law 89-110, 79 Stat. 437) in the wake of the \n     bombing;\n       Whereas the 4 men suspected of the bombing, Bobby Frank \n     Cherry, Herman Cash, Thomas Blanton, and Robert Chambliss, \n     were not immediately prosecuted because authorities believed \n     it impossible to obtain a conviction in the heated racial \n     climate of the mid-1960s;\n       Whereas Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley successfully \n     prosecuted Robert Chambliss 13 years after the bombing;\n       Whereas after the indictment and conviction of Robert \n     Chambliss, the bombing investigation was closed;\n       Whereas the bombing investigation was reopened in 1995 due \n     to the efforts of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special \n     Agent Rob Langford and local African-American leaders;\n       Whereas in 2001 and 2002, a joint Federal and State task \n     force, under the supervision of United States Attorney \n     Douglas Jones and Alabama Attorney General William Pryor,\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\n     successfully prosecuted Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry \n     with the assistance of State and local law enforcement \n     personnel; and\n       Whereas the bombing, the prosecution of the offenders, and \n     the cause of civil rights in general have become national and \n     international concerns: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion of the 40th \n     anniversary of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist \n     Church of Birmingham, Alabama--\n       (1) honors the memory of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, \n     Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley;\n       (2) recognizes the historical significance of the bombing \n     and the enduring impact it has had on the cause of civil \n     rights everywhere; and\n       (3) commends the efforts of the Alabama Attorney General's \n     office for its successful prosecution of Robert Chambliss in \n     1977, the efforts of the joint Federal and State task force \n     for the successful prosecution of Bobby Frank Cherry and \n     Thomas Blanton in 2001 and 2002, and the efforts of all other \n     law enforcement personnel who worked to bring the persons \n     responsible for the bombing to justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 461--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING ON OCTOBER 17, \n              2004, AS ``NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Fitzgerald, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Biden, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lott, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nAlexander, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Levin, Mrs. \nDole, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Talent, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Bayh, \nMr. Allen, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 461\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the Nation;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week beginning October 17, 2004, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to--\n       (A) embrace the elements of character identified by local \n     schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, \n     and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 462--RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE \nPEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN SINCE THE EMERGENCY LOYA JIRGA WAS \n  HELD IN JUNE 2002 IN ESTABLISHING THE FOUNDATION AND MEANS TO HOLD \n               PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON OCTOBER 9, 2004\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Sununu, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

The world and the \n     United States stand with [the people of Afghanistan] as \n     partners in their quest for peace and prosperity and \n     stability and democracy.'';\n       Whereas the independent Joint Electoral Management Body in \n     Afghanistan and thousands of its staff throughout Afghanistan \n     have worked to register voters and organize a fair and \n     transparent election process despite violent and deadly \n     attacks on them and on the purpose of their work;\n       Whereas more than 10,500,000 Afghans have been reported \n     registered to vote, demonstrating great courage and a deep \n     desire to have a voice in the future of Afghanistan, and more \n     than 40 percent of those reported registered to vote are \n     women;\n       Whereas the presidential election campaign in Afghanistan \n     officially began on September 7, 2004 and 18 candidates, \n     including one woman, are seeking the presidency;\n       Whereas on October 9, 2004, the people of Afghanistan will \n     vote in the first direct presidential election, at the \n     national level, in Afghanistan's history at 5,000 polling \n     centers located throughout Afghanistan, as well as polling \n     centers in Pakistan and Iran;\n       Whereas the United States, the European Union, the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the \n     Asian Network for Free Elections will send monitors and \n     support teams to join the more than 4,000 domestic election \n     observers in Afghanistan for the presidential election;\n       Whereas the United States and many international partners \n     have provided technical assistance and financial support for \n     elections in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), \n     led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and \n     coalition forces will join the Afghan National Army and \n     police in Afghanistan to help provide security during the \n     presidential election: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States applauds the steadfast commitment of \n     the people of Afghanistan to achieve responsive and \n     responsible government through democracy;\n       (2) the United States strongly supports self-government and \n     the protection of human rights and freedom of conscience for \n     all men and women in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) the United States remains committed to a long-term \n     partnership with the people of Afghanistan and to a peaceful \n     future for Afghanistan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 463--AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING OF A REVISED EDITION OF \n                      THE SENATE RULES AND MANUAL\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be closing down \nfor the night. While we are waiting for some of the final paperwork to \nbe provided, I wanted to take this opportunity to speak to an important \nissue that affects all children today but also our seniors--an issue \nthat reflects to me a longstanding problem that we must address in this \nbody yet we failed to address it adequately thus far, although we have \nattempted on several occasions. It has to do with the influenza \nvaccine.\n  As we all know, this week Chiron, the company that makes the \ninfluenza vaccine, actually one of two companies licensed to sell the \nvaccine in the United States, announced 48 million doses could not be \nsent to the United States because of contamination problems.\n  I thought I would take a few minutes and put that in perspective \nbecause people say, Why don't we have more manufacturers? What happened \nto the U.S. manufacturing base?\n  A couple of facts: Influenza is a type of virus that kills 36,000 \nAmericans a year; about 100 people a day die from influenza, and about \none-half million people die worldwide.\n  This week, the influenza vaccine supply coming into the United States \nwas cut in half when the manufacturer Chiron announced it would not be \nable to produce those 48 million doses for the United States--seniors \nand Americans really of all ages--because some of it may have been \ncontaminated.\n  As I mentioned, Chiron is only one of two companies licensed to sell \nthe vaccine in the United States. As a result, as we all know, public \nservice announcements and other announcements\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\nof the Department of Health and Human Services asked healthy adults to \nforego getting flu shots this year. Up until that point in time, it \nencouraged everyone, in essence, to get flu shots.\n  We know it is quite benign, with very few side effects, and it has a \nreal therapeutic impact.\n  This change in policy is required because of the fall-off in the \nnumber of doses that are available. Before this week's announcement, we \nhad expected about 100 million doses ready for this year. Last year, it \nwas 87 million doses. We were going to have 100 million doses this \nyear. So it was appropriate planning but also only two companies are \nproducing here. One company had its supply contaminated and we find \nourselves in the current situation.\n  General background: We have had this discussion before. I am really \ngoing back and repeating something we have already done on the floor \nand debated on the floor about 8 months ago. So this is not new \ninformation, but it is worth people thinking about because it is a real \ncall to action. There are now only five major vaccine manufacturers \nworldwide that have production facilities in the United States. This is \nfor all vaccines. Only two, Merck and Wyeth, are U.S. companies.\n  The five large vaccine manufacturers are Aventis Pasteur, which \nproduces here in the United States and over in France; Merck produces \nhere in the United States; Chiron, which produces in Europe and in \nseveral places throughout Europe, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom; \nWyeth/Lederle, which produces here in the United States; and \nGlaxoSmithKline with production in Belgium.\n  There are some other manufacturers of much smaller scale around the \nworld, but it is hard to get a real good estimate of how many there \nare, especially with developing country manufacturers. But there are \nmainly five. That is for all vaccines.\n  If I focus just on the influenza vaccine, there are approximately a \ndozen manufacturers worldwide, if you put everybody together. Yet only \ntwo manufacturers of influenza vaccines are located in the United \nStates, Aventis Pasteur and MedImmune. Aventis also has a French-based \nmanufacturing plant, which I mentioned, but that vaccine is not \nlicensed here in the United States.\n\n  Chiron became a major player in the influenza market when it combined \nreally three other companies--bought three companies that were in the \nexisting influenza manufacturing business in the United Kingdom and in \nItaly and Germany.\n  None of the influenza vaccines in Italy or Germany are licensed in \nthe United States. The facility in Liverpool has a capacity of about 56 \nmillion doses a year, and almost all of that--90 percent--comes to the \nUnited States. The other player, MedImmune, is a new player and it has \nthat live vaccine nasal spray called FluMist. It was introduced last \nyear--quite revolutionary at the time. The company made slightly more \nthan 4 million doses last year but it only sold about 800,000. So it \nmade 4 million, only sold about 500,000 to 800,000, and now they will \nsay they will only have about 1 to 2 million doses in the market. The \nCDC says it is about 1.1 million doses.\n  That is all really one needs to know about the manufacturing base. \nThe whole point is, it is small and has gotten smaller and smaller over \ntime.\n  Why is that? That is really what I want to speak to because that is \nwhat I believe this body must act upon or otherwise it is not going to \nchange.\n  My point is, the manufacturing base has been weakened, devastated in \nthis country in part because of lawsuits. It is the same old story--\nfrivolous, unnecessary lawsuits, but these frivolous lawsuits are \ntolerated into many fields.\n  We talked about asbestos and medical liability on the floor. We \ntalked about class action lawsuits. But once again, it is lawsuits that \ncall out for tort reform because it drives companies from a \nmanufacturing base--from a score down to really two in the flu vaccine.\n  Our Nation's commitment to immunization: Why are vaccines so \nimportant? Our Nation's commitment has been one of the most effective \npublic health interventions in the history of medicine. Our country has \nbeen proactive, it has been aggressive, and it has been the world \nleader.\n  We have been able to reduce the incidence of a whole range of \ndisease, whether it is measles, mumps, or polio. I spoke earlier on the \nfloor today about the HIV/AIDS virus which killed 23 million people. We \ndon't have a vaccine for it. That little virus, which knows no borders. \nIt can't be smelled or felt. It just travels across the world. We need \na vaccine to eradicate it.\n  We did have smallpox. We eradicated smallpox which killed between 300 \nmillion and 500 million people in the 20th century alone--that little \nsmallpox virus.\n  However, because we had a vaccine, we killed it. We eradicated that \nvirus, which had killed between 300 million and 500 million. That is \nthe power of vaccines. They can and they do protect individuals. That \nis why we recommend them to not only individuals but entire \npopulations.\n  Now the overall safety record and frivolous lawsuits. This is not Dr. \nFrist trying to beat up on the trial lawyers. Frivolous lawsuits are a \nhuge problem. If there are all of these lawsuits, people must think \nthere is a huge safety problem; otherwise why sue everybody? The \noverall safety record of vaccines has been remarkable. That is why \ntoday, looking at the relative benefits and disadvantages, the balance \nis huge for the benefits, largely because the vaccines have not only \nworked but have been safe, again and again and again.\n  However, in spite of that safety, the escalating cost and the \ncontinuing threats of litigation, which drive the cost of those \nvaccines up and the manufacturers have to pay those huge premiums to be \nprotected, have become major disincentives to the production and \ndistribution of these products. It is obvious, if you are a \nmanufacturer today in America or wherever in the world--it is just that \nour legal system is much more aggressive than any country in the \nworld--if you were a manufacturer, why would you make a vaccine if you \nknow you will be sued even if the product is safe? The answer is \nobvious.\n  Indeed, during the past two decades, the number of manufacturers who \nmake vaccines for kids, for children, has dwindled from 12 down to 4. \nOnly two of the four manufacturers that make vaccines for children are \nin the United States of America. I contend and the data and the \nevidence is that a large part of that is because of the devastating \nimpact of these frivolous lawsuits. In fact, only two major \nmanufacturers of vaccines for children and adults are based in the \nUnited States, coupled with the fact that there are only five major \ncompanies worldwide for all vaccines.\n  There are significant barriers to entry into this market. Again, I am \naddressing primarily the high cost of lawsuits. Why do I say that? If \nyou look during the early and middle 1980s, litigation threatened to \ncripple our vaccine industry. Things got better for a while, but now, \nonce again, there is a whole new wave of lawsuits that seek to \ncircumvent a program that is called the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram, or VICP, a program that historically has been very successful, \nbut the lawsuits go around the program, they circumvent the program, \nand with that you had the huge settlements, huge potential threats to \nour manufacturing base. The impact today is on our children's well-\nbeing and on the well-being of all Americans, especially if we have a \nhuge influenza outbreak.\n  Why do I point my finger at the legal system, which is almost \nchaotic? We have the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which can \nwork very well, but it needs to be reformed so you do not have the \nfrivolous lawsuits going around it and going after the deep pockets. An \nexample, and I will just give one although there is a whole list of \nexamples--the overall worldwide vaccine market, every vaccine made \neverywhere in the world, is worth $6 billion. Yet just one class action \nlawsuit pending last year sought $30 billion in damages. That is one \nclass action lawsuit seeking $30 billion. The overall market, every \nvaccine in the world, is only valued at $6 billion. Why would any \nmanufacturer subject themselves to this potential liability? It is \noccurring right here in the United States. It is not occurring in other \ncountries. So we have a weakened manufacturing base because they will \nnot stay in the business due to the threat of lawsuits, leaving us in a \nsituation of only two manufacturers.\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\n  No matter how big the demand, if we buy only from two people and \nthere is a contamination problem, we are in trouble. In the \nannouncement earlier this week, we saw what happened to Chiron and with \nthat the consequences of what has happened there on Americans and on \nchildren abroad. That is our protection from life-threatening \nillnesses.\n  Again, 36,000 people die every year of this little virus which can be \nprevented, and the vaccine helps prevent it. We have the demand, we \nhave the money, but we do not have the manufacturing base because of \nthis chaotic lawsuit frenzy, the frivolous lawsuits.\n  We have seen shortages in childhood vaccines in recent years. We have \nexperienced shortages in the influenza vaccine in recent years. After \nthis week's announcement, we will clearly experience another shortage \nin the United States this year despite the tremendous planning and the \nunprecedented Federal efforts, including the wonderful work done by Dr. \nJulie Gerberding at the CDC and Secretary Tommy Thompson at HHS. We \nhave to address the underlying causes. We have to address the root \ncauses of the vaccine shortages in the near term. The long-term effects \ncan even be more devastating if we do not.\n  That is why I bring it to the Senate's attention late on a Sunday \nevening. It is our responsibility. The Senate must act. No one else has \nbeen able to address that underlying problem that deals with our tort \nsystem, but we can. We should. If we are not able to stabilize the \nworld's vaccine supply and make the market stable, give it a firm \nfoundation, it will not be viable. This will affect not only our \nability to manufacture vaccines that exist today, but what about that \nHIV/AIDS virus which has killed 23 million people, has 45 million \npeople infected, and will likely kill another 60 million people--and \nmaybe more than that unless we act. Figure out a vaccine. People are \nnot going to have an incentive to research and invest in research and \ndevelopment in a vaccine if there will not be a market because of \nfrivolous lawsuits which destroy anybody entering that manufacturing \nbase.\n  I talked earlier today about Alzheimer's disease. Right now, could \nthere be a vaccine for Alzheimer's disease? The answer is yes. Will we \nhave appropriate research and development? Well, I don't know; it \ndepends on whether people are given some incentive to enter that field. \nTo do that, we have to have a strong manufacturing base.\n  We have to have companies willing to do the research and willing to \ntake the risks to develop safer vaccines that, ultimately, we know will \nprotect us, will save lives, not just for adults, but for kids, against \nthese biological agents, against these viruses, whether it is HIV/AIDS, \nor smallpox, where we were successful, or influenza that is of current \nconcern.\n  What have we done in the past? In the past, I have sponsored two \npieces of legislation that go a long way toward moving us to \nstabilization of this market. One of those bills, the Improved Vaccine \nAffordability and Availability Act, which was S. 2053 in the 107th \nCongress and S. 754 in the 108th Congress, would restore balance to the \nlitigation system for childhood vaccines by clarifying the \ncongressional intent that all vaccine litigation regarding childhood \nvaccines should proceed through the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram.\n  The program that I mentioned that is set up has worked well in the \npast. We just need to fix the program so we will not have these \nfrivolous lawsuits circumventing the program.\n  These bills would expand the remedies to help compensate those who \nare injured, those who suffer serious side effects from vaccines, while \nat the same time ensuring that unwarranted litigation does not further \ndestabilize the supplies.\n  The legislation--again, this is legislation in the 107th Congress and \nthe 108th Congress which, in effect, the lawyers have beat back and \nhave not let us pass; but it is going to come forward again--would also \nrequire the Federal Government to maintain a stockpile of prioritized \nvaccines. This will help stabilize supplies and help us prepare for \nyears ahead in which vaccine production may or may not be able to keep \npace with the need.\n  These bills--again, it was S. 2053 in the last Congress and S. 754 in \nthis Congress--would also expand the funding available for State and \nlocal efforts to boost immunization rates among children, especially \nthose in underserved areas or those at a high risk to vaccine-\npreventable diseases.\n  Each of the major provisions included in the legislation was \nrecommended by the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines. That is a \nFederal expert panel composed of vaccine manufacturers, health care \nproviders, and trial lawyers. The legislation also has been endorsed by \na broad range of medical and children's health groups, including the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Every Child By Two, and Parents of Kids \nwith Infectious Diseases.\n  We must return to this legislation in the next Congress. And we will \nconsider other steps to address the vaccine situation in the future.\n  Recently, over the course of the week--and really it plays off in the \nPresidential election again and in other discussions--people are trying \nto seize upon hot issues and turn them to their political advantage. \nLet me just say several things.\n  No. 1, it is irresponsible to say that there is a quick fix. It is \ncomplex. It takes study. We have done that study. We are ready to \nlegislate. But there is no quick fix.\n  Again, there have been people--I believe it has been on the floor of \nthe Senate, but I know it has been in the press--who are terribly \nmisinformed. Yet when they say something, people accept it as fact. And \na statement to suggest somehow that this is an issue that arises by \nbrand drugs keeping generics off the market does not make sense. People \ncan say that, and people nod their head, but it does not make sense.\n\n  Why do I say that? Because a flu vaccine has to be unique each year. \nThe generic is standardization; you just produce a lot of it. The flu \nvaccine has to be tailored. It has to be modified. And it takes several \nyears to do those modifications.\n  No. 2, I do want to applaud the Bush administration, the CDC, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Dr. Julie Gerberding, who I \nmentioned, and Secretary Tommy Thompson. They had virtually as close to \nperfect as you can planning in terms of vaccines. They took immediate \nand prompt action as soon as this shortage became available.\n  A third point I want to close with is, we have to create a stable \nenvironment through a combination. This is where there is no quick fix. \nWe need to address the future stockpile, perhaps with some guaranteed \npurchase by Government, public-private partnerships for research and \ndevelopment, increased funding for safer vaccines, and perhaps--I would \nargue most importantly--legal reforms. The flu vaccine shortage we are \nseeing right now is a symptom of the broader issues of risk and low \nreturn of developing any vaccines.\n  Lastly, healthy adults and kids not in the CDC-recommended categories \nshould withhold this year so that we will have sufficient vaccines \navailable for those who are at higher risk.\n  Mr. President, again, I bring this to the floor because it is a \ncurrent topic. I do not want to see it politicized. We have an \nobligation in this body to address it head-on. It is a tort reform \nissue. It is the sort of issue that we are obligated to take on, and we \nwill take on very directly in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11124-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11124-S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENSE OF THE SENATE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the national interest that qualifying members \n     of the Armed Forces on active duty and other overseas voters \n     be allowed to vote in Federal elections.\n       (2) Since 1980, when the first election for the \n     Congressional Delegate from American Samoa was held, general \n     elections have been held in the first week of November in \n     even-numbered years and runoff elections have been held 2 \n     weeks later.\n       (3) This practice of holding a run-off election 2 weeks \n     after a general election deprives members of the Armed Forces \n     on active duty and other overseas voters of the opportunity \n     to participate in the Federal election process in American \n     Samoa.\n       (4) Prior to and since September 11, 2001, and due to \n     limited air service, mail delays, and other considerations, \n     it has been and remains impossible for absentee ballots to be \n     prepared and returned within a 2-week period.\n       (5) American Samoa law requiring members of the Armed \n     Forces on active duty and other overseas voters to register \n     in person also prevents participation in the Federal election \n     process and is contrary to the Uniformed and Overseas \n     Citizens Absentee Voting Act.\n       (6) Given that 49 states elect their Representatives to the \n     United States House of Representatives by plurality, it is in \n     the national interest for American Samoa to do the same until \n     such time as the American Samoa Legislature establishes \n     primary elections and declares null and void the local \n     practice of requiring members of the Armed Forces on active \n     duty and other overseas voters to register in person which is \n     contrary to the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens \n     Absentee Voting Act.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 121) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas throughout history, physics has contributed to \n     knowledge, civilization, and culture around the world;\n       Whereas physics research has been and continues to be a \n     driving force for scientific, technological, and economic \n     development;\n       Whereas many emerging fields in science and technology, \n     such as nanoscience, information technology, and \n     biotechnology, are substantially based on, and derive many \n     tools from, fundamental discoveries in physics and physics \n     applications;\n       Whereas physics will continue to play a vital role in \n     addressing many 21st-century challenges relating to \n     sustainable development, including environmental \n     conservation, clean sources of energy, public health, and \n     security;\n       Whereas Albert Einstein is a widely recognized scientific \n     figure who contributed enormously to the development of \n     physics, beginning in 1905 with Einstein's groundbreaking \n     papers on the photoelectric effect, the size of molecules, \n     Brownian motion, and the theory of relativity that led to \n     Einstein's most famous equation, E = mc2;\n       Whereas 2005 will be the 100th anniversary of the \n     publication of those groundbreaking papers;\n       Whereas the General Assembly of the International Union of \n     Pure and Applied Physics unanimously approved the proposition \n     designating 2005 as the World Year of Physics; and\n       Whereas the Department of Energy is the leading source of \n     Federal support for academic physics research, accounting for \n     a majority of Federal funding for physics: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the World Year of \n     Physics, as designated by the General Assembly of the \n     International Union of Pure and Applied Physics;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the World Year of Physics as a special occasion for giving \n     impetus to--\n       (A) education and research in physics; and\n       (B) the public's understanding of physics;\n       (3) calls on the Secretary of Energy to lead and coordinate \n     Federal activities to commemorate the World Year of Physics;\n       (4) encourages the Secretary, all science-related \n     organizations, the private sector, and the media to highlight \n     and give enhanced recognition to--\n\n[[Page S11185]]\n\n       (A) the role of physics in social, cultural, and economic \n     development; and\n       (B) the positive impact and contributions of physics to \n     society; and\n       (5) encourages the Secretary and all people involved in \n     physics education and research to take additional steps \n     (including strengthening existing and emerging fields of \n     physics research and promoting the understanding of physics) \n     to ensure that--\n       (A) support for physics continues; and\n       (B) physics studies at all levels continue to attract an \n     adequate number of students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11185-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIBBEN CENTER ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Tomorrow, the Senate will resume consideration of the FSC/\nETI JOBS conference report. Under the previous order, at 12 we will \nproceed to a vote on adoption of that conference report. That will be a \nrollcall vote. Following that vote, the order provides for us to \ndispose of the Military Construction appropriations bill and the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill and a number of other \nhousekeeping measures.\n  As we indicated earlier, those will be completed without rollcall \nvotes. Therefore, for scheduling purposes we will have one rollcall \nvote at 12, and that should conclude our voting. Again, I thank Members \nfor their participation over this weekend.\n  We had a very full day yesterday and a very, very full day today. I \ndo appreciate the cooperation of everyone. It was a real inconvenience \nto people's schedules, but it has allowed us to reach conclusion at a \nmuch earlier time than we would otherwise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I mentioned off the microphones today to the two leaders, \nan hour or so ago, we are here on a Sunday and our dear friend, the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, talked about the Sabbath \nand we were all so impressed with his remarks, but I say that if there \never were a time legislatively when the ox was in the mire, it was this \nweekend. But for our being here as a result of the work of the two \nleaders, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, we would not have completed \nthe people's business.\n  We basically have done that tonight. Tomorrow we come in for some \nformalities: the FSC bill; cloture was invoked today and it will pass \ntomorrow and that is our only recorded vote. So I want the Record to \nreflect that Senators Daschle and Frist are the two leaders for a good \nreason. It is very hard to get where we are, and we all have apologized \non a number of occasions for having to come in on Sunday. It is a rare \noccasion we do that. But I repeat, the ox was in the mire. We had to do \nthat. The ox is out of the mire,\n\n[[Page S11187]]\n\nand whether we do that on Sunday or Monday, I believe that is the \nappropriate thing to do.\n\n  I know the Chair will join with me in saying, these people here are \nglassy-eyed. They have worked so long and so hard. The Capitol Police, \nthe official reporters, the enrolling clerks, the Parliamentarians, \neveryone here has worked so hard. Our staff has worked tireless hours. \nWe are the ones who are here and people see us, but they see mere \nshells of what we would be but for their great work. They protect us. \nThey cover for us. The mistakes we make, they find them and come back \nand correct legislation. So I want everyone who is here to know how \nmuch we appreciate what they do. They get so little attention.

So we do want to express our appreciation, \nespecially on this weekend when it is not totally unprecedented, but it \nis very unusual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/10/10/senate-section/article/S11187-1", "month": "10", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am very grateful to the majority leader \nand the Democratic whip for allowing me this time. I am sorry to run in \nbreathless at the end of the evening to ask for it. I thought I would \nhave an opportunity, perhaps in the wee hours of the morning, to make \nthis statement. I think it will be evident when I get into it why I \nwant to do it now. I will explain that also.\n  Let me say I agree completely with the statement of the Senator from \nNevada regarding the staff. I have presided, myself, during this \nweekend, on several occasions. I am grateful to the staff for coming in \nand sorry to keep them a few minutes later than they would otherwise \nhave to stay. I just want all the staff to know that, in compensation \nto them as a small token, if they would like to come to my desk after \nwe adjourn, I have plenty of Russell Stover candy, pecan rolls and \nalmond rolls--and low carb candy also, I say to the majority leader. I \nam more than happy to share it with all the staff who worked so hard \nthis weekend.\n  I want to talk a little bit about overtime. I have not talked about \novertime on the floor of the Senate despite the fact that there has \nbeen a lot of controversy over it. There are a lot of reasons I have \nnot to this point. I have had other priorities. But the overtime \nregulations that went into effect about 6 weeks ago are actually, of \ncourse, having an impact in the United States. In other words, they are \nnow the law. People are having to comply with them. Employers are \nhaving to comply with them.\n  So we have reached a new stage in the controversy over those rules \nbecause we don't have to speculate anymore what their impact is going \nto be. We know what their impact is because they have become law. What \nwe are finding is that these overtime regulations, as many of us \nthought and as the Secretary of Labor said over and over again, are \nworking the most significant enlargement of overtime pay, the most \nsignificant increase of overtime coverage in the history of the \novertime law, at least since 1938.\n  I wanted to say this on the floor of the Senate before we left \nbecause I think it is owing, in particular, to the Secretary to say it. \nShe has been criticized by many outside of this body and some in this \nbody. They have said these overtime regulations the Department has \nissued would restrict overtime for people. It is not working that way, \nand there are a lot of us who knew it wouldn't work that way, which is \nwhy we always voted to allow that process to move forward.\n  So I want to say this evening, and I am going to go through the \nreasons why and then talk about what exactly is happening out there in \nmy 20 minutes, but I want to repeat, these overtime regulations, far \nfrom restricting overtime coverage, are working the most significant \nenlargement in overtime protection since 1938.\n  I want to explain now why those of us who have some familiarity with \nthis field of law always thought that would be the case. I read these \nproposed regulations when they came out about a year ago. I looked at \nthem and said to myself, as a person who used to practice labor and \nemployment law, my gosh, there are going to be a lot more people \ngetting overtime under these regulations than have gotten it before. \nLet me explain why.\n  This is a rather arcane field of law, but it is possible to \nunderstand it. You have to start from the assumption that unless the \nlaw provides otherwise, every employee in the country is entitled to \novertime if they work more than 40 hours a week. You are entitled to \novertime unless the law exempts you from overtime, so the bigger the \nexemption, the less the overtime. When we talk about exemptions \nexpanding, we are talking about overtime restricting, and it is \nimportant to keep that in mind.\n\n  We start from the proposition that all employees are covered by \novertime. The law exempts management employees. It has always been an \naspect of the law that if you are in management, if you are one of the \npeople who run the company, you are not entitled to mandatory overtime.\n  So how does the law define management? First of all, to be a \nmanagement employee you have to be salaried. If you are paid by the \nhour, you get overtime. It doesn't matter what else your job may \nentail, you get overtime. So you have to be salaried.\n  Second, you have to be salaried above a certain level. This is very \nsignificant because it has changed. Under the old regulations, before \nthe new regulations were issued and took effect, under the old \nregulations, if your salary was below about $13,000 a year you \nautomatically got overtime. You could not be considered management \nunless your salary was at least $13,000 a year. That wasn't much \nprotection because just about everybody in the country who worked full \ntime and got a salary earned more than $13,000 a year. But the new \nregulations raised that threshold to $23,600. What the law is now, if \nyou get paid a salary of less than $23,600, you get overtime \nprotection. You get mandatory overtime regardless of what the rest of \nyour job may entail.\n  When I saw that, I knew immediately that there were going to be tens \nand tens of thousands of people who had been exempt, whose overtime had \nbeen denied them legally under the old regulations, who would now get \nit automatically. I am talking about people who work as assistant \nmanagers of restaurants or in some cases you might be a line leader in \na plant or you might have some other job which looks like it may be \nmanagement so you got exempted under the old regulations. But where you \nwere not paid $23,600, automatically those people come under \nprotection.\n  It is not enough to be paid a salary above $23,600 or above the \nthreshold, whatever it is, to be considered management, and it never \nhas been. The first step is, are you paid a salary? Is it above that \ncertain level? If it is, you might be exempt. You might not be entitled \nto overtime if you fell into one of several categories of management.\n  I am not going to go through them all, but let me take two very \nbriefly. One of them is if you were an executive. If you got a salary \nabove the threshold and you were an executive, you were not entitled as \nmanagement to overtime.\n  How do you define executive? The old rule said--I hope you are \nsticking with\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\nme here, Mr. President, and through you, all the vast numbers of \nSenators who are here on the floor listening to this--if you got paid a \nsalary above the threshold and under the old regulations you supervised \nat least two people--and by ``supervising,'' the law meant you did at \nleast one of the things that typically supervisors did. So it might be \ndirecting their performance on the job; it might be deciding what their \nschedules were, when they could come in to work, when they took \nvacations; it might be training them on the job. If you did any of \nthose things and you supervised two people and you had a salary above \n$13,000, you were exempt from coverage.\n\n  You can see that covered a lot of people, a lot of your first-line \nsupervisors. Think about this for a second. A lot of your first-line \nsupervisors, your shift foremen, your line leaders, your assistant \nmanagers, they get paid above $13,000, they have two people underneath \nthem, and they decide, for example, when you come in to work or which \nclothesrack you should be working on, if it is an assistant manager in \na clothing store, right? So those people were exempt from overtime.\n  Now under the new regulations you have to be paid at least $23,600, \nyou have to supervise two people, and then here is the thing: You have \nto hire or fire or effectively recommend the hiring or firing of \nemployees. If you don't do that, you are not exempt, under that \nexemption anyway.\n  Look at the difference. Under the old law you weren't exempt, you \nwere exempt if you got above $13,000 in salary; you supervised two \npeople, and you did anything in terms of the direction of their work. \nBut now you have to get above $23,600, you have to supervise two \npeople, and you have to effectively recommend hiring or firing on a \nday-to-day basis. That very substantially restricts the exemption, \nwhich very substantially increases the number of people who are covered \nby the overtime laws.\n  You may be exempt if you supervise people. I just went through that. \nYou also may be exempt if you supervise functions. Under the old law, \ntypically the classic example is somebody who is the lab director in a \nlaboratory. They may not have people under them, but they supervise the \nlab. But that exemption has been restricted, too, under the new \nregulations because it always required that you exercise what is called \nindependent judgment or discretion with respect to whatever function \nyou are supervising. But now the independent judgment and discretion \nmust be with respect to something, to an operation that has a \nsignificant impact on the workplace. It is no longer enough to \nsupervise a piece of a function; you have to supervise the whole thing. \nThis, too, increases the number of people who are covered by overtime \nby reducing the breadth of the exemption.\n  The same thing could be said with regard to the professional \nexemption. There are many aspects of these regulations which were \ndesigned to and do work an enlargement of overtime coverage.\n  How do we know they do that? Because the regulations have been in \neffect for 6 weeks and all the general counsels of all the big \ncompanies are looking at them. Do you know what they are recommending? \nThey are telling their employers we have to reclassify these job \nduties. These job classifications, they are no longer exempt from \novertime. We have to start paying people overtime.\n  A survey was recently done among Fortune 500 companies by the HR \nPolicy Association, and the return was this: Half of the Fortune 500 \ncompanies said they were going to treat more employees as eligible for \novertime. The other half said there would be little or no change.\n  The University of Missouri at Colombia--of course we all know that \nfine institution in Missouri--they said 400 to 500 workers would be \nreclassified as eligible for overtime who were not eligible before.\n  Sears Roebuck & Company said 2,000 employees will be reclassified as \nnonexempt, and nonexempt means you are covered. Overtime has to be paid \nto you.\n\n  Burdines-Macy's, 3M, McDonald's, St. Jude Children's Research \nHospital, the University of Kansas, they are all reporting that they \nare going to reclassify employees so they are covered by overtime, \nwhere under the old regulations that Members of this body have been \nfighting for a year to preserve, these people did not get overtime.\n  Senator Bond and I were contacted by police sergeants of the St. \nLouis City Police Department. These sergeants had earlier, under the \nold regulations, been found exempt, not entitled on a mandatory basis \nto overtime. They believed, reading the new regulations, that they \nwould be entitled. I believe they have a good case. I don't want to \nprejudge it. Senator Bond and I asked the Department of Labor to \ninvestigate. They are investigating. My prediction is--I can't be \ncertain because this gets down to the details of the job on a day-to-\nday basis, but my belief is that they will be entitled to overtime \nunless the police department changes their duties or arranges for them \nto work under 40 hours a week.\n  The new regulations contain specific references to police sergeants \nand firefighters and say they are entitled to overtime as examples of \npeople who would be entitled under the new rule who were not \nnecessarily entitled under the old--this with respect to a regulation \nthat again I say for the last year Members of this body have been \nsaying over and over again will restrict overtime. Yet I tell you and \nthe Senate that it will work out to be the most significant enlargement \nof overtime since 1938. Not a single company reported that they were \ngoing to reclassify people downward to make them exempt. We are aware \nof thousands and thousands of cases already, in 6 weeks, where we know \npeople are going to be reclassified as covered by overtime when they \nwere not covered before.\n  We don't yet know--I asked the Department of Labor this today. I \nasked them if they knew of a single case that had gotten up to their \nlevel where a person who had been receiving overtime under the old \nregulations had lost it under the new. They don't know of a single case \nwhere that happened.\n  It could happen. There is one aspect of the regulation that applies \nto people who are getting salaries of $100,000 a year or more. I talked \nwith a lady today who worked in Wage and Hour and was responsible for \nthis. She said: As I read it, I don't really think it is going to \nrestrict overtime. It could. I could probably construct a law school \nhypothetical where somebody in that position lost overtime. It is \npossible. We may see a handful. I don't believe we will see more than \nthat.\n  I am not going to go through all these remarks because I know the \nstaff has worked all weekend and I don't want to keep them any later. I \nthought it was important to say this. It is owing to Secretary Chao and \nfor the hard work she has put in to make this statement and to make \nclear to the Senate how significant these new regulations are in that \nthey are going to enlarge overtime.\n  I do think it is important to say also that if the efforts of Members \nof this Senate who have fought these regulations had succeeded, then \nthese thousands and thousands of people who are now getting overtime \nwould not be getting it. If the bill that has been sponsored--\nI understand we are going to vote on it through a voice vote--were to \npass, it would mean the withdrawal of overtime protection for all the \npeople in the last 6 weeks who have been reclassified as entitled to \nit. That would be a great shame. But it will happen because, as I read \nthese regulations and as they are working in practice, they are working \na significant expansion of protection for employees around the United \nStates.\n\n  I congratulate the Department. They have taken care of inequities \nthat have existed in this system for decades and decades. When you look \nat the struggle they have gone through, you understand why it was not \nremedied before now.\n  This is an arcane and a difficult area. Misinterpretations are \npossible. I do think many outside this Senate and some inside the \nSenate have been subject to a misinterpretation of these regulations. I \nhope I have cleared it up, and I wanted to have the opportunity to do \nthat before we adjourned, until the election.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. TALENT. I think I will give that 4 minutes as a gift to the staff \nand to\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nyou.
