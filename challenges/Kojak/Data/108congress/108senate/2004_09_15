Madam President, I yield such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nCommittee, who did such a wonderful job this week passing our Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill that is going to fund homeland security \nfor all of our country, after which I would like to reclaim the floor \nfor the Military Construction Subcommittee report.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for yielding briefly to me.\n  I take this opportunity to thank the staff members who worked so hard \non the appropriations subcommittee for homeland defense for helping \nensure the passage of the bill and handling the bill in such a \nprofessionally competent way. They all reflected credit on the Senate \nby their professional way of handling their duties. It was because of \ntheir hard work that we successfully completed action on the bill last \nnight. I commend them all.\n  On our side of the aisle, Rebecca Davies is the chief clerk of that \nsubcommittee. She is assisted ably by Carol Cribbs, Les Spivey, James \nHayes, Kimberly Nelson, and Avery Forbes. The staff members who served \non the minority side were equally professional and helpful in carrying \nout their duties.\n  I commend Senator Byrd for his cooperation with our efforts to \ncomplete action on the bill. I especially thank Senator Reid, the \nassistant leader, who was actively involved on the floor helping to \nensure the orderly flow of amendments. I am very grateful for his \nassistance as well.\n  My good friend Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was here when he was \nneeded during the handling of that bill, and without his guidance and \ngood judgment on several occasions, we would not have successfully \ncompleted action on the bill last evening.\n  But for all Senators who cooperated with us on time agreements and \nthe like, I express my deepest appreciation and thank them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am very pleased to bring forward \nfor the Senate's consideration the fiscal year 2005 Military \nConstruction appropriations bill. I am also pleased to be joined by the \nranking member of the Military Construction Subcommittee, Senator \nFeinstein from California. We have worked very closely on this bill. \nThat has been our tradition. We have never had a problem with our \nMilitary Construction bill. Frankly, we have done some very important \nwork and begun to help the Department of Defense shape the military for \nthe future.\n  Our bill provides, including $5.3 billion for military construction, \n$4.2 billion for military family housing; $166 million for NATO \ninfrastructure, and $246 million for base realignment and closure \ncosts.\n  Although the military construction needs continue to exceed resources \navailable, I am very pleased that the bill provides a significant \nincrease over last year's funding. I believe the bill we have on the \nfloor today attends both to the President's most pressing priorities \nand to the concerns of Senators.\n  Since September 11, 2001, we have made great demands on our military \npersonnel as they have waged the global war on terror. The sacrifices \nhave been widely shared, but the demands have been particularly acute \nfor our Reserve components who have faced deployments on a scale and \nfor durations unprecedented in the post-World-War II era. Facilities \nsupport for the Guard and Reserve have traditionally failed to keep \npace with need.\n  I am pleased that this year the administration increased the request \nfor Reserve component funding by 68 percent. Even this higher figure, \nhowever, is not adequate and the bill adds an additional $194 million \nor 31 percent more for critically needed projects in the Guard and \nReserve. We believe this bill does a very good job of providing the \nresources needed to accomplish our military mission. But nothing is so \ncritical to the mission as the people who carry it out, particularly in \na time in which so much is being asked of them. For that reason, we \nhave paid particular attention to projects that enhance the quality of \nlife of our military members and their families.\n  The bill provides over $1 billion for construction of new modern \nbarracks, $188 million for design and construction of new hospital and \nmedical facilities, and $11 million for child development centers to \nserve our military families. It also provides a 9-percent increase over \nlast year for family housing construction operations and maintenance.\n  Because we are concerned about the quality of life of our military \nfamilies, I want to comment briefly on a provision that is addressed in \nour bill and is very important to meeting the needs in the future for \nmilitary housing. In 1996,\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\nCongress passed legislation to provide the Defense Department with \nauthority to enter into partnerships with private entities for the \nacquisition and management of military family housing. Because the \ninitiative was unprecedented, the budget authority for the program was \ncapped at $850 million, pending an evaluation of the program's success. \nThe success has been striking.\n  To date, the Department of Defense has awarded 34 privatization \nprojects comprising 63,200 housing units. Another 63 projects involving \n116,000 housing units in 37 States and the District of Columbia are \npending. The program has accelerated significantly the elimination of \ninadequate housing for our Armed Forces and has placed thousands of \nmilitary families in better housing far sooner than would have been \npossible otherwise. Customer satisfaction with privatized housing is \nextremely high, and the Defense Department estimates the program will \ndecrease long-term housing costs by 10 to 15 percent due to more \nefficient maintenance. The Department expects to reach the statutory \ncap late this fall, and the cap must be raised or the program would \nend. However, the Congressional Budget Office has decided to change its \nmethods for scoring the additional authority, counting not just the \nannual appropriations required to fund the Government's contribution to \nprivatized housing but also all the estimated benefits that accrue to \nthe Government over time.\n  Effectively, the CBO intends to score the additional authority to \nenter into partnerships as though there were no partnerships, and the \nGovernment was paying for all of the new housing itself and paying for \nit all this year. That approach, besides seriously overstating the \nGovernment's expenditures for housing, negates any advantage of \nprivatized housing over traditional military construction.\n  Public-private partnerships are relatively new, and we recognize CBO \nis struggling to account for them properly. We acknowledge the appeal \nof a theoretically comprehensive accounting of Federal financial \nactivities. But the practical reality of CBO's proposed approach will \nbe prolonged substandard housing for tens of thousands of our military \nfamilies, with not a dollar difference in the amount of money \nGovernment is spending. So we are not going to allow that to stand.\n  I hope a sensible solution to this issue will prevail. We are going \nto continue to work with the Budget Committee, CBO, the Armed Services \nCommittee, and in our own Military Construction conference. In the \nmeantime, there is an amendment that is now part of our package that \nwill direct the Defense Department to assess the impact on our military \nfamilies if we fail to resolve this issue and, by doing so, put a \nmarker down to address the issue in conference if it is not settled \nelsewhere.\n  Last year this bill differed from the administration's request in \nonly one significant way, and that was overseas construction. The \nadministration was in the early stages of its global posture review and \nthere were many uncertainties about the future of the U.S. military \npresence overseas. Today, the Department's vision is clearer. The \nDepartment has made significant progress in thinking about the future \nof our overseas military facilities and, over the recess, began to \npublicly disclose some of that thinking. They have made a major step in \nthe right direction. The Independent Overseas Basing Commission created \nby last year's Military Construction Appropriations bill is up and \nrunning and has begun its assessment of overseas infrastructure needs. \nThe commission's work will help inform our evaluation of our overseas \nconstruction requirements.\n  I and my colleague, Senator Feinstein, have visited numerous military \ninstallations all over the world. I know our colleagues have as well. I \nam certain they have found the same thing we have--that the needs at \nthese installations almost always outstrip the resources we are able to \ndirect to them. Although most of the needs are eventually addressed, \nsometimes the urgency of the requirement isn't fully appreciated here \nin Washington, where the budget requests are being prepared.\n  This bill provides funding for a number of projects which are badly \nneeded at particular installations and are in the future years defense \nplan, but which were not included in this year's budget request. All of \nthem have been carefully screened by the military services to ensure \nthat they meet urgent military requirements; all are top priorities for \ninstallation commanders, and all have been authorized in the Senate \nversion of the Defense authorization bill. A significant percentage of \nthem support our Guard and Reserve forces, and I am pleased we were \nable to include them in this bill. They are a priority.\n  The bill before the Senate was approved by the Committee on \nAppropriations on a unanimous vote of 29-0. I thank my ranking member, \nSenator Feinstein, for her cooperation and counsel throughout this \nprocess, and compliment her staff, Christina Evans and B.G. Wright, who \nhave worked so cooperatively with my staff in preparing this bill. My \nstaff, Dennis Ward and Sean Knowles, also have done a terrific job. \nThey have traveled to the bases where we have requests to find out for \nthemselves that these requests are needed and how we can best meet the \nneeds of all of the military installations in our country and where our \ntroops are based overseas. I so appreciate their professionalism and \nsupport.\n  I am pleased to offer the 2005 Military Construction appropriations \nbill for the Senate's consideration.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman, \nSenator Hutchison, in recommending the 2005 Military Construction \nappropriations bill to the Senate. I thank her because it has been \nquite wonderful for me to work with her over the years. We have \nexchanged positions, ranking and chairman, on this subcommittee. I \nthink we have always worked in a collegial and very productive way. Her \nleadership has been outstanding and I, for one, am very grateful. I \nalso thank Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for their leadership and \nassistance in guiding this bill through committee and to the floor.\n  America's men and women in uniform need all the support we can give \nthem, so expeditious consideration of defense bills, such as this one, \nsends an important signal of support to our troops. I know both Senator \nHutchison and I want to send that signal.\n  The President's budget request for MilCon was $9.55 billion. That was \nonly 2.5 percent over last year's enacted level. But with the support \nof Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye, the committee was able to add \nanother $450 million to meet the urgent construction needs of our \nactive and reserve military bases.\n  As Senator Hutchison indicated, one issue that dominated discussion \nin the 2005 Military Construction program is the question of how to \nrescue the military family housing privatization initiative from \nrunning out of budget authority. I agree very much with my chairman. By \naccelerating the pace at which new family housing can be provided, the \nprogram has had a tremendous impact on the quality of life for \nthousands of military families. The question is, what do we do now? \nThis year, the subcommittee was faced with that dilemma because we will \nshortly be out of money. So as the chairman said, we hope the \nauthorizing committee--the Budget Committee as well as the Armed \nServices Committee--can find a solution to this problem by the time \nthis bill is in conference.\n  Again this year, the subcommittee was faced with a still evolving \nproposal for realigning our overseas military force structure. I want \nto take a couple of minutes to discuss it because I think it is \nimportant. Last year, the Defense Department unveiled a preliminary \nplan for a major restructuring of forces in Europe and Korea, a plan \nthat has now evolved into a wide-ranging global rebasing plan. The \nPresident publicly announced the plan last month, noting that 60,000 to \n70,000 troops currently stationed overseas would return home over the \nnext decade. Unfortunately, the administration offered few other \ndetails about the plan, and it appears some key basing decisions remain \nunresolved. This year's budget request included more than $700 million \nfor overseas military construction.\n  The planning and rebuilding of military facilities is a complicated \nprocess, constrained by long lead times, and the\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nlack of a fully developed basing plan by the Department of Defense has \nhampered the subcommittee's ability to make prudent and informed \ndecisions about overseas military construction.\n  For this reason, several proposed overseas construction projects were \ndeleted from the Senate bill pending a clearer understanding of how \nthey might be affected by the global basing plan.\n  It is clear the Department is continuing to fine-tune and adjust its \nglobal realignment plan. Although the President has announced plans to \nrealign and significantly reduce the number of U.S. troops stationed \noverseas, the committee has received no requests from the Defense \nDepartment that would support moving forces back to the United States; \nnor has the Defense Department provided Congress with any cost estimate \nor timetable for its global restructuring plan. It is said that ``the \ndevil is in the details'' and we do need those details. Only when the \nDefense Department provides Congress with a comprehensive, well-\nreasoned plan will the committee have a sufficient understanding of the \nassociated military construction requirements to proceed with \nconfidence.\n  Until the Defense Department completes its overseas basing review and \npresents a plan to Congress, projects supporting activities that may be \nsubject to further change should remain on hold. I think we are both in \nagreement on that.\n  The Overseas Basing Commission that Senator Hutchison led, and I \nsupported, was established last year. That, we hope, will provide some \nvaluable insights for Congress regarding this process. We have given \nthis matter great consideration, and I commend Senator Hutchison for \nlaying out the position of the subcommittee so clearly and completely \nin the report accompanying our bill. I very much agree with that.\n  I thank Chairman Hutchison and the members of the Appropriations \nstaff, Dennis Ward and Sean Knowles, for their hard work on this bill. \nI also thank my Appropriations staff, Christina Evans and B. G. Wright, \nsitting to my left, and my personal staff, Michael Schiffer and Chris \nThompson, who does our appropriations, for their contributions.\n  The work of the Military Construction Subcommittee enhances our \nNation's efforts to build quality facilities for our military men and \nwomen, and I urge my colleagues to approve this bill.\n  Mr. President, I want the chairman to know that at the appropriate \ntime, I would like to enter into a colloquy between Senator Nelson and \nmyself, to which the chairman has agreed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this would now be the appropriate time \nbecause I know of no speakers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There is one, and I would like to yield a few minutes \nto the Senator from Delaware, if I may, Senator Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for yielding to \nme at this time. I wish to express my appreciation on behalf of \neveryone at Dover Air Force Base for project funds that are included in \nthis bill.\n  Is this an appropriate time for me to make that statement?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. CARPER. I will proceed. Dover Air Force Base has been in \nexistence a half century or more. The oldest control tower on any Air \nForce base in America, as far as I am aware, is at Dover Air Force \nBase. There has been a request for a number of years to try to replace \nthat tower and put in new technology to provide better safety control \nof our aircraft on the Delmarva Peninsula.\n  The committee sought to include that project last year and was unable \nto do so for the 2004 funding cycle. Senator Feinstein has been \nterrific in making sure it was included in the funding for this year. I \nexpress my gratitude to her and to Senator Hutchison for that \ninclusion.\n  The importance of airlift today is great. We have, as my colleagues \nknow, operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, supporting our personnel in \nNigeria, Haiti--all over the world. The importance of airlift is only \ngoing to grow in the years ahead because of the redeployment of our \nforces, as we bring folks home and the need in the future to deploy \nthem through airlift, and if we want to do it quickly, airlift is the \nkey. Bases where we provide airlift today will only be more critical to \nour Nation's military security. There are a lot of Air Force bases. I \ndo not know of any base on the east coast that does more in terms of \nproviding the lift for our men, women, troops, materiel, and equipment \nthan Dover Air Force Base.\n\n  Within a few weeks, we are going to be breaking ground at Dover Air \nForce Base for a new aerial port. This is a new huge modernized cargo \nwarehouse through which equipment will move from ground transportation, \ntruck and rail, onto aircraft to be shipped all around the world, and, \nin other cases, off the aircraft to the port, and distributed through \nthis country. It is a huge project. It was funded in the 2004 budget, \nand we break ground in a few days. We are excited about it. And we are \nfinally seeing the oldest control tower in the Air Force being replaced \nby a modern, technologically current tower.\n  There are 5,000 people who work at Dover Air Force Base. Many are \nfamilies. A lot of their loved ones are abroad. Today they are all over \nthe world. Their housing is not especially good. I believe there is \nsome money in this Military Construction bill to help us on the housing \nside as well.\n  For all of that and for all the families at Dover Air Force Base, for \nthose of us who know how important the base is to our military \nreadiness, we say our heartfelt thanks.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before I yield back the remainder of \nmy time, I would like to thank the Senator from Delaware for his \ncomments. The control tower at Dover Air Force Base, which is I think \nabout a $9 million appropriation, was on their ask list in 2004. \nUnfortunately, we could not do it, so we made it a high priority this \nyear. I know both Senator Hutchison and I were really pleased to be \nable to do it.\n  It is very nice for the Senator from Delaware to come to the floor to \nsay thank you. Very few do that. It is appreciated. I thank the Senator \nvery much.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, speaking not only for myself, I know I \nspeak for Senator Biden as well, for both of us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before Senator Feinstein yields the \nfloor, in case she has anything else to say, I say to the Senator from \nDelaware that he was very persistent last year. We did everything to \ntry to help him with that last component of the increase in the \ncapacity for Dover. We were not able to do that last year.\n  Senator Feinstein did make it her highest priority this year. I want \nthe Senators from Delaware to know that. I supported it fully, but we \ndid remember that the Senator had pressed hard.\n  Every one of us knows the great role that Dover Air Force Base plays \nin our military. They have one of the hardest jobs in all of our \nmilitary, and that is the comforting of families when their loved ones \nare returned home, many times no longer alive in body but certainly in \nspirit. That is a huge job that is done beautifully at Dover. We \nappreciate that.\n  We have added to the capacity of Dover Air Force Base that has such \nan important place in our military facilities throughout our whole \ncountry. We thank the Senator from Delaware for coming to the floor of \nthe Senate to reemphasize that importance. I thank him very much.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I can yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from California yields \nback her time, may I be recognized?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I had some meetings this morning and was not planning on \ncoming to the Chamber, but walking through the Senate today took me \nback to when I went to law school.\n  When I went to law school in a very large class at George Washington \nUniversity, as I recall, we had two women in that very large class. \nWhen I took the bar in Nevada after having graduated from law school, I \nthink we had one woman who took the bar.\n  It has been a while since I went to law school and took the bar but \nnot that long, and the face of America has changed dramatically. Since \nI have come to the national legislature, the\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\nface of the legislature has changed dramatically. The biggest change \nand I believe the most positive change that has taken place is women. \nHalf the people going to law school today are now women. There are \nsignificantly larger numbers of women in the Congress than when I came \nhere 22 years ago.\n  When I first saw this Military Construction Appropriations \nsubcommittee, this big important committee, being chaired by two women, \nI was so impressed I gave a little speech at that time.\n  I cannot express my satisfaction of walking into this Chamber and \nseeing two women in charge of something as important as this \nSubcommittee on Appropriations. The legal profession--I have only \npicked that one area--and the second area I pick is the national \nlegislature, are much better places as a result of women being \ninvolved, and there is no better example of that than these two \nwonderful human beings, the Senator from Texas and the Senator from \nCalifornia, who lead us on this committee.\n  I hope people watching understand what a message this sends. It is \nsaid young girls are shunted aside because they do not have \nproclivities to go into science; let them do other things; let them \nbecome teachers and nurses--they have different kinds of minds. They \nare not scientists.\n  One of the people I worked with, a brilliant man, told me women would \nnever be able to be lawyers because their briefcases were too heavy. \nAll of these old ideas are gone and these young girls who are hopefully \nwatching or hear about this should focus on these two women who are \nleading us on this multibillion-dollar bill.\n  I am so, I guess, enthralled with it. Walking into this Chamber and \nseeing these women lead this committee, I know--and I say this wherever \nI go, if I have the opportunity--we do much better work as a result of \nwomen becoming more a part of our legislative body. As far as I am \nconcerned, there are no two better Senators than these two women who \nare on the Senate floor today directing what we should do in spending \nfor our military construction throughout the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada appeared on \nthe floor and said similar words a year ago. I never expected he would \ncome back a second time and do that again. I had his words printed up \nand gave a copy to my chairman and put one copy in my memory book. What \nshould not be so rare, but I guess is rare, is the fact that women can \ndo this work, women can participate in the great public policy debates \nof our day, women can work together, they can be effective and I think \nthe fact that that is now becoming the given is important.\n  The message Senator Reid sent to young women who may be out there \nsaying, could I do this job some day, is absolutely, yes, if they get \nan education.\n  The old proverbial myths that women cannot work together or women are \njealous or women are this or women are that are not true. We are living \nexamples of this, both Republican and Democratic women in the Senate. \nIt is one of the great treats of our service that we are able to share, \ndevelop collegiality, be real professionals, and care about the people \nwe represent.\n  It is a great pleasure for me to hear and see the Senator from Nevada \nsaying these things, and also, as I said before, to be able to work \nwith Senator Hutchison. We have become good friends in the process. We \ndo not always agree, but that does not matter. The point is there is a \nbasic integrity and a commitment to do the right thing for the people \nwe represent and the people in the military.\n  So I thank Senator Reid and my thanks to my chairman. I yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for his very kind \nwords. It means a lot to Senator Feinstein and myself that he would \ncome to the floor and recognize the job we are doing. It is very \nthoughtful and we appreciate it very much.\n  Once again, I think we have a good bill that has taken into \nconsideration the priorities of our military, our administration, and \nthe Senators who all came together to put a bill on the floor that \nwould address the needs in a fair and balanced way throughout our \ncountry, and I thank my colleague from California. We have a great \nworking relationship, which shows in the bill because it passed \nunanimously out of the committee, and I think it will pass unanimously \nout of the Senate. Hopefully we can go forward to start the \nconstruction projects October 1, the beginning of fiscal year 2005.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                florida national guard hurricane damage\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senators from Texas \nand California be willing to engage me in a colloquy?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would also be willing to engage in a colloquy with \nmy friend from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today \nto speak about the Florida National Guard and the damage to their \ncritical facilities as a result of Hurricanes Charley and Frances. \nAlthough no armory or readiness center was lost to total destruction, \nthere are many significant problems to over thirty facilities that need \nimmediate attention. I am concerned that funds are made immediately \navailable to fix buildings to ensure that they are not exposed to \nfurther damage and that the Florida National Guard can return to its \nhigh readiness in their home stations.\n  I have received the assurances of LTG Steve Blum, Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau, that the $5 million necessary to make repairs to \nFlorida's armories is already available in contingency accounts and \nwill be released for obligation as soon as practical. Accordingly, I \nwill not seek additional funds in the military construction bill for \nthis purpose.\n  The Florida National Guard has performed its State and Federal \nmissions superbly over the last 2 years. At home and overseas the \nFlorida National Guard has time and again been there for the people of \nthe United States and Florida. We owe them our total support in the \nfastest possible repair of their facilities so that they can remain \nready for all that we will continue to ask them to do in the days \nahead.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Florida for bringing this \nissue to the attention of our committee and the Senate. Contingency \nfunds exist to support the requirements of the Florida National Guard \nand I am confident they will have what they need when they need it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I also thank the Senator from Florida for bringing \nthis to our attention. I appreciate his sharp attention to the needs of \nFlorida in this time of crisis, his determined efforts on behalf of \ntheir relief, and his unwavering support of the Florida National Guard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember for their interest and I look forward to working with them on \nthe range of issues that confront Florida in its recovery from these \nhurricanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4837, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4837) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2005, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the text of the \nSenate measure is substituted for the House bill. The question is on \nthe engrossment of the amendment and the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9245-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9245-S9246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \ndisturbing rise in anti-Semitism that the world has witnessed during \nthe last several years. I believe it is important that Senator Frist, \nSenator Santorum and others have come together to highlight the urgent \nneed to take action to combat this serious problem.\n  As a public official and private citizen, I have had the opportunity \nto visit the State of Israel on six separate occasions. I will never \nforget the time that I spent at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem in 1980, and on \nseveral other visits. Nor will the images that I saw at the Diaspora \nMuseum in Tel Aviv ever leave my mind. Those experiences truly brought \nhome to me the horrors of the Holocaust, and the role that anti-\nSemitism played in leading to the Holocaust. I vowed that I would do \neverything in my power to prevent this from ever happening again. Quite \nfrankly, as I have said before, this is something that I never thought \nI would see again in my lifetime.\n  In May 2002, following a disturbing number of anti-Semitic incidents \nin Europe, I joined members of the Helsinki Commission in a hearing to \nexamine the rise of anti-Semitic violence in Europe. I was shocked by \nthe reports that I heard. Today, the news is equally as disturbing. \nEven during the last month, we have seen numerous acts of anti-\nSemitism, which some of my colleagues will be referencing today. I will \nalso name a few:\n  In Paris, France, on August 14, 2004, anti-Semitic graffiti, \nincluding a sign saying ``death to Jews'' and a swastika, was found \nscrawled on a wall on the grounds of Notre Dame Cathedral;\n  In Wellington, New Zealand, on August 6, 2004, a Jewish chapel was \ndestroyed by fire and up to 90 Jewish headstones were pulled out of the \nground and smashed at a cemetery, on the outskirts of the nation's \ncapital;\n  In Calgary, Canada over the night of August 22, 2004, vandals sprayed \nswastikas and anti-Semitic messages on a condominium complex a block \nfrom the Calgary Jewish Center;\n  In the Czech Republic on August 10, 2004 more than 80 tombstones were \noverturned at a Jewish cemetery; and\n  In Birmingham, United Kingdom, during the night of August 22, 2004, \nsixty Jewish gravestones were destroyed in a local cemetery. Community \nofficials reported that stickers with the logo of a Neo-Nazi group were \nfound on some of the stones.\n  It is also important to stress that we are not exempt here in the \nUnited States. At the end of March, the Anti-Defamation League released \na report on anti-Semitic incidents that took place in the United States \nin 2003. In total, ADL counted more than 1,500 acts of anti-Semitism \nhere at home. According to their count, 25 of these incidents occurred \nin my own State.\n  Last month, I met with a group of individuals in my home state to \ndiscuss concern with growing anti-Semitism. There was general consensus \nthat this is, in fact, a problem in our own communities. Our \nconversation underscored the need to do all that we can to make the \nfight against anti-Semitism a priority in the United States, just as we \nredouble our efforts to encourage other countries to take action.\n  We should recognize positive efforts underway to promote tolerance \nand understanding, both at home and abroad. I am encouraged by action \nthat is taking place in Ohio to work toward this end. For instance, \nlast year, community leaders in Cleveland came together to form an \norganization called ``Ishmael and Isaac.'' This program brings together \nmembers of Ohio's Jewish and Muslim communities in an effort to raise \nmoney for the medical needs of Israelis and Palestinians.\n  Other efforts to promote diversity and anti-bias education are \ncritical if we are to succeed in creating more accepting and tolerant \nenvironments in cities and towns across the country. For instance, the \nAnti-Defamation League's ``A World of Difference Institute'' provides \nhands-on training and education programs that are used to promote \ntolerance and counter messages of hate in schools and universities, as \nwell as corporations and law enforcement agencies in 29 cities in the \nUnited States and 14 other countries. Such programs should continue, \nand they deserve our full support.\n  We cannot be silent and stand on the sidelines as anti-Semitism \nfesters at home and abroad. At sunset today, Jewish people across the \nworld will begin the observance of Rosh Hashanah, marking the beginning \nof a New Year. It is my sincere hope that in this new year, the United \nStates and members of the international community will make a renewed \neffort to stamp out anti-Semitism wherever it exists.\n  In recent months, the United States has taken significant steps in \nthe fight against anti-Semitism. In April, Secretary of State Colin \nPowell traveled to Berlin for a conference of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe--OSCE--dedicated to the fight \nagainst anti-Semitism.\n  At that conference, 55 participating states of the OSCE pledged to \ntake action. During the conference, a strong declaration was agreed to, \nwhich outlines steps that will be taken to address anti-Semitism. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Distinguished delegates,\n       Let me sum up the proceedings of this Conference in what I \n     would like to call ``Berlin Declaration''.\n       Based on consultations I conclude that OSCE participating \n     States,\n       Reaffirming the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, \n     which proclaims that everyone is entitled to all the rights \n     and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any \n     kind, such as race, religion or other status,\n       Recalling that Article 18 of the Universal Declaration on \n     Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights state that everyone has the right \n     to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,\n       Recalling also the decisions of the OSCE Ministerial \n     Councils at Porto and Maastricht, as well as previous \n     decisions and documents, and committing ourselves to \n     intensify efforts to combat anti-Semitism in all its \n     manifestations and to promote and strengthen tolerance and \n     non-discrimination,\n       Recognizing that anti-Semitism, following its most \n     devastating manifestation during the Holocaust, has assumed \n     new forms and expressions, which, along with other forms of \n     intolerance, pose a threat to democracy, the values of \n     civilization and, therefore, to overall security in the OSCE \n     region and beyond,\n       Concerned in particular that this hostility toward Jews--as \n     individuals or collectively--on racial, social, and/or \n     religious grounds, has manifested itself in verbal and \n     physical attacks and in the desecration of synagogues and \n     cemeteries,\n       1. Condemn without reserve all manifestations of anti-\n     Semitism, and all other acts of intolerance, incitement, \n     harassment or violence against persons or communities based \n     on ethnic origin or religious belief, wherever they occur;\n       2. Also condemn all attacks motivated by anti-Semitism or \n     by any other forms of religious or racial hatred or \n     intolerance, including attacks against synagogues and other \n     religious places, sites and shrines;\n       3. Declare unambiguously that international developments or \n     political issues, including those in Israel or elsewhere in \n     the Middle East, never justify anti-Semitism;\n       In addition, I note that the Maastricht Ministerial Council \n     in its Decision on Tolerance and Non-Discrimination, tasked \n     the Permanent Council ``to further discuss ways and means of \n     increasing the efforts of the OSCE and the participating \n     States for the promotion of tolerance and non-discrimination \n     in all fields.''In light of this Ministerial Decision, I \n     welcome the April 22 Permanent Council Decision on Combating \n     Anti-Semitism and, in accordance with that Decision, \n     incorporate it into this Declaration.\n       1. The OSCE participating States commit to:\n       Strive to ensure that their legal systems foster a safe \n     environment free from anti-Semitic harassment, violence or \n     discrimination in all fields of life;\n       Promote, a appropriate, educational programmers for \n     combating anti-Semitism;\n       Promote remembrance of and, as appropriate, education about \n     the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the importance of respect \n     for all ethnic and religious groups;\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\n       Combat hate crimes, which can be fuelled by racist, \n     xenophobic and anti-Semitic Propaganda in the media and on \n     the Internet;\n       Encourage and support international organization and NGO \n     efforts in thee areas;\n       Collect and maintain reliable information and statistics \n     about anti-Semitic crimes, and other hate crimes, committed \n     within their territory, report such information periodically \n     to the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and human \n     Rights (ODIHR), and make this information available to the \n     public;\n       Endeavour to provide the ODIHR with the appropriate \n     resources to accomplish the tasks agreed upon in the \n     Maastricht Ministerial Decision on Tolerance and Non-\n     Discrimination;\n       Work with the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly to determine \n     appropriate ways to review periodically the problem of anti-\n     Semitism;\n       Encourage development of informal exchanges among experts \n     in appropriate fora on best practices and experiences in law \n     enforcement and education;\n       2. To task the ODIHR to:\n       Follow closely, in full co-operation with other OSCE \n     institutions as well as the United Nations Committee on the \n     Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UNCERD), the European \n     Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), the \n     European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) \n     and other relevant international institutions and NGOs, anti-\n     Semitic incidents in the OSCE area making use of all reliable \n     information available;\n       Report its findings to the Permanent Council and to the \n     Human Dimension Implementation Meeting and make these \n     findings public. These reports should also be taken into \n     account in deciding on priorities for the work of the OSCE in \n     the area of intolerance; and\n       Systematically collect and disseminate information \n     throughout the OSCE area on best practices for preventing and \n     responding to anti-Semitism and, if requested, offer advice \n     to participating Stats in their efforts to fight anti-\n     Semitism;\n       This decision will be forwarded to he Ministerial Council \n     for endorsement at its Twelfth Meeting.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. As this document makes clear, the OSCE, through its \nOffice of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights--ODIHR, will for the \nfirst time monitor and report on acts of anti-Semitism. Moreover, the \nOSCE will keep track of positive steps countries are taking to address \nthe problem. This will be high on the agenda at the OSCE Ministerial \nthis December, and, next spring, Spain will host a meeting to follow-up \non the specific recommendations made at the Berlin Conference, and to \nexercise oversight of the progress ODIHR is making in complying with \nthe Berlin Declaration.\n  I have encouraged Secretary Powell to ensure that the United States \nnot only supports these efforts, but that we do all that we can to make \ncertain that the OSCE has the resources necessary to effectively do the \njob that it has been called upon to do to monitor anti-Semitism. I have \nbeen assured by our Ambassador to the OSCE, Stephan Minikes, that the \nUnited States will in fact do all that it can to support the work of \nthe OSCE in this regard. Ambassador Minikes has also assured me that \nthe OSCE, with the help of the United States and other member \ncountries, has the funding it needs to begin this crucial work. It is \nnot enough to pass Declarations and to have tables. What we need to do \nis give the organization that is supposed to get the job done, the \nmoney and the resources.\n  While I had hoped to attend the Berlin Conference on anti-Semitism at \nthe invitation of Secretary Powell, I was unable to be at this historic \ngathering due to pressing business here in the Senate. However, while \nthe conference was underway, an article that I co-authored with a \nleading member in the fight against anti-Semitism in the German \nBundestag, Professor Gert Weisskirchen, ran in the Washington Post.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article, entitled \n``Halting the New Hatred,'' be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 28, 2004]\n\n                         Halting the New Hatred\n\n       Two years ago members of Congress and the German Bundestag \n     launched a joint project that will come to fruition this week \n     in Berlin. More than 500 representatives from the 55-nation \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     are meeting to formulate an action plan to tackle the growing \n     problem of anti-Semitism.\n       Today anti-Semitism is no longer directed solely against \n     Jews an individuals. ``Israel, in effect, is emerging as the \n     collective Jew among nations,'' writes Mortimer B. Zuckerman \n     in U.S. News & World report. The old conspiracy theories, \n     prejudices and ``world domination'' fantasies are emerging in \n     new guises and are exploiting the conflict between Israelis \n     and Palestinians.\n       While the ``old'' anti-Semitism sought to stigmatize Jews \n     as individual threats to local coexistence, the ``new'' anti-\n     Semitism seeks to stigmatize Israel as a collective threat to \n     global coexistence. At the core of the new anti-Semitism is \n     the ``Auschwitz Lie''--that the Holocaust was invented as an \n     excuse for Jews to converge on Palestine in order to oppress \n     Arabs and conquer the world.\n       In both its old and new forms, anti-Semitism is merely an \n     attempt to divert attention from the perpetrators' motives \n     for committing acts of violence and injustice. In fighting \n     anti-Semitism we must turn our attention toward strengthening \n     peace and justice. The real battle against anti-Semitism lies \n     ahead of us, and it will affect the foundations of our \n     democracies.\n       Globalization is bringing ideas, cultures and lifestyles \n     into contact--and sometimes conflict--with one another in new \n     and unusual ways. Our task is to determine how our political \n     systems can shape the outcome in a positive way. Will we be \n     tolerant enough to create space for differences, and allow \n     them to develop and flourish? Globalization means that we all \n     have a shared fate.\n       Anti-Semitism is a problem for every OSCE state, because it \n     seeks to break down the pillars of our societies: rule of \n     law, equality, decency, tolerance and faith. Its violence is \n     felt by all, regardless of faith. Its most diabolical \n     offspring is terrorism, a force that in its embrace of death \n     tears down everything in its path. Its aim is to destroy all \n     that is humane.\n       In Berlin we will build on last year's groundbreaking OSCE \n     conference in Vienna, where governments expressed their \n     willingness to take action. In Berlin we must concentrate on \n     specific steps to which governments and societies commit \n     themselves: collecting and analyzing data on hate crimes, \n     training police and educating children for tolerance, and \n     measuring the effectiveness of these steps. Rather than \n     asking if we can afford to take such steps, we should ask \n     whether we can afford not to when the costs of inaction are \n     so great.\n       We are not fighting anti-Semitism solely in order to \n     protect Jewish people, although the safety of any one group \n     is intrinsic to the safety of all. We are waging this battle \n     because we want to ensure that we do not again sink into \n     barbarity--and we will win this struggle. Democracy is \n     stronger than hate.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. As we wrote then:\n\n       We are not fighting anti-Semitism solely in order to \n     protect Jewish people, although the safety of any one group \n     is intrinsic to the safety of all. We are waging this battle \n     because we want to ensure that we do not again sink into \n     barbarity--and we will win this struggle. Democracy is \n     stronger than hate.\n\n  Today, I continue to repeat this message. We cannot become complacent \nin the fight against anti-Semitism. There is too much at stake.\n  I remain in close contact with the State Department to encourage our \nhighest-ranking diplomats to make the fight against anti-Semitism a top \npriority in our bilateral relationships and interaction with \ninternational organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union and \nthe United Nations.\n  At the end of last month, Under Secretary of State for Political \nAffairs Marc Grossman sent me a letter, in which he outlined some of \nthe positive steps that our Government is taking to combat anti-\nSemitism. This includes our work with the OSCE, as well as efforts \ntaken by United States Ambassadors and other officials in countries \nthroughout the world. This is a priority, now, for our Ambassadors all \nover the world. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthis letter be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Under Secretary of State\n\n\n                                        for Political Affairs,\n\n                                      Washington, August 24, 2004.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: This is to follow up our \n     conversation concerning the Department's efforts to combat \n     anti-Semitism.\n       This Administration recognizes that anti-Semitism is a \n     serious human rights problem and is strongly committed to \n     fighting it. We are taking the following steps to combat \n     anti-Semitism and related violence, using the range of tools \n     at our disposal to advance human rights standards and norms.\n       Reporting: Two annual reports (the ``International \n     Religious Freedom Report'' and the ``Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices'') describe in detail both the trend of \n     anti-Semitism throughout the world as well as the specific \n     anti-Semitism incidents that have occurred during the \n     reporting period. The Department formally reports on anti-\n     Semitism every six months. These reports are posted on \n     embassy websites for public\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\n     dissemination. In our instructions for the 2004 Country \n     Report, we have made explicit the guidelines for reporting \n     acts of violence against Jewish people and Jewish community \n     institutions. Embassies have supplied detailed information on \n     the level of anti-Semitism in their host country.\n       Demarches and Interventions: Our embassies abroad regularly \n     press host countries on combating anti-Semitism, particularly \n     in Europe where anti-Semitism has increased significantly \n     during the past few years. Our ambassadors are very involved \n     in this effort. We also maintain close contact with the local \n     Jewish communities.\n       OSCE: The Department took the lead in convincing the OSCE \n     to sponsor two conferences on combating anti-Semitism (in \n     Vienna in June 2003, in Berlin in April 2004). Secretary \n     Powell participated in the Berlin Conference. As a result of \n     those conferences, the OSCE is implementing a process to \n     monitor and report in a consistent manner on anti-Semitism \n     incidents within the OSCE region.\n       These conferences were the first multilateral gatherings \n     devoted solely to this subject and also the first to deal \n     with anti-Semitism as a human rights issue. They have \n     substantially increased awareness of this serious problem and \n     the need to take strong steps to deal with it.\n       The United States also supports a third anti-Semitism \n     meeting, scheduled for 2005 in Spain, to assess \n     implementation by member states of the OSCE commitments.\n       Public Diplomacy: Department officers regularly address \n     this issue in speeches to foreign audiences, the American \n     public and in testimony before the Congress (see enclosure). \n     The issue of anti-Semitism was a core component of testimony \n     before the Congress on several occasions in recent months.\n       Holocaust Task Force: In 2003-2004, the United States \n     chaired the Task Force for International Cooperation on \n     Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research. This group now \n     comprises 18 countries that promote understanding of the \n     Holocaust as a means to prevent a recurrence of the hatred \n     that resulted in that tragic event.\n       Speaking Out: Our Chiefs of Mission in Europe and Eurasia \n     are under specific instructions to be both vigilant and vocal \n     in denouncing anti-Semitism, and they do so.\n       Multilateral Efforts: The United States has been successful \n     in including anti-Semitism language in several resolutions of \n     the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR). We \n     will continue to press for inclusion of such language at the \n     UNCHR and elsewhere.\n       I hope this overview of Department of State efforts to \n     combat anti-Semitism is helpful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance. We \n     want to work closely with you to end anti-Semitism.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marc Grossman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          The Department of State and Combating Anti-Semitism\n\n       The Department of State has been deeply involved in \n     combating anti-Semitism. Policy level officials most \n     frequently involved in our efforts to stem the tide of anti-\n     Semitism include the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under \n     Secretary for Political Affairs, the Assistant Secretary for \n     European and Eurasian Affairs, the Assistant Secretary for \n     Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the Special Envoy for \n     Holocaust Issues and the Ambassador-at Large for \n     International Religious Freedom.\n       These officials regularly testify before the Congress and \n     make public speeches calling attention to anti-Semitism and \n     the need to combat it.\n       The Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues heads up the staff \n     level work on this issue and coordinates closely with U.S. \n     NGOs. He works particularly closely with the U.S. Ambassador \n     to the OSCE who has represented the United States in the \n     preparations for the separate OSCE conferences on anti-\n     Semitism in Vienna in June 2003 and in Berlin in April 2004.\n       The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor produces \n     two annual reports (International Religious Freedom, Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices), both of which include \n     extensive coverage of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic \n     incidents.\n       Our ambassadors abroad and their staffs engage with host \n     countries on this issue. Ambassadors have mentioned their \n     concern about anti-Semitism in the host country during their \n     initial meetings with the Prime Minister. Our ambassadors \n     speak out forcefully and meet with visiting representatives \n     of American Jewish organizations to review anti-Semitism \n     trends.\n       Senior-level Department officials and officers travel from \n     Washington to our posts in Europe and Eurasia. They meet with \n     representatives of Jewish communities to discuss their \n     concerns first-hand and to demonstrate Washington's strong \n     interest.\n       The Vienna and Berlin OSCE conferences were largely the \n     result of efforts by the United States to have the OSCE focus \n     on anti-Semitism. Secretary Powell addressed the Berlin \n     conference.\n       The conferences and a decision by the December 2003 \n     Ministerial Council led to the establishment of an OSCE \n     program to monitor and report on anti-Semitic developments in \n     the OSCE region. The Conferences also sensitized all of the \n     participants to the reality of the increased level of anti-\n     Semitism in Europe in recent years and also generated \n     considerable publicity on the issue.\n       The Department of State also works assiduously to include \n     this issue in resolutions of the United Nations and its \n     subsidiary bodies. In 2003, the U.S. delegation succeeded in \n     getting language on anti-Semitism into the UN Commission on \n     Human Rights resolution on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Religious Intolerance. In 2004, the Department of State again \n     succeeded in getting mention of the issue in the resolution \n     on the Elimination of All Forms of Religious Intolerance and \n     also in the resolution on The Incompatibility between \n     Democracy and Racism.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the United States Government should be \ncommended for the good work that is being done to raise awareness \nregarding growing anti-Semitism, both at home and abroad. However, our \nwork is not done.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced Senate Bill 2292, the Global Anti-\nSemitism Review Act of 2004. This legislation requires the State \nDepartment to enhance its reporting on anti-Semitism worldwide. It \nrequires the State Department to submit to Congress a report on anti-\nSemitism this November. This report must include detailed information \nfor each country, including, first, a description of physical violence \nagainst or harassment of Jewish people or community institutions, such \nas schools, synagogues, or cemeteries, that occurred in that country, \nand, second, the response of the government of that country to such \nattacks;\n  What are they doing about that?\n  Third, actions by the government of that country to enact and enforce \nlaws relating to the protection of the right to religious freedom with \nrespect to Jewish people; and finally, the efforts by that government \nto promote anti-bias and tolerance education.\n  Following the report this November, my legislation requires enhanced \nreporting on anti-Semitism in two existing annual reports: the \nInternational Religious Freedom Report and the Human Rights Report.\n  The Senate passed this critical legislation with strong, bipartisan \nsupport on May 7, 2004. Twenty-four of my colleagues joined me as co-\nsponsors. This underscores the high priority that the United States \nSenate has given to the fight against anti-Semitism.\n  It is my sincere hope that the House of Representatives will soon \npass this legislation, so that we can see the President sign the Global \nAnti-Semitism Review Act into law this year. We must do all that we can \nto move toward the goal of zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism in the world \ntoday. The United States must be the leader.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I made a vow back in 1982 that if \nthe ugly head of anti-Semitism rose, I would do everything in my power \nto make sure that we cut it off.\n  I want my colleagues to know this is a passion with me, and I hope it \nbecomes a passion with them. It is important to the world, and it is \nimportant to the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my colleague \nfrom Ohio for his passion and for his commitment on this issue. As you \nknow, my colleague from Ohio is very tenacious when he digs into \nsomething. It is easy in many ways, perhaps, for me to speak about \nanti-Semitism. I am of the Jewish faith. It is a very personal issue \nfor me, but if we just talk about it, it is not enough.\n  I have been through Yad Vashem, which is the museum on the Holocaust \nin Israel. And there is part of Yad Vashem that is dedicated to the \nrighteous gentiles, those not of the Jewish faith who showed great \ncourage and at times risked their lives and were outspoken in \nopposition to the Holocaust and helped the Jewish people and other \nvictims of the Holocaust.\n  I have a deep and profound respect for my colleague from Ohio for all \nthat he has done. That passion is real. It is reflected in all he does, \nand it is greatly appreciated by all of us concerned about this issue.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, over 200 year ago, it was written:\n\n       The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is \n     eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is \n     at once the consequence of his crime and the punishment of \n     his guilt.\n\n  Mr. Jefferson came up with the short version: Eternal vigilance is \nthe price of liberty.\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n  The message is clear and it is urgent. We need to be constantly on \nthe look out for hatred of any kind. And like the spouting of a \ndangerous weed, we need to deal with it when it is small and before it \ngrows.\n  That is why a number of us have taken the floor to call attention to \na disturbing rise in incidents of anti-Semitism. This is not a fringe \nexpression of free speech. It is the leading edge of danger that has \nappeared all too often in the last 2,000 years of human history.\n  One of the ironies of this subject lies in the word ``anti-Semitic.'' \nIn common usage it means prejudice or bigotry against Jews. But when \nyou look up the root word ``Semite,'' you see it refers to members of \nthe Jewish and Arab peoples. Strictly speaking to be ``anti-Semitic'' \ncould mean expressing hatred of Arabs.\n  That illustrates an important point. A statement of hatred against \nany group of people should be abhorred by freedom loving people from \nevery group. Because hatred has a way of spreading and hurting people \nall around its intended target.\n  As Dr. King wrote in his famous letter from the Birmingham jail, \n``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''\n  Six million Jews were killed in Europe during the Holocaust. We vowed \nwe would never let it happen again.\n  But the new millennium has brought to Europe a wave of anti-Semitism \nunlike anything we have seen since the 1930s.\n  In France, which is home to Europe's largest Jewish community--with \nabout 600,000--there have been and continue to be more anti-Semitic \nattacks than elsewhere in Europe. Just last month the Jewish cemetery \nin Lyon was spray-painted with swastikas, and other anti-Semitic \nsymbols. In Paris this spring, a 12-year-old girl coming out of a \nJewish school was attacked by two men who carved a swastika into her \nface.\n  Excuses abound for the rise in European anti-Semitism: The changing \ndemography of Europe, as more Muslim immigrants arrive; anger about the \nrenewed Intifada between Israel and the Palestinians; anti-Americanism \nor anti-globalism manifest as anti-Semitic behavior; and a resurgence \nof Neo-Nazis and skinhead movements.\n  At the end of the day, though, there is simply no excuse. Anti-\nSemitism takes many forms: defaming of Jewish cemeteries; arson of \nsynagogues and Jewish schools; Holocaust denial or inadequate Holocaust \neducation; biased media coverage; and graffiti that says \n``Sharon=Hitler.'' This comparison is not only grossly unfair to the \nIsraeli Prime Minister, but more ominously minimizes what Hitler did \nand stood for. Ominously in this country, we have seen bumper stickers \nmaking similar comparisons with our President.\n  The winning entry in the British Political Cartoon Society's 2003 \ncompetition was a picture of Ariel Sharon eating the head of a \nPalestinian baby with a burning city in the background. ``What's \nwrong,'' reads the caption, ``you've never seen a politician kissing a \nbaby?''\n  This is not humor, this is hate.\n  Some will say, ``Surely a person can criticize the policies of the \nIsraeli government without being an anti-Semite?'' And the answer is of \ncourse, yes.\n  But when criticism of Israel is so prevalent and one-sided, when \nfully one-third of votes at the U.N. General Assembly criticize Israel \nand Israel only, when a European public opinion poll finds Israel to be \nconsidered the top threat to world peace--ahead of North Korea or Iran, \nwhen a U.N. conference in South Africa on racism devolves into a \ndiatribe against Israel--and only Israel, when even non-violent \nresponses by the government of Israel to defend its citizens against \nterrorism are disparaged, then you have a problem.\n  Natan Sharansky--a great man for his advocacy for the Soviet Jews and \ntoday an Israeli government official--has talked about three ways to \ndetermine whether criticism of Israel rises to the level of anti-\nSemitism. He talks about three Ds: Demonization, double standards, and \ndelegitimization:\n  Demonization--when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion \nthat the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil;\n  Double Standards--when Israel is criticized soundly for things any \nother government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting \nits citizens from terrorism;\n  Deligitimization--a denial of Israel's right to exist or the right of \nthe Jewish people to aspire to live securely in a homeland.\n  When European criticism of Israel is so one-sided and so filled with \nexaggeration, it reflects a broader bias. And while this kind of \ncriticism of Israel may not always equal anti-Semitism, it certainly \ncreates an atmosphere that tolerates and breeds anti-Semitism.\n  In recent years, Europe has seen a marked increase in anti-Semitism, \nbut Europe is not alone. Anti-Semitism abounds in the Middle East. It \nabounds in the Nadrasas, the schools, that teach hate. We have our own \nproblems here in the United States, particularly on our college \ncampuses. And one of the deadliest acts of terror in South America \nremains the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community Center in \nArgentina--a crime for which not one perpetrator has yet been brought \nto justice.\n  The good news is that things in Europe have improved in the last \nyear, and the key to that improvement is leadership.\n  The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe has held \nimportant conferences on anti-Semitism. My colleague from Ohio has \ntalked about that, introducing into the Record some of the evidence of \nthe works which have drawn attention to anti-Semitism and those that \nhave led to the identification of anti-Semitism as a specific human \nrights issue as well as a commitment to track anti-Semitic incidents in \norder to build a better understanding of the problem.\n  French President Jacques Chirac, to his credit, has said when a Jew \nis attacked in France, it is an attack on the whole of France. He is \nright, not just because it is so morally repugnant to target any one \ngroup for this kind of violence and hate but because Jews are the \ncanary in the coal mine. Remember, Hitler was not satisfied to simply \nwipe out the Jews; he set his sights on the disabled, gypsies, Blacks, \nand others.\n  Let me reflect about the situation in the United States, particularly \non our college campuses. College is supposed to be a place where young \npeople are exposed to diverse experiences and other peoples. \nTragically, anti-Semitism in America has found a home on college \ncampuses. There, anti-Semitism at times is fashionable and politically \ncorrect. We can forget about diversity of opinion when it comes to \nIsrael.\n  On our campuses, anti-Semitism looks like virulently anti-Israel \nprofessors of Middle Eastern studies; harassment of Jewish students; \npro-Palestinian rallies have crossed the line into anti-Semitism, with \nslogans like ``Hitler did not finish the job;'' fliers around campuses \ndepicting Palestinian children slaughtered according to Jewish rites \nunder American license; vandalism of Hillel buildings at Rutgers in \nSeptember of this year, at UC Berkeley in the winter of 2002, at the \nUniversity of Colorado in March of 2002 and again in September of that \nyear.\n  The poster behind me is of a photograph taken at Cornell University: \nWeapons of mass destruction. Leader is a war criminal. U.N. resolution \noccupies foreign countries, with a notation ``bomb Israel.''\n  It crosses the line. This is not about free speech. This is about \nhate. This is not something we should see on college campuses, but we \ndo, far too often. That is unfortunate. That is wrong.\n  A professor at UC Berkeley presented the following course description \nfor a poetry class:\n\n       The brutal Israeli military occupation of Palestine \n     [ongoing] since 1948, has systematically displaced, killed, \n     and maimed millions of Palestinian people. And yet from under \n     the brutal weight of occupation, Palestinians have produced \n     their own culture and poetry of resistance . . . This class \n     takes as a starting point the right of Palestinians to fight \n     for their own self-determination.\n\n  That is for a poetry class. And the posting ends with the suggestion, \n``Conservative thinkers are encouraged to seek other sections.''\n  In 2001 to 2002, anti-Semitic incidents at college campuses increased \nto a worrisome 24 percent, according to the Stephen Roth Institute at \nTel Aviv University.\n  I read an account of a Berkeley student, Micki Weinberg, who was \nwalking\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\nto campus September 12, 2001, the day after the horrific attacks on our \nNation. At the entrance to the campus there were huge sheets of blank \npaper spread out at an impromptu memorial for students, faculty, and \nothers to write thoughts. He saw a message written in big letters. \nMicki Weinberg set out to add his own thoughts, until he saw one \nmessage written in big letters: ``It's the Jews, stupid.''\n  In closing, I return to the idea that hatred against Jewish people is \neveryone's concern. I was in Israel a couple weeks ago. The vision that \nthis President has and so many have had is Israel living side by side \nwith a Palestinian state, people free to live their lives and raise \ntheir families and grow up with the sense of safety and security. That \nis what it is about. Safety and security is a prelude to peace and \npeople living together, but the level of hatred, which in the end is a \ndenial of the existence of Israel, simply goes too far. That level of \nhatred is spread throughout Europe. It has spread to college campuses. \nIt is wrong.\n  The Reverend Martin Niemoller was a Lutheran pastor living in Germany \nin the 1930s. His words should be taken to heart by all:\n\n       First they came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up, \n     because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, \n     and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came \n     for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up, because I was a \n     Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was \n     no one left to speak up for me.\n\n  We have seen genocide in Europe. We have seen it in Rwanda. We are \nseeing it today in Sudan. We need to speak up against hatred wherever \nit rears its head because it literally threatens everyone. The question \nis, How do we get the hate genie back in the bottle? The genie is out. \nThere is too much hatred. We see it all around us. We see it certainly \nin what we are seeing today with anti-Semitism. We are seeing it on the \nAmerican political scene. We have to get the genie of hate back in the \nbottle. We can do it by educating. We can do it by strengthening our \nfamilies. We can do it by strengthening our faith, by doing what we are \ndoing today, speaking out on the floor in the hallowed Halls of this \ngreat institution and telling the people of this country and telling \nthe people of this world that anti-Semitism is wrong, that we must do \nall in our power to speak out and make sure it stops. And when it does, \nthe world will be a safer and better place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be in the Senate today with \nmy colleague, Norm Coleman. Norm is one of my esteemed new colleagues \nand can speak with considerable insight on the issue of anti-Semitism, \nas he hails from the Jewish faith and genealogy. I honor him for being \ndown here speaking about an issue that has been a cancer in the human \nsoul for a long time, and that is anti-Semitism.\n  I learned at my mother's knee to fight against bigotry and \ndiscrimination. I am not Jewish. I was born into the Mormon faith to \nMormon parents who in our history knew something of persecution. In \nfact, many of my Jewish families are surprised to learn that \nextermination orders have actually been ordered before, even before the \npogroms that have beset the tribes of Judah. They were once issued by a \nGovernor of Missouri on the Mormon pioneers, and they set about \nexterminating them and drove them literally from what was then the \nUnited States.\n  So as a young boy, I had an interest in history. I would watch \nnewsreels of what had recently happened in Germany to the Jewish \npeople. I had a particular sensitivity to that and, again, learned from \nmy mother to befriend the children of Israel.\n  But what besets the human heart in the form of anti-Semitism is \nancient in its origin, even prophesied in Jewish history and Scripture. \nThis morning, as I contemplated Rosh Hashanah, which is the new year, \nthe beginning of the world in the Jewish calendar, I turn to a verse of \nScripture that I remember reading many times throughout my life, and \nthat is in the 49th chapter of Genesis where the prophet Jacob is \ngiving blessings to his twelve sons. We know the names of Abraham, \nIsaac, and Jacob, and Jacob had four wives. His first wife was Leah, \nand Leah bore him a number of sons, but one of them was named Judah. \nThe blessing that Jacob gave to Judah is very instructive. He says:\n\n       Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand \n     shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children \n     shall bow down before thee.\n       Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art \n     gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old \n     lion; who shall rouse him up?\n       The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver \n     from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall \n     the gathering of the people be.\n\n  If you can break down that language, you will understand that Judah \nwas a leader among the sons of Jacob, and in this patriarchal blessing \nhe was given a leadership role, and he was to be, and his descendants, \nsomething of a thorn in the neck of his enemies.\n  The Torah is full of promises, predictions, prophecies of the \nDiaspora, of the affliction of the Tribe of Judah. Indeed, there are \nplaces in the Torah where it says that all nations will be turned \nagainst Israel. The question for us, as human beings and as Americans, \nis, do we turn against Israel?\n  I have regarded it as one of the important cornerstones of American \nforeign policy, that since the Holocaust in the Second World War, the \nAmerican Nation has stood by the Tribe of Judah in the form of the \nState of Israel, defended its right to exist, and been an ally to it in \nits darkest days.\n  The feelings of anti-Semitism in this world, they ebb and they flow. \nBut I would suggest to you, and all listening, Mr. President, that \nanti-Semitism is something of a barometer of the human heart. And when \nwe have those feelings, we are on the wrong side. We need not have \nthose feelings. We must not have those feelings because if too many \nAmericans do, the American Nation will join other nations who turn on \nthe State of Israel and the Tribe of Judah.\n  So, for me, I guess you can discern from my remarks this is a \nprinciple of faith, it is a belief that I hold deeply, that part of my \npublic service has, as a cornerstone, friendship to the Jewish people. \nSo as I contemplate what is happening in the world today, as nations \nturn against Israel again, I am determined to push back. And I am \ndetermined to speak out against vicious lies that have been told for \ncenturies against the Jewish people. I would like to share a few of \nthem with you.\n  I touched briefly upon the depravity of the Second World War, that \nresulted in the misery and death of 6 million Jews. Yet that spirit \nthat led to such a policy exists in some places even still. \nUnfortunately, it exists in many of the lands of the Middle East.\n  Let me give you a few examples.\n  In November and December of 2002, Egypt aired on state television a \nseries based on the forged and notorious anti-Semitic tract, the so-\ncalled ``Protocols of the Elders of Zion.'' The ``Protocols of the \nElders of Zion'' is a fraudulent document that reported the alleged \nproceedings of a 19th century conference of Jews during which they \ndiscussed plans to overthrow Christianity and control the world. It has \nbeen proven a fraud time and again. Yet some governments of civilized \nnations continue to propagate this heinous lie.\n  The Saudi Government daily newspaper Al-Riyadh, in a March 2002 \narticle titled ``The Jewish Holiday of Purim,'' charged that Jews used \nthe blood of non-Jewish youngsters in preparing their pastries for the \nPurim holiday.\n  To be precise, the columnist writes:\n\n       Before I go into the details, I would like to clarify that \n     the Jews' spilling human blood to prepare pastry for their \n     holidays is a well-established fact, historically and \n     legally, all throughout history. This was one of the main \n     reasons for the persecution and exile that were their lot in \n     Europe and Asia at various times.\n\n  That is a hideous lie. Yet it is reported in a newspaper in Saudi \nArabia.\n\n  Also reported in this same paper, Al-Riyadh, a Saudi Crown Prince \nremarked to a gathering of leading government officials and academics \nin Jeddah that ``Zionists'' and ``followers of Satan'' are to blame for \nrecent terrorist attacks in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular, \na May 1 terrorist attack on foreign oil workers in the city of Yanbu \nthat killed 6 people and injured 25.\n  This was done by al-Qaida, not the Jews. Yet a Crown Prince of Saudi \nArabia felt to blame it on the Jews. Specifically, the Crown Prince \nsaid: ``Zionism is behind everything.''\n\n[[Page S9251]]\n\n  Another issue, a journal titled ``The Muslim Soldier,'' which is \npublished by the Religious Affairs Department of the Saudi Armed \nForces, recently contained an article claiming:\n\n       The majority of revolutions, coups d'etat, and wars which \n     have occurred in the world, those that are occurring, and \n     those that will occur, are almost entirely the handiwork of \n     the Jews. They turned to [these methods] in order to \n     implement the injunctions of the fabricated Torah, the \n     Talmud, and the ``Protocols [of the Elders of Zion],'' all of \n     which command the destruction of all non-Jews in order to \n     achieve their goal--namely, world domination.\n\n  Again, these are disgusting lies that are propagated supposedly by \nSyria's people.\n  The author of an article in an Egyptian Government daily titled ``The \nLie About the Burning of the Jews'' defended his piece on Egyptian \ntelevision by saying:\n\n       This article was scientific research, which relied on many \n     European and American sources concerning this lie, one of the \n     lies upon which the State of Israel was established--the lie \n     about the burning of the Jews in the Nazis' ovens.\n\n  I have been to those ovens. I have been to Auschwitz. I have seen the \npictures. I have seen the ashes. Any representation like that must be \nrefuted in places like this.\n  And in Syria, according to the State Department's 2003 International \nReligious Freedom Report, the:\n\n       Government primarily cites tense relations with Israel as \n     the reason for barring Jews from government employment and \n     for exempting them from military service obligations.\n\n  Despite the fact that state-sponsored anti-Semitism is more prevalent \nin the Arab world, it unfortunately exists in other countries as well. \nIn certain states of India, schools are required to use textbooks that \ncondone Nazism, including detailing its achievements and omitting any \nreference to Nazi extermination policies or concentration camps.\n  In Belarus, anti-Semitic literature is sold in government buildings \nand in stores directly connected with the Belarusian Orthodox Church.\n  The fact that this kind of hatred exists in the hearts of some people \nis something that we unfortunately are unable to control. But what we \ncan do, what we must do, is express our distaste and indeed our \nrevulsion that governments around the world feel it is appropriate to \npromote such hatred.\n  At the G-8 summit in Sea Island, Georgia, this June, President Bush \nreached out to our allies to establish a Partnership with the Broader \nMiddle East and North Africa in an effort to advance freedom, \ndemocracy, and prosperity in the region. I support the President's \napproach for peace in the Middle East, and I believe it will only occur \nif the countries at stake are working together.\n  So I ask, if governments are actively supporting anti-Semitism and \neven, at times, the destruction of the Jewish state, how will they be \nable to convince their populations that peaceful coexistence with \nIsrael is an appropriate course of action? How will they expect their \nchildren to live in harmony with their Jewish peers? How will they ever \nreconcile their malevolent views of the Jewish people?\n  State-sponsored anti-Semitism around the world is a sinister fact \nwith potentially devastating consequences. We must work tirelessly to \nhighlight its insidious nature at every opportunity. And there are many \nfriends in the Jewish community who ought to be thanked for their \nefforts to try to stem the tide of anti-Semitism: Specifically, Jess \nHordes and Abe Foxman at the Anti-Defamation League for their work on \nthis vital front as well as many of my colleagues here who stand in the \nSenate to bring attention to this issue.\n\n  Anti-Semitism cannot take root unless it starts in our hearts \nindividually. If it starts in our hearts individually, it goes to our \nhomes, our neighborhoods, our schools, and then it hits into our \ngovernments. That America never be one of those governments turned \nagainst Israel is my hope and my prayer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to adjourn for the \nJewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, I would like to address a recent rise \nin anti-Semitic events abroad.\n  In the 50 years since the atrocities committed against the Jewish \npeople in Europe during World War II, we have seen other occasional \nincidents of anti-Semitism. While anti-Israelism and anti-Semitism are \nregrettably still commonplace in the Middle East, recent events in \nFrance and Indonesia have shown us these feelings of intolerance are on \nthe rise internationally.\n  Israel has a unique position in the modern world. Its cities and \nlandmarks are sacred to Christian, Jewish, and Muslims cultures. And \ntoday, as throughout much of recorded history, it is a land struggling \nto find peace. Yet despite the conflicts of history and culture, Israel \nhas had the courage to stand strong with the United States of America \nas an ally in the war on terror and a pillar of strength in an unstable \nregion.\n  Anti-Semitism, racism, and bigotry all serve to undermine the efforts \nof peace loving people throughout the world. These misguided prejudices \nare chains that hold us back from compromise and harmony. The people of \nAmerica, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia should not accept \nthe anti-Semitism that has become all too prevalent in the world. As we \nwork toward peace it is important that people from all nations approach \ninternational relations with an open mind.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate have brought attention \nto the growing problem of anti-Semitism in the world today. As several \nof our colleagues celebrate the Jewish New Year this coming week, let \nus all take the time to think about ways we can promote understanding \nand acceptance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9251-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9251-S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROSH HASHANAH\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this evening, Jewish families and \ncommunities will come together to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish \nNew Year, and offer their prayers for a sweet and peaceful year ahead.\n  Growing up in Aberdeen, my family was close to three Jewish families, \nthe Franks, Feinsteins, and the Preds. They introduced me to the Rosh \nHashanah celebration. I have always remembered the warmth of their \ncelebration as well as the generosity and friendship they offered to a \nyoung Catholic boy growing up in the neighborhood.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to extend my wishes for a Shana \nTova, a good year, to my friends in the Jewish community across the \ncountry and around the world.\n  This year, Rosh Hashanah arrives at an auspicious anniversary. This \nmonth, we mark the 350th anniversary of the first Jewish settlement in \nAmerica.\n  In September of 1654, a small ship carrying 23 Jews from Brazil \narrived at the southern tip of Manhattan.\n  They had been told of a new land founded in the name of religious \nfreedom. So this small group of settlers set out across the ocean to \nfind a home where they could live in peace and follow the tenets of \ntheir faith and the dictates of their conscience.\n  As has been the case with so many immigrants of every faith, from \nevery part of the world and every generation since, they found that \nhome in America.\n  Throughout the generations, the American Jewish community has been a \nleader in the effort to ensure that the fundamental American value of \nreligious freedom is honored and protected.\n  While the history of the American Jewish community offers this Rosh \nHashanah a special sweetness, the Jewish community and its friends \nwelcome the High Holy Days with a certain anxiety, as well.\n  While Israel has taken important steps toward increasing its own \nsecurity, Israeli families still live under the shadow of terrorism, \nand the Palestinian Authority has yet to take concrete steps to end the \nviolence.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, two simultaneous attacks by Hamas suicide bombers \ntook the lives of 16 Israelis. It came as a terrible reminder of the \nfear that continues to pervade the lives of Israelis.\n  In addition, friends of Israel have also watched with growing concern \nas Iran, which is sworn to the destruction of the Jewish state, takes \nsteps toward becoming a nuclear power.\n  The instability in Iraq, if not brought under control, may one day \nthreaten\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\nthe stability of that entire region, including Israel.\n  At the same time, Jews throughout the world have watched as the \nterrible specter of anti-Semitism re-emerges in Europe. Jewish \ncemeteries have been vandalized. Synagogues and Jewish schools have \nbeen the targets of terrorism. School children have been attacked for \nno other reason than they were identified as Jews.\n  At the recent Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism held by the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Elie Wiesel \nexpressed the shock and surprise shared by many of us who hoped that \nEurope could not so soon forget the history and lessons of the \nHolocaust.\n  ``Had any pessimist told me,'' Wiesel said, ``that in my lifetime, I \nwould hear stories of Jews in Berlin or Paris being advised by friends \nnot to wear a [skullcap] in the street so as not to attract hostility \nand peril, I would not have believed it. But it now has become \nreality.''\n  Wiesel concluded by warning the conferees that ``the history of \nNazism teaches us that hatred is like cancer. It often grows \nunderground, and when detected it is too late. If unchecked \nimmediately, it will invade its natural surroundings. What began in the \nmind will destroy the brain. Then the heart.''\n  The OSCE's Berlin Declaration, calling for a coordinated, \ninternational response against the crimes of anti-Semitism and racism, \nwas an important step forward for Europe and the world. But its words \nmust be backed with real action and commitment.\n  It is not enough to speak out against racist attacks. Wherever the \ncrime of anti-Semitism is committed, the world has a shared \nresponsibility to ensure the perpetrators are punished.\n  Therefore, I have asked the U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom to follow through on each of the recommendations of \nthe Berlin Declaration.\n  In addition, later today Senator Dodd and I will send a letter to the \nCommission calling on it to investigate why 10 years after the bombing \nof the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, none of the terrorists \nresponsible have been brought to justice.\n  The United States must make a clear statement. If you wish to be a \nmember of the family of nations, you cannot turn a blind eye to the \nviolence of anti-Semitism and racism.\n  We are all bound by a common obligation to fight for justice and to \nfight for peace. And in a way, Rosh Hashanah can serve as a reminder of \nthese shared responsibilities.\n  This year also represents another anniversary celebrated by Americans \nand the American Jewish community in particular. 2004 marks the \ncentennial of the birth of one of America's greatest writers and \nstorytellers, Isaac Bashevis Singer.\n  In a story entitled, ``Joy,'' Singer tells of a Rabbi from a small \nRussian village who suffers the loss of each of his six children. His \nfaith is shaken, and he turns his back on his tradition and community. \nOn the eve of Rosh Hashana, he sees a vision of his youngest daughter \nwho had died many years earlier, and his faith is restored. He \nimmediately goes to the synagogue and asks to speak. Because of the \nlunar calendar, Rosh Hashana always coincides with the new moon. So he \nasks, what is the meaning of the fact that ``the moon is obscured on \nRosh Hashanah?''\n  The answer, he says, is that ``on Rosh Hashana one prays for life, \nand life means free choice, and freedom is mystery. . . . If hell and \nparadise were in the middle of the marketplace, everyone would be a \nsaint.\n  ``Of all the blessings bestowed on man, the greatest lies in the fact \nthat God's face is hidden from him.\n  ``Men are the children of the Almighty, and He plays hide and seek \nwith them. He hides His face, and the children seek Him, while they \nhave faith that He exists.''\n  In a way, the search that Singer speaks of connects us all. \nIndividually and as a nation we try to find the wisdom and the courage \nto do what is right, and to extend justice here at home and throughout \nthe world.\n  The way may not always be clear. But alongside our friends in the \nJewish community, this Rosh Hashana we can recommit ourselves to \ncreating a world where no one, anywhere in the world, suffers the kind \nof persecution and violence that led that small band of Jewish settlers \nto flee half way across the world more than 350 years ago. The memory \nof their voyage and the beginning of Rosh Hashana remind us of this \nhistoric aspect of our Nation's role in the world, and call us back to \nour duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9252-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today marks the 10th anniversary of the \nViolence Against Women Act. We are also coming up on the 2nd \nanniversary of the loss of two champions of the fight to end domestic \nviolence.\n  Senator Paul Wellstone was a key leader in the bipartisan effort to \npass the Violence Against Women Act. And, as she was in every great \ncause he took on, Sheila Wellstone was Paul's indispensable partner. \nPaul and Sheila's commitment to ending domestic violence continues \ntoday through the work of Wellstone Action and the Sheila Wellstone \nInstitute. This morning, Paul and Sheila's work was recalled at a \ngathering here in the Capitol of people who are working to protect \nAmerica's families from domestic violence. We applaud them.\n  Much good has come about because of the Violence Against Women Act. \nThere are more domestic abuse hotlines today than there were 10 years \nago, and more shelters. There are more doctors, nurses, therapists, \nteachers, police officers, judges and others today who recognize the \nsigns of domestic violence, and know how to help if they see those \nsigns. We have made progress. But there is more we need to do.\n  Each year, more than 1 million women in America are victims of \ndomestic violence, and more than 3 million American children witness \ndomestic violence every year. Protecting the victims of domestic \nviolence is essential but it is not enough. Next year, when Congress \nreauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act, we need to do more to \nprevent domestic violence, and to help the children who witness such \nviolence. It's the only way we will ever break the cycle of violence.\n  In South Dakota, in Rapid City and on the Pine Ridge Reservation, a \nnonprofit organization called Sacred Circle is helping to break the \ncycle of violence by providing domestic violence prevention and \nintervention services. There are similar organizations doing good work \nin communities all across America--native and non-native, rich and \npoor.\n  On this 10th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, we thank \nthose organizations for the life-saving work they are doing. We \nacknowledge the victims and survivors of domestic violence. And let us \nalso vow to do even more to finally break the cycle of domestic \nviolence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9252-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9252-S9257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROSH HASHANAH AND HOPE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is entirely appropriate that the \nSenate pause today at the celebration of Rosh Hashanah. This, the \npeople's body--the House of Representatives and the Senate--demonstrate \ntheir great respect for a very important Jewish holiday that symbolizes \nso much that is important not only in terms of their faith, but also \nunderlies a very important value and spirit of this country, and that \nis the spirit of hope and optimism, portrayed by the dipping of apples \ninto honey, symbolizing that one is going to have a better, more \nhopeful, and sweeter year. It is a message of hope, and it reminds us \nof a long tradition that hope is deeply rooted in a spiritual setting. \nIt is entirely appropriate for us as a nation as well to share that \nsense with our Jewish friends, and also draw lessons from that very \nspecial occasion.\n  So I pay tribute to all of our friends who are celebrating this \nspiritual holiday today and thank them again for reminding us as a \nnation and reminding the world of that extraordinary spirit, which is \nreflected in that tradition and which is symbolized today in Israel in \nits continued struggle for existence and for religious liberty.\n  Mr. President, I speak today about this issue of hope, and where it \nis and where it is not in terms of our own society, and what I think we \nshould be attempting to do about it.\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\n  I believe we ought to take a look at what is being represented to the \nAmerican people, particularly on the issues of the economy. Under our \nconstitutional system, we are in a period where we will be making \njudgments as to the course we are charting for the future. I believe, \non the one hand, that we do have a road toward hope, particularly for \nworking families. I think the last 3 years has been a road of burden \nand a quaky road for hard-working Americans.\n  I review the record for the Senate again and for the American people \nas we are looking forward to these next 6 or 7 weeks and making \njudgments and decisions about the direction that we should follow. I \ndon't think it is anywhere clearer than in the state of our economy and \nwhat has happened to average working Americans in our Nation. There has \nbeen an economic squeeze that has resulted in American families working \nharder, working longer, and falling further and further behind. It \ndoesn't have to be this way.\n  We have seen at other times when we have had Presidential leadership, \nwhere we have had the strong, expanding, and growing economy, with \neconomic growth and price stability, and the reduction of unemployment. \nWe have seen it in most recent times under President Clinton. We saw it \nin the early 1960s under President Kennedy prior to the time of the \nVietnam war buildup in the latter part of the 1960s.\n  Really, the issues of economic growth, price stability, and economic \nexpansion is directly related to Presidential leadership. What is \nhappening to the middle class today is an extraordinary set of \npressures on working Americans that is giving them an extraordinary \nsqueeze in terms of their sense of hope and optimism in terms of the \nfuture. I have reviewed, in the course of my discussions yesterday, \nwhat is happening in terms of the health care crisis--the fact that \npremiums in the area of Medicare have increased fivefold, five times \nthe increase that seniors are receiving in their Social Security from \ntheir COLA benefits. As a result, the pressure is going onto our \nseniors. But if we look at this chart, which is a reflection of the \nlast year, we will find that health insurance premiums--this is as of \nJuly 2004. We have also seen in the last month that this figure is 11.2 \npercent for employee-provided coverage. But in this year, private \nhealth insurance premiums have gone up 8.5 percent; the cost of tuition \nthis year is up 14.6 percent; housing is up 7.7 percent; and what has \nhappened to wages of workers in real terms is that they are down .9 \npercent.\n  Workers are working longer, families are working harder. Nonetheless, \nwhen you take the indicators, they need the health insurance. And more \noften than not, they have children they are trying to educate, and they \nare finding college tuition going up and the cost of housing is \nincreasing, but their wages are not.\n  Yet we hear time and again that the economy is getting stronger and \nthe economy is getting better. The President says that time and again. \nHe said it just this last week. If you look at this, he said:\n\n       The economy of ours is strong and it's getting stronger.\n\n  He said that on September 13 in Muskegon, MI. Since Bush took office, \nwe have seen 250,000 jobs lost in Michigan, and 80,000 jobs lost in \nColorado. This idea about the economy getting stronger has been \nrepeated time and again over the course of this last year.\n  The President said there would be tax cuts for the middle class and \nthen gave the tax cuts to the wealthy. He said those tax cuts were for \neconomic stimulus, but we know if the President had spent the $700 \nbillion on programs such as unemployment insurance, tax cuts for low-\nwage workers who really need it, instead of giving the $700 billion in \ntax breaks to the wealthy, 2 million more Americans would be employed \ntoday, and economic growth would have been twice as fast.\n  You cannot believe this administration on the economy, and you cannot \ntrust them to do the right thing for the middle class. Middle-class \nworking families are being squeezed in every direction by the Bush \neconomy. And the ability of American families to live the American \ndream is increasingly out of reach with each passing year as they find \nit harder and harder to earn a living, pay a mortgage, pay rent, pay \ntheir medical bills, their food and energy bills, and still send their \nsons and daughters to college.\n\n  Yet we keep hearing only happy talk from the administration. As I \nmentioned, in Muskegon, MI, the President praised the economy: This \neconomy of ours is strong and getting stronger. But still we have seen \nthe loss of jobs. Michigan is one of 44 States that has higher \nunemployment today than when the recession began.\n  A week and a half ago at the Republican convention, the President \nsaid: We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. Our economy is \ngrowing again, creating jobs. Nothing will hold us back. But since the \nPresident took office, the overall number of jobs in the economy has \nfallen by 900,000. Since many of the new jobs created are in the public \nsector, the private sector is down even more, 1.7 million jobs, and \nmanufacturing has been especially hard hit, 2.7 million jobs. President \nBush has the worst job record of any administration since the Great \nDepression.\n  Vice President Cheney has a novel approach to the economy. He said \nthe lackluster economic indicators do not reflect reality because they \ndo not include the hundreds of thousands who make money selling on e-\nBay. That is a source that did not even exist 10 years ago. Cheney told \nan audience in Cincinnati last week that 400,000 people make some money \ntrading on e-Bay.\n  First the Bush administration tried to count hamburger flippers as \nmanufacturing jobs. Now they want to call e-Bay traders an economic \nindicator. No wonder the Vice President told a crowd of workers in New \nHampshire last week: We think we are on the right track and we are \nheaded in the right direction.\n  Tell that to the more than 8 million Americans who are currently \nunemployed, and tell that to the 1.6 million long-term unemployed who \nhave been out of work more than 6 months, more than double when the \nPresident took office.\n  We have to look at these employment figures and what has happened \nover the recent year. This chart shows the job growth of this \nPresident, which is the worst since World War II. These are the total \njob recoveries. This blue line is before 1991. This green line is an \nindicator of what happened with job growth from 1991 to 1993, and the \nred line is the current recovery. This is all from the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis. These are all solid figures. The fact is, we are \ngrowing in employment at a slower rate.\n  Let's just take the total number of jobs in our country in the \nprivate sector. In January 2001, there were 111,609,000 jobs. As of \nAugust 2004, 1.7 million jobs have been lost from 2001 to 2004, and yet \nwe have this administration saying the economy is strong, the economy \nhas never been better, the economy is getting stronger.\n  What planet is this President living on?\n  Let's look at what has happened in terms of the jobs that have been \ncreated. Let's look at what the pay was for the jobs that have been \nreplaced.\n  Mr. President, $51,270 is the average pay for industries that are \nlosing jobs. The new jobs, those in growing industries, pay 41 percent \nless. So here we have a record that is indefensible in terms of the \nnumber of jobs that are out there in the private sector, in particular, \nand then when we look at what the salaries are for people who are \nworking, we find out they are getting paid less when health care costs \nare going through the roof, tuition is going through the roof, and rent \nis going through the roof.\n  What does this mean in real terms? What is happening to American \nfamilies? What with all of these statements that are being made by \nthis President and the Vice President out on the campaign trail, let's \njust look at what has been happening in our country over the last 3 \nyears.\n\n  There are 13 million children hungry or on the verge of hunger, 8 \nmillion Americans unemployed, and nearly 3 million have lost \nunemployment benefits since the Republicans ended the program with $20 \nbillion in surplus in the unemployment compensation fund that these \nworkers paid into.\n  Do you hear me? These workers paid into that fund, and this \nadministration is denying them the ability to draw on it. That is the 3 \nmillion who have lost unemployment benefits and, oh, yes, the economy \nis getting better.\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\n  We have 7 million low-wage workers who have been waiting 7 years for \nan increase in the minimum wage--7 years. I noted last night when I was \nwatching the news that the House of Representatives, under the \nRepublican leadership, just voted itself another pay increase, the \nseventh pay increase since the last time we increased the minimum \nwage--seven pay increases.\n  We cannot even get an up-or-down vote on minimum wage because of the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate of the United States and because of \nthe Republican President. It has only been in the last few years that \nthis has become a partisan issue. President Nixon voted for an increase \nin the minimum wage. President Bush 1 voted for an increase in the \nminimum wage. President Reagan voted for an increase in the minimum \nwage. But not President Bush 2. No, no, we are not going to permit an \nincrease in the minimum wage. We are going to give tax breaks to \nwealthy individuals but nothing in terms of an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  And 6 million workers have lost overtime protections, and in spite of \nthe fact that a bipartisan coalition in the House of Representatives \nand the Senate of the United States rejected that policy, they still \nhave gone forward with it. This chart shows the votes on overtime \nprotection. The Senate voted September 10, 2003, to reject the \nrestrictions on overtime advanced by the administration. The House \nvoted on October 2, 2003, 221 to 203. The Senate voted May 4, 2004, 52 \nto 47. The Senate voted on May 4, 99 to 0. The House voted on September \n9, 2004, 223 to 193. The House of Representatives in a bipartisan vote \nand the Senate in a bipartisan vote said no, and still they are going \nahead. And the President says they are the friends of working families?\n  We heard the administration trying to defend this overtime \nrestriction that it has been long overdue and it will provide greater \nrelief for lower income working families; they will have greater \nstability in their pay increases, and this is a simplification of the \nrules. Always look out when you hear that kind of chatter. Always look \na little behind the rationale for taking such policy.\n  Look at this:\n\n       The National Restaurant Association requests that the \n     Department of Labor include chefs under the creative \n     professional category as well as the learned professional \n     category. . . .\n\n  That was from a National Restaurant Association letter to the \nDepartment of Labor. Here we have the National Restaurant Association \nurging the administration to restrict the coverage of overtime in terms \nof those who are working in the kitchen.\n\n       The Department concludes to the extent a chef has primary \n     duty of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or \n     talent, such chef may be considered an exempt creative \n     professional.\n\n  Here is the association asking the administration to restrict \novertime, and guess what. It is just what the administration did.\n  The list goes on. We have other charts that indicate for other \nindustries as well. That is illustrative. We have 4.3 million more \nAmericans living in poverty.\n  There are 800,000 more children living in poverty today than 2001, \n4.3 million more Americans in total living in poverty. They are against \nany increase in the minimum wage, cutting back on the unemployment \ncompensation that could help these families transition, pay their \nmortgages, pay their bills. No, we are cutting that out. These are \nhard-working Americans who paid in. No, they are not going to get that. \nThat is what they have done. But, no, the economy is strong and getting \nstronger. Yet there are 4.3 million more Americans who are living in \npoverty, 800,000 of them children.\n  I have given the example of what was happening for individual jobs, \nfor contracting industries and expanding industries, the disparity in \npayment in the new jobs. This also affects the household income because \nwe know now that many more women are working and they are participating \nin the market, too. So is it not fair to say, let us look at what has \nhappened in household income?\n  Remember the first chart that showed health care going up through the \nroof, that showed tuition going up through the roof, that showed rent \nor housing going up through the roof? This is what has happened now. In \nthe year 2000, median household income in the United States was \n$44,853. The median income in 2004 is $43,318. It is a drop of $1,500 \nfor average working families in America. That is last year, and this \nyear it goes down even further. And everything is fine for working \nfamilies, for middle-income families?\n  The same administration, again, is against increases in minimum wage, \nunemployment, and against overtime. This is what results. They are \nshipping jobs overseas, and they support a Tax Code that the \nadministration knows has loopholes which they refuse to close down. \nThis is what is happening.\n  Let me give a couple of other indicators of what is happening to \nmiddle-income families. Look what has happened to gasoline. I do not \nknow how it is in South Carolina, but I know how it is in \nMassachusetts, and that is that many workers have to drive many miles \nin order to get employment. That has been fairly consistent. We had \ngreat pockets of significant unemployment for years. The interstate \nsystem and rail have opened up some hope and some opportunities, and \nhere we find out what has happened with gas. Gas has gone up 23 percent \nin 2004, and the wages again are down. They pay more in terms of gas.\n  One of the most extraordinary things that absolutely amazes me is \nwhat has happened to milk. When I was home in Massachusetts a week ago \nin a grocery store, milk was $4.11 a gallon. I do not know, maybe it is \na little bit less in some other parts of the country, but how in the \nworld, when one is making $5.15 an hour, does a family or a single mom \nafford a gallon of milk in order to provide for their child? How do \nthey do that with milk prices going up? These are the real economic \nindicators.\n  That is why the credibility of this administration, when it says \neverything is rosy, the economy is fine, is no better than it was when \nit misrepresented the facts in Iraq. They misrepresented, distorted, \ndeceived the American people as to what was happening in Iraq and \nbrought us into the terrible quagmire we are facing today, and the same \nis true with regards to the economy. It is incompetency, and that is \nwhat has been happening.\n  Well, we can say, all right, Senator Kennedy, look, there has \ncertainly been some increase for the workers with jobs. Well, let us \nlook at productivity. Let us look at the American workers. Is it the \nAmerican workers' fault?\n  This chart is from the Economic Policy Institute, their analysis of \ndata from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is what is happening \nfrom 2001 through 2004 in the areas of productivity and wages. \nHistorically, when we have had an increase in productivity, we have \nseen wages go up. I can put five more charts up going on back to the \npostwar period and they would all reflect the fact that with increase \nin productivity, there are increased wages, but not under the Bush \nadministration. Workers are more productive today than they have ever \nbeen, but do my colleagues think that has been reflected in wages? \nAbsolutely not. Why? No overtime, cutting back on the overtime. And \nbecause of the minimum wage, failing to get the bump for those who are \nworking at the lower wage. This productivity represents the greatest \ngap we have had since the Great Depression, and there is a squeeze on \nthe wages of the American economy. But, no, no, this economy is strong \nand getting stronger.\n\n  Well, it is for some in America, and this chart indicates who the \neconomy is getting strong and stronger for. All one has to do is look \nat this chart from 2001 through 2004 and see where the workers' efforts \nare going. I just showed what was happening in productivity. Well, look \nwhat has happened. Corporate profits, their share has gone up 65 \npercent. They have effectively swallowed up all of the productivity. Do \nmy colleagues think they have shared it with the American workers? \nAbsolutely not. They have sucked all of that productivity up in these \ncorporate profits. What does the administration say? Look, the economy \nis getting along fine. It is working well. It is strong and it is \ngetting stronger. As a result of this, it is no mystery about what has \nbeen happening in America.\n  This shows the pay of the average CEO. We now have the highest paid \ndisparity between CEOs and the average\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\nworker. The average worker makes $26,000, and the difference is 300 \ntimes, and that is what is happening.\n  I will show what has happened historically when I was talking about \nthe increase in productivity, and then what we have seen is the \nincrease in corporate earnings that has reached the record figures. \nLook what happened during the average last eight recoveries: Corporate \nprofits went up 14 percent, wages 8.6 percent. That is what has \nhappened really over the period of the last 50 years--the corporate \nprofits went up and wages went up.\n  Look what has happened in the current recovery. Corporate profits are \nup 39.6 percent, and workers' wages lost five-tenths of 1 percent. Oh, \nthe economy is fine.\n  Does it begin to have a ring, I say to my friends? Take any \nindicator--wages, productivity, what is happening with minimum wage, \nunemployment compensation, and overtime--take any indicator in terms of \nwhere working families are in this economy and they are falling further \nand further behind.\n  One of the areas that I feel so strongly about is the issue of the \nincrease in the minimum wage. I have been proud to be a sponsor of the \nincreases since I arrived in the Senate in the early 1960s. We have had \nsome success, in a bipartisan way, trying to get the minimum wage up so \npeople do not have to live in poverty. Without the increase in the \nminimum wage, it is now at $5.15. Its purchasing power by the year 2005 \nwill put it at one of the lowest levels of purchasing power ever.\n\n  Who are these workers with a minimum wage? These are proud men and \nwomen, men and women of dignity. They clean out the great buildings of \nAmerican industry every day. They are assistants to teachers in urban \nand rural areas all across this country. They work at nursing homes, \nlooking after our parents. Our parents are in these nursing homes. \nThese minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity. They have not \ngotten any increase over the period of the last 7 years, in spite of \nthe fact we in the Congress have voted ourselves pay increases six \ntimes, and more recently in the House seven times. Over $20,000 for the \nindividual Members of the House and Senate, but we cannot get a vote on \nraising the minimum wage in the Senate.\n  The issue of minimum wage is a women's issue, because the great \nmajority of those who receive minimum wage are women. The great \nmajority of the women who receive the minimum wage have children, so it \nis a women's issue and a children's issue. It is basically a family \nissue.\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric here about family and family values. The \nminimum wage is a family issue. Will these women, single women for the \nmost part, be able to see their children? No, they have to get two or \nthree jobs. They are lucky if they see their children at all. It is a \nfamily issue.\n  It is a civil rights issue because so many of those who work at the \nminimum wage are women of color. Women's issue, children's issue, civil \nrights issue--but most of all, it is a fairness issue. What the \nAmerican people understand is fairness. What the American people \nunderstand is, if people are ready to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a \nyear, they should not have to live in poverty and their children should \nnot have to live in poverty, either.\n  Oh, no, says President Bush. Oh, no, says President Bush. Oh, no, \nsays the Republican leadership. You can't even have a vote in the \nSenate. When we offered that minimum wage increase on the State \nDepartment reauthorization, what did our Republican friends do? No, no, \nwe are not going to vote; we are scared of that. We pulled the bill. We \npulled the bill, so you are denied the opportunity to vote on it.\n  America, do you hear me? That is this Bush administration and that \nRepublican leadership. They are saying: Oh, the economy is fine. \nEverything is fine. This is a wonderful economy, growing stronger. What \nabout those 7 million men and women at lower level jobs? What about \nthose who have been on unemployment? What about all those who have \ngiven up? We thought we were one country with one history and one \ndestiny. Oh, no.\n  I have described some of what I think are the basic failings of the \ncurrent administration. I want to include in the Record today the \nanswers to many of these failings that my friend and colleague, Senator \nKerry, has proposed. He has done so during the course of the campaign. \nIt is on the Web site. He has outlined in great detail today in Cobo \nHall in Detroit. The article is in the Wall Street Journal today, ``My \nEconomic Policy.'' He outlines what he will do to create jobs. He \nunderstands middle-class taxes and their health care costs.\n  I read into the Record yesterday what President Bush had to say about \nhealth care. I am sure he meant it in a flattering way. He said, out in \nMichigan: And John Kerry has a program that is going to be costly. What \ncan you expect from a Senator from Massachusetts? Ha-ha-ha. And he got \nsome laugher out in the audience on that part.\n  I will tell you what I care about in health care, having battled for \nit for 30 years, and that is every American have the same kind of \nhealth care as President Bush has. That is what I care about. That is \nwhat John Kerry cares about. You can distort it, misrepresent it, which \nPresident Bush did, and then differ with it, which he did as well. That \nis an easy debate technique that is used around here frequently. Let's \nrecognize it for what it is. Distortion, misrepresentation--does this \nhave a ring to it? You didn't get the facts when he came to Iraq, why \nin the world should you believe it when they distort and misrepresent \nJohn Kerry's health care program?\n  There is a basic limitation on American people being able to buy into \nthe kind of health care program that every Member of the Senate and \nHouse has. I wonder how many of those people, the 3,000 or 4,000 people \nout there listening to the President, have the same kind of benefit \nprogram we have? We pay a 25-percent premium and the taxpayers pay 75 \npercent. Wouldn't every American like that one?\n  If we are so concerned about the Federal employees' health insurance, \nlet's give it up and go back, like every other American, except those \n11 million or 12 million of us who are able to get in the Federal \nemployees' program. How about it? Not a chance.\n  So until you do, let's be easy in characterizing John Kerry's \nprogram. Here it is: creation of jobs, cut middle-class health care \ncosts, restore America's competitive edge, cut the deficit, restore \neconomic confidence. I will not read through it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 15, 2004]\n\n                           My Economic Policy\n\n                            (By John Kerry)\n\n       As I travel across this country, I meet store owners, stock \n     traders, factory foremen and optimistic entrepreneurs. Their \n     experiences may be different, but they all agree that America \n     can do better under an administration that is better for \n     business. Business leaders like Warren Buffett, Lee Iacocca \n     and Robert Rubin are joining my campaign because they believe \n     that American businesses will do better if we change our CEO.\n       Since January 2001, the economy has lost 1.6 million \n     private-sector jobs. The typical family has seen its income \n     fall more than $1,500, while health costs are up more than \n     $3,500.\n       Today, American companies are investing less and exporting \n     less than they were in 2000--the first time investment and \n     exports have been down during any presidential term in over \n     70 years. At the same time, our trade deficit has grown to \n     more than 5% of the economy for the first time ever, a \n     troublesome and unsustainable development.\n       The economy still has not turned the corner. Over the last \n     year, real wages are still down and even the jobs created in \n     the past 12 months represent the worst job performance for \n     this period of a recovery in over 50 years. Indeed, the total \n     of 1.7 million jobs created over the last year is weaker than \n     even the worst year of job creation under President Clinton, \n     and below what is needed just to find jobs for new applicants \n     entering the work force.\n       Forty-three months into his presidency, George Bush's main \n     explanation for this dismal economic record is an assortment \n     of blame and excuses. Yet what President Bush cannot explain \n     is how the last 11 presidents before him--Democrats and \n     Republicans--faced wars, recessions and international crises, \n     and yet only he has presided over lost jobs, declining real \n     exports, and the swing from a $5.6 trillion surplus to \n     trillions of dollars of deficits.\n       While the private sector will always be America's engine \n     for innovation and job creation, President Bush has failed to \n     take any\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\n     responsibility for missing opportunities to strengthen the \n     conditions for investment, economic confidence and job \n     creation.\n       When the economy needed short-run stimulus without \n     increasing the long-run deficit, President Bush got it \n     backwards, passing an initial round of tax cuts that \n     Economy.com found had no effect in lifting us out of \n     recession. He then passed more deficit-increasing tax cuts \n     that Goldman Sachs described as ``especially ineffective as a \n     stimulative measure.'' When small businesses and families \n     needed relief from skyrocketing health-care and energy costs, \n     he chose sweetheart deals for special interests over serious \n     plans to reduce costs and help spur new job creation.\n       With the right choices on the economy, America can do \n     better. American businesses and workers are the most \n     resilient, productive and innovative in the world. And they \n     deserve policies that are better for our economy. My economic \n     plan will do the following: (1) Create good jobs, (2) cut \n     middle-class taxes and health-care costs, (3) restore \n     America's competitive edge, and (4) cut the deficit and \n     restore economic confidence.\n       Create good jobs. I strongly believe that America must \n     engage in the global economy, and I voted for trade opening \n     from Nafta to the WTO. But at the same time, I have always \n     believed that we need to fight for a level playing field for \n     America's workers.\n       I am not trying to stop all outsourcing, but as president, \n     I will end every single incentive that encourages companies \n     to outsource. Today, taxpayers spend $12 billion a year to \n     subsidize the export of jobs. If a company is trying to \n     choose between building a factory in Michigan or Malaysia, \n     our tax code actually encourages it to locate in Asia.\n       My plan would take the entire $12 billion we save from \n     closing these loopholes each year and use it to cut corporate \n     tax rates by 5%. This will provide a tax cut for 99% of \n     taxpaying corporations. This would be the most sweeping \n     reform and simplification of international taxation in over \n     40 years. In addition, I have proposed a two-year new jobs \n     tax credit to encourage manufacturers, other businesses \n     affected by outsourcing, and small businesses that created \n     jobs.\n       American businesses are the most competitive in the world, \n     yet when it comes to enforcing trade agreements the Bush \n     administration refuses to show our competitors that we mean \n     business. They have brought only one WTO case for every three \n     brought by the Clinton administration, while cutting trade \n     enforcement budgets and failing to stand up to China's \n     illegal currency manipulation. That not only costs jobs, it \n     threatens to erode support for open markets and a growing \n     global economy.\n       Cut middle-class taxes and health costs. Families are being \n     increasingly squeezed by falling incomes and rising costs for \n     everything from health care to college. But spiraling health-\n     care and energy costs squeeze businesses too, encouraging \n     them to lay off workers and shift to part-time and temporary \n     workers.\n       Under my plan, the tax cuts would be extended and made \n     permanent for 98% of Americans. In addition, I support new \n     tax cuts for college, child care and health care--in total, \n     more than twice as large as the new tax cuts President Bush \n     is proposing.\n       I have proposed a health plan that would increase coverage \n     while cutting costs. It builds on and strengthens the current \n     system, giving patients their choice of doctors, and \n     providing new incentives instead of imposing new mandates.\n       My health plan will offer businesses immediate relief on \n     their premiums. By providing employers some relief on \n     catastrophic costs that are driving up premiums for everyone, \n     we will save employers and workers about 10% of total health \n     premiums.\n       Our hospitals and doctors have the best technology for \n     saving lives, but often still rely on pencil and paper when \n     it comes to tracking medical tests and billing. As a result, \n     we spend over $350 billion a year on red tape, not to mention \n     the cost of performing duplicative or redundant tests. My \n     plan will modernize our information technology, create \n     private electronic medical records, and create incentives \n     for the adoption of the latest disease management.\n       And I won't be afraid to take on prescription drug or \n     medical malpractice costs. We will make it easier for generic \n     drugs to come to market and allow the safe importation of \n     pharmaceuticals from countries like Canada. Finally, we will \n     require medical malpractice plaintiffs to try nonbinding \n     mediation, oppose unjustified punitive damage awards and \n     penalize lawyers who file frivolous suits with a tough \n     ``three strikes and you're out'' rule.\n       This plan will make our businesses more competitive by \n     making our health care more affordable.\n       Restore America's competitive edge. America has fallen to \n     10th in the world in broadband technology. Some of our best \n     scientists are being encouraged to work overseas because of \n     the restrictions on federal funding for stem-cell research. \n     President Bush has proposed cutting 21 of the 24 research \n     areas that are so critical to long-term growth. We need to \n     invest in research because when we shortchange research we \n     shortchange our future.\n       My plan would invest in basic research and end the ban on \n     stem-cell research. It would invest more in energy research, \n     including clean coal, hydrogen and other alternative fuels. \n     It would boost funding at the National Science Foundation and \n     continue increases at the National Institutes of Health and \n     other government research labs. It will provide tax credits \n     to help jumpstart broadband in rural areas and the new \n     higher-speed broadband that has the potential to transform \n     everything from e-government to tele-medicine. I would \n     promote private-sector innovation policies, including the \n     elimination of capital gains for long-term investments in \n     small business start-ups.\n       To ensure we have the workers to compete in an innovation \n     economy, we need more young people to not only enter but \n     complete college, we need more young women and minorities to \n     enter the fields of math and science, and we need to make it \n     easier for working parents to get the lifelong learning \n     opportunities they need to excel at both their current and \n     their future jobs.\n       Cut the deficit and restore economic confidence. When \n     President Bush was in New York for the Republican convention, \n     he did not even pay lip service to reducing the deficit. His \n     record makes even Republicans wary. From missions to Mars to \n     a pricey Medicare bill, President Bush has proposed or passed \n     more than $6 trillion in initiatives without paying for any \n     of them. The record is clear: A deficit reduction promise \n     from George W. Bush is not exactly a gilt-edged bond.\n       Americans can trust my promise to cut the deficit because \n     my record backs up my word. When I first joined the Senate, I \n     broke with my own party to support the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \n     deficit reduction plan, which President Reagan signed into \n     law. In 1993, I cast a deciding vote to bring the deficit \n     under control. And in 1997, I supported the bipartisan \n     balanced budget agreement.\n       I will restore fiscal discipline and cut the deficit in \n     half in four years. First, by imposing caps, so that \n     discretionary spending--outside of security and education--\n     does not grow faster than inflation. If Congress cannot \n     control spending, it will automatically be cut across the \n     board. Second, I will reinstitute the ``pay as you go'' rule, \n     which requires that no one propose or pass a new program \n     without a way to pay for it. Third, I will ask for Congress \n     to grant me a constitutionally acceptable version of line-\n     item veto power and to establish a commission to eliminate \n     corporate welfare like the one John McCain and I have fought \n     for.\n       I am not waiting for next year to change the tone on fiscal \n     discipline. Every day on the campaign trail, I explain how I \n     pay for all my proposals. By rolling back the recent Bush tax \n     cuts for families making over $200,000 per year, we can pay \n     for health care and education. By cutting subsidies to banks \n     that make student loans and restoring the principle that \n     ``polluters pay,'' we can afford to invest in national \n     service and new energy technologies. My new rules won't just \n     apply to programs I don't like; they will apply to my own \n     priorities as well.\n       Cleaning up President Bush's fiscal mess will not be easy, \n     but to ensure a strong and sustainable economic future we \n     have to make the tough choices to move America's growing \n     deficits back in the right direction.\n       On Nov. 2 we will have a national shareholders meeting. On \n     the ballot will be the choice to continue with President \n     Bush's policies or return to the fiscal sanity and pro-growth \n     polices that proved so successful in the 1990s. You will \n     choose.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to review again the circumstances \nwe are facing. We have many Americans in working families working \nlonger and working harder. The fact is, Americans work longer and \nharder than people in most of the industrialized world. We are one of \nthe few--I don't know another one--where we have seen real income for \nworking families drop, as we have seen over the period of the last 3 \nyears.\n  This is an indication of a failed and flawed economic policy. No \nmatter how many times you tell the American people that everything is \nrosy, that is clearly not speaking about Main Street. They may be \ntalking about Wall Street, but they are not talking about Main Street.\n  When we hear the Vice President saying the lackluster economic \nindicators don't reflect the reality because they don't include the \nhundreds of thousands who ``make money selling on eBay, that is a \nsource that didn't even exist 10 years ago,'' and when they try to \ncharacterize flipping hamburgers as ``industrial jobs,'' we are not \ngetting the real story. We are not getting the real story on Iraq. We \nare not getting the real story on health care. We are not getting the \nreal story on education. We are not getting the real story on the \neconomy.\n  I hope the American people will pay careful attention over the next 6 \nweeks and try to understand the real story. When they do, I believe \nJohn Kerry will have their support.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, I rise to speak this morning about a \nvery important issue for the country, particularly for the gulf coast \nregion and the State of Louisiana.\n  Madam President, as you know, although your State of Alaska is not \nlocated in the southern part of the Nation, you and other members of \nsociety are well aware of the devastation that occurred to our coastal \ncommunities, whether on the eastern coast or southeastern coast or the \ncentral gulf.\n  As is the case this morning, Hurricane Ivan, a category 4 hurricane \nbearing down on the gulf coast region, according to the latest weather \nreports and indications based on good research that is being done here \nby many of our Federal agencies, we can somewhat predict the path of \nthe hurricane. With our most sophisticated systems, radar and weather \ntracking, pinpointing with some accuracy, there is a projection of \nwhere this killer storm, this major storm, may hit. It seems as though \nit has turned north and is headed right now to the Mississippi-Alabama \nline, but it could move within the next 12 hours to the east or to the \nwest.\n  As we wrap up our business here in Washington, the entire gulf coast, \nand the State I represent, Louisiana being one of those Gulf Coast \nStates, Mississippi and Alabama and the panhandle of Florida, is under \na mandatory evacuation. Why? It is because this is a huge storm. It is \na category 4. We hope and pray, and there are some indications, that it \nwill change to a category 3. But it is a major storm with high winds of \n165 miles per hour.\n  It is not the first time a storm of this size or intensity has hit \nthe gulf coast. We know by reading history. Several decades ago, some \nof us actually lived through extremely powerful and killer storms like \nCamille or Betsy in Louisiana and other States throughout the gulf \ncoast that proved to be very dangerous, with loss of life and billions \nof dollars in property loss.\n  We don't have to be reminded that Florida has just been hit in the \nlast 3 weeks twice already. This one will be of historic devastation in \nFlorida, having had three hurricanes hit in such a short period of \ntime.\n  I want to speak this morning about what we can do here in Washington \na little better, with a little more energy, with a little more focus to \nhelp the people in Louisiana and throughout the gulf coast area. Not \nonly do they deserve our help, but because of the energy industry and \nthe economic benefits they bring to the whole country, they not only \nneed our help, they deserve our help. They deserve our attention.\n  As I have stated, the hurricane is to make landfall sometime in early \nThursday morning, sometime between 1 a.m. and 6 or 7 a.m.\n  The people of Louisiana know the devastation this kind of storm can \nbring. Let me show a picture because I think a picture is worth a \nthousand words. While this looks terrible and horrible--and it is very \nfrightening, as you can see a woman, standing water rising over her \nwaist, trying to get to safety--this is not a hurricane. This is only a \ntropical storm. This was Tropical Storm Isidore that hit the gulf coast \nin 2002. This wasn't a category 1 hurricane. We are talking about \nsevere devastation when a category 3 or category 4 or category 5 \nhurricane pushes that water out of the gulf, out of Lake Ponchartrain \ninto the tremendously populated areas around the gulf coast.\n  This is what people have been fleeing from for the last 36 hours. \nWhen I say fleeing, I mean all of the interstates going north out of \nMississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, and interstates going west, as \npeople try to leave the east and head for safety toward Houston. They \nhave been, at times, in bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours. People can \nwalk faster than the rate the cars are moving. Luckily, the Governors \nof these States are very skilled and able, the local elected officials \nhave been through this many times and were quick to see the danger, \neven though the path could not be predicted, and were quick to call for \nevacuations days ago. This morning, we received reports that the \nhighways are clearing in some parts along the Gulf of Mexico. Some \nfamilies spent yesterday 12, 13, 14 hours in automobiles, going less \nthan 5 miles per hour as they tried to find safety and shelter all \nalong the gulf coast to flee a storm of this magnitude.\n\n  Again, this is not a picture of a hurricane. This is a tropical \nstorm. That is why people are fleeing in the gulf area.\n  I will speak for a moment about energy and about what the gulf coast \ncontributes to the energy independence and energy security of this \nNation. As millions of people have been leaving their homes to flee to \nhigher ground, 442 rigs or platforms have been deserted by companies in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. When I say deserted, not just, of course, left to \nwreak havoc, but they have been tied down, secured, supported. All \nnonessential emergency personnel have had to move out of the Gulf of \nMexico. This evacuation represents 50 percent of the manned rigs and \nplatforms in the gulf.\n  Right now, oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico and coastal Louisiana \nrepresents 60 percent of the entire Gulf of Mexico production. For the \ntime being, that has been shut down because of Ivan. I have discussed \nwith Members of this Senate the importance of our LOOP facility. The \nLouisiana Offshore Oil Port sits right out on the Continental Shelf, \nnear Port Fourchon Louisiana, and is a superport responsible for the \nentrance of 1 million barrels of oil a day.\n  We are in Iraq, in an important battle, but part of our objective \nthere is to secure an oil supply for the region and for the Nation and \nto use that for the betterment of the people of Iraq, for their growth \nand development and the security and stability of the world, as well as \nto fight for other issues. We are fighting to get 1 to 3 million \nbarrels out of Iraq, and right here in the Gulf of Mexico, today, we \nhave a facility that has virtually been shut down because of a \nhurricane. Nearly a million barrels is being imported in this country, \nand exported, a year.\n  Port Fourchon is a small port that sits at the very edge of Highway \n1. It is unbelievable to view the picture. This is Highway 1 in \nTropical Storm Isidore. That was another storm, not a hurricane. This \ndamage occurs in a tropical storm. We cannot see the highway because it \nis covered with water. The highway leads down to the gulf. Port \nFourchon, the LOOP facility, is right off of this shore where 18 \npercent of the offshore oil and gas revenues flow into this country \nthrough this little road called LA 1 that we have been fighting now for \nseveral years. With the leadership of Senator Murray and Senator Reid \nand others, Senator Jeffords and Members on the Republican side, as \nwell, we have been able to get a designation as a special highway, but \nwe are still waiting for the big bucks to help with lifting this \nhighway and expanding it so we can have a functioning port.\n  The hurricane is scheduled to hit Mobile or west of Mobile right now. \nI just spoke to the Port Fourchon Port Director and they expect this \nhighway to be underwater by 1 p.m. today--again. This is the major \nroute of oil and gas into the United States of America. This is Highway \n1, Port Fourchon, and the LOOP facility, which is the only facility in \nthe Nation that imports and exports oil and gas at that rate and at \nthat level.\n  My point is, I hope we will again use this opportunity to focus on \nthe critical infrastructure needs necessary for Louisiana and the gulf \ncoast of Mississippi and Alabama primarily to protect itself not just \nfrom homeland security threats from terrorists but real threats of \nweather.\n  People might say: Senator, why did they build the port here in the \nfirst place? I understand that. If we could do it again, knowing what \nwe know now, perhaps that would not have been done. I will speak for a \nminute about that because I want people to understand the argument. Men \nand women are here because the oil and gas is here. If we\n\n[[Page S9258]]\n\ncould figure out a way to have people live in Chicago and commute every \nday down to the Gulf of Mexico to get the oil and gas out of the \nground, then people would not have to live here, but we have not \nfigured that out yet. So real life men and women and children and \nfamilies live here. They have to live here to serve as the platform for \nthe oil and gas that keeps the lights on all over the country. Yet we \nask them time and time and time again to literally risk their lives to \ndo so, and we cannot find a few million dollars in this budget to lift \nthis highway so either they can get out or they can be safe.\n\n  This is a heavy rain. This occurs in a tropical storm in a heavy \nrain. I don't know what will happen with the hurricane. That is why \npeople are not panicked but are most certainly concerned. This picture \nshows the main bayou that runs inland. The only way the rigs can get \nout of the gulf, they can either dock along the ports--Morgan City, New \nIberia, Galveston, and come into Houston for some protection, the only \nway they can get in is through the Mississippi, up inland, through this \nbayou. They cannot get in when this bridge is down. The people cannot \nget out unless the bridge is down. So every time there is a storm, the \nlocal officials in my State have to say: OK, kids and families, you all \ngo over the bridge. And they hold up the rigs. Then they let some of \nthe rigs through, and they hold up the families trying to get out.\n  This is outrageous. We have money in the budget to build this bridge \nso we can move our infrastructure out of the gulf. And the Presiding \nOfficer understands the magnitude of the barges, cranes, and sheer \nweight and size of the equipment I am talking about. It is not a Tonka \ntoy. It is not Legos. It is big, heavy equipment that has to be moved \nat great danger to the men and women who have to move it to save \ninsurance companies money, to save taxpayers money, to save \nshareholders money for these companies.\n  Let me talk about what else is going on. Louisiana wetlands are not a \nbeach. I have spent a lot of my life growing up in the gulf area, and I \nhave spent a lot of time on the Florida beaches, and I have never seen \nanything more beautiful. We in Louisiana support those beaches. We \nunderstand the tourism. We are some of the tourists that go there. But \nour coast is not a beach. We do not have a beach unless you want to \ncount Grand Isle. It is beautiful and wonderful, but does not look like \nDestin, Florida. It is a lovely small beach. That is about the only \nbeach we have. The rest of our coast is not a beach. It is a wetlands. \nIt is not the wetlands of Louisiana, it is America's wetlands. It has \nbeen washing away at an alarming rate. The difference between a major \nhurricane coming out of the gulf in 1940 and a major hurricane coming \nout of the gulf this year in 2004 is we have lost thousands and \nthousands of acres. The size of the State of Rhode Island has been lost \nin the last 50 years, so the buffer has been shrinking that protects \nthe city of New Orleans and much of the populated portions of \nMississippi. That has been lost.\n  So the people who live on the gulf coast of Mississippi and the \nsouthern part of Mississippi and Louisiana are at greater and greater \nrisk because those barrier islands that once existed, those acres and \nacres and square miles of wetlands, have been eroded. Why? For two \nreasons. One, we leveed the Mississippi River for commerce, not just to \nbenefit Mississippi and Louisiana but to benefit the Midwest, the \nNortheast, the West, to open up trade and opportunity up and down that \nMississippi River. We had no choice.\n  If you want to go to before the trade and go to when the country \nstarted, we had to anchor the mouth of the Mississippi to literally \ncreate the Nation--unless we wanted to stop at the Kentucky border or \nthe Shenandoah Valley, which was a choice at one time. We could have \njust made the United States go from the east coast to the Shenandoah \nValley, and we could have had a wonderful nation right there in the \nEast. But we decided to go West. We decided to go all the way to the \nOregon Trail with Lewis and Clark. President Jefferson had a vision, \nbut that vision could not possibly happen without anchoring the \nsecurity of the mouth of the Mississippi River. So we did. We had to \nbasically try to tame this very wild place, very wet place, very low-\nlying place.\n  But we did it not just for ourselves; we did it for the whole Nation, \nwith the Nation's help and support. We did not pay for everything, but \nwe contributed a great deal. Today we continue to give billions of \ndollars out of the gulf coast in oil and gas revenues and taxes that go \nto this country. We continue to send our labor and our support and our \nmoney to this Nation. Yet time and time again, when Louisiana comes to \nask, Could we please have just a portion of the revenue that we send?--\nwe are not asking for charity; we are asking for something we earned; \nwe are happy to share with the rest of the country to help invest in \ninfrastructure--we are told: We cannot do it this year. We do not have \nenough money. It is not a high enough priority.\n  Well, I do not know when it is going to get to be a high enough \npriority. I hate to say maybe it is going to take the loss thousands of \nlives on the gulf coast to make this country wake up and realize in \nwhat we are under-investing. Again, we lose a football field every 30 \nminutes. We have lost more than 1,900 square miles in the past 70 \nyears, and the U.S. Geological Survey predicts we will lose another \n1,000 square miles if decisive action is not taken now.\n  Now, we have made good plans in the last several years to save the \nEverglades. We are well on our way to do that. We have plans underway \nto restore the Chesapeake Basin, which is an extremely important \necosystem to this part of the country. We have some preliminary plans \nunderway in the Great Lakes. But no area--not the Everglades, not the \nChesapeake, and not the Great Lakes--of this great Nation contributes \nmore economically or energy-wise than the wetlands of America that lay \nto the south along the gulf coast. They do not compare to the energy \ncontribution; they do not compare to the fisheries contribution; they \ndo not compare to the commerce contribution of this Nation or the port \ncontribution when you put it together. Yet we seem to be getting less, \nnot more.\n  So we have to stop the vanishing wetlands. We have plans in Congress. \nWe are going to continue to push, with Lamar Alexander's help, on the \nEnergy bill. We have a new bill moving through Congress called the \nAmericans Outdoors Act that seeks to dedicate a portion of those \nrevenues for coastal States, even States that do not produce oil and \ngas off of their coast. I think we should be willing to share some of \nthese coastal revenues for coastal-related issues. Some people \ndisagree.\n  The people of Louisiana do not mind sharing. It is sort of our \nnatural way. We are happy to do that. We do not even want it all. We \njust want our fair share. That is what this bill does.\n\n  We also have a bill through the WRDA legislation, which is the \ntraditional funding for the Corps of Engineers, the Federal agency \nprimarily responsible to keep the waterways dredged, to keep the levees \nup as high as possible, to work with our local flood control folks, \nparticularly our levee boards in Louisiana, which are some of the most \nimportant public entities we have, that literally keep people dry from \nheavy rains and from floods and storms of this nature.\n  But let me also repeat, again for the record, I know every time a \nhurricane hits in North Carolina or South Carolina or Florida, other \npeople who are not familiar with hurricanes say: Why do the people live \nalong the coast? Why do we let people live along the coast? I think \nthat is a legitimate argument that could be made for resort \ncommunities. It is not mandatory they live there. They choose to live \nthere because, of course, the coastlines are very pleasant and \nbeautiful places to live. In fact, Americans really agree with that \nbecause two-thirds of the entire population of the United States live \nwithin 50 miles of the coast. So that is an issue that could be \ndebated, and we could talk about that.\n  But Louisiana people who live in Port Fourchon, while they enjoy \nliving there, believe me, and while they love to shrimp and they love \nto fish, they are there doing a great service for this Nation, working \nin an energy industry and trying to dig out of the gulf the resources \nthis country needs. Where people live along these bayous, they are \nfishing and they are contributing to industries. They do not have a lot \nof fish\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\nin downtown New York. They do not have a lot of fish in Chicago. The \nonly place you are going to catch fish is in the water. So you have to \nlive there basically to catch the fish. They are living there for a \nlivelihood.\n  In addition, New Orleans itself was settled as the security as this \nNation grew. Now people want to say, maybe we should--if a big storm \nhits--just move New Orleans. I do not know how you move a major \nmetropolitan area. But I also say this about my great city, where I \ngrew up and have represented, still to this day--and in many different \nways throughout my life--the people, the city is 9 feet generally below \nsea level. But we have some of the most sophisticated pumping systems \nin the world.\n  In fact, the engineers who built the pumping stations that supply New \nOrleans with flood control were the engineers who helped Holland and \nstudied in Venice. We do not have halfway pumping systems. We have the \nbest in the world. We have the best engineers, the finest pumping \nsystems. We are an old city, and we spend a lot of our money to keep \nthose pumping systems up to date. In fact, the Federal Government has \nbeen a major partner. I am proud to have led the effort. The Southeast \nLouisiana Flood Control program has invested hundreds of millions of \ndollars, Federal and State money, to upgrade those pumping systems. So \nwe are not Pollyanna about this. We are not Johnny-come-lately. We have \ngreat engineers. We are smart. If fact, we have taught the world how to \ndrain floodwaters because we have been doing it the longest, for over \n300 years.\n  But the city can do just so much, when it has a population that is \nchallenged. We are not the wealthiest State. We are not the richest \nState. We need our Federal Government to understand that we are happy \nto share our resources and riches with the world, but we do deserve a \ngreater portion of these revenues to keep our people safe, to keep our \ninfrastructure intact, and, most certainly, to be respectful of what \nthe people of Louisiana and the entire gulf coast contribute to our \nnational well-being and security.\n  I want to put up another picture. This is another picture of LA 1. \nThis is on a day when you see the traffic backed up. Obviously, there \nwas something wrong with the Leeville Bridge. But this is what the \ntraffic looks like trying to get out before a hurricane: the trucks, \nthe cars, the schoolbuses, trying to leave a place where they were \nworking on behalf of not only themselves but on behalf of this Nation. \nThe least we can do is send a little money to fix this highway and to \nkeep people safe and high and dry in these storms.\n  Let's pray, Madam President, that Hurricane Ivan does not hit the \ncity of New Orleans directly. I am going to submit a front-page article \nfrom the Washington Post for the Record. It is an article about what \nthat might be like. One of our emergency personnel who has been working \non an emergency plan has stored several thousand body bags in the event \nof a major flood in the city of New Orleans. Let's hope that never \nhappens. But I have to say, as a Senator representing the State of \nLouisiana, the chances of it happening sometime are pretty good. If we \ndo not improve our transportation evacuation routes, invest in \nprotecting this infrastructure, and focusing on reinvesting some of the \ntremendous wealth that has been taken from this area, and reinvesting \nit back, we will only have ourselves to blame.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \n``Awaiting Ivan in the Big Uneasy'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 2004]\n\n                    Awaiting Ivan in the Big Uneasy\n\n\n                   New Orleans Girds for Major Damage\n\n             (By Michael Grunwald and Manuel Roig-Franzia)\n\n       New Orlean, Sept. 14.--Walter Maestri, an emergency manager \n     here in America's most vulnerable metropolitan area, has \n     10,000 body bags ready in case a major hurricane ever hits \n     New Orleans. As Hurricane Ivan's expected path shifted \n     uncomfortably close to this low-lying urban soup bowl \n     Tuesday, Maestri said he might need a lot more.\n       If a strong Category 4 storm such as Ivan made a direct \n     hit, he warned, 50,000 people could drown, and this city of \n     Mardi Gras and jazz could cease to exist.\n       ``This could be The One,'' Maestri said in an interview in \n     his underground bunker. ``You're talking about the potential \n     loss of a major metropolitan area.''\n       Forecasters said Tuesday night that they expected Ivan to \n     veer at least 70 miles east of New Orleans before making \n     landfall early Thursday, somewhere along the Gulf Coast \n     extremities of Louisiana, Alabama or Mississippi. But Ivan \n     has consistently drifted farther west than their predictions. \n     This port city's levees are designed to withstand only a \n     Category 3 storm, and officials begged residents to evacuate \n     the area ``if you have the means.''\n       By evening, the city's few escape routes were spectacularly \n     clogged, and authorities acknowledged that hundreds of \n     thousands of residents would not get out in time. The \n     stranded will not be able to turn to the Red Cross, because \n     New Orleans is the only city in which the relief agency \n     refuses to set up emergency storm shelters, to ensure the \n     safety of its own staff. Even if a 30-foot-high wall of water \n     crashes through the French Quarter--Maestri's worst-case \n     scenario--stranded residents will be on their own.\n       New Orleans is often described as a disaster waiting to \n     happen--it is mostly below sea level, practically surrounded \n     by water, artificially kept dry by pumps and levees, rapidly \n     losing its natural storm protection. But rarely have its \n     leaders sounded so afraid that the wait could be over soon.\n       ``I'm terrified,'' said Windell Curole, director of the \n     South Lafourche Levee District in the swampy bayous south of \n     the city. ``I'm telling you, we've got no elevation. This \n     isn't hyperbole. The only place I can compare us to is \n     Bangladesh.''\n       More than 100,000 Bangladeshis died in a 1991 storm, and \n     Curole is genuinely afraid that a similar tragedy could \n     strike New Orleans, most of which sits six to eight feet \n     lower than the surrounding waters of the Mississippi River, \n     Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico. Ivan is the \n     strongest storm to threaten the region since Hurricane Betsy \n     nailed New Orleans in 1965. It brought more than $7 billion \n     in havoc at a time when southern Louisiana was less populated \n     and less exposed.\n       The doomsayers are quick to add a caveat: Ivan might not \n     turn out to be The One. The National Hurricane Center expects \n     the storm to swerve toward the area between Gulfport, Miss., \n     and Mobile, Ala. Officials in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi \n     and the Florida Panhandle were urging residents Tuesday to \n     leave coastal areas. ``I beg people on the coast: Do not ride \n     this storm out,'' Mississippi's Gov. Haley Barbour (R) said.\n       A dozen coastal casinos were shuttered in Mississippi, and \n     Barbour's evacuation order for coastal areas was mandatory. \n     In Alabama, Gov. Bob Riley (R) ordered evacuations from Gulf \n     Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and some towns \n     postponed runoff elections scheduled for Tuesday. Evacuation \n     was mandatory in parts of Escambia, Bay and Walton counties \n     in Florida, and most schools in the Panhandle were closed.\n       Most scientists, engineers and emergency managers agree \n     that if Ivan does spare southern Louisiana this time, The One \n     is destined to arrive some day. The director of the U.S. \n     Geological Survey has warned that New Orleans is on a path to \n     extinction. Gregory W. Stone, director of the Coastal Studies \n     Institute at Louisiana State University, frets that near \n     misses such as Hurricane Georges--a Category 2 storm that \n     swerved away from New Orleans a day before landfall in 1998--\n     only give residents a false sense of security. The Red Cross \n     has rated a hurricane inundating New Orleans as America's \n     deadliest potential natural disaster--worse than a California \n     earthquake.\n       ``I don't mean to be an alarmist, but the doomsday scenario \n     is going to happen eventually,'' Stone said. ``I'll stake my \n     professional reputation on it.''\n       The main problem with southern Louisiana is that it is \n     dangerously low, and getting lower. The levees that \n     imprisoned the Mississippi River into its shipping channel \n     and helped make New Orleans one of the world's busiest ports \n     have also prevented the muddy river from spreading sediment \n     around its delta.\n       As a result, southern Louisiana is sinking into the Gulf, \n     losing about 25 square miles of coastal marshes and barrier \n     islands every year. Those marshes and islands used to help \n     slow storms as they approached New Orleans; computer \n     simulations now predict that the loss of these natural storm \n     barriers will increase storm surges and waves by several \n     feet.\n       On a seaplane tour of the region Tuesday, Gerald M. \n     Duszynsi, assistant secretary of the Louisiana Department of \n     Natural Resources, pointed out an area near the tiny bayou \n     town of Leesville, where he fished for redfish and flounder \n     25 years ago. Once a solid patch of green tidal marsh, it is \n     now mostly open water, with a few strips and splotches of \n     green.\n       ``This used to be perfect, and now look at it,'' Duszynski \n     said. ``The buffer is gone. Now even the little storms give a \n     big influx.''\n       Louisiana's politicians, environmentalists and business \n     leaders have been pushing for a $14 billion coastal \n     restoration project to try to bring back those lost marshes \n     and islands--in order to help protect New Orleans as well as \n     an oil and gas industry that handles nearly a third of the \n     nation's supply.\n       The Bush administration forced the state to scale down its \n     request to $1.2 billion last year, and a Senate committee \n     authorized $375 million. But Mark Davis, executive director \n     of the coalition to Restore Coastal\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\n     Louisiana, believes that even if Ivan bypasses the region, \n     its scary approach could help galvanize support for a more \n     comprehensive fix.\n       ``We're running out of tomorrows,'' Davis said. ``God \n     willing, if there's still a southern Louisiana next week, I'm \n     not talking about the politics of the possible anymore. It's \n     now a question of which side are you on: Do you support the \n     obliteration of a region, or do you want to try to save it?``\n       On Tuesday, though, most local officials were thinking more \n     about the potential danger than the potential opportunity. If \n     Ivan does pound New Orleans tidal surges could leave the city \n     underwater for months, since its pumps can remove only about \n     an inch every hour, creating a ``toxic soup'' of chemicals, \n     rodents, poisons and snakes.\n       The local officials said they could not order a mandatory \n     evacuation in a city as poor as New Orleans in which more \n     than 100,000 residents have no cars, but they urged people to \n     find some way to escape. ``If you want to take a chance buy a \n     lottery ticket,'' said Jefferson Parish President Aaron \n     Broussard. ``Don't take a chance on this hurricane.''\n       New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin seemed flustered as he \n     pleaded with his constituents to flee, at one point \n     suggesting that they take shelter in area hospitals. Visitors \n     were also urged to find somewhere else to go--including \n     10,000 conventioneers in town for the annual meeting of the \n     National Safety Council\n       ``This is not a drill,'' Nagin said. ``This is the real \n     deal.''\n       But the logistics of exit are quite formidable in the Big \n     Easy. In 1998, as more than 300,000 people fled Hurricane \n     Georges, Interstate 10 turned into a parking lot. Similar \n     miles-long snarls unfolded Tuesday. Flights were canceled and \n     the airport prepared to close. The town that gave the world \n     ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' idled its streetcars.\n       The underlying problem, Maestri said, is that the city \n     never should have been built in the first place. It is a \n     teriffic location for business but a lousy location for \n     safety.\n       ``The Chamber of Commerce gets really mad at me when I say \n     this, but does New Orleans get rebuilt?'' Maestri asked. The \n     answer, he said could very well be no.\n\n  I thank the Chair for the time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Madam President, I rise to voice deep concern about \nwhat is happening in our war with Iraq, what is happening within our \ncountry, and a lack of direction that is pronounced as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  We hear the political debate that goes on: What is your plan for \ngetting us out of Iraq? Well, what is yours?\n  Since our Commander in Chief is in charge, I would think that he \nwould lead the country and lead the direction of the campaign, telling \nthe American people about when it is we are going to be able to expect \nour troops to come home, when these families will be reunited.\n  Last week, the 33rd soldier from New Jersey died in Iraq. Our country \nhas now lost a total of 1,018 of our troops in Iraq. Of these deaths, \n877 troops have died since the President announced that major combat \noperations in Iraq were over, finished. He made that announcement \nduring a political appearance on an aircraft carrier on May 1, 2003.\n  If we look at this picture, we see our sailors lined up. I know what \nthey are thinking. I was a veteran, and I remember so vividly when I \nwas on a ship bound for Japan after serving in Europe and the war \nsuddenly ended and how relieved I was. I was concerned for myself, of \ncourse, but I was concerned for my brothers and sisters in arms as \nwell. So these sailors are standing at attention, and there were \nrousing cheers when the President made his statement. And he boldly \ndeclared: ``Mission accomplished.''\n  It turned out to be more theater than reality. The mission \naccomplished debacle is illustrative of President Bush's failure to \nexecute a coherent plan to win the war in Iraq. Even after reaching a \nthousand dead, President Bush has not come forward with a plan. We have \nnot heard one word about when those troops are expected to come home. \nWhen will the fighting really stop? When can we look at the situation \nin Iraq and say, good grief, it is finally resolved? Every day more and \nmore people are killed, and many are Americans. But lots of times the \nstructure in Iraq promotes this kind of dispute and violence.\n  I say to President Bush, stop this killing. Our troops are putting \ntheir lives on the line for our country.\n  The President refuses to show the kind of leadership we need to have \nin a time of war. Even as the fighting continues, we hear promises that \nsomehow or other it is going to get better, when in fact the situation \nhas worsened.\n  I ask my colleagues: What are we doing there? What is our plan? What \nkind of a government do we think we are going to see there? We have \nsort of turned it over to the Iraqis, but since that turnover has been \nmade the violence and the numbers killed each day has accelerated. I \ndon't know whether anyone here knows what, if any, our plans are. As \nthe killing continues overseas, the President is inviting a new risk to \nbegin here at home.\n  Madam President, this Senate, the Congress, failed to extend the life \nof the assault weapons ban. Ultimately, the failure to extend this law \nfalls on the desk of President Bush. He has not done anything--not \nlifted a finger--to urge the Republican leaders to extend this ban. As \na matter of fact, in earlier days, he said he would sign a bill. But he \nknows very well, and all America knows very well, if he doesn't \nencourage the Republican leadership to present a bill, there is no bill \nto sign. So all kinds of boastful comments can be made about how he \nwould sign it, but to my knowledge he never has picked up the phone and \ncalled the leadership of the House or Senate and said we need a bill, \nwe don't want these crazy weapons around our country.\n  Assault weapons are semiautomatic, civilian versions of weapons \ndesigned for military use. They are the weapons of choice of criminals \nand terrorists because they are capable of holding large-capacity \nmagazines that allow a shooter to fire up to 150 shots without having \nto reload.\n  These weapons are specifically designed for military use in order to \nkill greater numbers of people more effectively and quickly.\n  This placard illustrates some of the new products available at local \ngun stores, thanks to the President's lack of leadership. We took an \naction here that said we would like to continue the ban, but it fell \nwhen the House refused to deal with it.\n  We could not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and we are \nfinding weapons that easily destroy lives right here at home. FBI \nstatistics show that one in five law enforcement officers slain in the \nline of duty were killed by an assault weapon. That is why police \nofficers across the country are outraged that we did not extend this \nban. Why in the world we need these weapons, I cannot figure out. Who \ndo we please when we say let's have these automatic weapons on our \nstreets in New York? For what purpose? Target shooting? Shooting deer? \nMaybe shooting neighbors. Maybe drug dealers, yes. Maybe policemen. \nThat is who gets shot when these guns are available.\n  The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association, the Major County Sheriffs \nAssociation--every one of them want us to extend the assault weapons \nban. But our ears were closed.\n  Madam President, these law enforcement officers put their lives on \nthe line every day, and they should not have to face criminals armed \nwith an Uzi pistol or an AK-47 rifle, a Street Sweeper, or a TEC-9 \npistol during a drug bust or school shooting. This Nation should never \nforget the school shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, \nwhere two teenage students, using a TEC-DC9 assault pistol and other \nweapons, went on a shooting rampage that killed 12 other students and a \nteacher. Who can ever forget the pictures of the students hanging out \nthe windows begging for mercy, begging for a way to escape the rampage \nthat was taking place?\n  We should never forget it. But we don't want to do anything about it; \nthat is the tragedy. Nor should the Nation forget another school \nshooting in Stockton, CA, in 1989, where an AK-47 was used in a \nschoolyard full of kids, firing over 100 rounds in less than 2 minutes \nand killing 5 children and wounding 29 others.\n  Then there is the issue of terrorism. If anyone thinks for a second \nthat the\n\n[[Page S9261]]\n\nexpiration of the assault weapons ban will not be noticed by foreign \nterrorists, then we are hiding our heads in the sand.\n  Found in the ruble of a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan was a \nmanual. It is entitled, ``How Can I Train Myself for Jihad?''\n  The placard contains a quote from that manual:\n\n       In other countries, e.g., some states of the USA, South \n     Africa, it is perfectly legal for members of the public to \n     own certain types of firearms. If you live in such a country, \n     obtain an assault rifle legally, preferably AK-47 or \n     variations, learn how to use it properly and go and practice \n     in the areas allowed for such training.\n\n  That is training on how to kill innocent people.\n  This placard also says:\n\n       ``How Can I Train Myself for Jihad,'' a guide originally \n     published on the Azzam.com, a website dedicated to the \n     worldwide jihad (now shut down). The guide was found in the \n     ruins of a terrorist training center south of Kabul, \n     Afghanistan, after it was destroyed by U.S. air strikes in \n     late 2001.\n\n  Those are the people who want to get their hands on these weapons. \nThose are the people who say that the United States is easy pickings if \nyou want to buy a gun and kill a lot of people.\n  Terrorists know, they are aware of our weak gun laws. It just became \nweaker. For all of President Bush's statements on terrorism, he has \nchosen to stand with the NRA rather than protecting our communities \nfrom this brand of terror.\n  In my view, the President's behavior on the assault weapons ban is \none of those things we call a flip-flop. It is when you say one thing \nand do something else. We saw an angry U.S. Senator on the floor of the \nconvention a couple of weeks ago when he said that the worst thing to \ndo is say something and do nothing. That is his definition of a flip-\nflop.\n  This is a flip-flop of the worst order. It endangers our families, \nour children, and our Nation's law enforcement officers. I wish it were \nnot so, and apparently there is not going to be any going back on the \nassault weapons ban. I wish there were a way to resurrect it. We are \nwhere we are. What we have done is we have encouraged the sale of these \nweapons. I heard there are gun manufacturers who were preparing for a \nburst of sales activity when these weapons were available. I ask \nmyself: Who wants to buy these kinds of weapons? What are they going to \ndo with them? They are going to endanger our families and our kids and \nother innocents. That is what they are going to do.\n  It is too bad because we are now in the midst of a terrible situation \nwith the war, with the casualties continuing to escalate, and with a \nsituation totally out of control in Iraq. I was there shortly before \nthe government was turned over to an interim group to be followed by an \nelection in January. The fact is that it does not look like there is \ngoing to be an election in January. I heard statements from those in \nleadership in Iraq who suggest an election might be tough to hold. But \none thing is for sure, this is not a mission accomplished. This is a \nmission that is still underway, and the cost is terrible.\n  I went to visit some wounded from Iraq at Walter Reed a few weeks \nago, after a burial at Arlington Cemetery, to meet young people who \nwill never function the way they used to. There was a man who was \nblinded from an attack who said to me: I will never see my 28-month-old \ndaughter, but I still want to hold her.\n  That is the condition that continues to develop each and every day: \nOver 1,000 killed, many more thousands wounded, and we just hope and \npray they will recover and we will be able to conclude this effort in \nIraq successfully but quickly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nproceed as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I might reminisce for a moment as a \npredicate for what I am about to say. I go back to a time in my career \nwhen I was the center of considerable national press attention. The \noccasion was the 1970s. The issue was Watergate. I will not bother to \ndescribe why I was there; I will just tell my colleagues of a phone \ncall I received one night just before the ``Evening News with Walter \nCronkite'' came on CBS.\n  A reporter called me to say that Dan Rather was going to be speaking \nabout me that night, and he read to me the piece that had been written \nfor Dan Rather to give on the evening news. Frankly, it terrified me \nbecause if it had been delivered in just the way it was read to me on \nthe phone, it would have destroyed my business, destroyed my career, \nmade it impossible for me to continue to represent the various clients \nI had in my public relations and consulting firm.\n  I said that to the reporter. I said: This is terrible, it is not \ntrue, and you will destroy my career. We had a brief conversation about \nthe details of what it is he had in his report, and he said, well, I \nsee your point, I will do the best I can, and hung up at about 10 \nminutes before the news broadcast was to begin.\n  As anyone can understand, I watched the news with great interest that \nnight, and Walter Cronkite began by saying: Tonight, Dan Rather has \nimportant new information about the Watergate scandal that he will be \nbringing us from Washington. It was about 20 minutes after the hour \nwhen he got around to Rather, and Dan Rather then gave a report, \nmentioned me by name but said the things that I had said to the \nreporter, along with some of the things he had already prepared. It was \nnot a pleasant experience for me, but it was nowhere near what it \nsounded as if it would be some half hour before.\n  Within 10 minutes after the news broadcast ended, the phone rang \nagain at my home, and it was Dan Rather. I thanked him for paying \nattention to the points I was trying to make, and he said: Well, you \nhad a strong advocate, referring to the reporter who had been talking \nto me. Then he said: I have been in this town long enough to know the \ndifference between a legitimate news story that has somehow come out \nand a situation that is being laid on me for the purpose of getting the \ninformation forward. He said: Mr. Bennett, this was not a legitimate \nnews story. This is something that was laid on me by someone who \nobviously wishes you ill. Who do you think your enemies might be in \nthis situation?\n\n  We then had that discussion. That is neither here nor there, but \nobviously I always will remember that time. We do remember the times in \nour lives when trauma comes upon us. I remembered it fondly, with \nrespect for Dan Rather and his willingness to listen to something other \nthan the preconception that had been handed to him, and for his \njournalistic instinct to tell him that this just might not be a \nlegitimate story, this just might be something that someone was feeding \nto him for a purpose and a hidden agenda.\n  We now know about the great controversy that has surrounded the \ndocuments that have come forward with respect to President Bush's \nservice in the Texas National Guard. I regret, from my personal \nexperience, to find that this newsman whom I have respected all these \nyears is in the center of this particular controversy. It would seem to \nme that this time, Dan Rather's instinct has failed him. The instinct \nthat told him some 30 years ago, again in his words, that ``something \nwas being laid on him'' deserted him this time. It is very clear that \ndocuments were forged, they were laid on him, and this time he bit.\n  I do not join in the chorus that is arising on talk radio and \nelsewhere that he must somehow be driven from the air. I don't think he \ndeserves that. But I do think this is a cautionary tale and we need to \nspend a little time talking about it because it represents a new \nphenomenon in the information age where someone has used information-\nage technology to forge documents and then insert those forged \ndocuments and the false information they contain into the political \ndebate at a time that is crucial.\n  This is the first indication I know of where we have seen that sort \nof thing,\n\n[[Page S9262]]\n\na deliberate attempt on the part of a forger to change the course of an \nelection and a situation where respected organizations, such as the \nBoston Globe and CBS News, have been conned by that forger and have \nbecome unwitting participants in foisting a forgery and a fraud upon \nthe electorate.\n  I believe I am something of an expert on forgery. In this same period \nof time, back in the 1970s, I worked for Howard Hughes. I was working \nfor the Hughes organization when we had two of the most significant \nforgery attempts of the last century. The first one was the \nautobiography of Howard Hughes. The second one was the will of Howard \nHughes.\n  We now know, looking back, that the autobiography of Howard Hughes \nwas written by a man named Clifford Irving, who had never met Howard \nHughes, never spoke to him, never had any contact with him at all. But, \nperhaps a parallel to today's situation, two very respected and \nprestigious national organizations bought the Clifford Irving forgery, \npaying $1 million to Clifford Irving for that manuscript. McGraw-Hill \nPublishing Company was going to publish the book, and Time-Life, the \npublishers of Time and Life magazines, now part of Time Warner, was \ngoing to publish excerpts from the book.\n  I won't go into the details of that, but I do remember very clearly \nwhen the leading investigative reporter for Life magazine came into my \noffice to discuss the Howard Hughes autobiography, and I said to him \nthere is no way in the world that Howard Hughes has ever met Clifford \nIrving. That is absolute, provable, irrefutable. Clifford Irving and \nHoward Hughes had never, ever met each other.\n  The reporter said to me: That may be true. Irving is probably lying \nabout how he got the manuscript, but the manuscript itself is genuine. \nThe evidence is overwhelming.\n  I said: What evidence?\n  He said: The handwriting experts. The handwriting experts have looked \nat the handwriting on the note that Clifford Irving put forward--\nsupposedly written by Howard Hughes--validating the manuscript, and he \nsaid the handwriting experts are unanimous, Howard Hughes wrote that \nnote.\n\n  Now we know, of course, Howard Hughes did not write that note. \nClifford Irving wrote that note.\n  In the course of his trial, one of the prosecutors said to Clifford \nIrving: Is it really possible that you were the man who wrote that \nnote? Is it really possible that you had the skills of forgery so that \nyou could write something that would fool the best experts in the \ncountry on handwriting analysis?\n  Clifford Irving took a legal pad, wrote out a letter from Howard \nHughes to this particular prosecutor, signed it ``Howard Hughes,'' and \nhanded it over to him. The prosecutor had it framed and it is hanging \non his wall.\n  One of the major lessons I learned from that experience is that the \nexperts can be wrong. The experts can be fooled. A good forger who \nconcentrates in the right area can, in fact, come up with forgeries \nthat can get by some forensic experts.\n  I don't think that is the case with the forgeries with respect to \nPresident Bush's Texas National Guard service. I think the forgeries \nare fairly clumsy and the expert that CBS has quoted validated only the \nsignature and not the document as a whole.\n  But the thing I have learned from dealing with the Hughes forgeries, \nthe fake autobiography and the fake will, is that one must look at a \nforgery not only for the forensic side of it but also for the content \nand ask this fundamental question whenever something magically appears: \nWhy did this appear at this particular time?\n  If, indeed, Howard Hughes was planning to write an autobiography, why \ndid it appear just after there was a major shakeup in the Hughes \norganization and there was a tremendous amount of publicity about \nHoward Hughes' reclusiveness? Isn't that coincidence a little bit too \nclose?\n  The will that would have left hundreds of millions of dollars to a \nservice station attendant in the state of Utah, why did that appear \njust as the press was reporting that Howard Hughes had died without \nsigning a will? What caused this to come forward at just that moment? \nIsn't that content suspicious? Doesn't that suggest that somebody has \nan agenda that is not just a coincidence?\n  The third area of forgery with which I am familiar says exactly the \nsame thing. I had friends with whom I went to college who were killed \nby the forger-murderer Mark Hoffman. Mark Hoffman earned his living \nover decades forging documents that had relationship to the Mormon \nChurch.\n  Looking back on it, now that Hoffman is in jail, we should have \nrecognized, once again, the great coincidence that these documents \nwould come forward at just the right time. There would be scholars who \nwould be speculating as to whether the founder of the church had any \nconnection with folk magic, and suddenly, at just the right time, \ndocuments saying that he did have connections with folk magic began to \nappear. We now know they were forged. They came from Mark Hoffman. They \nwere created out of whole cloth.\n  But they seemed logical because of the context in which they came.\n  The application of that to these documents relating to President Bush \nis obvious.\n  Why, if these documents have been sitting in the records of the Texas \nNational Guard for all of these years, did they suddenly come forward \nwith exactly the right amount of validation of the accusations that are \nbeing made by President Bush's opponents at just the right time in the \ncampaign when the Kerry campaign seemed to need a little boost?\n  That alone, once again, in historic context, says be on your guard. \nThat alone should have alerted Dan Rather's journalistic instincts that \nthis is not really a legitimate leak. This is something somebody is \nlaying on him for the purpose of their own agenda.\n  The rest of the press has gone in after all of the forensic evidence.\n  I looked at it with great interest because of my background in \nforgery. I agreed that the memos that are purported to be true do not \nfit with the memos that are written in the Texas National Guard. I \nagree that the typeface is suspect. I agree there can be no explanation \nother than forgery for the fact that someone sat down at a modern \ncomputer and recreated the memo exactly. You cannot do that with memos \nthat are typed on typewriters. You have to go back to the original \ntypewriter to recreate a memo and have it match exactly.\n  I agree with all of the forensic evidence, and I agree that there is \nabsolutely no question that this is a forgery.\n  But instead of wallowing in the delight of having caught the Boston \nGlobe or CBS in their gullibility, having caught them in the mistake of \nhaving bought this whole thing, let us ask the more fundamental \nquestion: Who did it? Who is concerned with the campaign to such a \ndegree that they are willing to falsify documents and peddle them to \nnational media organizations?\n  I have heard three explanations. There are people who have speculated \non this. Frankly, the speculation in its own way can add to the poison \nof this situation.\n  The first speculation I heard was that it was done by supporters of \nPresident and Senator Clinton. As they put it, the Clinton supporters \nwant to make sure Kerry didn't win so that the 2008 nomination would be \nopen to Senator Clinton, and they are the ones who forged the documents \nand then put them forward in a way that they knew would be embarrassing \nto the Kerry campaign.\n  The second speculation is that Karl Rove did it; that the Republicans \nare the ones who did this; that this is a Republican dirty trick; that \nthey are so anxious to destroy Kerry they are willing to forge \ndocuments and foist them onto an unsuspecting CBS and Boston Globe.\n  The third explanation, to me, is the only one that makes any sense, \nwhich is that there is an overzealous Kerry supporter, or, if you will, \na Bush hater who is really stupid. This was a really dumb thing for \nsomeone who supports Senator Kerry to have done.\n  I cannot believe it was done by anyone in the Kerry campaign because \nthey are smarter than that. But very often in politics we have the \nexperience called up from my father when someone was trying to help him \nin the campaign: I can take care of my enemies, may the Good Lord save \nme from my friends.\n\n[[Page S9263]]\n\n  But someone who wanted Bush to lose and Kerry to win said if the \ndocuments to support the charge on the National Guard issue aren't \nthere, I will see that they are there. I will do it anonymously. This \nwill be my contribution to the campaign.\n  It is a really stupid thing to do. But I believe that is the \nexplanation of where this came from.\n  Stupidity trumps Machiavelli almost every time when you are looking \nfor an explanation.\n  However, I think everyone ought to focus on finding out who did it. \nUntil we do find out who did it, we will continue to poison the \natmosphere with the suggestion that maybe the Clintons did it, maybe \nKarl Rove did it, or the Republicans played a dirty trick. We know \nthere are other forces at work.\n\n  We owe it to clear the atmosphere by finding out who it is that \nforged these documents.\n  Back to my own history, we cleared the atmosphere with respect to \nHoward Hughes when we found out and made public the fact that the H.R. \nHughes to whom the million-dollar payment was made by McGraw Hill was, \nin fact, Clifford Irving's wife. She opened a Swiss bank and told them \nher name was Helga R. Hughes, and asked McGraw Hill to please make the \nchecks out to H.R. Hughes. And then Clifford Irving's wife deposited \nthem into her account. Naturally, the signature card that endorsed the \ncheck H.R. Hughes matched the signature card in the bank because \nClifford Irving wrote them. Once we knew that, then the air was \ncleared.\n  The air was cleared with respect to the Howard Hughes will and who \nwrote the will. When Melvin Dumar, the service station attendant who \nwould have inherited $100 million from Howard Hughes, exclaimed he knew \nnothing about it, yet was surprised when he came forward and was \nconfronted in court by the fact that his thumbprint was on the will \ninside a sealed envelope when the will was found. Again, the air was \ncleared, and there was no more mystery as to where this came from.\n  The air was cleared with Mark Hoffman and all of the documents that \nhe forged when the murders occurred and we found out that he was trying \nto cover up his forgery by killing people who were in a position to \nexpose him.\n  The air needs to be cleared here. We should not just stop at \nsnickering at newspapers and television stations that seem to have been \ntaken in. We should go deeper than that and find out who actually did \nit. Then we can lay to rest the conspiracy theory that says it came \nfrom all of these other places.\n  I end as I began by saying, over the years, I have always had a warm \nspot in my heart and a great sense of respect for Dan Rather because of \nthe way he treated a story in which I was a principal some 30 years \nago. I know he is a journalist with the highest professional standards. \nI extend to him my regrets at this time that his journalistic instincts \nfailed him, and he didn't realize this was one that was being laid on \nhim in the hope that he would be taken in. I hope he will recover from \nthis. I know at some point he will recognize that he was taken in and \nstep forward and make that acknowledgment clear.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to my friend \nfrom Utah. He always speaks eloquently and brings a different insight \nthan most of us can to issues. It is a remarkable saga which he \nrecounts. It also makes me think that here we are, 6 weeks before a \nPresidential election, which all parties are describing as one of the \nmost important in our history, when we are at war and we have \nsignificant issues of health care, immigration--we could make a list a \nmile long--and jobs, can we keep our jobs in the competitive \nmarketplace, and the dominant issue of the moment is the media covering \nthe media about something that might or probably didn't happen 30 years \nago.\n  My hope is that we recognize that Senator Kerry served, President \nBush served, and they both supported the war in Iraq. It is now at the \nforefront of American consciousness. And the question before us in the \nPresidential race is which one of these men is the best prepared to be \nCommander in Chief to lead us into the future? My hope is the media \ncoverage would be more on those issues, more on the future. I don't \nwant to hear too much more about what happened 30 years ago.\n\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair was heroic in his service 30 \nyears ago. We admire that. But he spent most of his time looking toward \nthe future, as I do mine, and I think the American people do. We are \nnot elected to CBS president of the United States.\n  It is my hope that whatever the circumstances, if they made a \nmistake, admit it--we politicians have learned the hard way that is the \nbest thing to do--and get on with it. Talk about 30 years from now, \ninstead of the media covering the media about what happened 30 years \nago or what might not have happened 30 years ago.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, came to the \nChamber and talked primarily about the devastating hurricane in New \nOrleans. Having lived in New Orleans a year, at the time of another \ngreat hurricane in 1965, I know how difficult that is going to be for \nNew Orleans, Mobile, and that part of the world. Our hearts and support \nare with the people of the gulf coast. We are thinking about them and \ntheir families and hope they are safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9263-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9263-S9264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Louisiana also mentioned the 40th \nanniversary of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. She and I intended \ntoday to speak together about that. She spoke about it and she will \nhave more to say. She has worked very hard on it for the last several \nyears.\n  I take a few minutes in honor of the 40th anniversary of what we call \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, or the LWCF in this country. \nForty years ago, in September of 1964, President Johnson signed \nlegislation establishing the fund. It has been an important factor in \npreserving open spaces in our country ever since.\n  The idea began under a Republican President, President Eisenhower, \nwho signed legislation creating a commission to determine what should \nbe done to preserve outdoor space for recreation. Then a Democratic \nPresident, President Kennedy, submitted legislation to Congress \ncreating the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In submitting the draft \nlegislation, President Kennedy wrote:\n\n       The Nation needs a land acquisition program to preserve \n     both prime Federal and State areas for outdoor recreation \n     purposes. . . . In addition to the enhancement of spiritual, \n     cultural, and physical values resulting from the preservation \n     of those resources, the expenditure for their preservation \n     are a sound financial investment.\n\n  Shortly thereafter, it passed the House by a vote voice and the \nSenate with only one vote in opposition. Then President Johnson signed \nit into law. This is an idea that has had bipartisan support from the \nvery beginning.\n  Since that time, 40 years ago, 37,300 Land and Water Conservation \nFund State grants, totalling more than $3 billion, have been \ninstrumental in preserving 2.3 million acres and building 27,000 \nrecreational facilities. For example, one park that was preserved by \ngrants from the LWCF is Fall Creek Falls in Tennessee. Grants from the \nfund totalling $376,000 helped acquire land and built facilities at \nthis spectacular park, which I have visited many times, boasts the \nhighest waterfall in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Chances \nare pretty good many parks we have hiked would not even exist if it \nwere not for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Yet since the early 1980s, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nbeen consistently shortchanged of funding. During most of the 1980s and \n1990s, funding levels were kept to about one-third of the authorized \nlevel--$300 million of $900 million authorized, for example. By the \nlate 1990s, funding for State grants under the Land and Water \nConservation Fund was cut to zero.\n  In recent years, we have seen some improvements. Funding for State \ngrants averaged about $100 million since 2001, but it is not hard to do \nbetter when you are doing nothing.\n  While funding has declined, demand for conserved areas has \ndramatically increased. Since the Land and Water Conservation Fund was \nfirst established, the population of the United\n\n[[Page S9264]]\n\nStates has grown by more than 40 percent. A growing population puts \npressure on open spaces in two ways: First, more people want to enjoy \nthe great outdoors so they need more space for it; second, more land is \nbeing used for other purposes--such as new subdivisions, shopping \nmalls, office buildings, and more--which makes open space more scarce, \nespecially in areas where most of us live. The demand for parks and \nopen space is higher than ever before, especially for city parks, the \nparks down the street in which we walk, run and enjoy the outdoors.\n  How can we fund conservation efforts in the time of tight budgets? \nThe Americans Outdoors Act of 2004, which Senator Mary Landrieu and I \nintroduced in the Senate earlier this year, provides the answer.\n  The act provides a reliable stream of funding by collecting what we \ncall a conservation royalty on revenues from drilling for oil and gas \non offshore Federal lands. It uses this conservation royalty to fully \nfund three existing Federal programs. First, the State side of the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund is $450 million annually. Second, the \nWildlife Conservation Fund is $350 million annually. And third, Urban \nParks Initiatives is $125 million annually. It also provides 500 \nmillion additional dollars each year for coastal impact assistance \nincluding wetlands protection.\n  This new conservation royalty is not such a new idea at all. It is \nmodeled after the existing State royalty for onshore oil and gas \ndrilling created in the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. The act \ngives 50 cents of every dollar from drilling onshore--and in the case \nof Alaska, 90 cents out of every dollar--as a royalty to the State in \nwhich the drilling occurs.\n  In a similar way, our Americans Outdoors Act of 2004 would create a \nconservation royalty of about 25 percent for revenues of the funds \ncollected from offshore drilling on Federal lands. Some of the royalty \nwould go to States such as Texas where the drilling occurs. More would \ngo to all States for parks, game and fish commissions, and projects \nfunded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n\n  The premise of this legislation is simple. If drilling for oil and \ngas creates an environmental impact, it makes sense to use some of the \nproceeds to create an environmental benefit. In 2001, the Federal \nGovernment received $7.5 billion in oil and gas revenues from Federal \noffshore leases. This revenue comes from the Outer Continental Shelf \nwhich supplies more oil to the United States than any other country, \nincluding Saudi Arabia.\n  I mentioned at the beginning this was a bipartisan idea. I should \nmention one other President who was involved in this idea. His name was \nRonald Reagan. In 1985, President Reagan asked me to chair the \nPresident's Commission on Americans Outdoors which looked ahead for a \ngeneration to try to see what we could do now to help us--today, as it \nturns out, nearly 20 years later--to enjoy the great American outdoors. \nOne of the major recommendations from President Reagan's Commission on \nAmericans Outdoors was that we take some of the money from offshore oil \ndrilling and devote it to wildlife preservation, to city parks, and to \nthe State and Federal sides of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Senator Landrieu and I intend to add an amendment that includes the \nFederal side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to our proposal.\n  Today, we celebrate 40 years of a good idea with a new suggestion for \nhow to improve it: a conservation royalty on offshore revenues that we \ntreat exactly the same way we have treated onshore revenues for 50 \nyears. We give it to the States and to the Federal side of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund for wildlife preservation and city parks.\n  Someone once said Italy has its art, England has its history, and the \nUnited States has the great American outdoors. Our magnificent land, as \nmuch as our love of liberty, is at the core of our character. It has \ninspired our pioneer spirit, our resourcefulness, and our generosity. \nIts greatness has fueled our individualism and our optimism and made us \nbelieve anything is possible. It has influenced our music, our \nliterature, our science, and our language. It has served as our \ntraining ground for athletes and philosophers, of poets and defenders \nof American ideas.\n  So let us come together to conserve the great open spaces of our \ncountry for generations to come. That is why the generation before us--\nPresidents Eisenhower and Kennedy and Johnson and Reagan--worked to \nestablish the Land and Water Conservation Fund 40 years ago. That is \nwhy we should make sure it is fully funded today. The Americans \nOutdoors Act will do just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge \nReynaldo Guerra Garza, who passed away yesterday in Brownsville, TX, at \nthe age of 89. Judge Garza was the first Mexican American to serve as a \nFederal district court judge and a Federal appellate judge. Today, I \njoin my fellow Texans in mourning this loss, along with his wife of 65 \nyears, Bertha Garza, and his five children. By any measure of Reynaldo \nGarza's stature in the community, he was a mountain of a man.\n  Reynaldo Garza was born in 1915 in Brownsville, TX, a first-\ngeneration American whose parents had fled civil unrest in Mexico. It \nwas during the Depression when he decided to become a lawyer, so he \nworked as a laborer for the WPA to save money for tuition at the \nUniversity of Texas.\n  He excelled in his studies at the University of Texas and developed a \ngreat many political friendships, including a longstanding friendship \nwith then-congressional candidate Lyndon Baines Johnson. In 1939, he \ngraduated from the University of Texas Law School and opened his own \nlaw office in Brownsville, TX. A solo firm was financially risky for \nsuch a green young lawyer, but Reynaldo Garza strongly believed he \nshould practice law in his community, among his family and his friends.\n  Reynaldo Garza served for 4 years as a gunnery sergeant in World War \nII and returned to Brownsville with a growing reputation as a civic \nleader and a brilliant lawyer. He was invited to join the largest firm \nin town as a partner, where he practiced commercial and insurance law \nfor more than a decade.\n  When a Federal judicial vacancy came up in 1961, President John F. \nKennedy nominated Reynaldo Garza to fill the seat with broad support \nfrom the Texas leadership. After being confirmed, Judge Garza plowed \nthrough a heavy 2-year backlog of cases in exceptional time. As his \nprofile grew, Judge Garza became a symbol for many young, hard-working \nHispanics to pursue their goals of leadership within the legal, \nbusiness, and social community, blazing a trail for others to follow.\n  Those in Brownsville, TX, who saw Judge Garza as a model to follow \nincluded a junior high school student named Juliet Garcia, who became \nthe first Mexican-American woman president of a university, and a young \nattorney, Federico Pena, who was to become U.S. Transportation \nSecretary.\n  Garza wrote:\n\n       I've always said I hope I got the appointment because I was \n     qualified, not because I was Mexican American. But I knew I \n     had to do a good job or else my actions would reflect not \n     only my ability, but also that of other Mexican Americans.\n\n  It was in December of 1976 when President-elect Jimmy Carter called\n\n[[Page S9265]]\n\nJudge Garza personally to ask him to join his Cabinet as Attorney \nGeneral. But Judge Garza thought it was a prank call, so he simply hung \nup the phone. Eventually, after being convinced this was indeed the \nreal thing, a request from the President-elect, Judge Garza gracefully \ndeclined the offer because he wanted to stay close to home and stay \nclose to his community.\n  But it was in 1978, when President Carter called again, and this time \noffering him a nomination to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals--after having been confirmed by the Senate--he became the first \nMexican-American Federal appellate court judge. At every step of the \nway, Reynaldo Garza blazed a trail for others.\n  U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza, who practiced law in \nBrownsville from 1983 until 1988, told the Associated Press today that \neverybody who knew Judge Garza had a story to tell. He said:\n\n       I remember him telling me when I was a lawyer, ``Don't ever \n     forget you'll have a lot of clients, if you're lucky, but \n     hopefully your clients will only have one attorney.''\n\n  The Ambassador said:\n\n       I will never forget that advice.\n\n  Judge Garza retired from active service in 1982, but he continued to \nserve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals with a reduced workload. \nHis last court sitting was in 2001, and he continued working as a \ncircuit court judge until the time of his death. He never lost that \ndedication or belief in the importance of hard work and perseverance.\n  Let me share with you one additional story. This one is from the \nBrownsville Herald of today. It was reported:\n\n       Garza touched many [lives] in the legal community, both \n     professionally and personally.\n       Undeterred by his illness, he officiated the swearing in of \n     U.S. District Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa in McAllen as \n     chairman of the federal sentencing commission. The ceremony \n     was performed in [Judge] Garza's hospital room in Brownsville \n     on Aug. 3, Hinojosa said.\n       [Judge] Hinojosa met [Judge] Garza when he was on the bench \n     at the federal courthouse in Brownsville. Their two \n     courtrooms were located on the same floor.\n       ``Judge Garza was a great mentor and immediately made me \n     feel at home . . . he was always ready to provide advice and \n     counsel,'' [Judge] Hinojosa said.\n       Hinojosa said he has admired Garza since he was a boy. He \n     remembers attending naturalization ceremonies in Starr \n     County, which [Judge] Garza presided over.\n       ``I remember sitting there and not realizing that someday I \n     would be working on the same floor as he did,'' Hinojosa \n     said. ``He's an example of anything that is possible in this \n     great county.''\n       ``The rest of us have come along after him because he \n     opened doors for us. He opened doors that remain open for the \n     rest of us.''\n\n  Mr. President, today, I offer this salute to the memory of Judge \nReynaldo Garza.\n  I remember when I served on the State judiciary, we were at Southern \nMethodist University School of Law trying to help young law students \nbecome effective advocates on a moot court panel. He and I served on \nthe same panel. I remember his great humor, his great intelligence, and \nhis incisive questioning.\n  It may seem as if Judge Garza is gone from us now, but he is still \nhere as long as we bear his memory in our hearts, as long as we honor \nwhat he gave to us during his time here on Earth, and as long as his \nexample inspires a child to dream of greater things.\n  May God bless Reynaldo Garza. And may God bless his family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9265-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9265-S9266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today my subject is going to be one which we \nhad hoped would not be facing us. But it still faces us today, and that \nis the age-old plague of anti-Semitism. Like so many other diseases, we \nthought it had been wiped off the face of the Earth. But it has \nreturned in new and, unfortunately, virulent forms.\n  In July of this year, Australia's largest synagogue in the west coast \ncity of Perth was defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti that read ``6 \nmillion more please with fries.'' Recently, in the United States, and \nat least 14 other countries, anti-Semitic incidents have been recorded, \nand the trend is not promising. Mass expulsions, forced conversions, \nbans on land ownership, job and housing discrimination all mark a \npeople who have been singled out, not because of what they have done \nbut because of who they are--Jews.\n  Now, many of us who came of age in the post-World-War-II era harbored \nthe illusion that the last remnants of anti-Semitism perished in \nHitler's gas chambers. Many believed that what American GI's discovered \nin Nazi concentration camps was so horrendous and shocking that it \nfinally put an end to what historian Robert Wistrich had dubbed ``the \nlongest hatred''--that of anti-Semitism.\n  Unfortunately, we are witnessing a rapid re-emergence of anti-\nSemitism. From the Middle East where sermons from mosques single out \nJews for death; to Paris, where Jewish schools are firebombed and \nJewish children are routinely attacked, to the conference against \nracism in Durban, South Africa, which quickly became a carnival \nattacking Israel; to the inordinate number of anti-Israeli resolutions \nin the U.N. General Assembly, to U.S. college campuses, where anti-\nIsrael rallies become forums with chants that disintegrate into cries \nof ``Death to the Jews'', anti-Semitic acts have become commonplace and \neven fashionable once again. As Natan Sharansky wrote in Commentary \nmagazine, November 2003, ``Israel has become the world's Jew and anti-\nZionism is simply a substitute for anti-Semitism.''\n  In Washington, the recent attacks on Doug Feith and the so-called \nneo-conservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle charging \nJewish DoD officials with manipulating U.S. intelligence in order to \n``force'' the United States to take out Saddam in Iraq contain familiar \nanti-Semitic overtones. The fact is the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nafter an exhaustive review of pre-war U.S. intelligence, found \nabsolutely no evidence of pressure being put on intelligence analysts \nto change their official assessments by any officer of the \nadministration.\n  The Jewish state has tried in earnest to sacrifice ``land for \npeace''. We witnessed Prime Minister Barak's offer to Chairman Arafat: \nshared sovereignty over Jerusalem, Muslim control of the Temple Mount, \n97 percent of the West Bank and Gaza, and a land swap in the Negev for \na corridor around Jerusalem that couldn't be given away, a ``right of \nreturn'' for thousands of Palestinian refugees, and a compensatory \npackage for those that couldn't be re-absorbed. The offer was so \ngenerous that many were privately apprehensive about what would become \nof Israel if Arafat were to have accepted it. Yet, Arafat walked away \nfrom the negotiating table and responded with violence which has \nremained unmitigated ever since. Over 1,000 innocent Israelis have lost \ntheir lives for simply riding on buses, or going out to eat pizza with \ntheir families.\n  Under Article 51 of the U.N. charter, a nation's primary \nresponsibility is to protect the lives of its citizens. When Israel \ntried to do that, by building a defensive barrier to keep out \nterrorists, which has resulted in a 90 percent decrease in terrorist \nattacks, the U.N. General Assembly voted to refer it to the \nInternational Court of Justice, in the Hague. The ICJ declared Israel's \nsecurity fence ``immoral'' and demanded that it be removed. The \nsecurity fence will disrupt the Palestinian's travel, but inconvenience \nis not final, death is.\n  The ICJ decided that only Israel should be singled out for moral \nopprobrium--for building a security fence to defend the lives of its \ncivilian population. This is occurring while Muslims with less dark \npigment in their skin are systematically murdering Muslims with more \ndark pigment in their skin, in the Darfur region of the Sudan, to the \ntune of 1,000 a week. When a Jew or Israel is judged by a different, \nmore stringent standard than that used to judge any other person or \nnation, there is just one term for it: anti-Semitism.\n  Unfortunately, the scourge of anti-Semitism is prolonged when the \ninstitutions we depend upon for community and regional stability are \ninfected by it. Take for example the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency, UNRWA.\n  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency was established in 1949 to \nprovide humanitarian services to Arabs who left their homes during the \nwar against Israel's independence. UNRWA is the only U.N. agency \nassigned to serve only one class of people, and the\n\n[[Page S9266]]\n\nonly refugee agency whose mandate does not include the resettlement of \nits wards. Fifty-four years after its founding, UNRWA is providing \nassistance to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who \nleft. Soon it will be providing services to the grandchildren of the \ngrandchildren. All other refugees are the responsibility of the U.N. \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees; who serves 21.8 million persons in 120 \ncountries with the aim of resettling them.\n  This situation, unintended at first, is perpetuated now by a \ncombination of naivete, inertia and ill design. It is responsible in \nlarge measure for the intractable nature of Palestinian and Arab claims \nagainst the State of Israel, and makes the Palestinians tools in the \ncontinuing Arab struggle to delegitimize and ultimately eliminate \nIsrael. The difficulties created for the Palestinian people by this are \nlegion.\n  With the exception of Jordan, Arab states in which they live have \nrefused to grant citizenship to them or to their descendants born after \n1948.\n  In some countries, Lebanon in particular, laws strictly limit the \nprofessions these persons may enter, the schools they may attend, or \nthe places they may live.\n  UNRWA schools, according to the State Department, provide children \nwith textbooks that ``contain anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish content.'' \nThis is a mild statement. In fact, many of the texts contain \nexceptionally lurid and hateful propaganda.\n  UNRWA-administered camps are filled with weapons, as has been \nacknowledged by UNRWA personnel in statements to the media. The \nGovernment of Israel has charged that UNRWA warehouses have been and \nare being used to store weapons and bomb making material.\n  Each year UNRWA-financed projects, such as the Union of Youth \nActivities Centers, sponsor gigantic ``right of return'' rallies \nthroughout the West Bank and Gaza, encouraging people to believe the \nexistence of Israel is temporary and will be reversed by the U.N.\n  UNRWA is financed by voluntary contributions and, according to U.N. \nrecords, the United States has consistently contributed about 25 \npercent of UNRWA costs. In 2002, that amounted to $110 million. UNRWA \nis funded annually, providing an opportunity for countries to examine \nthe mandate, propose changes, and decide whether or not it will renew \nfunding. It is time to initiate a thorough investigation into the \nfinances of this agency. We must work to eliminate institutional hatred \nas exemplified by the anti-Semitic culture resident within UNRWA.\n  Some will say that America would not be targeted by terrorism if it \ndid not support Israel to the degree that it does. If we stand by and \nwitness this hatred without intervening or supporting our democratic \nally then we would become as venal as the rest of the world. \nAppeasement of hatred and murder would only come back to haunt us just \nas appeasement to terrorism in the 1980s and 1990s did on 9/11. Giving \nin to the prevailing, fashionable wind of anti-Semitism and anti-\nZionism would directly contradict the ideals that this country has been \nfounded upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9266-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9266-S9268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the start of \nHispanic Heritage Month. As we embark on this month-long festivity, I \nam pleased to take this opportunity to celebrate the extraordinary \ncontributions to our country that the Hispanic community embodies.\n  Today it is clear to all of us that Hispanic Americans are \nflourishing in every State in our Nation. The diversity of the \npopulation is such a tribute to the freedom and opportunity America \npromises.\n  Hispanic Americans are starting growing businesses, contributing to \nthe safety and security of our Nation through their service in the \nArmed Forces, going on to college in high rates, and making a real \ndifference in every part of American life. So there is much to \ncelebrate during Hispanic Heritage Month 2004.\n  There are also serious concerns that should involve all of us--not \nonly those who themselves are of Hispanic heritage or those like myself \nwho are privileged to represent a very vibrant, dynamic Latino \ncommunity in New York, but for all Americans--because the issues facing \nHispanic Americans are the same ones that are important to every \nAmerican.\n  I have been concerned because I think on so many fronts the record of \nthe current administration is one that by any objective analysis is \nfound wanting. Time and time again, the administration has promised or \ntold us one thing, only to proceed to do something else and to \nestablish a record of broken promises.\n  For example, on health care, Hispanic Americans, as all Americans, \nare dependent in their older years on Medicare. Medicare provides vital \nservices to Hispanic seniors. They were listening last year as \nPresident Bush claimed his Medicare bill would benefit them. He \nrepeated that claim in his speech at his party's political convention. \nAnd the next day, what did we see? The largest increase in Medicare \npremiums in history.\n  While Hispanic parents, like all parents, look to our public schools \nto help their children acquire the tools to be successful in our very \ncompetitive global economy, again, the Bush administration has proposed \nover and over in its budget to cut key programs such as bilingual \neducation, dropout prevention, migrant and seasonal Head Start, and \nHispanic Serving Institutions that do so much in every community across \nour Nation. Yet in the fiscal year 2005 budget, all of these programs \nare targeted for dramatic cuts. This is happening at the same time that \nwe know the administration has continued to underfund the No Child Left \nBehind Act.\n  In New York City, we have the largest school district in the country, \nwith a million students. That seems shocking to some of my colleagues \nwho come from States that don't even have a million people. In very \ndifficult circumstances, that school district is struggling to deal \nwith the obligations imposed upon it by the No Child Left Behind Act. \nAmong the obligations is to provide testing to children in their native \nlanguage. Yet we know that is still not being fulfilled by the \nadministration. We know there are all kinds of issues with overcrowding \nbecause we are letting people move from school to school under the \ntransfer provision, but we don't have adequate space for them to move \ninto. Because of the very highly concentrated Hispanic population in \nNew York, that falls disproportionately on the children I represent. I \nworry that what was held out as a great promise under No Child Left \nBehind, because of a broken promise and a failure to fund what had been \npromised, the burdens of complying with that act are falling on those \nleast able to bear them.\n  Perhaps most alarmingly, the President continues to tell us, against \nthe evidence we see with our own eyes, that the economy is strong and \nthat the budget deficit, estimated to be at least $422 billion--and \nmore likely $445 billion--is not to be worried about. In fact, \nrecently, on a national news program, the President was asked whether \nhe thought the budget deficit--the highest in our history--was pretty \ngood. The President answered, ``Yes, I do, I do.'' Well, I could not \ndisagree more. There is nothing pretty good about a record budget \nsurplus in 2001 being transformed into a record budget deficit. All the \nwhile, the number of Americans without health care goes up, the number \nof Americans in the middle class falling into poverty goes up.\n  Since the President took office, the number of Americans living in \npoverty has increased by more than 4.3 million men, women, and \nchildren. Median household income for families is down 3.4 percent. \nHowever, the picture for Hispanic Americans is even bleaker because so \nmany of them start at the bottom of the economic ladder, where they \nwork and strive and accomplish so much to lift themselves and their \nchildren out of poverty. So while 11.7 percent of all Americans live in \npoverty, 21.4 percent of Hispanics live in poverty. Last year, median \nincome fell, on average, $63 nationally, but it dropped $864 for \nHispanic families.\n  The list goes on and on because so many of the pillars of the \nAmerican middle-class dream--a dream that sustained my family, that \nmotivated me,\n\n[[Page S9267]]\n\nthat has brought many of us to this Chamber--are beginning to erode. \nWhat does it mean if the income you get from a job is not enough to \nsustain yourself and your family? What does it mean for a minimum wage \nwhen you work 40 hours a week and you remain mired in poverty? What \ndoes it mean if you can get a job but it doesn't have health care \nbenefits? What does it mean if your pension is at risk and the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal Government's promise to try \nto guarantee those pensions, is tottering as well?\n\n  Mark my words, we are on a path that will undermine the economic \nviability not only of American businesses in this competitive global \neconomy but of Americans, American families, and traditionally \ndisadvantaged communities will suffer disproportionately.\n  When people sort of dismiss the importance of the Federal budget \ndeficit, I don't know what economic text they have been studying. We \nknow that it is inevitable that interest rates will rise, capital will \nbe squeezed as the Government takes more and more. But what is even \nworse is we become increasingly dependent on foreign lenders. I for one \nam not enthusiastic about the fact that we borrow tens of billions of \ndollars from the Governments of Japan, China, and South Korea. How can \nwe look ourselves in the mirror and know we are now the world's biggest \ndebtor nation, and among our creditors are nations we built, we saved, \nwe economically propped up or are our competitors strategically and \neconomically for the future? We are setting up a house of cards. When \nit will begin to totter adequately for all to see, I cannot predict, \nbut I know we are living on both borrowed money and borrowed time.\n  I do not wish to dampen the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, \nbut none of this sounds pretty good to me. The Latino community has \nmade so many contributions to our history, our culture, our economy, \nand our society. I wish every one of my colleagues could march with me \nin the many parades we hold in New York, celebrating the various \ndiverse heritages that make New York the most dynamic, extraordinary \nplace on this wonderful planet of ours. Just to see and hear the \nexcitement, the music, the color, and the vivacity would lift your \nspirit.\n  I am so proud and honored to represent the most diverse Hispanic \ncommunity in our Nation. Yet I worry that if we don't focus on what is \nhappening in our health care system, our education system, and our \neconomy, all Americans will wake up to find that the future is not as \nbright as it should be, that the promise we all feel is part of our \nbirthright--those of us born here and those of us who came here--has \nsomehow been undermined.\n  It gives me great pleasure to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month but \nto ask that we do more, to ask that we pass legislation such as AgJobs, \nask that we pass the DREAM Act and continue to do everything we can to \nensure the promise of the American dream for Hispanic Americans and \nevery American.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate an occasion that is \nbecoming more important with every passing year.\n  In 1968, Congress designated the week of September 15 Hispanic \nHeritage Week. The celebration was subsequently extended to include the \nentire month from September 15 to October 15.\n  September 15 was chosen as the opening of Hispanic Heritage Month to \nhonor the independence day of several Latin American countries \nincluding Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. \nThe nations of Mexico and Chile also gained their independence on \nSeptember 16 and 18, respectively.\n  Today, Hispanic Heritage Month not only recognizes and celebrates the \nimportant contributions that Latinos make to our Nation's cultural, \neconomic, and political life, it also reminds us of the strength we \ndraw from diversity.\n  People all over the world have flocked to America in search of \nfreedom and opportunity. This has made us one of the most diverse \ncountries on earth, and Latinos are an important part of that \ndiversity.\n  Hispanics in the United States are not one monolithic, homogeneous \ngroup. In fact, they come from many different cultural and ethnic \nbackgrounds.\n  Latinos in the United States can trace their ancestry to more than 20 \ncountries and territories, spanning an area of thousands of miles, from \nas far north as Puerto Rico to as far south as Argentina, and \nencompassing a wide array of cultures and histories.\n  The families of some Hispanics have been in this land since the 16th \nCentury. Others are newcomers to our Nation, drawn by the same sense of \nhope that has always made America a beacon for immigrants.\n  Some Latinos speak Spanish. Others speak only English, and many are \nconversant in both languages.\n  But taken as a whole, Latinos in the United States reflect the \ndiversity and breadth of Hispanic culture and history.\n  Today, Latinos are not simply a small isolated minority group in our \ncountry; rather they take part in every aspect of American life.\n  Many prominent American citizens are Latinos.\n  People like Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers \nAssociation; Bill Richardson, Governor of New Mexico; Julia Alvarez, \ninternationally recognized author of ``In the Time of the \nButterflies;'' and John Leguizamo, actor and 2004 recipient of the \nHispanic Heritage Award in the Arts have made great social, political \nand artistic contributions to this Nation.\n  Latinos are also active in every facet of business.\n  They are the entrepreneurs of family companies and the CEOs of large \ncorporations. They are bankers and builders, manufacturers and \nmarketers.\n  So there is no way to stereotype Hispanics, they are simply too \ndiverse.\n  But beneath that diversity, I believe there are some strong values \nthat are shared not only by Americans with Hispanic heritage, but by \nAmericans of all backgrounds.\n  We all believe in opportunity.\n  Every person should have a chance to realize his or her dreams.\n  The power of that idea has propelled the United States from an \nupstart nation to the most powerful country on earth. And it is just as \npowerful today as it was 228 years ago.\n  We all believe in hard work. Every individual deserves an \nopportunity, but then it is up to the individual to make the most of \nthat opportunity.\n  And we all know that our families are a source of strength and \ninspiration. The love of our families sustains us, and drives us to \nmake the world better for our children and grandchildren.\n  Nevada has a particularly strong historical connection to Hispanic \nculture. Latinos have been in my State since long before the United \nStates gained independence.\n  In fact, there were Mexicans working in some of the oldest mining \nclaims in the State and they contributed greatly to Nevada's mining \nindustry.\n  One of the richest silver mines in the world, the Comstock Mine near \nVirgina City, was first discovered by Ignacio Paredes from the State of \nSonora in Mexico.\n  It was Sonoran miners who introduced the use of a pan for creek bed \nmining, and the process known as ``dry digging'' that facilitates \nmining in areas where water is scarce.\n  Hispanics also played a role in the early days of the hospitality \nindustry in Nevada. A man of Mexican decent by the name of Bony Aguilar \nis considered one of the pioneers of the tourism and entertainment \nindustry in my State.\n  Originally a miner, Bony Aguilar settled in Silver Peak Marsh in \n1870, where he built a resort and saloon along with a bathhouse that \nutilized the natural hot springs at the site.\n  The resort prospered and people came from across the State to enjoy \nthe hot springs, hear Mr. Aguilar's stories, and stay at the resort.\n  Mexican workers played an integral role in the construction of the \nSan Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad that gave the city of \nLas Vegas its beginnings.\n  And Mexicans were among some of the first residents of Las Vegas.\n  Hispanics were also involved in early ranching in Nevada. The Altube \nbrothers, although of Spanish decent, came to Nevada via South America.\n  They established the Spanish Ranch in northeastern Nevada and \nemployed\n\n[[Page S9268]]\n\nmany Mexican cowboys, who were known to be some of the best in the \nState.\n  The Spanish Ranch became one of the largest ranches in the history of \nNevada, encompassing 60,000 acres.\n  The important role of Latinos in Nevada has continued right up to \nthis day. In 1976 a small group of Cuban Americans established the \nLatin Chamber of Commerce in Las Vegas with the goal of promoting the \neconomic advancement of the Latino community and the State of Nevada.\n  Since then the Latin Chamber of Commerce has played an important role \nin Nevada's Hispanic community. Its members have successfully advocated \nfor educational equality and equal government hiring practices.\n  In the Reno area, the Northern Nevada Hispanic Chamber is also a \nstrong force for progress.\n  These are just a few of the contributions that Hispanics have made to \nNevada.\n  As you can see, Hispanics have been in Nevada since before it became \na State, and they continue to play an important role today both in my \nState and throughout the country.\n  I would like to commend Dr. M. L. Miranda for his pioneering \nscholarship of Hispanics in Nevada. Without his original research, \nthere would be little acknowledgement of the influence of Hispanics \nthroughout Nevada's history.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the many Hispanics serving in our \narmed forces.\n  This is a critical time in our Nation's history, and our troops are \ndeployed all around the world. Many Latinos have followed the call to \nservice, and they risk their lives every day in defense of our freedom \nat home.\n  I am sincerely grateful to all those who leave their families behind \nto serve their country.\n  On this, the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month, I am honored to \nhave been able to share with you the stories of some of the Hispanics \nthat helped establish the ``Battle-Born state,'' and to pay tribute to \nthe diversity of this great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor on another topic \nat this moment, but I want to reflect briefly on what my colleague from \nNew York said about the Hispanic community of New York. I would like to \nspeak about the ones of Idaho. They are some of the most upwardly \nmobile, achieving communities in my State today, with great successes. \nThey are out to become Americans, or are becoming Americans, by their \ningenuity, creativity, and their energy. While I don't think they are \nlooking for a handout, they are certainly looking for a hand up, and \nthey are getting that. I am proud of them, and they have every reason \nto be proud of themselves during this month as we celebrate their \nheritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9268-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9268-S9269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about energy \nonce again. Here we are now, with record gas and oil prices, and \nseveral of the opponents of the energy bill produced by Senator \nDomenici, myself, and others--my Democrat colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle--are now claiming that the bill does little, if it were \npassed and if it were law, to reduce our dependence upon oil or other \nfossil fuels. Less dependence is something we all share.\n\n  First of all, I challenge my Democratic opponents to pass the law. \nFirst pass the law, get it into production, see where it takes us, \ninstead of simply carp and carp very loudly about energy prices and \ndependency on oil, and then do nothing about it except talk in \npolitical terms in a very political year.\n  What I am going to suggest and show you in the next few moments about \none aspect of the bill--one relatively small aspect of the bill--I \nthink argues that if the bill were law today and if it were allowed to \nbe implemented, it would give us the opportunity to rapidly begin to \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil and other fossil fuels.\n  The one provision I am talking about in the bill by itself could \nreduce our dependence on gas and other foreign oils by as much as 12 \nbillion gallons. To understand how wrong my Democratic colleagues are \non this issue, let's look at the provisions of the bill that would \nenable loan guarantees to help kick-start the cellulose ethanol \nindustry. Cellulose ethanol could develop very quickly as an industry \nand have a major impact on rural incomes and the environment as well as \nour energy security.\n  What is cellulose ethanol? Cellulose ethanol looks, smells, and acts \nlike regular ethanol, but instead of being made from corn, it is made \nfrom what we call agricultural residues. Agricultural residues are a \npart of the plants for which we have no commercial productive use \ntoday. When a crop is grown--grain, for example--we use the grain for \nfood, both animal food and human food. Some of the plant is often left \non the ground to keep the soil fertile and from eroding. We call it \nstraw. And the rest must be disposed of as a form of residue. Sometimes \nit is burned, sometimes it is bailed and used for livestock bedding, \nand a variety of other purposes. But residue is straw from which wheat \nand barley grow in my State and nearly every other State in the Nation. \nIt is the corn stover, the stalks, the husks, the cobs from the Corn \nBelt. It is the sugar bagasse or cotton stalks from Florida or Texas. \nIt is that residue that American agriculture produces.\n  Farmers often pay to dispose of this material. We have known for a \nlong time that cellulose in this material can be transformed into \nhydrocarbons. Now it seems that the technology to do so is closer than \never before.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported on April 21 of this year that Iogen, \na Canadian company, had begun to produce cellulose ethanol \ncommercially. That ethanol produced from wheat straw is now being sold \nand used in small quantities in Ottawa and surrounding areas.\n  The cover of the August 30 issue of Fortune magazine, a magazine I \nhold in my hand, says ``How to Kick the Oil Habit.'' The article \nmentions alternative fuels as one of the four ways to kick the habit. \nIt also focuses on Iogen and cellulose ethanol in this article. So \ncellulose ethanol seems to be on its way.\n  But why should any of us care about this? What does it have to do \nwith our Energy bill? The Energy bill contains a provision that would \nallow commercial cellulose ethanol production to begin in the United \nStates within a matter of a couple of years.\n  Iogen has partnered with Shell Oil, and together they want to build \nthe world's first full-scale cellulose ethanol production facility \nright here in the United States. But as long as the Energy bill is \nstalled, so is this project. A lot of lipservice can be given, but \nuntil this Congress acts and until my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle line up with us to allow this technology to come on line, \nthere can be a lot of talk, but the dependence on foreign oil will \ncontinue.\n\n  Also stalled today would be an opportunity to begin to fill the gas \ntanks of Americans with a fuel that would be grown in the heartland of \nAmerica. Certainly, we have and will continue to use corn-based \nethanol, and the Energy bill I talk about would go a long way toward \nbringing more of that into production. But there is a limit as to how \nmuch corn we can dedicate to energy production.\n  On the other hand, with cellulose ethanol, we are not talking about \nsmall quantities. This summer, Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman \nannounced the results of a study that showed there is enough \nagricultural residue produced on our farms to support 200 of these \ntypes of ethanol plants and that those plants could displace 7 to 10 \npercent of the gasoline we consume today. That is a reasonable \nguesstimate.\n  You have heard me right: If we get this industry going by simply \nusing waste materials from America's farms, we could knock almost 10 \npercent off our gas imports. What does that say as to our ability to \nnegotiate in a world market? It says a great deal because now we have \nleverage, and the leverage is a product being produced right here at \nhome.\n  This will not happen unless we are able to implement this bill and \nbring it on board. Just one cellulose ethanol plant would enhance \nenergy security by replacing a gasoline component of the crude oil \nimports from 2.4 to 2.9 million barrels per year; increase farm income \nby $25 million per year by creating economic value for residues that \ncurrently, as I said, have little to no value or are simply viewed as \nwaste;\n\n[[Page S9269]]\n\ncreate economic development by creating over 1,000 new jobs during peak \nconstruction, and almost 200 new permanent jobs and about 450 spinoff \njobs.\n  That is positive economics when you can talk in those terms, and \nthose terms are not just talk. That is reality if we implement the \nEnergy bill.\n  It would reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide by 355,000 metric \ntons annually and would reduce emissions of major air components \ntargeted by the Clean Air Act.\n  A mature cellulose ethanol industry based on agricultural residues \nalone would multiply these benefits: Enhance U.S. energy security by \ndisplacing up to 10 to 12 billion gallons of gas annually, which \nrepresents 7 to 10 percent of current U.S. gas consumption; provide \napproximately 200 to 300 rural communities with more jobs and farmers \nwith more income, and certainly a stronger economy for American \nagriculture; reduce carbon dioxide, CO2, emissions from 65 to 100 \nmillion metric tons.\n  We are talking about putting money into U.S. farmers' pockets instead \nof the pockets of the oil sheiks of the Middle East.\n  About 29 States currently produce ethanol, and those States clearly \nhave the ability to produce cellulose ethanol in a tremendous way. \nChart 1 shows the States that are capable of doing that. Can you \nimagine, instead of having only a few oil-producing States in our \nNation, we would have nearly 25 States capable of producing? That is \nthe value of this program, and adding nearly $25 million a year to the \nlocal economy. That is what we are talking about with regard to this \nEnergy bill and what it could do.\n  So not only are we talking about that, but our second chart shows \nwhat is extremely important, and that is in carbon savings reported by \nvarious studies by bringing this kind of production online. Reducing \ndemand on gasoline from foreign oil from 15 to 20 percent creates \nanywhere from $5 billion to $7.5 billion annually in economic growth in \nrural America. That is what we are talking about, and that is what I \nthink chart 3 represents so clearly. It is tremendously important.\n  Here is today's gas engines, in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. \nHere is the diesel hybrid that we are all excited about today in hybrid \nproduction, again a decline. Here is the hydrogen fuel cell car. Our \nPresident has been leading and talking about the new hydrogen \ntechnologies for surface transportation. Then we have today's ethanol \nengine, today's ethanol fuel cell engine.\n  As a country, we are simply on hold at this moment because for 5 long \nyears this Congress has debated but has refused to pass a comprehensive \nnational energy policy that not only advances these technologies but \nincentivizes the marketplace to go after these technologies.\n  So when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle simply say the \nEnergy bill will do nothing for the American consumer, I say \npolitically and in reality, shame on them. They know better. They \nworked with us in trying to develop this bill over the last 5 years. It \nhas become a bipartisan working piece in a very comprehensive way.\n  Today, I have taken just a small piece of that bill, the cellulose \nethanol production capability of this country, and to suggest that it \nwould reduce our dependence by 12 percent or even more, that it would \nimprove American agriculture and put $25 million a year into the \nheartland of America, oh, my goodness, we cannot as a country look \nforward in that way, shame on us.\n  I hoped we could have passed a national energy bill this year. We are \ncertainly going to in the future because the American public, I trust, \nis going to get fed up with paying $2.10 or more a gallon for their \nfuel and finding themselves increasingly dependent upon the Middle \nEast. That is something the American consumer should not tolerate and \nthat the American politician ought not stall out or block from \nhappening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9269-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9269-S9271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONSERVATION ROYALTIES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Tennessee is \nagain on the Senate floor, and it is my pleasure this afternoon to \nspend a few minutes with him marking the 40th anniversary of the \ncreation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a fund that has been \nextraordinarily helpful and useful to Governors, mayors, local elected \nofficials, and advocates for conservation and for preservation for \nthese 40 years.\n  When it was passed and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson, \nit was a very farsighted and bold legislation that acknowledged that \none of the great characteristics that separates America from the rest \nof the world, particularly the old world represented by the European \ncountries. The essence of America, having such great expanses and great \noutdoors, separates it from an old world that was relatively small \ngeographically and somewhat cramped. The United States of America has \nmany special characteristics about it, but the one that really stands \nout that people of all political persuasions and from all geographic \nareas really appreciate and grasp is the value of the vastness of our \nland and the great open spaces. Our mighty rivers, our deep canyons, \nour extraordinary lush forests and green spaces, our breathtakingly \nbeautiful deserts are all the things that make this country what it is.\n  Although the country was created this way and a great gift to all of \nus from the Creator, it is not going to stay this way unless we take \nsome affirmative actions to preserve what we can, to give our people \nand our population places to grow, expand, earn livings, and create \njobs. We have an obligation, as stewards, as the Senator said earlier, \nnot just to our constituents but actually we have a moral obligation to \nthe Creator who created this beauty to be good stewards of the land and \nthe gift that has been given.\n  Looking at the 40th anniversary of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, while we have done a good job, while we have made a fine effort, \nwhile we can point to many success stories of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, I stand today on the 40th anniversary with the \nSenator from Tennessee to say that we must do better. There are \nterrible gaps in funding that are leaving beautiful States such as \nTennessee and magnificent States such as Louisiana and other States \nthroughout our Nation desperate for Federal help to finish the good \nwork that was started late in the last century.\n  President Roosevelt, who is even credited today with being such a \ngreat visionary conservationist, was an advocate of the preservation of \nspecial places in America. That is what we come today to talk about, \nhow important it is to recommit ourselves, on this 40th anniversary, to \nsetting aside the proper amount of money, not more than we need but an \nadequate amount of money to help our Governors and our mayors and \nsupport a new effort for wildlife preservation and support our coastal \nareas in light of the original vision of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  So the Senator from Tennessee and I have introduced the Americans \nOutdoors Act of 2004. I commend the chairman, Pete Domenici from New \nMexico, who, in this very challenging year, has already allowed us a \nhearing on this bill. We look forward to working with the members of \nthe Energy Committee, which has jurisdiction, of course, and the \nDepartment of Interior as we move this great legislation through \nseeking a more reliable source of funding.\n  We propose in our legislation to basically establish the same \nconservation royalty that the Federal Government now gives for onshore \nproduction of oil and natural gas. This bill will create a conservation \nroyalty for offshore production of oil and natural gas and have it \ndistributed in a way that complements and fulfills the promise of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. It is like saying the great wealth of \nthis resource, of oil and natural gas, should be invested, as the \nSenator said, in the Federal Treasury to help economic development and \nbuilding highways and the space program and should support our \nmilitary.\n  A large percentage of these tax dollars should go for general uses, \nbut a small percentage, 25 percent of these billions of dollars that \nare generated, should really go to a conservation royalty to \nacknowledge the creation that we have inherited, to acknowledge the\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\ngreat land and water that we have inherited, and to say on this day we \nbelieve it is wrong to take and never to give back. We believe it is \nour political and moral responsibility to be good stewards of the \nwealth that is generated and to turn back a portion of that money for \nconservation. It is our responsibility to give to our grandchildren and \ngreat grandchildren the great gift and the great land that was given to \nus by our forefathers and our Presidents, both Republican and Democrat, \nwho have argued and established this great fund.\n  So it is my hope, with the Senator from Tennessee, that we will be \njoined by other Senate leaders as we pursue this effort to find a \nreliable stream of revenue to create a conservation royalty that will \nfully fund the State side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a \nrobust coastal program for the States in our Nation, and a wildlife \nrestoration fund, as well as the urban parks component of the State \nside of the bill.\n  I think we should explore and try to look for opportunities to find a \nreliable stream of money for the Federal side as we continue to build \nand expand on public lands in the United States.\n  Let me say there is no one in this Senate who understands the great \nvalue of private property more than do I and the Senator from \nTennessee. I go all over the world doing a lot of work on economic \ndevelopment and lifting people out of poverty. I have been probably to \nmore orphanages and homes for poor children than most. Many Senators do \nthat great work. I am well aware that, in order for countries to create \nwealth, owning private property and building equity in a home or \ngetting a mortgage for a farm is essential. That is the founding \nessence of America. This bill we intend to reinvigorate today is not a \nthreat to private property. It complements the great commitment we have \nto private property, by saying that some lands, a small portion of \nlands, should be in public hands. The majority should be in private \nhands. It is an extraordinary partnership that gives value to both.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund envisions that strong \npartnership making all of our land more valuable, cleaner, more user \nfriendly, open and beautiful for us to give to future generations.\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee, who may want to add a few \nadditional words. But I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the distribution of money to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. It is not blown up, but I think the cameras at least can zoom in \nto see how volatile the funding has been, up and down, up and down, \nsince 1965. Our bill attempts to equal this out by creating a \nconservation royalty so we can rely on these dollars and we can make \ngood plans, spend taxpayer money well and wisely, creating beautiful \nbike paths and trails, helping to make more robust our park systems and \nour public lands for the benefit of our grandchildren in a way that \ncomplements the private sector, private property, and the economic \ndevelopment efforts that will continue to be underway for generations \nto come in this great Nation.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a news \nrelease that was issued by the Department of Interior, saying how proud \nthey are to have distributed some money, royalties, for conservation to \ninterior States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   States Receive More Than $1 Billion From Share of Federal Mineral \n                                Revenues\n\n       Washington.--Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton \n     announced today that 36 states received more than $1 billion \n     during 2003 as part of their share of federal revenues \n     collected by the Department's Minerals Management Service.\n       The $1,096,699,888 distributed to states during the year, \n     was nearly 46 percent more than 2002 payments to states that \n     totaled $753 million.\n       ``Responsible energy development on public lands and \n     offshore areas contribute greatly to states and local \n     governments,'' Norton said. ``The money enables local \n     governments to fund important projects for the betterment of \n     communities and the lives of Americans.''\n       The nearly $1.1 billion distributed through December of \n     last year represents the states' cumulative share of revenues \n     collected from mineral production on federal lands located \n     within their borders, and from federal offshore oil and gas \n     tracts adjacent to their shores.\n       ``In many cases states share their revenues with counties, \n     which apply the money to meet needs like infrastructure \n     improvements and school funding,'' MMS Director Johnnie \n     Burton said.\n       During calendar year 2003, the state of Wyoming again led \n     all states by receiving more than $503 million as its share \n     of revenues collected from mineral production on federal \n     lands within its borders, including oil, gas and coal \n     production. New Mexico's share was more than $318 million, \n     while $62.7 million was received by the state of Colorado. \n     Other states sharing revenues included Utah with more than \n     $54.4 million; Louisiana with $31.5 million; Montana at $26.9 \n     million; and California with more than $25.3 million. \n     (Complete table provided below.)\n       A state is entitled to a share of the mineral revenues \n     collected from federal lands located within that state's \n     boundaries. For the majority of onshore federal lands, states \n     receive 50 percent of the revenues while the other 50 percent \n     goes to various funds of the U.S. Treasury, including the DOI \n     Reclamation Fund. Alaska receives a 90 percent share as \n     prescribed by the Alaska Statehood Act. States may also \n     receive appropriations from the offshore royalty-funded \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund to help them with park \n     and land acquisitions.\n       In addition, coastal states with producing federal offshore \n     tracts adjacent to their seaward boundaries receive 27 \n     percent of those mineral royalties. Remaining offshore \n     revenues collected by the Minerals Management Service are \n     deposited in various accounts of the U.S. Treasury, with the \n     majority of those revenues going to the General Fund.\n       MMS is the federal agency in the U.S. Department of the \n     Interior that manages the nation's oil, natural gas, and \n     other mineral resources on the outer continental shelf in \n     federal offshore waters. The agency also collects, accounts \n     for, and disburses mineral revenues from Federal and American \n     Indian lands. Between 1982 and 2003, MMS distributed more \n     than $135 billion in revenues from onshore and offshore \n     lands, an average of more than $6 billion per year, to the \n     Nation, States and American Indians. Nearly $1 billion from \n     those revenues goes into the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     annually for the development of State and Federal park and \n     recreation lands.\n\nAlabama.....................................................$14,601,401\nAlaska.......................................................13,126,183\nArizona.........................................................128,474\nArkansas......................................................4,379,518\nCalifornia...................................................25,336,757\nColorado.....................................................62,703,158\nFlorida.........................................................387,298\nGeorgia..............................................................54\nIdaho.........................................................1,880,786\nIllinois........................................................100,822\nIndiana...........................................................6,438\nKansas........................................................1,928,091\nKentucky.........................................................55,782\nLouisiana....................................................31,561,211\nMichigan........................................................425,844\nMinnesota........................................................17,427\nMississippi...................................................1,231,716\nMissouri........................................................169,832\nMontana......................................................26,906,699\nNebraska.........................................................15,125\nNevada........................................................5,015,687\nNew

LANDRIEU. We ask the same, that the same process that is in the \nlaw for onshore oil and gas drilling be in the law for off-shore oil \nand gas drilling. The onshore revenue provision has been in place since \nthe early 1920s.\n  The record is clear. This, basically, is the essence of what our bill \ndoes to mark the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Let's actually find a way to fund it. That is what \nour bill will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I commend the Senator from Louisiana. She has worked \nhard for 6 years on legislation like this. I am proud to join her on \nthe 40th anniversary of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to \ncontinue its bipartisan support.\n  If I may ask through the Chair a question to the Senator from \nLouisiana. She mentions that for 50 years we have had a tradition in \nthis country of a State royalty. In other words, if you drill for oil \nin Wyoming, for example, there is a royalty paid to the State of \nWyoming, which is 50 cents out of every dollar of revenues.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Louisiana knows what amount of money \nthat royalty produced for the State of Wyoming this year?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I do. I happen to have that document right here.\n  I understand the State of Wyoming, according to this document, has \nreceived over $500 million. Yes, $503,771,000 this year, which was the \nState royalty for Wyoming.\n  For the record, New Mexico received this year $318,768,000 in the \nsame account.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The Senator and I understand that those concerned about the \nappropriations process in the Senate have to deal with this issue. \nToday, under our budget rules, if we were to create a conservation \nroyalty for offshore oil drilling and made it identical to what we have \nbeen doing for 50 years with onshore oil drilling, that would require \nus to treat it in a different way today than they did 50 years ago when \nthey started it. We know that. But what we are trying to suggest is \nthere is no real difference between creating a royalty on oil drillings \nor gas drillings onshore and oil or gas drillings offshore. In fact, \nthere is a better argument for creating a conservation royalty than for \ncreating just any old royalty for the State of Wyoming or the State of \nNew Mexico or Arizona or Montana.\n  The logic is this. I am one who votes for more drilling for oil and \ngas because I don't like us relying so much on the Middle East for it, \nso I vote for that. But I don't know why we cannot agree that, if we \nhave an environmental burden on the one hand, we cannot create an \nenvironmental benefit on the other hand.\n  This is a subject the Senator from Louisiana and I hope to talk over \nwith our Members and say yes, this is an issue. We understand that. But \nfor 50 years we have been taking 50 cents out of every dollar that \ncomes from drilling on Federal lands onshore--90 cents in Alaska--and \nleaving it in the State where the drilling is done. What we are \nsuggesting is we take about 25 cents of every dollar from offshore \ndrilling and create a conservation royalty for the State to fund these \nprograms the Senator talked about. We think that makes good sense, and \nthat it is in the 40-year bipartisan tradition of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  I am convinced there is a bipartisan conservation majority in the \nUnited States of America, and that on this legislation there will \neventually be a bipartisan conservation majority in support of the \nAmericans Outdoors Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9271-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9271-S9273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SQUEEZE ON MIDDLE-INCOME FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this afternoon \nand express my concern and the concern of many of us around the country \nabout the growing squeeze that is occurring on middle-income families \nin the United States. This is a very alarming trend we are seeing.\n  I address not only that point but also the issue of what is happening \nwith the rising level of poverty in the country, particularly poverty \namong our youngest citizens in the earliest ages, and the number of \nchildren being born in the United States who are being born into \nextreme poverty--not just living in poverty but living below half the \npoverty line.\n  When you think of the combination of the squeeze occurring on the \nmiddle income and watching the growing numbers of children living in \npoverty in this country, all of us ought to be supremely alarmed about \nthose trendlines.\n  Add to that the fact that there now appears to be the largest single \ndeficit in the history of the United States, and the failure to create \nnew jobs in the country, which is the worst performance of job creation \nsince just prior to the beginning of the Great Depression back in the \n1920s. We have lost somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million jobs in \nthis country in the last 4 years. When you compare that to the 20 \nmillion jobs created during the 1990s, there is a startling contrast in \nwhat is happening to America's economy.\n  I think it is critically important in these days that the American \npeople be well informed factually about what is occurring as we make \nthe difficult choices in the coming days about the leadership of this \nNation.\n  Let me begin with the middle-income squeeze because I think it is \nimportant to know what is happening to families out there. We are \nwatching a tremendous decline in household incomes. Household incomes \nhave fallen about 3.4 percent during the last 4 years.\n  Let me put that in terms of dollars and cents.\n  To give you some idea of the median household income in the year \n2000, the median household income was almost $45,000 a year--actually \n$44,853. Today, that median income is now $43,318. That is a decline of \n$1,500 in median household income. That is a drop in earning power.\n  If you have merely a decline in income and also a commensurate \ndecline in costs, you would say that is not great, but certainly given \nthe cost of essential items that middle-income families must acquire, \nthose prices are going down, then the declining income would not be \nstartling. But what is happening is quite the opposite.\n  We have watched median household income decline by $1,500, and \nsimultaneously watched gas prices during the same period of time go up \nalmost 20 percent in the United States. College tuition has gone up \nsome 28 percent in that same 4-year period, and family health care \npremiums have risen 45 percent just in the last 2 years by 26 percent--\n11 percent in 1 year and 15 percent the next. So we are watching \nhousehold median income decline by $1,500, and then we are watching \ncollege tuition, health care premiums, and gasoline prices soar. This \nis the squeeze. This is what is happening to average families in this \ncountry.\n  Also, as I mentioned at the outset, we are watching jobs not being \ncreated. We are short of well over a million jobs that we need in order \nto maintain a growing economy. But even these jobs are not coming back. \nWe saw 144,000 new jobs created in the month of August. That is \ncertainly vastly improved over the 32,000 new jobs created in July. \nUnderstand that just to keep pace with the new entries into the job \nmarket we should be creating about 220,000 jobs every month. That is \nwhat we need to do in an economy such as ours with a population of \nalmost 300 million people: You have it produce about 220,000 new jobs \nevery month just to stay even.\n  When we start talking about 32,000 jobs or 144,000 jobs, while \ncertainly 133,000 is positive news, it still is well\n\n[[Page S9272]]\n\nbelow what we ought to be doing if we are going to keep people working \nat levels that will allow them to provide for their families.\n\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, we are watching incomes decline. This is \neven more true when you start talking about new entrants into the job \nmarket from people who have lost a job and then go back to work. They \nare making about $9,000 less a year overall, putting all incomes \ntogether, than they were before.\n  While we are creating some new jobs, the wages these jobs are paying \nand the benefits being provided are very different than they were with \nthe previous jobs held by these very same people. This is tough news.\n  Again, there are choices that will be made in the next 45 or 50 days.\n  I point out for the purposes of discussion--sometimes it all gets \nlost--that there are those who are claiming there is nothing to worry \nabout, that in fact our economy is good and strong.\n  I noted the other day that there was a speech the President gave in \nMichigan when he talked about how well our economy was doing. I think \nit was in Muskegon, MI. He was speaking just 2 days ago:\n\n       This economy of ours is strong, and it's getting stronger.\n\n  That was a speech given in Muskegon and Greenwood Village, CO.\n  Since the President has taken office, less than 4 years ago, the \nState of Michigan has lost 250,000 jobs. In Colorado, there has been a \nloss of 80,000 jobs.\n  I don't know how you square a statement of saying the economy is \nstrong and getting stronger when a quarter of a million people in one \nof the most industrial States in the United States have lost work, and \n80,000 jobs in the State of Colorado no longer exist. How is that a \nstrong economy or a stronger growing economy? I don't see that. I don't \nthink most Americans would.\n\n  John Kerry, our colleague, who is running for the Presidency, has \npromised to create 10 million new jobs during the first 4 years of his \nadministration. We need job creation in this country. We need to be \ntalking about creating tax cuts for middle-income families and smaller \nbusinesses. That is where real growth occurs when you provide the kind \nof stimulus to smaller businesses and industries. They need the relief \nfinancially to modernize, to buy new equipment, to make themselves more \ncompetitive in a global economy. We need more of that kind of economic \nthinking than what we have seen in the last few years which has \ncontributed to the worsening economic program at home.\n  I am an optimist and believe we ought to talk about good things that \ncan happen in our country. It is very difficult to go anywhere in this \ncountry and have that kind of a conversation when people are out there \nstruggling every day harder and harder to make ends meet, watching \ntheir incomes decline and their costs rise, and wondering how they will \ndeal with the issues.\n  There are an additional 1.2 million Americans who no longer have \nhealth insurance. That number is up to 45 million in our country; it \nwas below 44 million, but in the last year or so that number has jumped \nby 1.2 million. Those people are working Americans who have lost their \nhealth care coverage because of the rising premium costs of smaller and \nmidsized businesses. Their employers are not mean spirited. They just \ncannot afford to maintain the cost of the health care premiums and some \nare dropping their employees from this kind of coverage.\n  So now we have working Americans who have watched their health care \npremiums jump tremendously. The average home health care premium in \n2000 was $6,351 a year. Less than 4 years later it has jumped to well \nover $9,000, almost $10,000. That is staggering. Employers just do not \nhave the resources to pay these bills. So we find now 1.2 million \nworking families in the ranks of the uninsured in our country. That \nadds to our problems.\n  I mentioned a moment ago child poverty. I will share with my \ncolleagues my deep and growing concern about these numbers because this \nworries me. This is not the America that I was raised to believe in.\n  We are talking about a generation of kids coming along who will have \nto be the best educated, best prepared our Nation has ever produced. We \nare now in a highly competitive marketplace in the world. When kids \ngrew up a generation or two ago you worried, if you were in \nConnecticut, that you might end up competing with a young person from \nNew Mexico or you might compete with a person in Oregon. That was what \nit was like in this country.\n  Today, for a child growing up in New Mexico or in Oregon or \nConnecticut, their competition will be in Beijing, it will be in \nMoscow, it will be in Sydney, in Johannesburg, London. A global economy \nwill be the challenge. How well prepared is this generation coming \nalong?\n  We may be in the most unique position of any generation of Americans \nin watching a succeeding generation be less well off, less well \nprepared than we were as a generation. Every other generation \nthroughout the more than 200-year history of our country has left their \nchildren and grandchildren in a stronger position. That has been our \nlegacy as a nation. We are now precariously close to setting back for \nthe first time in our history where a generation coming along may not \nbe as well prepared, particularly when the challenges are going to be \ngreater than ever before.\n  I worry very much when we see the jump, by 4.3 million, of Americans \nliving in poverty over the last 3 years. In the year 2000, of the 300 \nmillion Americans, there were 31.6 million Americans living in poverty. \nToday that number is close to 36 million, up 4.3 million people living \nin poverty in the United States. Of those numbers, we have almost 13 \nmillion of that 36 million who are children.\n\n  While the overall child poverty rate is 17.6 percent, the poverty \nrate for children under 5 is 20 percent. That makes the fastest growing \ngroup among the poor today, families with children under the age of 5.\n  Those are the facts. That is the legacy of 36 months--not quite, \nalmost 40 months of leadership here. We are finding ourselves in worse \nshape.\n  We are fighting tooth and nail to get some resources for child care, \nfor nutrition, for WIC programs to try to do something to assist these \nkids and these families. It is like pulling teeth around here to get \nsome help for the kids who, through no fault of their own, are living \nin poverty. Yet the children are the ones who will be asked to defend \nour country, to become well educated, to provide for the strength of \nAmerica in the 21st century.\n  I am deeply alarmed about the trendlines. We are not spending enough \ntime addressing and talking about what we might do. This is the largest \nannual increase in child poverty in 10 years that has occurred in our \ncountry. Overall child poverty increased by 5.4 percent in 2003 while \nchildren living in extreme poverty increased by 11.6 percent. In fact, \nextreme poverty for children under 5 increased by 16.2 percent.\n  According to the Census Bureau, over 40 percent of children under the \nage of 18 who are being raised by a single mom are poor. Over half of \nthem live in extreme poverty. That is below the poverty level.\n  More than half of our children under the age of five who are being \nraised by a single mom are poor. And, 60 percent of them--three of \nevery five poor 5 year olds being raised by a single mother--are living \nin extreme poverty.\n  I addressed the issue of the squeeze that is occurring on middle-\nincome families, watching the incomes decline and the costs rise. They \nare dramatic over the last few years. I am worried about the crushing \nblow that is occurring to children and the level of poverty that is \noccurring.\n  I raise these issues because we are going to have to change \ndirection. We cannot continue the path we are on and expect these \nnumbers to change. Every indication we have is the numbers are going to \nget worse and not better if we do not take dramatic steps in a \ndifferent direction. I raise them today, and I pointed out earlier, and \nthese are not personal attacks, they are choices we have to make. The \ncandidates for President have entirely different views on how we ought \nto address this.\n  I mentioned earlier our colleague, Senator Kerry, has talked directly \nabout tax cuts and where they ought to occur--for middle-income people, \nfor smaller businesses; a health care plan that would start taking \npeople off the rolls of the uninsured, put people in insurance programs \nand relieve them of\n\n[[Page S9273]]\n\nthe fear of a child or a loved one being caught with a crippling \nillness or accident and bankrupting a family overnight because of their \nabsence of insurance protection; of seeing to it that people who work \novertime get paid for the overtime instead of shutting them off and \ndepriving them of the extra income they need; of raising the minimum \nwage instead of depriving people of the kind of increases they need to \nmake ends meet.\n  The tax incentives make a difference. Those are choices. The \nPresident says the economy is strong and getting stronger. Tell that to \nthe 250,000 people in Michigan or the 80,000 Coloradans who have lost \ntheir jobs. I think they will agree. This is hardly getting better.\n  We need a change. That change will be available to people in less \nthan 50 days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator from New Mexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator has 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 10 and I know there is another Republican \nSenator who is not here but he gave me another 10. I am just kidding. \nWe will try to get by with 10.\n  I say to my good friend, I am just wondering, we have a President who \nis in the hinterland campaigning and we have an opposition candidate \nfrom your side. I wonder, how come all of you are coming to the Senate, \none after another, telling us what your candidate is going to do? Can't \nhe tell Americans for himself? Does he need you all to come down here \nand give a speech every day, five or six of you, one after another, \ntalking about what your candidate is going to do?\n  No, I will not yield at this point. You have been talking for a long, \nlong time, so let me speak.\n  Mr. DODD. How long did the Senator from Connecticut speak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes and I gave you 2 extra minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. That is a long time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9273-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9273-S9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a speech on energy, but the \nSenator energized me so much that I want to speak a little bit about \nwhat he spoke about and then I will talk about the people in the Senate \non their side of the aisle.\n  First, isn't it wonderful to say, fellow Americans, we need 10 \nmillion new jobs.\n  Senator Smith, you own a business; you know how people get jobs, \nright? Your business employs them, right? If things are bad in the \neconomy, you cannot hire more, right? What good does it do for a \npolitician to come up here and say we need 10 million new jobs? That is \ntrue. In fact, I would say we probably could use 20, although the truth \nis, we do not have that many people to be hired, but we could say that.\n  Well, that is no plan. That is a statement. How are you going to do \nit? Who are you going to follow? Are you going to follow the Clinton \nmodel? They say that did all those things. There is a lot of question \nwhether that plan did all that. But why don't Democrats say: We are \ngoing to follow the Clinton plan? The Clinton plan was to raise taxes. \nIt just happened that the economy was recovering. And the Democrats \nwill say: Yes, but the country got very confident once we put in the \nincrease in taxes because they thought we were going to reduce the \ndeficit. That is really their idea of where they got their great, new \njobs. That may be true, but nobody is saying they are going to do that.\n  They stand up and say: We need 10 million jobs. Bush is not producing \nthem. We need 10 million jobs. Elect our man. That will take care of \nit. Does anybody believe that? It used to be they would say something \nbetter. When I came to the Senate, and we would have a downturn, the \nDemocrats would come to the floor and say: We are going to add jobs. \nHow? They would say: We are going to spend money. Do you know what they \nused to do? They would put a public works jobs bill on the floor and \nsay: We are going to build bridges. We are going to build roads. We are \ngoing to build all these things. And the American people, like big, fat \nsuckers, would say: Let's pass it. We are going to get new jobs.\n  We stopped doing that. I say to the Presiding Officer, have you ever \nheard of anybody doing that since you have been here? No. Do you know \nwhy? Because it does not work. By the time those new jobs would come \non, do you know how many years passed, on average? Three years before \nthey started; 7 years before they got finished. By then, there was a \nwhole new set of problems. Right? The downturn was gone. It did not \nhave anything to do with it, but they passed something. Or they said: \nLet's double all the spending in all these programs we have. That will \nput everybody to work.\n  Maybe we could get a chart here and say: We need 10 million new jobs. \nLet's put them to work with Government programs. We would see what that \nproduced. The American people would say: Are you nuts? You want to \nspend $50 billion to put people to work? And then it would be invented \nwork.\n  So the truth is, you have to say, when you talk about 10 million \njobs: I have the secret of how to make the American economy grow--not \nhow you wish it would, but how you are going to make it grow.\n  And I have not heard much. I have heard there is going to be more \nmiddle-income people getting tax cuts. Interesting. Has anybody put on \na board how much that will cost? And will they really do it? And how \nmuch are they going to give the middle income back? And what will that \ndo to create jobs? Most interesting. I would like to see it. Enough of \nthat.\n  Second issue. Health care costs are too high. Let's take a poll. I \nsay to Senators, put up your hand as to how many of you think health \ncare costs are too high? I imagine you would get 100 votes. Right? One \nhundred Senators say health care costs are too high, health care costs \nare going up too much. Wonderful.\n  Now, let's go out to America and tell them that: I am running, and \nhealth care costs are too high. That is good. But now the question is, \nAre you telling us you know how to reduce the health care costs? What \nis your plan? What is your secret? Do you have some new way to do it? \nLet's hear how. I do not hear that because the one thing that is being \nsaid is, maybe the Government ought to take more people and let the \nGovernment take care of them in health care. But then, when you say, \nwhat do you want to do that for, is it that you mean you want more \nGovernment-owned and operated health care?\n\n  Now, I know when you say ``socialized medicine,'' they get very \nupset. But maybe you do not want socialized medicine. Maybe you only \nwant half socialized medicine, not all of it. But, frankly, I do not \nsee any plan. The only one I have heard about is the importation of \ndrugs. And I am not going to argue that today. It has been argued back \nand forth.\n  I will just say, I have read everything I can about the importation \nof drugs and its impact on the costs of prescription drugs in America. \nAnd I guess I am prepared to say that there is very little empirical \nevidence that across the board, for really good kinds of medicines that \nare important today, and to our seniors, that in the long run, unless \nyou physically take your body on a train or an airplane or car and \ndrive to a foreign country and buy the prescription and bring it back, \nthere is very little evidence that you are sure to get the right kind \nand that the price will be right if you ask it be shipped. Now, enough \nof that.\n  So the question is, we need 10 million more jobs. How will the \nDemocrat Presidential candidate do it? And let's talk about it. And \nthen we need to reduce health care costs; and let's ask, how would we \ndo it?\n  Now, let me tell you, there is a lot of talk about the uninsured. \nFrankly, the most interesting thing is, they speak about a lot of \nchildren being uninsured. I submit that may be true. But when we were \nworking 8 or 9 or 10 years ago on health care, I was involved. We asked \nsome insurance companies: Well, how much does it cost to insure kids? \nDo you know what they said? ``We don't insure kids, children. We don't \nhave any insurance policy that insures children.'' ``Are you kidding?'' \n``Yes, we don't do that.''\n\n[[Page S9274]]\n\n  Well, frankly, before that year was out, we pushed somebody. One \ninsurance company finally put out a brochure that said: We will insure \nchildren. Do you know what. Very cheap. The thing is, most children are \nnot covered that way. They are covered derivatively through their \nparents. Right? One of their parents gets a job. Their parent's job \ncovers them and their kids. They buy insurance. They don't buy it only \nfor themselves, they buy it for them and their children.\n  So, in essence, it is good to say: We need to cover more people. It \nis hard to say how you are going to do it. I submit if you put what the \nPresident is proposing side by side with what the Democratic candidate \nis saying, you at least have some very positive things you can measure \nthat are being done that the President is proposing. The other one is \nuntried, nice to talk about, beautiful rhetoric. But I think the \nPresident's basic ones, with some additional things added to it, will \nprobably be the way we go as a country anyway.\n  Now, all the other issues that were raised by my good friend on \nbehalf of their nominee could all be answered much the same way. So \nthere are more poor people than there were before. Good statement. Not \nquite as many as they say, not quite as big a problem as they allege. \nBut the question is, What are you going to do about it? How are you \ngoing to fix it?\n\n  Most of the time, we are down here on the floor of the Senate talking \nabout education and the inadequacy of our education. It is most \ncompelling to me that about 4 weeks ago, Alan Greenspan, who normally \ndoes not have anything to do with education, was being asked a question \nin one of our committees about the fact that we have a lot of people \nwho are unemployed, we have a lot of people underemployed, we have very \ntough competition from overseas. What do we do about it, Dr. Greenspan? \nI say to my colleagues, he did not talk about any single American \nprogram. He did not say: Let's increase the Small Business \nAdministration so it would help more small businesses. He did not say: \nLet's give a tax cut to somebody. Do you know what he said? He said: \nWell, if that is the case, I guess we better start educating our \nchildren better. That will do more for the unemployment, more for the \nunderemployment than anything else: better technical education for \nchildren. I am surprised--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Murkowski, could I have 2 additional \nminutes? I say to the Senator, you are next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But I am surprised that is not what we are talking \nabout: How do we take that tremendous number of young people walking \nour streets, who are not educated, who do not have diplomas, and make \nthem educated so they will get out of poverty? Not just coming down and \nsaying they are but that they will get out of it. How will we be \ncompetitive? Because that kind of person will become technologically \ncapable, and they will help make us competitive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9274-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9274-S9277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEED FOR ENERGY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I said a couple weeks ago, 10 days ago, \nI was going to come to the floor once every day to talk about the \nEnergy bill. I did not do that, but this is my third or fourth time.\n  We are rudderless, a ship that has no capacity to guide itself, when \nit comes to energy policy. We have a bill ready to go that can steer us \nto a better future. But there are still a number of Senators who refuse \nto hear the warning bells that require our action.\n  How much louder can those bells be ringing? There was a huge blackout \nin August in the East. A complete energy meltdown occurred in the West \njust a few summers ago. Oil prices are surging to record heights. \nNatural gas demands are increasing.\n  Prices of coal are higher and going up. Consumers are paying beyond \nthe reasonable price at the gas pump. Our critical infrastructure lacks \nadequate investment--that is, in electricity and other things that \nrelate to energy, refineries. Our electricity grid has no mandatory \nreliability rules, meaning we may have blackouts again which we thought \nAmericans would never have again. If we pass the bill, we will be able \nto tell them that. Efforts to increase efficiency and renewable energy \nare anemic. The list can continue for a frighteningly long time unless \nwe pass the Energy bill. I am committed to the Energy bill because it \nis necessary. It is the first step we must take in order to change our \neconomy's destiny.\n  We can't increase domestic oil and natural gas production overnight. \nWe can't snap our fingers and modernize our Nation's electric \ntransmission grid. We can't expect renewable energy to appear online \ntomorrow. We can't move away from foreign oil toward a clean, hydrogen \nfuture all of a sudden.\n  We need an energy policy plan to move us forward to reach those \ngoals. We need an energy policy in place so that businesses and \ninvestors have regulatory certainty. We need to make having an energy \npolicy a priority.\n  Today, as we speak, there are events affecting our oil situation.\n  OPEC has decided to up its quota. Big deal. They were already \nproducing over their last quota and are still over this most recently \nannounced one.\n  Right now, OPEC is not in charge of how much a barrel of oil costs in \nthe spot market. Why? They don't have enough capacity to weather the \ndemands of the global market.\n  The weather, on the other hand, can affect the market greatly.\n  Hurricane Ivan is making OPEC look pretty weak. Oil prices have been \nvolatile with each report of Ivan's predicted impact.\n  Right now, oil prices are just over $44. This morning the U.S. \nMinerals Management Service announced that 73 percent of the Gulf of \nMexico oil production--that is about 1.25 million barrels of oil--and \n41 percent of the gulf's gas production--about 5 billion feet of \nnatural gas--have been shut in.\n  The longer the storm and its aftermath lasts, the longer imports from \nVenezuela will take to get to our southern ports. If refineries are \nshut down in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana due to Ivan, a 5-to-7-\nday delay in products getting to the market could occur.\n  The warning bells are ringing. We are living on the bleeding edge of \nsupply and demand for oil, natural gas, coal, and renewable fuels. \nLet's get off the edge of this cliff and focus on achieving some energy \nsecurity.\n  Instead of wringing our hands at each crisis and passing political \nblame around, we need to work together to get an energy policy in \nplace. We have such a policy ready for action. It is called the energy \nbill. If the Democrats would agree to limit the number of amendments to \nabout 10, we can pass this much-needed legislation. If they will not \nagree, then I want the American people to know for whom the bell tolls. \nIt tolls for those that refuse to come to the floor and get this energy \nbill done.\n  Let's get to work and pass it.\n  I am quite surprised that when Members come to the floor of the \nSenate and talk about jobs, about growth, about competition, that they \nare not talking about energy. But they are not.\n  We have Hurricane Ivan, which makes OPEC look very weak. Oil prices \nhave become very volatile, and the hurricanes, including ``Ivan the \nTerrible,'' are causing us to shut in huge amounts of oil all over the \ncoastal areas because they can't leave those deep wells open in the \nwake of the hurricane. So they are creating another big uncertainty. I \ndon't want to make it sound like I am only worried about energy and \nhurricanes; I just want to state the facts.\n  While we do that, I want to say that all of us, whether we come from \na State far away from hurricanes, are deeply worried about what has \nhappened and what might happen. We don't know. Nobody knows how \nheartfelt Americans are from the rest of the United States. We are \nprayerful. We are worried, and we hope and pray that what we hear about \npossible damage to parts of Louisiana doesn't happen. It would be \nwithout precedent if it happens--just terrible. So let energy set aside \nfor a little bit as we look at that problem and hope we can do \nsomething to be helpful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate being able to follow the \ncomments of my esteemed colleague\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\nand the chairman of the Energy Committee speaking about the importance \nof energy. He and I would agree that is a topic we just haven't heard \nenough of lately on this floor, the Energy bill and an energy policy \nthat this country so desperately needs, whether it is Americans looking \nat the price they are paying for gasoline at the pump, whether it is \nAmericans looking at our utility statements and realizing the price of \nnatural gas is going beyond a level we feel comfortable with, just \nrecognizing that we as a country do not have a notion, do not have a \nreal solid policy for how our energy supply meets up with our energy \ndemand. That is something we in Alaska have talked about for far too \nlong. We have urged this body to move forward with an energy policy, \none that makes sense.\n  I like to say that Alaska is prepared to be or in effect is the \nenergy bank for the country. All we are waiting for is the opportunity \nto make a withdrawal from what we have in our incredible resources. But \nas we know, we have some issues we need to work through. Whether it is \npermitting issues for a natural gas pipeline, whether it is those \nfinancial incentives that make this megaproject, this $20 billion \nproject possible so we can supply domestic reserves of natural gas to \nthis country, we have the ability to make it happen in Alaska. We just \nneed a little assistance from the Congress in moving forward.\n  We can't leave this conversation without talking about ANWR and the \nopportunities for us as a nation, recognizing the known reserves we \nhave up there, recognizing that we are in a position in the State of \nAlaska to provide for enhanced domestic reserves of oil supplies at a \ntime when we know the supplies are questionable from the sources we are \ncurrently receiving them, whether it is because of political \ninstability or just declining reserves. We have an opportunity in the \nState of Alaska. Again, we just need the ability to move forward.\n\n  My purpose today in addressing the body is not to speak to the Energy \nbill or the importance of the Energy bill; it is to speak to an \nincident that happened this morning in the Energy Committee when we, as \na committee, took up a series of land bills. It was a business meeting \nthis morning that was designed to take up and pass, again, some land \nissues. It was kind of a cats and dogs type of a hearing. Most of the \nissues we took up were relatively noncontroversial.\n  We have a history in the Energy Committee of working in a very good, \nstrong, solid bipartisan way. The committee works well together. The \nchairman and the ranking member work well together. We move forward on \nissues, it is fair to say, in a good and enviable manner. We accomplish \nthings. So this morning was a bit of a surprise when, instead of doing \nthe business that was before us, we had members of the Democratic Party \nleave, essentially stage a walkout on a business meeting of the Energy \nCommittee.\n  As an individual Senator coming from my State, working on legislation \nthat is important and, quite honestly, isolated to my State, as I am \nworking through issues that affect Alaskans, I would ask for certain \nconsideration from my colleagues on Alaska-related issues as we work \nthrough them. Today's episode or incident in the Energy Committee \ndoesn't allow Alaska to move forward with a series of our issues.\n  So what exactly happened? We had 22 bills move through the markup \nwithout question or controversy. I had an agenda item that was a bill \nto resolve certain conveyances and provide for alternative land \nselection under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act related to Cape \nFox Corporation and Sealaska Corporation and for other purposes, with \nan amendment in the nature of a substitute. I read that from this \nmorning's agenda.\n  I indicated to the chairman that I had an amendment in the nature of \na substitute and moved to discuss those portions of the amended bill, \nand the minority members of the committee proceeded to leave the \ncommittee, which left us without a quorum and no ability to move \nforward on the business. The business remaining were two bills I had \nbeen working, this Cape Fox bill as well as another very specific \nAlaska lands-related issue.\n  As we discussed in the committee, after our Democratic colleagues had \nleft, one of my Republican colleagues informed me that in his 24 years \non the committee, it had been the first time members of the committee \nhad walked out, which left me, as the Republican Senator for Alaska \nworking on these very specific Alaska pieces, to wonder: Wait a minute, \nI am here to represent my State on very specific Alaska issues. If I \ncan't have my colleagues debate back and forth on the merits of the \namendment, if we don't have the opportunity in these sessions to do the \nbusiness that needs to be done to allow my State to move forward on \nthese land issues, how do I move forward with legislation?\n  So it causes me to look back and say: Well, was there a failing on my \npart, on my staff's part, or on the committee's part? As we had \nattempted to move this legislation forward, had we failed to work in a \nbipartisan manner, failed to reach out in an attempt to accommodate on \nissues that had caused concern?\n\n  Let me speak to the two different bills we had before us. The first \none related to the Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act. \nEssentially, what this act is destined to do is an equity issue for an \nAlaska Native corporation. It allows for an exchange to resolve an \ninequity to the Cape Fox shareholders through a land selection process. \nThis is a land selection process authorized under our Native Claim \nSettlement Act. The shareholders were denied the ability to select \ncertain lands within 6 miles of their area. It created an inequity.\n  The only way this inequity can be resolved is through Federal \nlegislation. So what we have done is created logical boundaries that \nimprove Forest Service management. Essentially, this is a land exchange \nthat would allow the Cape Fox shareholders to receive certain lands. It \nconsolidated private ownership and increased the role of State \ngovernment in the environmental regulatory process. It created economic \nopportunities for Cape Fox and Sealaska through certain leasing \nagreements that would be made possible. It allowed for native hire and \nvocational education in an area where, as I recall, the unemployment \nrate in that very small community is 25.6 percent, almost 420 percent \nof the State's unemployment rate. This is an area that can definitely \nuse some equitable economic assistance.\n  So the legislation itself is good. It is sound. So the question must \nbe, OK, did we fail to reach out? Were we not working with the other \nside on this?\n  This is not legislation that is new to the process. This is \nlegislation that was actually passed in the 107th Congress. This is \nlegislation that was passed through the House committee with unanimous \nsupport earlier this year.\n  I introduced this legislation in June of last year. In August of \n2003, the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests held a hearing in \nAnchorage, AK. Subsequent to that time, we held a public hearing in \nJuneau, AK--a townhall meeting--in September to hear the comments and \nconcerns of Alaskans who are located down in the area where this \nexchange is to take place.\n  After that, in March of 2004, we held another subcommittee hearing \nhere in Washington, DC. We were then placed on the agenda in mid-March \nfor markup--it was March 24. But there was no consensus so we began to \nattempt to work out a compromise to address the concerns that had been \nexpressed by some of the environmental community, by Alaskans, and by \nsome of our Democratic colleagues; and so what we did was we had \nprepared an amendment that was the amendment we were prepared to offer \nas a complete substitute today. That amendment would maintain the view \nshed in an area where we have recreational opportunities for kayakers \nand boaters, so we inserted an amendment to provide for view shed \nprotection, an amendment to provide for public access; and we provided \na provision that would ensure that all exchanged lands would be based \non appraisal reports in accordance with the uniform appraisal standards \nof the Federal Land Acquisition Act.\n  We essentially had worked through the process. We had worked with the \ncommittee. After that markup that didn't happen in March of 2004, we \nhad discussions with minority staff, which\n\n[[Page S9276]]\n\nhad occurred prior to that intended markup date, as well as after. \nThose discussions continued through the third week in July of this \nyear. We were making every effort to accommodate the concerns and \nconsiderations of the minority on this legislation yet still maintain \nthe integrity and meet the needs of the Cape Fox Corporation and the \nSealaska Corporation.\n  In looking at the bill and what we were intending to do, the entire \nintent of the Cape Fox legislation was to correct this inequity to this \nsmall southeast village, which has 431 residents, where the \nunemployment rate is 25.6 percent, as I indicated. So we were prepared \nto move forward with this legislation today. We had shared the \namendment with the minority in July and, quite honestly, were stunned \nwhen the minority members walked out of that committee hearing.\n\n  I need to point out that not only did minority members walk out, \nwhich put us in a situation where we no longer had a quorum, but \nanother minority member attempted to enter the committee room to join \nus in committee, when that individual was literally pushed back out of \nthe committee room so a quorum would not be had. So not only was there \na walkout but there was a lockout.\n  Again, it causes one to wonder. If the legislation that I am working \non as a Senator from Alaska is so Alaska-specific, so Alaska-germane, \nand I cannot get the cooperation of colleagues to move it through even \nthe committee process, it causes you to wonder what is going on.\n  Let's look at the second bill that was on the calendar this morning. \nWas this what was being objected to? The second piece of legislation \nthat was before the committee was S. 1466, ``a bill to facilitate the \ntransfer of land in the State of Alaska, and for other purposes.''\n  Again, what we are talking about here is entirely Alaska-specific. \nThis legislation relates to no other State. What we are faced with in \nthe State of Alaska, through multiple land acts, through statehood we \nwere promised certain lands. We were promised certain lands under the \nAlaska Claims Settlement Act. We are a young State, only 45 years old, \nbut we are still waiting for vast amounts of our land to be conveyed to \nus--the land promised at statehood.\n  We still have some 89 million acres of land yet to be conveyed to the \nState of Alaska, promised some 45 years ago. We had a hearing on this \nlegislation--a subcommittee hearing--in Anchorage last year. I asked \nthe agency people at the time: Given how long it has taken the Federal \nagencies to work through the conveyance process and kind of estimating \nforward, how long do you figure it will take for the State of Alaska to \nreceive conveyance of all the land to which it is entitled? The \nresponse that I received was: Anywhere from 30 years to 300 years.\n  Thirty years to 300 years to get the lands that were promised to us \nat statehood.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely unacceptable. Any other State would \nhave said, no, this is wrong and you have to deliver on your promises.\n  So what are we doing? I have introduced this legislation to say: Hey, \nFederal Government, hey, agencies, you have a promise, you made the \npromise. Do the job you are required to do by law. Move through the \nconveyance process. I know it is complicated. I know we have \noverlapping land issues. It is a complicated process, but do what you \nneed to do, and if you need additional assistance, let us know how. \nThis is essentially legislation that helps speed up, if you will, helps \nexpedite the process.\n  Let's look at a few of the provisions we are talking about here. We \nare clarifying and streamlining the conveyance process. We have \ntechnical amendments that move forward filing deadlines. We have a \nsituation right now where if there is any survey that is not exactly \naccurate, even by a tiny amount if you are exceeded, then you basically \nhave to start all over in terms of completing your surveys.\n  What we have done is get the survey down to the last hundredths of an \nacre and if, in fact, it is not exactly entirely precise, you do not \nhave to start all over again.\n  We set final acreage for the 10 regional Native corporations.\n  We allow the Secretary to make certain withdrawals for two of the \nregional corporations which right now do not have sufficient land \nselection.\n  We are attempting to solve the problems of old ACSA-related \nwithdrawals that closed public lands in Alaska to full operation of \npublic land laws.\n  We provide that the Natives in Kaktovik are allowed to receive their \nfull entitlement under the agreement made in 1983.\n  There are some people who have said: Oh, my gosh, you are opening up \nANWR for oil and gas development. The authorization does not change or \nlift the prohibitions on oil and gas development in the refuge. This is \nnot what this is about. This is all about the Natives in this community \nbeing able to complete their selections as all Alaska Natives should be \nallowed to do.\n  There are other technical amendments streamlining the process, the \ndeadline for Native corporations in the State of Alaska to identify \ntheir final land priorities. There is a title that directs the \nSecretary of Interior to speed up the hearings appeals and probates. It \nestablishes an Alaska-based branch office and requires the Secretary to \nreport on the progress in implementing these land exchanges within 3 \nyears of enactment.\n  It is very clear how Alaska-specific this legislation is.\n  Again, the question must be asked: Was there a failure, was there a \nproblem in how we worked the committee process? Was this being rushed \nthrough the committee? Did we fail to reach out to the minority and the \nstaff on this?\n  Again, I refer to the timeline. The bill was introduced last year. We \nheld a subcommittee hearing on public lands and forest in Anchorage. We \nhad a further subcommittee hearing in Washington, DC, in February of \nthis year, and within a few days of that hearing, my staff met with \nboth minority and majority committee staff members, and everyone agreed \nthey were going to meet 1 day a week for as long as it took to work out \na joint staff substitute.\n  We were told at that time by the minority that they were working on \nanother Member's bill, and once they completed that, they would turn \ntheir full attention to 1466.\n  We made repeated requests in May, June, and the first part of July to \nthe minority staff, and it did not result in any meetings. Meetings \nwere later held in the latter part of July, and we made substantial \nprogress with the assignments agreed to by the committee staff.\n  The minority had a number of requests for changes and concessions, \nlooking for additional information and analysis. They offered to \nprovide assistance with technical edits and even to draft at least one \nprovision.\n\n  We continued to work on the bill throughout the August recess. We \nwere incorporating all this that we were working through the committee \nprocess. We had taken massive comments from Alaskan organizations and \nindividuals and Native organizations, working the process as the \nprocess should be worked.\n  We truly did make substantial headway. We were prepared this morning \nto move forward with a committee substitute and put forward the \nsubstance of that substitute to the minority staff on September 2. It \nwas a good-faith effort to accommodate all the requested changes \nwithout sacrificing the goal of completing these land transfers by our \n50th anniversary of statehood, or the year 2009.\n  As of last Friday, less than a week ago, we were hearing very \npositive reports about the progress we were making on both sides and \ntruly believed we were going to be in a position to offer a joint staff \nsubstitute at today's meeting.\n  It was not until yesterday that we were abruptly informed no such \nsubstitute would be possible. So I proceeded with an amendment on my \nown, an amendment that really does reflect the very bipartisan effort \nthat was going on in this very important bill.\n  Again, I need to stress the importance of this legislation: land \nconveyances owed to the State of Alaska since statehood, land \nconveyances owed to Alaska Natives since passage of the Native Claims \nSettlement Act, promises made by the Federal Government to Alaska that \nneed to be promises kept.\n\n[[Page S9277]]\n\n  I am very committed to my work in the Senate. I am very committed to \ndoing my utmost best for the people of the State of Alaska. These two \npieces of legislation we were prepared to take up this morning and that \nwe were thwarted in our efforts to move forward are very important to \nAlaskans. They do make a difference in how we move forward with our \nlands.\n  Put your State in this position. If you do not have the ability to \nmove forward with your lands, if you do not even know what the status \nof your land title is, how complicated the future is for your State. We \nneed to get these issues resolved.\n  All I ask for is the ability to do my job, and my job, as we all \nknow, requires a cooperative process. We cannot move legislation \nthrough this body if we do not have cooperation, and cooperation begins \nat that very beginning level, working through the committees, as we \nhave with both of these legislations. It then moves forward to that \nnext step--to move the legislation through the committee--so we can \nmove it to the floor.\n  I am happy to engage in debate on the merits. If you do not like the \namendments, if you think they can be made better, wonderful, let's make \nit happen, but let's at least allow the process to work. When we fail, \nwhen we as Senators abdicate the duty and say, Alaska, or whatever \nState, you are on your own, nothing is going to move forward, we are \nnot doing our job.\n  I know this is a contentious time. We are in the middle of all the \nhot political debates. I am a Senator who is standing for election now. \nWe know that causes interesting things to happen within the process. \nBut I would certainly like to think that what we do here in the course \nof our work should not harm our constituents. We ought to be able to do \nthe business that needs to be done in a cooperative manner.\n  I am very hopeful we will be able to move forward with not only these \nbills and hopefully see them on the floor of this body, but other \nlegislation that pertains to all of us. We all come to this body with \nour very unique issues. They are very particular to our home States. I \nask that we all respect one another in our efforts to accomplish those \nthings that are truly very local to our States.\n  So I look forward to next week and an opportunity to again bring \nforward very important issues for my State.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9277-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9277-S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to add my thoughts to the debate \non the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  First, I want to preface my remarks by thanking the chairman and \nranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee for \nworking so diligently on this bill despite the constraints they have \nfaced. The fight against terrorism is our number one priority, and this \nappropriations bill is a key component in that fight.\n  I also thank the Nation's first responders and the employees of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, who work daily to protect this \nNation. They are on the front lines of the fight against terrorism. \nThey are the ones who are called on to stop and respond to any future \nattack upon our Nation. This bill includes important resources these \nbrave men and women need to perform their critical tasks.\n  The Senate bill is a vast improvement over the President's proposed \nbudget. It increases funding for such important things as port \nsecurity, FIRE Act grants, Federal air marshals, Emergency Management \nPerformance Grants, and the SAFER program. The Senate bill also \nincludes funding for research and development on next generation \nexplosive detection equipment, a priority identified by the 9/11 \nCommission. These are just a few examples of the many areas where the \nSenate bill is far superior to the administration's request.\n  I was also pleased that the Senate bill includes a number of \namendments I sponsored. The Senate adopted my amendment requiring DHS \nto create a strategic transportation security plan and to base future \ntransportation security budgets on that plan. This amendment will make \nsure that taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently and effectively to \nmeet our Nation's most pressing transportation security needs, rather \nthan the current well-intended but ad hoc method of spending. This \namendment was based on one of the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission and, it is one of the first of the Commission's \nrecommendations to be adopted by the Senate.\n  The Senate also adopted my amendment to extend to the Department of \nHomeland Security for fiscal year 2005 a provision included in the \nfiscal year 2004 omnibus appropriations law that requires all \ndepartments and agencies to report to Congress on purchases of foreign-\nmade goods. It is important that the government make every effort to \npurchase American-made goods and that it explain to the public whenever \nit fails to do so.\n  I was also pleased that the Senate adopted my amendment requiring the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to report to Congress on its use of \ndata-mining in fiscal year 2005. This amendment will provide the \nAmerican people with critical information about the use of data-mining \ntechnology and the way highly personal information, like credit \nreports, travel records and other personal information, is obtained and \nused by our government. Periodically, after millions of dollars have \nbeen spent, we learn about a new data-mining program under development \nby the Federal Government. This amendment will not stop any data-\nmining. It simply requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nreport to Congress on any data-mining programs it is using or \ndeveloping and how these programs implicate the civil liberties and \nprivacy of all Americans. With complete information, the American \npeople will be able to make considered judgments about which programs \nshould and should not go forward.\n  Although this bill does a lot to help protect this Nation, including \nproviding much-needed resources for our first responders, it does not \ndo enough. I was disappointed that many good amendments were not \nadopted by the Senate. For example, an amendment offered by Senator \nByrd, which I cosponsored, would have canceled purchases of oil to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and directed the $470 million in savings to \ncritical homeland security needs. Yet the Senate rejected this \namendment even though it would have helped to ease gas prices by \nfreeing more oil for the market and provided important funding for our \nhomeland security programs.\n  I also regret that this bill was so severely limited by a budget \nallocation that did not provide adequate funding for homeland security, \nchoosing instead to make tax cuts its highest priority. That is why I \nsupported several amendments that would have added funding for critical \nsecurity needs. I want to point out to my colleagues that I do not take \nlightly my decision to vote in favor of spending more money. Fiscal \nresponsibility is one of my highest priorities and I constantly look \nfor ways to limit government spending. I am honored that the Concord \nCoalition and others have recognized me for my efforts in this regard. \nAlthough fiscal responsibility remains one of my top priorities, it is \nimperative that we provide the resources needed to combat terrorism.\n  I voted for this bill because it provides necessary funding. However, \nour Nation's vulnerabilities demand more, and I will continue to work \nto ensure that our vital homeland security needs are met.\n\n\n                          intelligence reform\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last night, the Republican majority in \nthe Senate voted 49-45 to table an amendment I offered on intelligence \nreform. The amendment would have required the President to give \nCongress a copy of the 2001 report by the Scowcroft Commission on \nintelligence reform. A classified annex could be provided if necessary.\n\n[[Page S9278]]\n\n  In May 2001, before 9/11, President Bush ordered a review of U.S. \nintelligence, and General Brent Scowcroft was named to lead a \ncommission to provide recommendations.\n  The report of the Scowcroft Commission was submitted to the White \nHouse in December 2001, three months after 9/11, but it continues to be \nclassified, despite repeated requests from Congress to release it.\n  The 9/11 Commissioners had full access to the Scowcroft \nrecommendations as background for their work, and the final report from \nthe commission drew significantly from the recommendations.\n  Clearly, before we act on intelligence reform later this month, \nCongress should also have the benefit of General Scowcroft's \nrecommendations.\n  But the Republican majority blocked it. They rallied behind the \nPresident and argued that the report could not be provided because of \nwhat they called ``executive privilege.'' Frankly, that's ridiculous.\n  The White House did not invoke executive privilege when they gave the \n9/11 Commission full access to the Scowcroft report. They did not \ninvoke executive privilege when they allowed National Security Advisor \nCondoleezza Rice to testify before the 9/11 Commission.\n  In these cases, the administration concluded that the benefit of \nprotecting the Nation's security outweighed other considerations about \nprivileged information. It should have done the same in this case.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he \ncould not see any reason why the Scowcroft report should not be \ndeclassified. Our colleague Senator Roberts, chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, and our colleague Senator Warner, chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, have requested the report, but it still \nhas not been made available.\n  There is no compelling reason to keep this information classified. \nWhat are the White House and the Republicans in the Senate trying to \nprotect? The Nation's security? Hardly. They are trying to protect \nPresident Bush. Why? Because President Bush had General Scowcroft's \nrecommendations on intelligence reform for nearly 3 years and failed to \nact on them.\n  Congress needs the report, and we deserve to have it before we act on \nintelligence reform. We are talking about our national security, and \nPresident Bush is playing politics by stonewalling us. It is already \nclear that the administration sat on the Scowcroft recommendations for \n3 years, and the Nation has obviously suffered because of it. Had the \nreforms been implemented, we very well may have known that there were \nno weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  Congress and the American people deserve to know how much greater \nprogress we could have made in the war on terrorism if President Bush \nhad not buried the Scowcroft recommendations and allowed them to \ncollect dust on a shelf at the White House.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I was unavoidably detained \nduring rollcall vote No. 178 on Senate amendment No. 3632 to H.R. 4567, \nthe Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. If present I \nwould have voted ``aye,'' in favor of the motion to waive the Budget \nAct. It would not have changed the outcome of the vote.\n\n\n                        byrd amendment no. 3649\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor and to speak \nin support of the amendment offered yesterday by my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd. As members of Congress, our most sacred duty is \nprotecting our fellow Americans. We do this in several ways, of course, \nby supporting our troops at home and abroad, by our oversight of the \nintelligence community, and now, with the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security, with an annual appropriation to fund the security \nactivities of the various agencies that make up DHS, and to fund grant \nprograms to states, localities, and private industry to make certain \nthat citizens of the United States are protected from terrorist \nattacks, life-threatening accidents, and acts of God.\n  In the last 3 years I have sat down with hundreds of first responders \naround my State of West Virginia, as well as local elected officials \nand experts from my State's core industries, to discuss what they were \ndoing to protect West Virginians, and to hear from them directly where \nthey needed help from the Federal Government. I am sure that each of my \ncolleagues has had similar meetings. While I would not presume to know \nspecifically what was said at these meetings, I would be willing to \nwager that no Member of Congress heard anything other than ``We have \nhuge unmet security needs and we need federal resources to make our \ncountry safer.''\n  When we created the Department of Homeland Security, and when we \nauthorized many billions of dollars in additional funding to protect \nthis Nation, I am sure we convinced some people that we had learned the \nharsh lessons of September 11. In fact, I think we have done well \nmaking increased safety and security priority issues for the Federal \nGovernment and for all Americans. Unfortunately, we have fallen short \non addressing these needs, and the Byrd amendment is a very good step \nin the right direction. This amendment would not do everything that \nneeds to be done for Congress to be able to say we are delivering the \ngoods to our first responders, State and local officials, and to the \nindustries that make up our critical infrastructure, but it would be a \nmuch-needed boost for all those trying to make America safer.\n  I commend Senator Byrd for making his usual strong, principled stand \non this matter. Let me be clear, too, that I do not believe the funding \nlevels in the underlying bill reflect any lack of understanding of the \nscope of the problem on the part of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. The chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, my \nfriend, Senator Cochran, has done very well with the amount he was \ngiven to distribute. The problem is, quite simply, that the \nadministration's past policy choices and the need to adequately support \nour troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have left Senator Cochran and his \nfellow appropriators with too little to do this all-important job.\n  It is not a question, let me reiterate, of our Republican colleagues \nor the President not wanting to see our Nation adequately protected. I \ndo question, I am sad to say, the idea that it is vitally important to \nmake unaffordable tax cuts permanent, but it is not more immediately \nimportant to secure our chemical facilities, our railroads, our \nelectricity grid, or provide training and technical assistance to our \nfirefighters and emergency medical personnel.\n  I hope that my colleagues will see just how important this is. It \nwould be a tragedy beyond measure if we failed to do the right thing \nwhen we had the chance, and only provided funding, for instance, to fix \nthe problem of interoperable radios after another tragedy where first \nresponders were at risk because they could not talk to each other.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate completed action of \nthe second of 13 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2005, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  Although the Senate has not yet adopted a new concurrent resolution \non the budget, we did establish a discretionary spending allocation for \nthe Appropriations Committee in the recently enacted Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. That allocation, and the subcommittee \nallocations that were derived from it, enabled us to consider the \nHomeland appropriations bill under the usual budget enforcement \nprotections.\n  During debate on the Homeland appropriations bill, a total of 10 \nbudget points of order were raised against amendments that sought to \nincrease spending by an incredible $19.9 billion in 2005 alone. If \nthose amendments had been enacted and incorporated into the \ndiscretionary spending baseline, their 10-year cost is a staggering \n$220.2 billion. Including debt service costs, that number increases to \n$285.3 billion.\n  I am happy to inform my colleagues that the Senate upheld all 10 \nbudget points of order and rejected each one of these spending \nincreases.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate did adopt an amendment providing $2.98 \nbillion in emergency spending for agriculture disaster assistance. I \nopposed that amendment because it did not belong on this appropriations \nbill, and it\n\n[[Page S9279]]\n\nshould be paid for and not add to the deficit. I want my colleagues to \nknow that I will continue to seek to have this spending dropped from \nthe bill or offset with appropriate spending cuts.\n  I congratulate my good friend from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, who \nmanaged the Homeland appropriations bill for using the Budget Act \nsuccessfully to control the spending in his bill. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the remaining appropriations bills to \ncontinue that success.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget points of \norder raised during consideration of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005 and their cost be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TEN-YEAR COST OF DEMOCRATIC AMENDMENTS TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2005 HOMELAND\n     SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL DEFEATED BY BUDGET POINTS OF ORDER\n               [Budget authority, in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Amendment a                   PoO b     2005     2005-14\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3580--Schumer--Port security R grants....   302(f)       0.2       1.7\n3596--Murray--Port security................   302(f)       0.3       3.3\n3597--Byrd--Misc. homeland programs........   302(f)       2.0      22.1\n3604--Dodd--First responders...............   302(f)      15.8     175.2\n3617--Lautenberg--Coast Guard..............   302(f)       0.1       1.1\n3624--Mikulski--Firefighter assistance        302(f)       0.2       1.7\n grants....................................\n3632--Clinton--High threat area funding       302(f)       0.6       6.9\n increase..................................\n3649--Byrd--TSA and SPR....................   501(b)       0.0       0.5\n3655--Schumer--Border security.............   302(f)       0.4       3.9\n3656--Schumer--Rail security...............   302(f)       0.4       3.9\n                                                     -------------------\n      Subtotal.............................  .......      19.9     220.2\nInterest on amendments c...................  .......       0.0      65.2\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total including interest.............  .......      19.9     285.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\na The increases in spending in several of these amendments may be for\n  very similar or identical purposes.\nb 302(f): Amendment exceeded Homeland Security 302(b) allocation;\n  501(b): Amendment provided advance appropriations in an account not\n  identified for advance appropriations by the conference report on H.\n  Con.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend \nof over 40 years--a fellow Kentuckian who has had a national impact. It \nis an honor and a privilege to congratulate my good friend, Ernie \nAllen, on winning the Henry Clay Distinguished Kentuckian Award from \nthe Kentucky Society of Washington. Ernie's work as President and CEO \nof the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children makes him a \nmost worthy recipient. As I mentioned, I've known Ernie for over 40 \nyears, dating back to our days at Manual High School in Louisville. On \nthe same day I won election as president of the high school, Ernie was \nelected president of the junior high school. We both went on to attend \nthe University of Louisville, and were fraternity brothers.\n  Knowing Ernie so well, I can assure you that his dedication to \nrescuing missing children runs deep. Over twenty years ago, when I was \nthe Jefferson County Judge-Executive, Ernie was the Director of the \nLouisville/Jefferson County Crime Commission. That Commission was the \nfirst of its kind to bring police officers and social workers together \non behalf of kids. Just one innovation Ernie came up with back then was \nto make a fingerprint card for as many Kentucky kids as possible, and \nsend that card home to the child's parents to hang on to in the awful \nevent their child ever went missing. A young man on my staff today \nstill has his card, two decades later.\n  Ernie's work in Kentucky established him as a national leader for his \ncause as early as 1981. At that time, no nationwide organization \nexisted to share and distribute information on missing children. If a \nchild was abducted and taken over a State line, or even a county line, \nthe chances that law enforcement in the new jurisdiction had all the \ninformation necessary to save that child were small. Ernie led the \neffort to lobby Congress to establish laws so that police could talk to \neach other across boundaries about missing kids. His work and patience \nbore fruit in 1984, when President Ronald Reagan signed the bill \ncreating the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as a \npublic-private partnership.\n  Under Ernie's leadership, the Center has created the CyberTipline, an \nonline reporting service that former Vice President Al Gore has called \n``the 911 for the Internet.'' They created the AMBER Alert System, \nnotifying citizens statewide when a child has been kidnapped. They've \nworked on over 98,000 cases, and have been involved in the successful \nrecovery of over 83,000 kids. Last year they had an astonishing success \nrate of 95 percent.\n  Mr. President, Ernie has labored for 20 years to save children from \nghastly fates, and parents from horrible nightmares. It's a \nheartbreaking job at times. It provides a window into the ugliest parts \nof the human soul. But thanks to Ernie and the Center, there are a lot \nof success stories. Last month, a woman in Oklahoma City left her four-\nmonth-old baby in the back seat of her running car to pick up her other \nchild from school. When she emerged a minute later, the car was gone. \nThe police issued an AMBER Alert. They quickly tracked down the car and \ncollared the kidnapper. Thankfully, the baby was still safely strapped \nin his car seat. We can all imagine his mother's relief. Multiply that \nfeeling by 83,000 children saved, and you begin to see the good Ernie \nand the National Center do.\n  Twenty years ago, it was literally easier to find a stolen car than a \nmissing child. Now because of Ernie, that is no longer the case. \nParents across America owe Ernie thanks for the peace of mind they have \nevery day, knowing that should the unspeakable ever happen, an \nincredible man is running a fine organization dedicated to rescuing \ntheir child. Kentucky, America, and the United States Senate pay \ntribute to Ernie Allen, and hope he will be on the side of justice and \nmercy for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this \nAmerican hero whose roots run deep in the Kentucky Bluegrass.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9279-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ALEJANDRO FERNANDEZ\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to commend and congratulate the \nAmerican Youth Philharmonic Orchestra of Annandale, VA on its fortieth \nanniversary.\n  The cultural and political history of the United States has changed \ndramatically over the last five decades. During that time, however, the \nAmerican Youth Philharmonic Orchestras have provided a vital service \nfor young musicians throughout northern Virginia and the District of \nColumbia. The 2004-05 concert season will commemorate the 40th year in \nwhich the American Youth Philharmonic Orchestras have trained new \ngenerations of children, teenagers, and young adults to become \nextraordinary musicians. To give an example of the marvelous impact \nthat this institution has had, over 100 public and private schools from \nWashington's metropolitan area are represented within the orchestra's \ncurrent enrollment. The students of the American Youth Philharmonic \nconstantly strive for excellence in their performances; such \npreparation increases the chance that they will seek to make a positive \nimpact on our society, whether through the arts or other endeavors.\n  With a group of approximately 400 students, the orchestra has \nrepresented Virginia and the District of Columbia with distinction in \nthe performances at the Kennedy Center, the Festival of Youth \nOrchestras, and the Spoleto Festival in South Carolina. Remembering \nthis Nation's tragic losses on September 11, 2001, the Philharmonic \nperformed a touching concert, entitled ``The Spirit of Freedom,'' at \nNew York's Carnegie Hall in January 2002. In addition to their \nexceptional performances in the United States, the American Youth \nPhilharmonic was a dignified cultural ambassador for this country at \nthe International Rachmaninoff Festival in Russia, the Aberdeen \nInternational Youth Festival in Scotland, and the British Festival of \nYouth Orchestras. The young men and women of the orchestra have offered \nthe diplomatic language of music to our friends abroad, and they \ndeserve to be recognized for their efforts.\n  If we were to gauge the success of the American Youth Philharmonic by \nthe rate at which its students are accepted to the best musical and \neducational schools in the United States, we would see that the \nAmerican Youth Philharmonic is unrivaled in its training of our \nNation's best and brightest. Members of the American Youth Philharmonic \nhave continued their study of music at the Oberlin Conservatory, the \nJuilliard School, Carnegie Mellon, and the Cleveland Institute of \nMusic, while others proudly accepted offers to Harvard, Princeton, \nStanford, and the University of Southern California, to name a few.\n  Beyond the beauty of the sound generated in their performances, the \nAmerican Youth Philharmonic Orchestras have given their time and \nservice to the surrounding communities of Northern Virginia and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The American Youth Philharmonic created a music \nmentorship program that trains designed high-school members to offer \nfree tutoring to younger musicians in the area. In this way, the \nstudents of the orchestra are able to strengthen their own abilities as \nteachers while providing an enriching experience to those who are \nlimited by financial circumstances or their special needs. Recognizing \nthe value of this community service, the First Place Arts Council of \nFairfax County, VA recognized the American Youth Philharmonic with the \nArts for Special Audiences Award in 2000.\n  We must also credit the constant dedication of Maestro Luis Haza for \nthe brilliance of the American Youth Philharmonic. Mr. Haza has given \n20 years of service to this ensemble in addition to his 29 years of \nongoing performance as a violinist with the esteemed National Symphony \nOrchestra. Born in Santiago, Cuba, Mr. Haza was honored with a \nWashington Immigrant Achievement Award in 2004, and he truly \ndemonstrates a commitment to the values of democracy and freedom on \nwhich this country was founded. While Mr. Haza has shared his talent \nfor musical direction with the London Symphony Orchestra, our own \nNational Symphony Orchestra, and the national orchestras of Panama, El \nSalvador, and Guatemala, his passion for music is never more evident \nthan in his direction of the American Youth Philharmonic. Mr. Haza has \ndedicated a lifetime to sharing the gift of music with young people \nthroughout the Americas, and his legacy to this country will be \nreflected in the values of his students for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9280-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9280-S9281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING GEORGE BRUNSTAD\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I congratulate one of my Connecticut \nconstituents, George Brunstad, on an extraordinary achievement. A few \nweeks ago, George, a resident of Ridgefield, became the oldest person \nto swim across the English Channel.\n  George, who celebrated his 70th birthday on August 25, began his \nrecord-breaking swim three days later when he left Dover, England \nshortly after 9 a.m. on Saturday, August 28. He reached Sangatte, on \nthe French coast, after midnight on Sunday, completing the 21-mile \nstretch in 15 hours and 59 minutes. Prior to George, the oldest person \nto swim the Channel was Clifford Batts, who was about 100 days shy of \nhis 68th birthday.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little about George Brunstad. He is a \nretired Air Force pilot who flew B-52 bombers. For 20 years, he piloted \njumbo jets for American Airlines. Currently, he is a swim coordinator \nfor children at the YMCA in Wilton, CT, where he is affectionately \nknown as ``Grandpa George.'' George and his wife Judy are active \nmembers of the Wilton Baptist Church, where George serves as a Deacon. \nFor 20 years, George has been associated with Pivot Ministries, a group \nthat helps men who are recovering from drug and alcohol addiction.\n  While George was on the swim team in college, he had been away from \nthe sport for 20 years before he saw a sign at the Wilton YMCA \nadvertising competitive swimming for adults. That was 31 years ago, and \nGeorge Brunstad hasn't stopped swimming since. He is a World Masters \nOpen Water Swimming Champion and has won more than 100 national \nchampionship medals in U.S. Masters Swimming.\n  But George Brunstad's feat last month was much more than an athletic \nachievement. Last year, George and Judy traveled on a mission to the \nisland nation of Haiti with their church. They were appalled by the \nincredible poverty that continues to afflict that nation. They were \nparticularly saddened by the large numbers of homeless children they \nsaw in Haiti. And they decided to do what they could to help those \nchildren.\n  George and Judy are founding members of the board of directors of the \nCenter of Hope, an organization devoted to building an orphanage and \nschool in the Haitian city of Hinche. Hinche has 80,000 people, most of \nwhom are desperately poor and lack basic needs like clean water, \nshelter, medical care, transportation, and education.\n  George decided that his swim across the Channel would be a perfect \nway to raise money for the Center of Hope. In total, he managed to \nraise over $11,000. As someone who has been to Haiti numerous times, \nand as a Senator who\n\n[[Page S9281]]\n\nhas done his best to try to direct our attention to Haiti's dire needs, \nI'm particularly pleased that George Brunstad chose to turn his moment \nof personal triumph into one that will help better the lives of some of \nthe residents of an impoverished nation only a few hundred miles from \nour shores.\n  This coming weekend, the Wilton Baptist Church and the Center of Hope \nwill be holding a special celebration in George's honor. I send George, \nJudy, their family, and all those who will be attending the celebration \nmy best wishes, and my enthusiastic congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9281-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed by \nunanimous consent to pass a substitute amendment to the Federal Trade \nCommission Reauthorization Act, S. 1234. The bill would reauthorize the \nFederal Trade Commission in furtherance of its mission to enhance the \nefficient operation of the marketplace by both eliminating acts or \npractices that are unfair or deceptive and preventing anti-competitive \nconduct. Further, the legislation would authorize funding for the FTC \nthrough 2008, and enhance the Commission's ability to combat \ninternational--or cross-border--fraud.\n  In addition to reauthorizing this vital consumer protection agency \nfor the period 2005 through 2008, the bill, as amended, is also \ndesigned to mitigate the challenges that the FTC increasingly faces in \ncombating cross-border fraud. The FTC's consumer protection \nresponsibilities are essential, particularly in today's global climate \nof high-speed information and marketing, which know no international \nborders.\n  This legislation is crucial to the FTC's ability to protect American \nconsumers by authorizing the Commission to: Share information involving \ncross-border fraud with foreign consumer protection agencies; secure \nconfidential information from those foreign agencies; work in \nconjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice to seek redress for \nAmerican consumers in foreign courts; make criminal referrals to the \nDOJ for cross-border criminal activity; and generally strengthen its \nrelationship with foreign consumer protection agencies.\n  Under the FTC's current authority the agency is not able to exchange \ninformation with its foreign counterparts to shut down consumer scams \noriginating outside the United States, but perpetrated against American \nconsumers. As a consequence, the FTC is left without the ability to \nseek redress on behalf of defrauded consumers. In addition, the FTC is \nnot currently considered a ``market regulator,'' and thus, banking \nagencies may not share suspicious consumer information with the FTC. As \na result, the FTC is not able to trade funds derived from illegal \nInternet schemes sent through U.S. banks and placed in offshore bank \naccounts. Thus, those who devise and carry out such schemes are too \noften allowed to escape the grasp of the FTC. But even if the FTC were \nable to share information with its foreign counterparts and market \nregulators, the FTC would be unable to litigate consumer protection \ncases in foreign courts.\n  While these are descriptions of merely a few gaps in the FTC's \ncurrent international consumer protection authority, they underscore \nhow vulnerable American consumers are to cross-border fraud. This \nlegislation would fill these and other gaps in the FTC's current \ninternational consumer protection authority, and allow the FTC to \nfunction more effectively in carrying out its Congressional mandate to \nprotect American consumers.\n  This bill, as amended, would also grant authority to the FTC to \nprovide investigative and other services to a requesting domestic law \nenforcement agency and receive from that agency, if offered, \nreimbursement for the FTC's involvement. Finally, the amendment would \nprovide to the Commission the authority it has requested to receive \ngifts or items that would be useful to the Commission as long as a \nconflict of interest is not created by such receipt.\n  The underlying bill was considered and reported unanimously last year \nby the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Since \nbeing placed on the Senate Calendar, its provisions have been \nthoroughly vetted on a bipartisan basis with the multiple federal \nagencies that have a vested interest in its enactment. We have worked \nwith and received sign off from each affected agency on this substitute \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9281-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9281-S9282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REPUBLICAN HIGH TECH TASK FORCE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the critical role of \ntechnology and innovation in maintaining our Nation's security and \nprosperity in the future. Technology and the intellectual property that \naccompanies it is the very lynchpin of our modern economy. Technology \nis changing all the rules, from the way we do business to how we \ncommunicate. It is saving lives, and it is protecting our homeland. In \nrecognition of the critical role that technology plays in the lives of \nall Americans, Majority Leader Bill Frist has made technology a top \npriority by devoting significant time and resources to the Senate \nRepublican High Tech Task Force which serves as the focal point for \ntechnology-related issues in the United States Senate.\n  I have been honored to serve as the chairman of the Senate Republican \nHigh Tech Task Force during the 108th Congress. I have been privileged \nto meet the leading innovators of our great Nation and talk directly to \nthe employees who have made technology their career and are delivering \nevery day the promise of the new ``next big thing.''\n  The work of the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force increases in \nimportance each day, as technology becomes ever more a part of our \nlives. It is the responsibility of the Task Force to be leaders on \ntechnology issues in the Senate. We are tasked by the majority leader \nto reach out to the technology community to listen and learn and then \nadvise our colleagues and lead on legislation related to this important \nsector of our economy. And we have been very successful this year. \nSenate Republican High Tech Task Force members have passed important \nlegislation that protects technology and helps foster continued \ninnovation. Just a few of the many accomplishments in the past few \nmonths include the following: Senator Allen has championed intellectual \nproperty protection and has utilized his position with the Committee on \nForeign Affairs to ensure that American intellectual property is \nprotected abroad and that overseas piracy of copyrighted materials is \nfought to the fullest extent possible. Senator Allen was also \nsuccessful in passing legislation out of the Senate to keep State, \nlocal, and Federal tax collectors from driving up the cost of broadband \nwith Internet access taxes.\n  Senator Grassley has championed free trade agreements with Singapore, \nChile and Australia. Free trade is the life blood of our economy and \nensuring that American companies are able to access new markets on a \nfair footing with all appropriate intellectual property protections \ncreates and protects American jobs.\n  Senator Sununu has led Senate efforts in protecting nascent voice \nover internet protocol technology which promises to provide new data \nservices for businesses and consumers, fundamentally changing the way \nwe look at phone service.\n  Senator Burns worked tirelessly to successfully secure passage of the \nCAN-SPAM Act which was passed unanimously by the United States Senate. \nUnsolicited commercial e-mails are overwhelming our telecommunications \ninfrastructure and costing Americans productivity and now, more \nalarmingly, affecting their confidence in online transactions. The CAN-\nSPAM Act was a successful first step, and the Task Force will continue \nto work to restore confidence and protect American consumers from SPAM.\n  Senator Smith and I have been successful in seeing the Invest in the \nUSA Act passed out of the Senate. This important legislation will bring \nback a cash infusion of over $400 billion to be reinvested in America \nand create over 600,000 American jobs. This will allow money that \nAmerican companies earn overseas to be brought back to the United \nStates where it can create jobs and grow our economy.\n  My colleagues and I have been very busy during the 108th Congress. We \nhave visited technology centers around the United States and met with \ntop innovators and the most talented employees in the world. The work \nof the High Tech Task Force will continue through the remainder of this \nsession and into the 109th Congress.\n\n[[Page S9282]]\n\n  The Senate Republican High Tech Task Force remains focused on \nsecuring final passage of important priorities such as: final passage \nof the JOBS Bill that includes international tax reform, extension of \nthe R Tax Credit and the Invest in the USA Act; preserving broad-\nbased employee stock option plans that are threatened by FASB; class \naction reform to stop frivolous lawsuits that stifle innovation and \ndrive up costs for consumers; bringing an end to patent fee diversion \nthat harms the ability of U.S. innovators to bring their exciting \nproducts to market. Four-year delays to obtain patents hurt innovation; \nfinal passage of the Internet Tax Moratorium legislation to keep state, \nlocal, and federal tax collectors from driving up the cost of Internet \naccess; final passage of the Spectrum Relocation Bill which will \nprovide additional spectrum for the wireless revolution and has the \npotential to yield more than $500 billion in economic and consumer \nbenefits over the next decade, spur $50 billion or more in capital \ninvestment, and create thousands of American jobs.\n  These priorities are critical to our country's continued leadership \nin the world, and we are redoubling our efforts to see these issues \nthrough to signature by the President. We are more committed than ever \nto ensuring that American workers are getting the best education in \norder to become the innovators of the future. And yet there are new \nissues arising each day. Members of the task force will be intimately \ninvolved with rewriting the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Issues such \nas the regulatory treatment of voice over internet protocol and \nhastening the availability of spectrum for next-generation wireless \nbroadband, along with many others, will be added to our list of \npriorities for the coming session of Congress.\n  In conclusion, we have accomplished much over the past year on many \ntechnology issues. The Senate Republican High Tech Task Force has been \nan effective voice for technology on Capitol Hill. Our members are \nleaders on every major technology issue and are fighting to protect \nAmerican innovation. While we have been very successful in pursuing our \npolicy platform, technology is ever-changing. We will work diligently \nto ensure that we stay ahead of the curve and, if nothing else, help \nkeep government out of the way to allow American innovators and \nentrepreneurs to bring the latest and greatest to the doorsteps of all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9282-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIVE PEOPLE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when troubles befall our Nation, \nwhether it is a hurricane in Florida, a tornado in Oklahoma, or an \nearthquake in my State of Alaska, America turns to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, to help it recover.\n  FEMA, in turn, relies upon some 4,000 part time, temporary employees \ncalled disaster assistance employees to help it meet the heightened \nworkload demands. These disaster reservists, who live in all corners of \nour Nation, are organized into cadres and are pressed into service when \ntheir services are needed.\n  The Federal Government transports these individuals from their home \nto the disaster site, houses them, pays a Federal civil service wage \nfor their services and returns them home at Federal expense when their \nservices are no longer needed.\n  In the native villages of my home State and in native communities \nacross the Nation, the level of unemployment is unacceptably high. \nNative people are often left with the choice of relocating to urban \nareas where jobs are in greater supply, leaving their native culture \nbehind or remaining in their communities where jobs are scarce.\n  I suspect that native people who live in the rural villages of Alaska \nwill find the opportunity for intermittent employment with FEMA \ndesirable. Employment such as that offered by FEMA in the Disaster \nAssistance Employee cadres allows my native people to participate in \nthe cash economy without completely losing their ties with the \ntraditional subsistence culture in their villages. I expect the same is \ntrue for native people who live on our Indian reservations and native \nHawaiians.\n  Last evening, joined by Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, I offered \nan amendment to H.R. 4567, the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill on \nthis subject. This amendment encourages the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to make an effort to improve the representation of American \nIndians, Alaska natives and native Hawaiians in the Disaster Assistance \nEmployee cadres by actively recruiting in our native communities. The \namendment was adopted by unanimous consent last evening, and I want to \nthank my colleagues for supporting it.\n  I hope that this amendment will serve its intended purpose, which is \nto encourage FEMA to be proactive in identifying opportunities to \nreduce unemployment among our qualified and motivated native workforce, \nand I hope that this lesson will not be lost on the other Federal \nagencies.\n  As thousands of native people from across our Nation descend on \nWashington next week for the opening of the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian, it is fitting that our Federal Government renew its \ncommitment to provide native people, many of whom reside in the \nremotest parts of our Nation, with access to Federal employment \nopportunities. Last night the Senate did just that, and I am grateful \nto my colleagues for their support of my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9282-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9282-S9283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the tenth \nanniversary of the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. One \nof the most prominent woman Latin American writers, Isabel Allende, \nonce said, ``How can one not speak about war, poverty, and inequality \nwhen people who suffer from these afflictions don't have a voice to \nspeak?'' Ten years ago today, this body rose up and spoke for a group \nin our society that is frequently left voiceless.\n  The number of women in the United States who have been murdered by an \nintimate partner is greater than the number of soldiers killed during \nthe Vietnam War. In 1996 alone, over 30 percent of all female murder \nvictims in the United States were slain by their husbands or \nboyfriends. These women who lost their lives in the war of domestic \nviolence that plagues our country began to have a voice because of the \npassage of VAWA.\n  Today, there are roughly 143.4 million women in the United States. Of \nthis population, it is predicted that almost 28.7 million, or 20 \npercent, will be raped during their lifetime, and one-third will be \nphysically or sexually abused. Battery is the single greatest cause of \ninjury to women in the United States, accounting for more emergency \nroom visits than all other injuries combined. Yet, with these sobering \nstatistics there are three times more shelters for neglected animals \nthan there are shelters for battered women.\n  Jane Addams said, ``Action indeed is the sole medium of expression \nfor ethics.'' Ten years ago on this day, the United States Congress \nacted to ensure that all women who are victims of violence receive the \nprotection and support they need and deserve. However, there is still \nmore work to be done. Domestic violence is a problem that continues to \nafflict our country.\n  It is estimated that family violence costs our Nation from $5 to $10 \nbillion annually in medical expenses, police and court costs, shelters, \nfoster care, sick leave, absenteeism, and non-productivity. Remarkably, \nthe VAWA domestic violence programs have helped to save money, while \nsaving lives. The original VAWA that was authorized 10 years ago saved \ntaxpayers at least $14.8 billion in net averted social costs. This \nyear, as we move through the appropriations process, I ask all of my \ncolleagues to remember the millions of innocent women in this country \nwho have been the victims of violence and the effects that violence has \nhad, not only on them, but also on their families and our society.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate an important \nevent in this country's history. Today marks the tenth anniversary of \nthe passage of Violence Against Women Act. I am proud that I was an \noriginal cosponsor of that bill which has done so much to reduce \ndomestic violence.\n\n[[Page S9283]]\n\n  The Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, was originally passed in \n1994, and reauthorized in 2000, both times by overwhelming bipartisan \nmajorities. It created our current framework for a comprehensive, \ncoordinated response to domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault. \nBefore VAWA, domestic violence was too often considered to be a `family \nmatter' to which the police turned a blind eye. There were no Federal \npenalties for stalking, domestic violence or violating a protection \norder. And in sexual assault cases, a victim's past sexual history was \nconsidered a legitimate subject for the defense to bring up in the \ncourtroom. All of these basic considerations became law as a result of \nVAWA.\n  As a result of this landmark legislation millions of dollars in \ngrants are distributed to States and local communities to put these \ncost effective programs into practice. The first VAWA, authorized in \n1994, cost $15.50 per woman and has been estimated to save $159 per \nwoman, totaling a savings of nearly $14.8 billion since its creation in \naverted costs of victimization. VAWA programs have helped train \nthousands of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, court officials and \nvictim advocates to respond effectively to domestic violence. In the \nfirst five years after VAWA became law, intimate partner violence \ndropped significantly, and by 2002, violent crimes against women were \nless than half of what they were in 1993. This is a record of which we \ncan be very proud.\n  On a related note, I am proud to have my name associated with a law \nthat has done a great deal to make families safer, the Domestic \nViolence Gun Ban. This law prohibits those convicted of a crime \ninvolving domestic violence--whether a felony or a misdemeanor--from \nacquiring or possessing a gun. Research shows that the presence of a \ngun in a household where a woman is battered increases the chances of \nher death significantly: often, the only difference between a battered \nwoman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun. Since many abusers do \nnot get convicted of felonies, this law has helped to keep guns out of \nthe hands of thousands of people who are dangerous to their partners \nand families. Since its passage this law has prevented the sale of \nalmost 30,000 guns, potentially saving countless lives.\n  We cannot mark the passage of this landmark legislation without \nmaking mention of two particular champions in the campaign to stop \nviolence against women. Our friend and former colleague Senator Paul \nWellstone and his wife Sheila were tireless fighters against domestic \nviolence. The Sheila Wellstone Institute, in the first year of its \nexistence, has been at the forefront of the movement to institute \neffective policies to stop violence against women and children. On this \nanniversary we should remember their wonderful work, and commit to \nfinishing it.\n  We still have much more to do. Even today, approximately 4.9 million \nintimate partner rapes and physical assaults are perpetrated against \nU.S. women annually and nearly one in every four women experiences at \nleast one physical assault by a partner. When I think about my \nlegislative agenda I look to my family: my three daughters and son, and \nmy ten grandchildren. The thought that a woman could be the subject of \nabuse is repulsive. Domestic violence doesn't just happen to women; it \nhappens to families. That is why we must continue to fund programs to \nhelp victims, enforce laws protecting women, and teach respect and \nnonviolent problem-solving to our children. We need to make this \ncountry a place where women and children are safe, whether walking down \na city street or in their own homes. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in making this goal a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9283-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FUNDING FOR HURRICANE DAMAGE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize a dedicated \npatriot, sailor, wife and mother: CAPT Kristine Geddings, U.S. Navy. I \nhad the privilege of getting to know Captain Geddings when she served \nin my office on Capitol Hill as a legislative fellow, and I have \ncontinued to follow her career. I am pleased to offer this tribute to \nher achievements.\n  Before joining the Navy, this remarkable lady spent 15 years as a \nhousewife and mother. As her daughter entered high school, and having \ngained her Bachelor of Science degree at the University of North \nFlorida, Captain Geddings decided upon a Naval Career, and applied to \nand was accepted into Officer Candidate School at Newport, RI. At the \nage of 34, she was one of the oldest cadets to ever graduate from OCS, \nyet she met all the qualifications, including physical requirements, \nthat were designed for cadets closer to the age of her daughter.\n  By the time her granddaughter Amber commences sixth grade this fall, \nCaptain Geddings will have retired from active duty after 23 years of \nservice in the United States Navy. Captain Geddings has served the \nNation and the Navy faithfully and well over these many years. Her \npersonal leadership, intelligence, stewardship, and compassionate \ncommitment to her sailors and the United States Navy mark a career most \nworthy of our recognition.\n  Captain Geddings' initial assignment was to Patrol Squadron Thirty, \nNaval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL, where she served both as personnel \nand legal officer. She next reported to Naval Management Engineering \nCenter, Detachment Jacksonville as a Management Analyst and team \nleader. During this tour, she completed her Master of Arts in \nAdministration through Central Michigan University.\n  Next, she was assigned to Navy Recruiting District, Jacksonville, FL, \nwhere she took on the most challenging assignment in recruiting, the \nEnlisted Programs Officer. Seeking the next most challenging job in \nrecruiting, she accepted the job of executive officer of the recruiting \nstation in New Orleans, LA. Finally, in 1998, Captain\n\n[[Page S9284]]\n\nGeddings assumed command of Navy Recruiting District, Richmond, VA, \nwhere she led 192 recruiters and support personnel in 42 recruiting \nstations spread over 5 States to be named Navy Recruiting Command \nDistrict of the Year, bronze. On her watch during these years as a Navy \nrecruiter, the Navy won its ``Battle for Talent.'' Because of the \nefforts of recruiters like Captain Geddings, the Navy did more than \njust maintain the status quo. They brought the Navy a high quality \nsailor, and because of that high quality sailor, the Navy's retention, \nreadiness, and quality of life were improved.\n  Captain Geddings accepted orders to Naples, Italy on the staff of \nCOMFAIRMED in 1989. That very same year, her husband Gerry retired from \nthe Navy after 20 years of service, and their daughter Michelle was \nmarried to her husband, Trace Wilson. After her tour in Naples, and \nfollow-on assignment as a student at Command and Staff College, \nQuantico, VA, and Joint Forces Staff College, Norfolk, VA, Captain \nGeddings completed her Joint Professional Military Education.\n  In 1996 she was selected for the Legislative Fellows Program and \nreported to Washington, DC, for orientation at America's oldest public \npolicy research institution, the Brookings Institution. The remainder \nof her fellowship, she served as my Legislative Assistant for Veteran's \nAffairs. Captain Geddings reported to the Department of the Navy, \nOrganization, Management, and Infrastructure Team as a Senior Analyst \nand as administrative aide under the Deputy Under Secretary of the \nNavy.\n  In December 1999, Captain Geddings served on the Joint Staff, and was \nassigned as a Joint Education Planner in J-7, Operational Plans and \nJoint Force Development, with primary responsibility as the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff's representative for the Department of \nDefense Centers for Regional Security Studies. It was during this tour \nof duty that the attacks of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon occurred. Shortly thereafter, Captain Geddings \nreported to the OPNAV staff in July, 2002, as the Head, Joint, and \nContingency Matters and N-1 Planner.\n  It is a great honor and personal privilege for me to recognize the \nexemplary service of CAPT Kristine Geddings and her family today. She \nis an individual of uncommon character, and an amiable personality who \nwill be sincerely missed. I wish her and her family fair winds and \nfollowing seas as she closes her distinguished military career. I also \nwish them continued success and happiness they so well deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9284-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9284-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate.\n\n       H.R 1084.

A bill to establish the Department of Intelligence, to \nmodify and enhance authorities and responsibilities relating to the \nadministration of intelligence and the intelligence community, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Intelligence Reformation Act of 2004, also known as the ``9/11 \nAct.'' This bill creates clear, unambiguous lines of authority in the \nintelligence community, which assures both accountability and \nsufficient command authority for a new Department and Director of \nIntelligence to manage and coordinate the intelligence community, break \ndown existing stovepipes, demand accountability among the agencies, set \nrequirements, and use new directive authority to quickly task \ncollection and analysis while moving personnel and resources to respond \nto new and emerging situations.\n  The unanimous recommendations which accompany the Report of the \nNational Commission on Terrorist Attacks Against the United States \n(``9/11 Commission''), and the Executive orders issued on August 27, \n2004, relating to information sharing, intelligence community \nmanagement, and the National Counterterrorism Center, are intended to \naddress systematic, long-term problems with the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity that have been highlighted by the various investigations into \nthe 9/11 tragedy, including the findings of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on Iraq Pre-War Intelligence, and the congressional Joint \nInquiry recommendations issued in 2002. Our country has during the last \ndecade suffered through an escalating cycle of intelligence failures \nwhile witnessing the onset of new global threats--most notably \nterrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The \nexisting intelligence community structure is disorganized and \ndysfunctional, and thus incapable of effectively responding to these \nthreats.\n  The restructuring recommendations of the President and 9/11 \nCommission are consistent with the reorganization efforts I undertook \nas chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the 104th \nCongress, my efforts to install a Director of National Intelligence \nbeginning in 1986, and my work in 1998-1999 on the Commission to Assess \nthe Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation \nof Weapons of Mass Destruction (``WMD Commission''), as well as that of \nno fewer than 15 independent commissions and legislative or executive \nbranch attempts at restructuring the intelligence community, beginning \nin 1955 with the Second Hoover Commission.\n\n  It is imperative that we immediately put into place a national \nsecurity structure that is competent to confront this enemy. While the \n9/11 Commission and recent Executive orders provide helpful guidance, \nmuch discretion is left to Congress in determining the scope and nature \nof the restructuring of the intelligence community.\n  Under the legislation I introduce today, budgetary authority will be \na principal means for the new Director of Intelligence to maintain \nsupervision and control of the intelligence community. For example, the \nDirector would have the National Foreign Intelligence Program \nappropriation go directly to him, and that appropriation would remain \nunder his jurisdiction through the budget execution process.\n  Further, enhanced tasking authority would facilitate coordinated \nintelligence collection and analysis and overcome the ``culture of \nconcealment'' that exists among intelligence entities.\n  And clear lines of authority, including the ability of the Director \nto hire and fire intelligence community personnel, will in turn avoid \nthe uncertainty of ``serving two masters.'' Clear lines of authority \nmeans that intelligence community personnel will not suffer from the \ndisorder and paralysis that epitomized the community prior to 9/11, and \nwhich continues today. This legislation differs from the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations on restructuring the intelligence community \nin two main respects: the institution of a ten-year term for the \nDirector of Intelligence in order to remove him from political \ninfluence, and the direct control and supervision by the Director of \nthe major national intelligence community entities, rather than the \nuntested ``dual hatting'' approach favored by the 9/11 Commission.\n  I also believe that any legislation must address the FBI failures \nthat preceded 9/11. By placing the certain FBI functions under the \ndirection of the new Director of Intelligence, FBI missteps in \ncommunication, intelligence gathering and analysis that contributed to \nfailures in anticipating the 9/11 attack and in intercepting the \nhijackers can be averted in the future, while adding necessary \nsafeguards to protect privacy and civil liberties. And this bill, like \nthe bill I have introduced with Senators McCain and Lieberman, codifies \nthe 9/11 Commission recommendations on FBI reform.\n  Other important reforms undertaken by this legislation are also \ncontained in the 9/11 Commission bill. For example, consistent with the \nrecent conclusions of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the \nlegislation would require the National Intelligence Council to \nincorporate alternative views held by elements of the intelligence \ncommunity into National Intelligence Estimates (NIE), and be certified \nas approved for publication by the Director of Intelligence and the \nChair of the National Intelligence Council.\n  The Director and Department of Intelligence that I recommend fully \nintegrate the 9/11 Commission and President's important tenets of \ncentral direction, coordination, and control by a high-ranking \nintelligence official and would bring crucial expertise and immediate \ndirection to the many intelligence challenges we face. Creating a \nDepartment of Intelligence, run by a Director empowered with full \nbudget execution and clear line authority over national intelligence, \nbut without a large new bureaucratic infrastructure, is a proposal \nwhich best meets the need of the intelligence community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9288-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9288-S9295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 426--COMMENDING MARYLAND'S OLYMPIANS ON THEIR \n   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AT THE 2004 SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES IN ATHENS, GREECE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, \nwhich took place between August 13-29, have added a vivid and memorable \nchapter to the Olympic tradition, which first took shape in Greece \nnearly three millennia ago, and which in its modern form dates back to \n1896. The Athens 2004 Organizing Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, \nthe International Olympic Committee and dozens of other organizations, \nthe U.S. Olympic Team and thousands of athletes from all over the \nworld, the unwavering determination to meet unprecedented challenges \nand the good will and hard work of the people of Greece all contributed \nto assuring the success of the Games. In tribute to their magnificent \nachievement, today I am joined by a number of my colleagues in \nintroducing a resolution to express our gratitude and congratulations.\n  Greece took on a daunting challenge when, in 1997, the nation was \ndesignated by the International Olympic Committee to serve as host to \nthe 2004 Summer Games. With the exception of Finland, where the 1952 \nGames took place, in terms of population Greece is the smallest Olympic \nhost ever. To prepare for the return of the Games to Athens, where the \nfirst modern Olympics were held in 1896, the whole nation came together \nin a great common effort. The President and Managing Director of the \nAthens 2004 Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games \nand their associates worked closely with the Mayor of Athens, the \nMinistries of Public Works and Culture and other government agencies to \nassure a setting and facilities uniquely appropriate to the great \nevents. The people of Greece, in Athens and also in communities around \nthe Nation, gave their full support to the preparatory efforts and \nopened their hearts to the athletes.\n  The events of September 11, 2001 raised the challenge of preparing \nfor the Olympic Games to unprecedented heights, for they fundamentally \nchanged the security and logistical context for all major international \nevents--and indeed, as we know from our recent political conventions, \nfor all large gatherings. As the Athens Games were the first summer \nGames to occur after 9/11, Greece had neither precedents nor guidelines \nupon which to rely in planning for the security of some 10,500 Olympic \nathletes, 5,500 team officials and literally millions of visitors. The \nchallenges were all the more formidable because many of the events, \nincluding soccer and shot put, were held in places as distant from \nAthens as Thessaloniki and ancient Olympia.\n  Greece undertook to do everything ``humanly possible'' to ensure the \nsafety and success of the Games. The Athens 2004 Organizing Committee \ncarried out a careful study and analysis of the security arrangements \nfor the somewhat smaller Winter Games that had taken place in 2002, in \nSalt Lake City.\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\nA specially trained security force of 45,000 men and women was \ndeployed, which included military and air force personnel, coast \nguards, fire fighters, law enforcement officials and private security \ncontractors. The government of Greece worked in close collaboration \nwith the United States, Britain, Israel, France, Germany, Australia, \nand Spain, along with NATO, guided by two principles: every single \nnation had an interest in having its athletes compete safely, and all \nnations working toward a common objective--the ultimate success of the \nGames--would provide the most effective deterrent to a terrorist act. \nAs a result, while security measures were comprehensive and complex \nthey were expertly and unobtrusively carried out, in no way detracting \nfrom the spirit of the Games. Athletes and visitors alike moved about \nunimpeded, and competition went forward in the finest Olympic \ntradition.\n  Major investments in infrastructure also contributed significantly to \nthe smooth functioning of the Games. Athens today is a city \ntransformed. Since 1997, when the International Olympic Committee \ndesignated Greece as the host country for the 2004 Games, \ntransportation and telecommunications systems have been expanded and \nmodernized. The investments Greece has made in connection with the \nOlympics have created unprecedented opportunities for the future. The \nOlympic stadium complex, which includes the aquatic and tennis center, \nas well as the indoor arena and main stadium, will serve as major \ntraining facilities for many years to come. The soccer facilities will \nbe highly sought after for international soccer events. Overall, \ninfrastructure improvements have laid a sound foundation for economic \ngrowth and prosperity nationwide. Having met a daunting challenge, \nGreece is now poised to take on new responsibilities in an expanded \nEuropean Union, and in the broad international community. Where the \ncherished tradition of the Summer Olympics is concerned, Greece has \nshown what can be accomplished. The experience in Athens will surely \nprove invaluable to China, which fours years from now will play host to \nthe Games in Beijing.\n  As a Marylander, I am especially proud of the signal accomplishments \nof Maryland athletes, and I am sure my colleagues take similar pride in \nthe athletes from their respective states. The performance of the U.S. \nOlympic Team members in one stirring event after another will long be \nremembered, as anyone fortunate enough to have witnessed the \ncompetition firsthand will attest.\n  Above and beyond the excitement and the triumphs of the different \nevents, however, the Athens Olympics gave us something more. The 2004 \nGames showed that even in uncertain and turbulent times, it is possible \nwith determination and planning and foresight to bring together men and \nwomen of good will from every corner of the globe in a great common \nendeavor. This is for all of us a both a reminder and an inspiration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Aug. 30, 2004]\n\n                   Greece Celebrates Successful Games\n\n                          (By Candus Thomson)\n\n       Athens.--Under the soft light of a full moon, the Greeks \n     said goodbye to the sports spectacle they invented in 776 \n     B.C. and revived in 1896.\n       After 16 days of competition, the 28th Summer Olympiad \n     ended its run in a ceremony filled with folk music, dancing \n     and sighs of relief.\n       This was the Olympics burdened with the fears of \n     construction delays and terrorism. But the venues were done \n     on time and everyone remained safe.\n       Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the Athens 2004 president, \n     drew a roar from the crowd of 72,000 with her opening \n     remarks.\n       ``I ask our foreign guests: Did you enjoy yourselves in \n     Greece?'' she asked. ``We loved having you here. You wave \n     your national flags. You stood for every anthem. You danced \n     to our music. We even heard you speak your first words of \n     Greek. To you, we say, thank you.''\n       Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic \n     Committee, pronounced himself satisfied with the Athens \n     Olympics.\n       ``Dear Greek friends, you have won,'' he said to much \n     cheering.\n       Earlier, Rogge told reporters he never doubted that the \n     organizers would accelerate construction and meet their \n     deadline.\n       ``I'm an extremely happy president of the IOC,'' Rogge \n     said. ``I've always said I believed there was enough time to \n     finish the preparations in due time. Many did not believe me. \n     I think our friends have delivered in Athens in a very \n     splendid way.''\n\n\n                         slow start, big finish\n\n       Like the preparations, the Games started slowly, with \n     lagging ticket sales and sparse attendance. Ticket scalpers \n     blamed bad publicity, terrorism and a slow European economy.\n       But the second week came back gangbusters.\n       ``We knew we would host successful Games because the stakes \n     for Greece were huge. And we knew because of our Olympic \n     heritage we would do a good job,'' said Achilles Paparsenos, \n     the press officer for the Greek Embassy in Washington. ``The \n     results speak for themselves. All of the so-called experts \n     should apologize to Greece at some point.''\n       With a total of 103 medals, the U.S. team exceeded the \n     total of 97 four years ago in Sydney, Australia, and met its \n     goal of 100 medals. But just 35 medals were gold, fewer than \n     the 40 in Sydney and 44 in Atlanta in 1996.\n       The U.S. team also won 39 silver medals and 29 bronze. \n     Russia finished second in total medals with 92; China \n     finished third with 63.\n       For the first week, these were the Michael Phelps Olympics. \n     If he were a nation, Phelps would have tied Thailand, \n     Denmark, Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic for 24th our of \n     202 nations in total medals. The Baltimore County swimmer won \n     eight, equaling the record for most at one Olympics with six \n     gold and two bronze medals. But he could not eclipse Mark \n     Spitz's 1972 record of seven gold medals.\n       And there were other notable U.S. accomplishments. After \n     disastrous showings in Sydney four years ago, Americans were \n     crowned the all-around men's and women's gymnastics \n     champions, and both teams earned silver medals.\n       But while Carly Patterson is being hailed as the new Mary \n     Lou Retton, winner of the previous women's all-around gold \n     medal in 1984, Paul Hamm is fighting to keep his gold.\n       A scoring error allowed Hamm to slip past South Korean Yang \n     Tae Young, and team officials didn't challenge the result \n     until too late. Hours before the start of the closing \n     ceremony, Yang filed a protest with the Court of Arbitration \n     for Sport, which will hear the dispute in Lausanne, \n     Switzerland, home of the International Olympic Committee.\n       Despite the medals harvest, there are ominous signs for \n     other U.S. sports. The men's basketball team had to settle \n     for a bronze medal, and the men's soccer and baseball teams \n     didn't even qualify. The U.S. sailing team won just two \n     medals--a gold and a silver--tying its worst showing in 20 \n     years.\n       And there are troubling signs for the Olympics, which \n     picked up a new nickname: the Doping Games.\n       The final tally of athletes stripped of their medals or \n     disciplined isn't known, but is expected to top two dozen \n     after the IOC analyzes samples.\n       The list grew almost daily and included the Hungarian gold \n     medalist in discus and silver medalist in hammer throw, the \n     Russian gold medalist in women's shot put, a Belarus high \n     jumper, a Kenyan boxer, two Greek baseball players and two \n     Greek sprinters, a Swiss cyclist, a Spanish canoeist and an \n     Irish distance runner.\n       Nearly one in four athletes was tested, and Rogge said the \n     IOC will expand its program over the next two Olympics.\n       ``These were the Games where it became increasingly \n     difficult to cheat,'' he said.\n       But there were magical moments, too.\n       Athletes set 15 world records in six sports.\n       Windsurfer Gal Fridman won Israel's first gold medal.\n       U.S. women earned gold in soccer, basketball and \n     softball, led by Mia Hamm, Dawn Staley and Lisa Fernandez, \n     players heading for retirement.\n       Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj won both the 5,000-meter and \n     1,500-meter races after failing to earn a gold medal in \n     Atlanta and Sydney. The overjoyed runner, who swept the \n     middle-distance races for the first time in 80 years, \n     delighted the crowd by dancing to a Greek tune and leaping \n     into the stands to hug his 3-month-old daughter.\n       Kayaker Alexandros Dimitriou, laboring through the \n     whitewater rapids, at any moment ready to capsize, was lifted \n     by the rhythmic clapping of thousands of spectators to music \n     from Zorba the Greek. He finished 24th out of 25, but the \n     crowd made him a winner.\n\n\n                             the road ahead\n\n       As host, Greece will be stuck with the tab. The government \n     built more than 120 miles of highway, a new subway system and \n     an airport.\n       Some athletic venues still aren't finished. And no one is \n     sure what will become of the gyms, ballparks and pools built \n     for 16 days of competition for an estimated $8.6 billion--\n     $5.5 billion over budget.\n       The Greek government says it may have no choice but to tax \n     its 11 million citizens to pay the Olympic-size bill.\n       But those are worries for another day.\n       Near the end of the closing ceremony, the mayor of Athens, \n     Dora Bakoyannis, presented Rogge with an Olympic flag that he \n     passed to Bejing's mayor, Wang Qishan. The 2008 Summer Games \n     will begin there about 1,500 days from now.\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\n       Rogge declared the Games closed, the cauldron was \n     extinguished and the party began.\n       ``I really feel sorry for people who did not come to Greece \n     because they were dissuaded by the doubting Thomases and \n     Cassandras of doom and gloom,'' said Paparsenos, who attended \n     the party. ``They missed such a unique experience, a \n     celebration of sports where the Olympics were born.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 30, 2004]\n\n      Proud Country Shows the World ``Great Things Greeks Can Do''\n\n                          (By Craig Whitlock)\n\n       Under a brilliant full moon and the burning Olympic flame, \n     the Greeks danced. They clapped, they sang, kicked up their \n     legs and celebrated an Olympics that at one point was almost \n     taken away, but in the end left them jumping with national \n     pride.\n       Afer sponsoring more than two weeks of competition, and \n     enduring years of ridicule and doubt from the rest of the \n     world about whether the Games deserved to return to their \n     birthplace, the Greeks danced and danced in their modern \n     Olympics Stadium. About 75,000 spectators clapped along as \n     performers served up a giant Greek wedding feast of a Closing \n     Ceremonies, joyful that so much had gone right during the \n     Games of the XXVIII Olympiad, and that so little had gone \n     wrong.\n       Gone were the fears about terrorist attacks and smoggy \n     traffic jams and unfinished stadiums. The Athens Olympics had \n     come to an end, and for the most part everything worked just \n     fine.\n       Greece was the smallest nation in 52 years to host the \n     Summer Olympics, determined to recast Athens as a modern \n     European city known for more than its ancient past. In doing \n     so, the country spent at least $7.2 billion on the Games, \n     including $1.5 billion to provide security--an enormous sum \n     that will take many years, if not decades, to pay off.\n       But complaints about costs were hard to find Sunday night, \n     as Greece proudly handed off the Olympics flame to a nation \n     125 times its size--China, host of the 2008 Summer Games--\n     secure that it had proved itself to the world.\n       ``The Olympics came home and we showed the world the great \n     things Greeks can do,'' Giana Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, \n     president of the Athens Organizing Committee, told the crowd. \n     ``On this stage, the world discovered a new Greece.''\n       ``Hellas! Hellas!'' the crowd shouted, waving Greek flags \n     and white hankies.\n       Organizers flooded the stadium with 250,000 balloons as \n     thousands of fireworks lit up the sky. Under the dazzling \n     light show, a succession of Greek singers and folk musicians \n     kept the audience dancing throughout the Closing Ceremonies. \n     Toward the end, the mood became so infectious that small \n     groups of athletes from Brazil, Britain, France and other \n     nations broke away from the security cordon in the stadium \n     infield and danced around the track.\n       Despite the festive atmosphere, strict security measures \n     remained in place until the end. Several helicopters and a \n     blimp circled the stadium throughout the ceremonies.\n       Worries about political disruptions also kept U.S. \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell from attending; he canceled a \n     planned trip to Athens after Greek anti-war protesters angry \n     about his visit clashed with police Friday in downtown \n     Athens.\n       Unlike the Opening Ceremonies, where fans loudly cheered \n     the delegations from Iraq and Afghanistan and gave the silent \n     treatment to U.S. athletes, politics were not on display \n     Sunday night. Athletes from 202 nations entered the stadium \n     at the same time, mixing together on the infield.\n       The United States led the overall medal standings with 103, \n     capped off by an unexpected silver in the last event of the \n     Games, the men's marathon.\n       American athletes dominated the competition in track and \n     field, women's team sports and the swimming pool, where \n     Maryland's 19-year-old Michael Phelps won a record eight \n     medals. A major disappointment: the men's basketball team, \n     which lost three games and settled for bronze.\n       The biggest controversies were athletic ones, thanks to \n     cheaters and judges who shook up several events.\n       At least 22 competitors were flagged for drug-testing \n     violations, resulting in the revocation of seven medals. \n     Greece in particular was shamed by the expulsion of two \n     national heroes, medal-winning sprinters Kostas Kenteris and \n     Katerina Thanou, who were kicked off the team after missing \n     several drug tests.\n       Olympic officials said athletes had gotten the message that \n     doping would not be tolerated. ``These were the Games where \n     it became increasingly difficult to cheat and where clean \n     athletes were protected,'' Jacques Rogge, president of the \n     International Olympic Committee, told the audience.\n       Earlier, Rogge cheered the Greeks in attendance by thanking \n     them for their hospitality. ``Dear Greek friends, you have \n     won,'' he said in their native language, before lapsing into \n     French. ``You have won by brilliantly meeting the tough \n     challenge of holding the Games.''\n       Four years earlier, the IOC came close to yanking the \n     Olympics away from Athens. Construction projects and other \n     preparations had barely progressed since the Games were \n     awarded to Greece in 1997. Former IOC president Juan Antonio \n     Samaranch revealed recently that Olympic overseers were about \n     three months from making an emergency decision to move the \n     Games to South Korea.\n       Spurred on by the threat, Greek officials worked feverishly \n     over the next four years to prove that it could get ready on \n     time. The challenges were substantial: Athens needed a new \n     international airport, new highways, an expanded subway \n     system and more than a dozen new athletic arenas.\n       As the deadline neared--the roof on the Olympic stadium \n     slid into place just three months ago--there was little time \n     for testing. Even Olympic officials wondered if things would \n     work when the crowds showed up. By and large, they did.\n       ``At the end of the day, the biggest surprise to everybody \n     is that there were no major issues,'' Ioannis Spanudakis, \n     managing director for the Athens 2004 organizing committee, \n     said in an interview.\n       Not everything went exactly as organizers hoped. While the \n     Athens committee met its attendance projections by selling \n     more than 3.5 million tickets, many athletes performed in \n     front of sparse crowds. Television ratings were higher than \n     in Sydney four years earlier, but cameras couldn't conceal \n     the fact that stadiums were often largely empty.\n       The Closing Ceremonies, however, were a sellout.

As far \n     as most people here are concerned, Greece already has emerged \n     as the big winner of the 2004 Games.\n       This summer has marked a turning point for a country that \n     often was dismissed by Europeans as little more than a cheap \n     package-tour destination and denigrated by Americans as too \n     small, too poor and too disorganized to mount a successful \n     Olympics.\n       Not only has Greece put on a surprisingly laid-back, \n     glitch-free and not overly commercialized games, but earlier \n     this month, it completed construction of an architecturally \n     stunning suspension bridge that links western Greece with the \n     Peloponnese. The 1.79-mile Harilaos Trikoupis Bridge was \n     completed six months ahead of schedule and within its $900 \n     million budget.\n       On top of that, underdog Greece recently won the European \n     soccer championship--its first-ever championship in the one \n     sport that truly matters in Europe.\n       The cumulative effect of all this is a growing sense of \n     self-confidence in a country long plagued by a low self-\n     esteem and a feeling that ``Europe'' referred to someplace \n     else.\n       ``People are stopping me in the street and congratulating \n     me, but I tell them it's not me, it's all of us,'' said \n     Spyros Capralos, general secretary of the Olympic Games for \n     the Greek government. ``Greeks will have a new sense of self-\n     respect after this. The whole nation feels it.''\n       Ted Couloumbis, a historian and political analyst at Athens \n     University, agreed, but cautioned that it would take some \n     time before popular perceptions catch up with the reality of \n     a rapidly modernizing Greece.\n       ``Many people here still think we are the Greece of the \n     past; the poor Greece, the backward Greece, the politically \n     unstable Greece,'' he said. ``But the successful delivery of \n     a high-tech, highly complex Olympics in a post-Sept. 11 \n     climate is going to contribute tremendously to Greeks' \n     perception of themselves.''\n\n\n                     doubters until the last minute\n\n       With a population of 11 million, Greece is the smallest \n     country ever to stage the Summer Games, and doubters were \n     numerous right up until the opening ceremony.\n       But even if workers were bolting down the last seats in the \n     Olympic Aquatic Center just 20 minutes before the start of \n     the first event there, the experience of staging such a large \n     spectacle has given Greece a wealth of technical expertise \n     and a cadre of young professionals confident in their \n     abilities.\n       ``The human resources, the know-how, the working methods \n     and organizing methods, the new cooperation between the \n     private sector and public section--these are the intangibles \n     that come with the Olympics,'' said Evangelos Venizelos, and \n     opposition leader who is a former minister of culture.\n       Economists and other experts point to expected improvements \n     in the service and tourism sectors, while Greek engineering \n     and construction companies now have the experience to compete \n     for large-scale projects almost anywhere.\n\n\n                           skyrocketing costs\n\n       The price tag has been high. Because Greece fell far behind \n     schedule during the first six years of Olympic construction \n     and then had to make a man dash to the finish line over the \n     last year, costs skyrocketed from $5.6 billion to more than \n     $8.4 billion, or more than 5 percent of Greece's gross \n     domestic product.\n       But even that figure is dwarfed by the $56 billion that the \n     government is spending between 2000 and 2006 on \n     infrastructure overhaul that is expected to transform Greece \n     into a mainstream European player. About 60 percent of the \n     funding comes from European Union sources while Greece is \n     handling the rest, mainly in the form of long-term loans and \n     private investment.\n       ``The bridge is the most symbolic example of the country's \n     modernization, but there's a long list of new infrastructure \n     projects, and not only in Athens but in Thessaloniki and \n     Patras and Volos,'' Venizelos said.\n\n[[Page S9292]]\n\n       The new suspension bridge was built by a French-Greek \n     consortium. It crosses the Gulf of Corinth with five spans \n     that add up to the world's longest cable-suspended deck. \n     Physically and psychologically, the bridge brings Greece \n     closer to Europe, linking it with the continent's main road \n     and rail networks.\n\n\n                     setting aside bitter memories\n\n       All of this is helping shape a new Greek self-image. Just \n     as the crowd-pleasing Barcelona Olympics of 1992 formally \n     laid to rest the gloomy legacy of Gen. Francisco Franco's 36-\n     year dictatorship and reintroduced Spain to Europe, Athens \n     2004 is helping Greece set aside lingering memories of a \n     bitter civil war, military dictatorships in the 1960s and \n     '70s, and years of tense relations with neighboring Turkey.\n       ``We are in the process of becoming a normal European \n     country that want to be in the core of Europe,'' said \n     Couloumbis, the historian. ``If there is a Europe of \n     concentric circles, Greeks want to be in the center.''\n       When the Olympic caravan folds its tent Sunday and begins \n     the long trek to Beijing, the next venue for the games, \n     Athens inevitably will suffer from a case of post-Olympic \n     blues.\n       ``People will ask if the huge investment was justified,'' \n     Couluombis said. ``There will be finger-pointing about the \n     cost overruns.''\n       Venizelos, the opposition leader, said the real benefits \n     for Greece would not be counted during the 16 days between \n     the Games' opening and closing ceremonies.\n       ``Was it worth it? We will know in the next 50 years,'' he \n     said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [Knight Ridder Newspapers, Aug. 31, 2004]\n\n              The Ultimate Star of These Olympics: Athens\n\n                            (By Ann Killion)\n\n       Athens, Greece.--The star of these Olympics is easy to \n     pick. It is the lady with the funny hat and long spear, the \n     gal who sprouted fully grown out of the head of her dad, \n     Zeus.\n       Athena, the goddess of wisdom. She and her namesake city \n     win the gold.\n       Each Olympics produces a lasting image or two. In Sydney it \n     was Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones. In Atlanta it was Michael \n     Johnson and Kerri Strug.\n       These Games produced their own stars and scandals. Among \n     the high points: Michael Phelps, who won more medals than \n     many countries; America's golden girls Natalie Coughlin and \n     Carly Patterson, beach volleyball, along with the softball, \n     soccer and basketball teams.\n       Among the lows: drugs, incompetent judges and a red-kilted \n     attacker on the marathon course.\n       But the most defining memory from these Games will be the \n     performance of Athens and her citizens. We always cheer for \n     the underdog. We love it when the underestimated and \n     overlooked come up big.\n       And there has never been an Olympic underdog like Athens. \n     Or one that has rallied to victory as drastically.\n       The city was doubted, scoffed, maligned. Athenians \n     mortgaged their future to bring the Olympics home to their \n     birthplace. They felt disrespected by the rest of the world.\n       But the city and her people performed under pressure. From \n     the beginning until the very end, as the massive crowds moved \n     smoothly Monday through Eleftherios Benizelos Airport, Athens \n     shone.\n       The people who invested the ancient Games hosted a very \n     modern event, from the billion-dollar-plus security bill to \n     the doping shadow looming over the event.\n       The security worked. The scariest thing about being in \n     Athens was riding in a taxi. It's still debatable how well \n     the doping control works. More than 20 athletes tested \n     positive, more than at any previous Olympics. IOC President \n     Jacques Rogge called each positive test ``a blessing,'' \n     proving that the system works. But as Balco has taught us the \n     invisible, undetectable menace is still there.\n       Doping was at the root of Greece's most embarrassing \n     moment, when track stars Kostas Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou \n     withdrew after missing a drug test. Another shameful moment \n     was the Paul Hamm mess. A judging mistake was compounded by \n     the Federation of International Gymnastics' ham-handed \n     approach, asking Hamm to give back his medal. Hamm was \n     already home. The USOC was furious. And poor South Korean \n     Yang Tae-young was left a victim of Olympic incompetence.\n       Before every Olympics, the cynics say the Games are dying, \n     pierced through the heart with a syringe, strangled by \n     corporate greed and political motivation.\n       But the 2004 Olympics drew huge television ratings. NBC \n     recorded the highest ratings for a Summer Olympics held \n     outside the United States. For the public, scandals seemed to \n     only add to the Games' intrigue and soap opera plot.\n       Politics, as always, was unavoidable. A member of the \n     Iranian judo team deliberately missed weight rather than \n     fight an Israeli. The Iraqi soccer team balked at being used \n     as a political tool in the American presidential campaign.\n       But the Olympic moments still shine through. Moroccan \n     Hicham el Guerrouj overcame his Olympic struggles to win two \n     gold medals. Israeli windsurfer Gal Fridman won the first \n     gold medal in his country's 52-year Olympic history and said \n     he would take the medal to the memorial honoring the 11 \n     Israeli Olympians murdered in 1972 and ``show it to them, to \n     show they are always with us.'' Greeks spontaneously sang the \n     national anthem when beloved weightlifter Pyrros Dimas won a \n     bronze.\n       The hosts were gracious and accommodating. How did such a \n     small country pull it off? I got a taste of the Greek \n     approach before the Games ever began.\n       Traveling with my family to Athens, our ferry from a small \n     island to the island of Santorini was scheduled to leave at \n     2:30. Apparently everybody else knew it really left at 4. \n     When it finally pulled out at 4:15, we were in danger of \n     missing our flight to Athens and being stranded until \n     morning.\n       As we neared Santorini, I spoke with the ship workers. They \n     shook their heads. Our task would be impossible. There would \n     be no taxis at the port. The airport is on the other side of \n     the island.\n       There was no hope. But they discussed my plight some more, \n     cited the politics of ferry schedules, pointed out the \n     beautiful cliff villages and told the story of the volcano \n     eruption to distract me from my worries.\n       Finally, they decided it could be done. They helped us with \n     our luggage. They spotted taxis waiting on shore. They pulled \n     us off the boat before the gangplank was fully down, shouting \n     as we dashed for the taxi, ``You'll make it with half an hour \n     to spare!''\n       We made it with five minutes to spare.\n       It's the Greek way, cynical, analytical, taking a break to \n     appreciate the beauty and history of their land, and then \n     rallying with complete enthusiasm.\n       The Olympic flame was extinguished under a full moon that \n     reflected off the Acropolis and bathed the city in a golden \n     light. Athena would be proud.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From The State, Aug. 29, 2004]\n\n               An Apology--And Thank You, Before Leaving\n\n                            (By Dave Barry)\n\n       Athens.--I'm leaving the Olympics and heading home, \n     assuming the plane can lift me. This is a concern because \n     I've gained many kilometers of mass from eating Greek food, \n     especially ``baklava,'' which is the Greek word for \n     ``carbohydrates.''\n       But before I leave I have something to say to Greece:\n       Dear Greece,\n       I owe you an apology. Every negative thought I had about \n     you before I got here--every worry, every concern--turned out \n     to be wrong.\n       When I got to Greece, I thought you wouldn't be ready for \n     the Olympics. But you were--more ready than my country was in \n     1996 when the Olympics came to Atlanta. Your facilities were \n     finished, or at least finished enough; the buses ran on time; \n     the phones worked; and an army of ever-cheerful volunteers \n     stood by to deal with what few glitches there were. The Games \n     went beautifully. I still don't understand rhythmic \n     gymnastics, but that's not our fault.\n\n\n                              feeling safe\n\n       When I got to Greece, I was worried about terrorism. But my \n     only moments of terror involved public toilets last cleaned \n     by the Goths, and of course the Athens taxis, which are a \n     menace to all humanity everywhere. (If we keep sending robots \n     to Mars, sooner or later one of them will be run over by an \n     Athens taxi.) But the Games themselves, and your country, \n     always felt safe. The security, even though there was a lot \n     of it, never felt oppressive. I wish I felt as safe in my own \n     country as I did in yours.\n       When I got to Greece, I was worried about pickpockets. My \n     company sent me to a scary security-training session that \n     left me convinced I'd wind up lying in some Athens alley, \n     stripped of money, clothes and key bodily organs. But nobody \n     took anything from me. Instead, people kept giving me things: \n     pins, maps, guidebooks, smiles, and--most precious of all--\n     directions. Whenever I looked lost--which was often--people \n     would stop and ask me, in English, if I needed help. Often \n     they'd walk with me, going out of their way, making sure I \n     was on the right path, sometimes even handing me off to \n     another Greek, passing me across Athens, a human baton in the \n     Clueless American Relay.\n\n\n                            a family affair\n\n       When I got to Greece, I was worried about bringing my 4-\n     year-old daughter, Sophie. But you opened your arms to her, \n     as you do to all children. We couldn't get on a bus without \n     somebody offering Sophie a seat; we couldn't walk around our \n     neighborhood without somebody shouting ``Sophie!'' and \n     running over to say hi to her. At home, I'm a newspaper \n     columnist; in Greece, I'm the guy who accompanies Sophie.\n       When I got to Greece. I was worried about not understanding \n     the language. But it turned out the only Greek word I really \n     needed to know was ``efharisto,'' which means (I hope) \n     ``thank you.'' I said it a hundred times a day.\n       So, Greece, I apologize. You took on a huge task, and you \n     did it well, and your competence was matched by your warmth. \n     You treated my family like your family; we've already decided \n     we're coming back (after all, Sophie will want to see her \n     friends).\n       Until then, Greece, from my heart: efharisto.\n\n[[Page S9293]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 428--REAUTHORIZING THE JOHN HEINZ SENATE FELLOWSHIP \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Hagel) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S. Res. 428\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOHN HEINZ SENATE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n       Senate Resolution 356, 102d Congress, agreed to October 7, \n     1992, is amended by striking section 5 and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5. FUNDS.\n\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the \n     provisions of this resolution $85,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2005 through 2009.''.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a \nresolution reauthorizing the John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program. This \nCongressional fellowship program, created in 1992, is a fitting tribute \nto my late colleague and dear friend, United States Senator John Heinz. \nSenator Heinz dedicated his life and much of his Congressional career \nto improving the lives of senior citizens. He believed that Congress \nhas a special responsibility to serve as a guardian for those who \ncannot protect themselves. This fellowship program, which focuses on \naging issues, honors the life and continues the legacy of Senator \nHeinz.\n  During his 20 years in the Congress, John Heinz compiled an enviable \nrecord of accomplishments. While he was successful in many areas, he \nbuilt a national reputation for his strong commitment to improving the \nquality of life of our Nation' s elderly. Pennsylvania, with nearly 2 \nmillion citizens aged 65 or older--over 15 percent of the population--\nhouses the second largest elderly population nationwide. As John \ntraveled throughout the State, he listened to the concerns of this \nimportant constituency and came back to Washington to address their \nneeds through policy and legislation.\n  Senator Heinz led the fight against age discrimination by championing \nlegislation to eliminate the requirement that older Americans must \nretire at age 65, and by ensuring full retirement pay for older workers \nemployed by factories forced to close. During his Chairmanship of the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging from 1981-1986 and his tenure as \nRanking Minority Member from 1987-1991, Senator Heinz used his position \nto improve health care accessibility and affordability for senior \ncitizens and to reduce fraud and abuse within Federal health care \nprograms. Congress enacted his legislation to provide Medicare \nrecipients a lower cost alternative to fee-for-service medicine, as \nwell as his legislation to add a hospice benefit to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  John also recognized the great need for nursing home reforms. He was \nsuccessful in passing legislation mandating that safety measures be \nimplemented in nursing homes and ensuring that nursing home residents \ncannot be bound and tied to their beds or wheelchairs.\n  The John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program will help continue the \nefforts of Senator Heinz to give our Nation's elderly the quality of \nlife they deserve. The program encourages the identification and \ntraining of new leadership in aging policy by awarding fellowships to \nqualified candidates to serve in a Senate office or with a Senate \nCommittee. The goal of this program is to advance the development of \npublic policy in issues affecting senior citizens. Administered by the \nHeinz Family Foundation in conjunction with the Secretary of the \nSenate, the program allows fellows to bring their firsthand experience \nin aging issues to the work of Congress. Heinz fellows who are \nadvocates for aging issues spend a year to help us learn about the \neffects of Federal policies on our elderly citizens, those who are \nsocial workers help us find better ways to protect our nation's elderly \nfrom abuse and neglect, and those who are health care providers help us \nto build a strong health care system that addresses the unique needs of \nour seniors.\n  The Heinz fellowship enables us to train new leaders in senior \ncitizen advocacy and aging policy. The fellows return to their \nrespective careers with a new understanding about how to work \neffectively with government, so they may better fulfill their goals as \nsenior citizen advocates.\n  The John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program has been a valuable tool for \nCongress and our communities since its establishment in 1992. The \ncontinuation of this vital program will signal a sustained commitment \nto our nation's elderly. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this resolution, and urge its swift adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 429--ESTABLISHING A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE \n TO INVESTIGATE THE AWARDING AND CARRYING OUT OF CONTRACTS TO CONDUCT \n  ACTIVITIES IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND TO FIGHT THE WAR ON TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Dayton) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration:\n\n                              s. Res. 429\n\n       Whereas the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States;\n       Whereas Congress has a constitutional responsibility to \n     ensure comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United \n     States Government funds;\n       Whereas waste and corporate abuse of United States \n     Government resources are particularly unacceptable and \n     reprehensible during times of war;\n       Whereas the magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch;\n       Whereas the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities;\n       Whereas the Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars; and\n       Whereas the public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 137\n\n       Whereas, in Darfur, Sudan, more than 30,000 innocent \n     civilians have been murdered, more than 400 villages have \n     been destroyed, more than 130,000 men, women, and children \n     have been forced from their villages into neighboring \n     countries, and more than 1,000,000 people have been \n     internally displaced;\n       Whereas the United States Government has been, and remains \n     as of September 2004, the largest contributor of assistance \n     to the people of Darfur, having provided over $200,000,000 in \n     assistance, which constitutes more than 70 percent of the \n     total assistance provided to that region;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged $299,000,000 in \n     humanitarian aid to Darfur through fiscal year 2005, as well \n     as $11,800,000 in support of the African Union mission in \n     that region, and is likely to provide support in excess of \n     those pledges;\n       Whereas United States citizens and private organizations, \n     as well as the United States Government, have admirably \n     worked, at great risk and through great effort, to ease \n     suffering in Darfur, Sudan, and in eastern Chad;\n       Whereas, based on credible reports, Congress determined in \n     late July 2004 that acts of genocide were occurring in \n     Darfur, Sudan, and that the Government of Sudan bears direct \n     responsibility for many of those acts of genocide;\n       Whereas, expressing its grave concern at the ongoing \n     humanitarian crisis and widespread human rights violations in \n     Darfur, including continued attacks on civilians that place \n     thousands of lives at risk, the United Nations Security \n     Council on July 30, 2004, unanimously adopted Security \n     Council Resolution 1556, which called upon the Government of \n     Sudan to fulfill immediately its obligations to facilitate \n     humanitarian relief efforts, to take steps to disarm \n     immediately the Janjaweed militias responsible for attacks on \n     civilians and bring the perpetrators of such attacks to \n     justice, and to cooperate with independent United Nations-\n     sponsored investigations of human rights violations;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has failed to take credible \n     steps to comply with the demands of the international \n     community as expressed through the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas, according to press reports, reports from \n     nongovernmental organizations,\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\n     first-hand accounts from refugees, and other sources, the \n     Janjaweed attacks on the civilians of Darfur continue \n     unabated as of September 2004;\n       Whereas there are credible reports from some of these same \n     sources that the Government of Sudan is providing assistance \n     to the Janjaweed militias and, in some cases, that Government \n     of Sudan forces have participated directly in attacks on \n     civilians;\n       Whereas the United States Government, after conducting more \n     than 1,000 interviews with survivors and refugees, has \n     determined that genocide has occurred in Darfur, that it may \n     still be occurring, and that both the Janjaweed and the \n     Government of Sudan bear responsibility for these acts;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State has determined that the \n     attacks by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed on the \n     non-Arab people of Darfur and their villages are based on \n     race, not religion;\n       Whereas the United States has recently introduced a new \n     resolution in the United Nations Security Council that calls \n     for the Government of Sudan to cooperate fully with an \n     expanded African Union force and for a cessation of Sudanese \n     military flights over Darfur;\n       Whereas the introduced resolution also provides for \n     international overflights of the Darfur region to monitor the \n     situation on the ground and requires the United Nations \n     Security Council to review the record of compliance of the \n     Government of Sudan to determine whether the United Nations \n     should impose sanctions on Sudan, including sanctions \n     affecting the petroleum sector in that country;\n       Whereas the resolution also urges the Government of Sudan \n     and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement to conclude \n     negotiations on a comprehensive peace accord and, most \n     important, calls for a United Nations investigation into all \n     violations of international humanitarian law and human rights \n     law that have occurred in Darfur in order to ensure \n     accountability;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council, in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1556, emphasized that the \n     Government of Sudan bears primary responsibility for \n     respecting human rights and protecting the people of Sudan;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 \n     calls upon the Government of Sudan to cooperate with the \n     United Nations;\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Commission, \n     established in 1946 and given the responsibility of drafting \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is responsible for \n     promoting respect for and observance of, human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms for all;\n       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares \n     that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and \n     rights, that everyone is entitled to all the rights and \n     freedoms set forth in the Declaration regardless of race, \n     color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, \n     or national or social origin, property, birth, or other \n     status that everyone has the right to life, liberty and \n     security of person, that no one shall be held in slavery or \n     servitude, and that no one shall be subjected to torture or \n     to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     Genocide, done at Paris on December 9, 1948 (hereafter in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Genocide Convention''), \n     delineates the criteria that constitute genocide and requires \n     parties to prevent and punish genocide;\n       Whereas Sudan is a state party to the Genocide Convention \n     and remains a member of the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State determined that, according \n     to United States law, the Government of Sudan is a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and has been since 1993 and therefore \n     remains ineligible for U.S. foreign assistance;\n       Whereas, due to the human rights situation in Darfur, it \n     would be consistent with United States obligations under the \n     Genocide Convention for the Secretary of State and the United \n     States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to seek \n     the immediate suspension of Sudan from the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights and, in the event a formal \n     investigation results in a determination by the UN that \n     genocide has occurred in Darfur, the ultimate removal of \n     Sudan from such Commission; and\n       Whereas it is a mockery of human rights as a universal \n     principle, a challenge to the United Nations as an \n     institution, and an affront to all responsible countries that \n     embrace and promote human rights that a government under \n     investigation by the United Nations for committing genocide \n     against, and violating the human rights of, its own citizens \n     sits in judgment of others as a member in good standing of \n     the United Nations Commission on Human Rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and approves of the findings of the \n     Secretary of State that genocide has occurred and may still \n     be occurring in Darfur, Sudan, and that the Government of \n     Sudan bears responsibility for such acts;\n       (2) supports the Secretary of State's call for a full and \n     unfettered investigation by the United Nations into all \n     violations of international humanitarian law and human rights \n     law that have occurred in Darfur, with a view to ensuring \n     accountability;\n       (3) supports the resolution introduced by the United States \n     Government in the United Nations Security Council on \n     September 9, 2004, with regard to the situation in Darfur;\n       (4) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take \n     immediate steps to pursue the establishment of a formal \n     United Nations investigation, under Article VIII of the \n     Genocide Convention, to determine whether the actions of the \n     Government of Sudan in Darfur constitute acts of genocide;\n       (5) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take \n     immediate steps to pursue the immediate suspension of Sudan \n     from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;\n       (6) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take \n     further steps to ensure that the suspension of Sudan from the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights remains in effect \n     unless and until the Government of Sudan meets all of its \n     obligations, as determined by the United Nations Security \n     Council, under United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1556 of July 30, 2004, and any subsequent United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions regarding this matter;\n       (7) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take steps \n     to ensure that, in the event that the formal investigation of \n     acts of genocide in Sudan results in a determination by the \n     UN that genocide has occurred or is occurring in Darfur, the \n     United States Government takes appropriate actions to ensure \n     that Sudan is removed from the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission;\n       (8) calls upon the member states of the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights to convene an immediate special \n     session to consider the urgent and acute human rights \n     situation in Sudan for the purpose of considering whether \n     Sudan should be suspended from membership in such Commission; \n     and\n       (9) expects the Secretary of State to report to Congress on \n     progress made toward taking the actions and accomplishing the \n     objectives outlined in this resolution not later than 60 days \n     after the date on which Congress agrees to the resolution.\n\n

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``International Consumer Protection Act of 2004.''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from \n     fraud and deception. Cross-border fraud and deception are \n     growing international problems that affect American consumers \n     and businesses. \n       (2) The development of the Internet and improvements in \n     telecommunications technologies have brought significant \n     benefits to consumers. At the same time, they have also \n     provided unprecedented opportunities for those engaged in \n     fraud and deception to establish operations in one country \n     and victimize a large number of consumers in other countries.\n       (3) An increasing number of consumer complaints collected \n     in the Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the \n     Commission, and an increasing number of cases brought by the \n     Commission, involve foreign consumers, foreign businesses or \n     individuals, or assets or evidence located outside the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Commission has legal authority to remedy law \n     violations involving domestic and foreign wrongdoers, \n     pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The \n     Commission's ability to obtain effective relief using this \n     authority, however, may face practical impediments when \n     wrongdoers, victims, other witnesses, documents, money and \n     third parties involved in the transaction are widely \n     dispersed in many different jurisdictions. Such circumstances \n     make it difficult for the Commission to gather all the \n     information necessary to detect injurious practices, to \n     recover offshore assets for consumer redress, and to reach \n     conduct occurring outside the United States that affects \n     United States consumers.\n       (5) Improving the ability of the Commission and its foreign \n     counterparts to share information about cross-border fraud \n     and deception, to conduct joint and parallel investigations, \n     and to assist each other is critical to achieving more timely \n     and effective enforcement in cross-border cases.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enhance the \n     ability of the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers \n     from cross-border fraud and deception and other consumer \n     protection law violations.\n\n     SEC. 2. FOREIGN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DEFINED.\n\n       Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     44) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       `` `Foreign law enforcement agency' means--\n       ``(A) any agency or judicial authority of a foreign \n     government, including a foreign state, a political \n     subdivision of a foreign state, or a multinational \n     organization constituted by and comprised of foreign states, \n     that is vested with law enforcement or investigative \n     authority in civil, criminal, or administrative matters; and\n       ``(B) any multinational or multiagency organization to the \n     extent that it is acting on behalf of an entity described in \n     subparagraph (A).''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AVAILABILITY OF REMEDIES.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     45(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term `unfair \n     or deceptive acts or practices' includes unfair or deceptive \n     acts or practices involving foreign commerce that--\n       ``(i) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable \n     injury within the United States; or\n       ``(ii) involve material conduct occurring within the United \n     States.\n       ``(B) All remedies available to the Commission with respect \n     to unfair and deceptive acts or practices shall be available \n     for acts and practices described in this paragraph, including \n     restitution to domestic or foreign victims.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

COMMISSION \n                            ON HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes, I will be propounding a \nnumber of unanimous consent requests and\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\ncompleting business for the day. One of the unanimous consent requests \nI will propound shortly has to do with one of the most significant \nhumanitarian crises of recent years--and most people would say it is \nthe most dramatic humanitarian global crisis of today--the atrocities \nthat are occurring in Sudan, in the Darfur region of Sudan, which is a \nregion in western Sudan which is about the size of France.\n  Sudan is a huge country, and this whole Darfur region since a year \nbefore last February has been the geographic location where 30,000 to \n50,000 people have died, with another 1.4 million and maybe as high as \n1.7 million people displaced from their homes--action that we condemned \non the floor of the Senate, and the House did likewise, at the end of \nJuly before our recess, and designating in the most dramatic terms that \nthis is genocide.\n  Unfortunately, not a lot has happened on the ground that is \nconstructive since that point in time. Thirty days passed and a United \nNations determination on what was going on didn't have very much teeth \nto it, and the Government in Khartoum of Sudan simply hasn't responded. \nThus these atrocities--the rape, the pillaging, the murder, the total \ndestruction of the villages--have continued. It is important that the \nUnited Nations continue to act and address this issue. It is also \nimportant, since the United Nations has not really acted, that we in \nthe United States lead with clarity, boldness, and, I would say, moral \nclarity.\n  The resolution we will be addressing shortly takes that next step for \nwhat we in this legislative body can do. The resolution calls upon the \nSecretary of State to take action to push for the immediate suspension \nof Sudan's membership on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. \nA government that is engaged in committing genocide should simply not \nhave a seat on the Commission on Human Rights.\n  Since the initial resolution we passed in July designating this as \ngenocide, I have had the opportunity to go to Sudan once again, which I \ndo at least once a year as part of the medical mission work I do. But \nthis time I had the opportunity to go to the country of Chad, which is \njust west of the Darfur region of Sudan where we have had thousands and \nthousands of people flee to escape the Janjaweed, the militia that is \nbeing funded by the Government of Khartoum.\n  In these refugee camps--Tulum is one I immediately think of where \n15,000 people fled--the stories you hear would be a woman who says: \nLast month, I was there with my three little kids, and my husband was \nin the fields working, and the Janjaweed military in uniform came and \ndestroyed our entire village. My two children, I don't know where they \nare. I assume they have been killed. Here is one child with me. My \nhusband is dead, and I have no home and nowhere to go, so I am in the \nrefugee camp.\n  That is going on. After 1,200 interviews that have occurred over the \nlast month, the Secretary of State this past week in a Foreign \nRelations hearing said: Yes. Based on our findings independent of what \nCongress decided, this is genocide.\n  What we don't have yet is a determination by the United Nations \nbecause there are countries such as China and Russia and Pakistan and \nothers that sit on the Security Council. Basically they have not yet \nmade a determination. Meanwhile people continue to die. The atrocities \ncontinue. Thus, this body today in this resolution will take action to \npush for the immediate suspension of Sudan's membership on the United \nNations Commission on Human Rights.\n  The Senate resolution further states that the United Nations should \nimmediately move to determine whether genocide has been conducted in \nDarfur, and if it has, that the Secretary of State should push for \nSudan's removal from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. A \ngovernment, as I said, engaged in genocide should not have a seat on \nthis Commission. It makes a mockery of the Human Rights Commission. \nThis is an affront to all responsible countries that embrace and \npromote human rights.\n\n  The 1948 Genocide Convention calls on state parties to punish \ngenocide--those are the words it uses--when it occurs. The United \nStates is party to this 1948 Convention on Genocide and so is Sudan. \nThe United States has taken a number of actions to provide relief to \nthe people of Sudan. We have introduced resolutions to the U.N. \ncondemning Khartoum's actions. We have taken a number of actions. The \nUnited States has already placed comprehensive sanctions on Sudan for \nits actions as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n  What we are doing today is pushing to suspend Sudan from the Human \nRights Commission, which is consistent with our obligations under that \nGenocide Convention. It makes sense. It is the right thing to do. I \nhope the House of Representatives will take up this resolution quickly \nand pass it forthwith. I also hope in the meantime, Secretary Powell \nwill listen to the will and intent of the Congress and begin taking \nappropriate action. If we are going to preserve the credibility of the \nUnited Nations and its separate commissions, if we are going to advance \nthe causes of human rights, if we are going to protect oppressed \npeoples around the globe, and especially in Darfur, then the U.N. must \ntake more aggressive action.\n  I turn to the resolution and ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 137, which was submitted \nearlier today by Senators Frist and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 137) calling for the \n     suspension of Sudan's membership on the United Nation's \n     Commission on Human Rights.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined Senator Frist \nin the submission of S. Con. Res. 137.\n  It is a shame, really, that we need to be here on the floor again to \ndiscuss Sudan. Yet we were confronted again this morning with even more \ntroubling and disconcerting news about the Darfur region of Sudan. \nAccording to this morning's newspapers, the United Nations has \nconcluded that between 6,000 and 10,000 people are dying from disease \nand violence each month in Sudan's Darfur region.\n  What is worse is that the United Nations--like the United States--has \nconcluded that each and every one of these deaths is entirely \npreventable.\n  Unfortunately, however, the Sudanese government continues to support \nmarauding militias that not only murder people whose only offense is to \nbe of a different ethnicity, but those militias continue to hinder \nefforts to respond to one of Africa's worst humanitarian crises.\n  This resolution also calls attention to a separate tragedy: That \nSudan was granted a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Commission. \nIt won that seat at a time when its tolerance and even support for \nmilitias in Darfur was widely known. Unfortunately, not only did no one \nin the Arab world object to Sudan taking this seat, neither did the \nadministration use its clout at the United Nations to stop this.\n  This resolution says very clearly that a government that appears to \nbe tolerating genocide has no business serving on the UN Human Rights \nCommission.\n  I also want to take a minute to discuss an additional effort on Sudan \nthat Senators Leahy, McConnell, Frist and I were able to work out this \nmorning.\n  We all recognize that we will soon face mounting costs to ease the \nsuffering caused by this humanitarian disaster in Darfur. As such, we \nwere able to come to a straightforward, common-sense agreement that the \nPresident and Secretary of State should re-direct $150 million in \nunused reconstruction money from Iraq to Darfur and for the African \nUnion forces that are attempting to stabilize the situation there.\n  Let me be clear: This is not money for our troops in Iraq, but is \nunused reconstruction money. This is the right thing to do, and I \ncommend my colleagues for their efforts to make sure it happens.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask that the concurrent resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 137) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 137\n\n       Whereas, in Darfur, Sudan, more than 30,000 innocent \n     civilians have been murdered, more than 400 villages have \n     been destroyed, more than 130,000 men, women, and children \n     have been forced from their villages into neighboring \n     countries, and more than 1,000,000 people have been \n     internally displaced;\n       Whereas the United States Government has been, and remains \n     as of September 2004, the largest contributor of assistance \n     to the people of Darfur, having provided over $200,000,000 in \n     assistance, which constitutes more than 70 percent of the \n     total assistance provided to that region;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged $299,000,000 in \n     humanitarian aid to Darfur through fiscal year 2005, as well \n     as $11,800,000 in support of the African Union mission in \n     that region, and is likely to provide support in excess of \n     those pledges;\n       Whereas United States citizens and private organizations, \n     as well as the United States Government, have admirably \n     worked, at great risk and through great effort, to ease \n     suffering in Darfur, Sudan, and in eastern Chad;\n       Whereas, based on credible reports, Congress determined in \n     late July 2004 that acts of genocide were occurring in \n     Darfur, Sudan, and that the Government of Sudan bears direct \n     responsibility for many of those acts of genocide;\n       Whereas, expressing its grave concern at the ongoing \n     humanitarian crisis and widespread human rights violations in \n     Darfur, including continued attacks on civilians that place \n     thousands of lives at risk, the United Nations Security \n     Council on July 30, 2004, unanimously adopted Security \n     Council Resolution 1556, which called upon the Government of \n     Sudan to fulfill immediately its obligations to facilitate \n     humanitarian relief efforts, to take steps to disarm \n     immediately the Janjaweed militias responsible for attacks on \n     civilians and bring the perpetrators of such attacks to \n     justice, and to cooperate with independent United Nations-\n     sponsored investigations of human rights violations;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has failed to take credible \n     steps to comply with the demands of the international \n     community as expressed through the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas, according to press reports, reports from \n     nongovernmental organizations, first-hand accounts from \n     refugees, and other sources, the Janjaweed attacks on the \n     civilians of Darfur continue unabated as of September 2004;\n       Whereas there are credible reports from some of these same \n     sources that the Government of Sudan is providing assistance \n     to the Janjaweed militias and, in some cases, that Government \n     of Sudan forces have participated directly in attacks on \n     civilians;\n       Whereas the United States Government, after conducting more \n     than 1,000 interviews with survivors and refugees, has \n     determined that genocide has occurred in Darfur, that it may \n     still be occurring, and that both the Janjaweed and the \n     Government of Sudan bear responsibility for these acts;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State has determined that the \n     attacks by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed on the \n     non-Arab people of Darfur and their villages are based on \n     race, not religion;\n       Whereas the United States has recently introduced a new \n     resolution in the United Nations Security Council that calls \n     for the Government of Sudan to cooperate fully with an \n     expanded African Union force and for a cessation of Sudanese \n     military flights over Darfur;\n       Whereas the introduced resolution also provides for \n     international overflights of the Darfur region to monitor the \n     situation on the ground and requires the United Nations \n     Security Council to review the record of compliance of the \n     Government of Sudan to determine whether the United Nations \n     should impose sanctions on Sudan, including sanctions \n     affecting the petroleum sector in that country;\n       Whereas the resolution also urges the Government of Sudan \n     and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement to conclude \n     negotiations on a comprehensive peace accord and, most \n     important, calls for a United Nations investigation into all \n     violations of international humanitarian law and human rights \n     law that have occurred in Darfur in order to ensure \n     accountability;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council, in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1556, emphasized that the \n     Government of Sudan bears primary responsibility for \n     respecting human rights and protecting the people of Sudan;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 \n     calls upon the Government of Sudan to cooperate with the \n     United Nations;\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Commission, \n     established in 1946 and given the responsibility of drafting \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is responsible for \n     promoting respect for and observance of, human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms for all;\n       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares \n     that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and \n     rights, that everyone is entitled to all the rights and \n     freedoms set forth in the Declaration regardless of race, \n     color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, \n     or national or social origin, property, birth, or other \n     status that everyone has the right to life, liberty and \n     security of person, that no one shall be held in slavery or \n     servitude, and that no one shall be subjected to torture or \n     to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     Genocide, done at Paris on December 9, 1948 (hereafter in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Genocide Convention''), \n     delineates the criteria that constitute genocide and requires \n     parties to prevent and punish genocide;\n       Whereas Sudan is a state party to the Genocide Convention \n     and remains a member of the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State determined that, according \n     to United States law, the Government of Sudan is a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and has been since 1993 and therefore \n     remains ineligible for U.S. foreign assistance;\n       Whereas, due to the human rights situation in Darfur, it \n     would be consistent with United States obligations under the \n     Genocide Convention for the Secretary of State and the United \n     States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to seek \n     the immediate suspension of Sudan from the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights and, in the event a formal \n     investigation results in a determination by the UN that \n     genocide has occurred in Darfur, the ultimate removal of \n     Sudan from such Commission; and\n       Whereas it is a mockery of human rights as a universal \n     principle, a challenge to the United Nations as an \n     institution, and an affront to all responsible countries that \n     embrace and promote human rights that a government under \n     investigation by the United Nations for committing genocide \n     against, and violating the human rights of, its own citizens \n     sits in judgment of others as a member in good standing of \n     the United Nations Commission on Human Rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and approves of the findings of the \n     Secretary of State that genocide has occurred and may still \n     be occurring in Darfur, Sudan, and that the Government of \n     Sudan bears responsibility for such acts;\n       (2) supports the Secretary of State's call for a full and \n     unfettered investigation by the United Nations into all \n     violations of international humanitarian law and human rights \n     law that have occurred in Darfur, with a view to ensuring \n     accountability;\n       (3) supports the resolution introduced by the United States \n     Government in the United Nations Security Council on \n     September 9, 2004, with regard to the situation in Darfur;\n       (4) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take \n     immediate steps to pursue the establishment of a formal \n     United Nations investigation, under Article VIII of the \n     Genocide Convention to determine whether the actions of the \n     Government of Sudan in Darfur constitute acts of genocide;\n       (5) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take \n     immediate steps to pursue the immediate suspension of Sudan \n     from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;\n       (6) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take \n     further steps to ensure that the suspension of Sudan from the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights remains in effect \n     unless and until the Government of Sudan meets all of its \n     obligations, as determined by the United Nations Security \n     Council, under United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1556 of July 30, 2004, and any subsequent United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions regarding this matter;\n       (7) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take steps \n     to ensure that, in the event that the formal investigation of \n     acts of genocide in Sudan results in a determination by the \n     UN that genocide has occurred or is occurring in Darfur, the \n     United States Government takes appropriate actions to ensure \n     that Sudan is removed from the United Nations Human Rights \n     Commission;\n       (8) calls upon the member states of the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights to convene an immediate special \n     session to consider the urgent and acute human rights \n     situation in Sudan for the purpose of considering whether \n     Sudan should be suspended from membership in such Commission; \n     and\n       (9) expects the Secretary of State to report to Congress on \n     progress made toward taking the actions and accomplishing the \n     objectives outlined in this resolution not later than 60 days \n     after the date on which Congress agrees to the resolution.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, I ask on Tuesday, September 21, at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 635, S. 2666, the Legislative Branch appropriations bill; that the \nfour managers' amendments at the desk be agreed to, and no other \namendments be in order. I further ask that there be 1 hour of debate \nyielded back of the time, and the bill, as amended, be read the third \ntime and returned to the Senate calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I further ask that the Appropriations Committee then be \ndischarged from further consideration and the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 4755, the House-passed Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill, that the text of the bill relating solely to the \nHouse remain; that all other text be stricken, and the text of the \nSenate bill, as amended, be inserted, and the Senate then proceed to a \nvote on H.R. 4755, as amended, all without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I further ask upon passage of the bill the bill be held at \nthe desk as if a House message.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the work that we did this past \nseveral days on the Homeland Security appropriations bill should set \nthe tone and the direction that we can take the next few weeks to \ncomplete any number of appropriations bills. If we continue with the \nsame bipartisan spirit that we have had before--I know we have had a \nlot of extraneous matters, just dealing with the matters dealing with \nthe appropriations bills as we started the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill with more than 200 amendments. We were able to work \nthrough those. I don't know how many votes we had, but we had a lot of \nvotes. I would hope that next week we can make some serious progress on \nsome of these appropriations bills before we get into the last 2 weeks \nof being here when we have to deal with the September 11 report and \nother such matters. We have the right to pat ourselves on the back for \nthe work we have done the last few days in the Senate relating to this \nappropriations process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. And I say this, too: Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens did \nsome good work in allowing Members to get to this work, along with you \nand Senator Daschle, so the whole body should be favorably inclined. \nThis has been hard work. We read off a few words, but it is easier to \nread them than what it took to write this down. I personally appreciate \nthe work of the two leaders of the Appropriations Committee and the \nDemocratic and Republican leaders in their work.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that same spirit is what we plan to \ncontinue to address in this appropriations bill, and we will continue \nto address in other appropriations bills as they become available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9316-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9316-S9321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [The Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) The Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from \n     fraud and deception. Cross-border fraud and deception are \n     growing international problems that affect American consumers \n     and businesses.\n       [(2) The development of the Internet and improvements in \n     telecommunications technologies have brought significant \n     benefits to consumers. At the same time, they have also \n     provided unprecedented opportunities for those engaged in \n     fraud and deception to establish operations in one country \n     and victimize a large number of consumers in other countries.\n       [(3) An increasing number of consumer complaints collected \n     in the Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the \n     Commission, and an increasing number of cases brought by the \n     Commission, involve foreign consumers, foreign businesses or \n     individuals, or assets or evidence located outside the United \n     States.\n       [(4) The Commission has legal authority to remedy law \n     violations involving domestic and foreign wrongdoers, \n     pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The \n     Commission's ability to obtain effective relief using this \n     authority, however, may face practical impediments when \n     wrongdoers, victims, other witnesses, documents, money and \n     third parties involved in the transaction are widely \n     dispersed in many different jurisdictions. Such circumstances \n     make it difficult for the Commission to gather all the \n     information necessary to detect injurious practices, to \n     recover offshore assets for consumer redress, and to reach \n     conduct occurring outside the United States that affects \n     United States consumers.\n       [(5) Improving the ability of the Commission and its \n     foreign counterparts to share information about cross-border \n     fraud and deception, to conduct joint and parallel \n     investigations, and to assist each other is critical to \n     achieve more timely and effective enforcement in cross-border \n     cases.\n       [(6) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation to \n     provide the Commission with more tools to protect consumers \n     across borders.\n\n     [SEC. 202.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from \n     fraud and deception. Cross-border fraud and deception are \n     growing international problems that affect American consumers \n     and businesses.\n       (2) The development of the Internet and improvements in \n     telecommunications technologies have brought significant \n     benefits to consumers. At the same time, they have also \n     provided unprecedented opportunities for those engaged in \n     fraud and deception to establish operations in one country \n     and victimize a large number of consumers in other countries.\n       (3) An increasing number of consumer complaints collected \n     in the Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the \n     Commission, and an increasing number of cases brought by the \n     Commission, involve foreign consumers, foreign businesses or \n     individuals, or assets or evidence located outside the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Commission has legal authority to remedy law \n     violations involving domestic and foreign wrongdoers, \n     pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The \n     Commission's ability to obtain effective relief using this \n     authority, however, may face practical impediments when \n     wrongdoers, victims, other witnesses, documents, money and \n     third parties involved in the transaction are widely \n     dispersed in many different jurisdictions. Such circumstances \n     make it difficult for the Commission to gather all the \n     information necessary to detect injurious practices, to \n     recover offshore assets for consumer redress, and to reach \n     conduct occurring outside the United States that affects \n     United States consumers.\n       (5) Improving the ability of the Commission and its foreign \n     counterparts to share information about cross-border fraud \n     and deception, to conduct joint and parallel investigations, \n     and to assist each other is critical to achieve more timely \n     and effective enforcement in cross-border cases.\n       (6) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation to \n     provide the Commission with more tools to protect consumers \n     across borders.\n\n     SEC. 202. FOREIGN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DEFINED.\n\n       Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     44) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       `` `Foreign law enforcement agency' means--\n       ``(1) any agency or judicial authority of a foreign \n     government, including a foreign state, a political \n     subdivision of a foreign state, or a multinational \n     organization constituted by and comprised of foreign states, \n     that is vested with law enforcement or investigative \n     authority in civil, criminal, or administrative matters; or\n       ``(2) any multinational organization, to the extent that it \n     is acting on behalf of an entity described in paragraph \n     (1).''.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 426, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 426) commending Maryland's Olympians \n     on their accomplishments at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in \n     Athens, Greece.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the American \nathletes for their participation in the 2004 Olympic Games. These \nathletes made us proud not only of their victories, but also of their \nsportsmanship. The heart, focus and perseverance exhibited by these men \nand women offered us an opportunity to reflect on the values and \ncharacteristics that embody the very best of the American Spirit.\n  All of our athletes should be commended, but because they played a \nvery prominent role in these games, I want to take a moment to \nacknowledge the hard work and dedication of Maryland's Olympic \nathletes. This year, we were very fortunate to have fourteen \nMarylanders compete. This group of athletes, which included both the \nyoungest and the oldest members of the U.S. team, represented Maryland \nand the United States with honor and dignity and excelled in their \nvarious competitions. Marylanders participated in a variety of sports \nranging from swimming and track and field, to whitewater slalom \ncanoeing and table tennis. Our State boasted household names like \nMichael Phelps and Carmelo Anthony as well as rising stars like Bernard \nWilliams and Courtney Kupets. The delegation included individuals from \nall over the State, from the City of Annapolis to Howard County, from \nBethesda to Gaithersburg to Baltimore City, and from Upper Marlboro to \nTowson and Abingdon.\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\n  And although they come from a diversity of backgrounds, each \ndemonstrated the common spirit of what it means to be a true Olympian. \nWe saw that spirit in Carmelo Anthony's refusal to quit after the men's \nbasketball team suffered a series of difficult and surprising losses. \nWe saw it in the decisions of Liz Filter and Nancy Haberland to compete \nin the face of challenging life circumstances. It was reflected in the \nwisdom and experience of Libby Callahan as well as the youthful \nexuberance of 15 year-old swimmer Katie Hoff. It shined through Jun Gao \nwhen on day four of the table tennis competition, as the only member of \nthe U.S. team still in competition, she shouldered the hopes of her \nteammates.\n  The Olympic spirit was further reflected in paddlers Joe Jacobi and \nScott Parsons, who focused on the experience and joy of the \nperformance. Courtney Kupets and Rhadi Ferguson showed enormous bravery \nby overcoming serious injuries to make the U.S. team and compete for \ntheir country. Ms. Kupets brought home two medals, a silver in the team \ncompetition and a bronze in the individual uneven bars. And Michael \nPhelps, who won six gold and two bronze medals, showed that the team is \nmore important than individual accomplishment when he yielded his spot \non the 4 x 100 medley relay squad and an opportunity for further glory \nto teammate Ian Crocker.\n  Finally, Maryland's track and field athletes should be commended for \ntheir heart and concentration. Tiombe Hurd, who is legally blind, \novercame her vision obstacles to finish 22nd in a crowded triple jump \nfield. Bernard Williams and James Carter, who hail from Baltimore \npublic schools, Carver Vocational-Technical High School and \nMergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School, showed the world the \nkind of talent and poise Baltimore City's public schools can produce, \ntaking home a silver in the 200 meter sprint and a fourth place finish \nin the 400 meter hurdles.\n  Maryland, and America, should be proud of their Olympic athletes. \nThrough their actions both on and off the field of competition, they \nexhibited the grace, sportsmanship, and determination that signify a \ntrue Olympian. Congratulations are due to all of our athletes both for \ntheir individual successes and for the way they, as a team, showed the \nworld the best our nation has to offer.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 422, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 422) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the President should designate the week beginning \n     September 12, 2004, as ``National Historically Black Colleges \n     and Universities Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, America's Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities have served as precious portals of opportunity for \nAfrican-Americans since the first, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, \nwas founded 167 years ago. I join all Americans in commemorating these \nproud institutions of higher learning this week, which the President \nhas proclaimed ``National Historically Black Colleges and Universities \nWeek.''\n  Mary McLeod Bethune once said, ``We firmly believe education has the \nirresistible power to dissolve the shackles of slavery.'' It was this \nmoral commitment to education for African-Americans that inspired Ms. \nBethune to found her famous day school in Daytona, FL--now known as \nBethune Cookman College--100 years ago. It was also this ideal that \ninspired the establishment of 130 other Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities nationwide. And the ``irresistible power'' of these \ninstitutions for the African-American community is clear. Fully 42 \npercent of all the PhDs earned each year by African-Americans are \nearned by graduates of HBCUs.\n  But despite playing a central role in our Nation's economic, \ncultural, social and spiritual life, HBCUs have been physically \neroding, victims of chronic neglect and underfunding. A 1990 General \nAccounting Office study concluded that 712 properties on 103 HBCU \ncampuses nationwide were in need of repair or renovation, at an \nestimated cost of $755 million.\n  That is why 2 years ago I joined with Congressman Jim Clyburn in the \ncause of repairing, restoring, rebuilding, and revitalizing HBCUs. With \nthe support of Senators Landrieu, Miller, and others, our legislation \nto authorize $50 million in new funding for HBCUs passed the Senate in \nJanuary 2003, and was signed into law by the President in February of \nthat year. We appropriated $3 million for the program last year, and \nhope to continue such robust funding this appropriations cycle.\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\n  I saw firsthand the effect that this legislation can have. When I \nvisited Allen University in South Carolina in 2002, I went to Arnett \nHall--a building that had been transformed from an eyesore into a \nbeautiful and stately facility with the help of Federal funds. In the \npast, students and faculty who walked into the dilapidated hall would \nbe left with the clear impression that we are neglecting these historic \ntreasures. Now, they visit the restored hall and are left with the \nimpression that we consider Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities central to our history and to our future.\n  Our HBCU legislation was an important step to fulfilling the dream, \nas Dr. Martin Luther King famously captured it, of an America true to \nits creed that we are all created equal. Each of these 130 institutions \nof higher learning, educating 300,000 African-American students, is a \nliving memorial to the dream of equal educational opportunity for all--\nliving memorials we are morally bound to preserve. This week, let us \nrecall the proud heritage and valuable contribution Historically Black \nColleges and Universities make to our Nation, and redouble our efforts \nto keep their doors open for future generations.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities around the country that serve over \n215,000 of our finest African-American students.\n  Since the first HBCU was founded in 1837, HBCUs have played an \nimportant role in our higher education system. They have educated some \nof our most prominent African-American leaders, such as the Reverend \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, educator Booker T. Washington, former U.S. Surgeon General \nDavid Satcher, Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, and Louisiana native and \nformer United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young, Jr., to just name a few. \nToday, 65 percent of all African-American physicians, 50 percent of \nAfrican-American engineers, and 35 percent of African-American lawyers \nare graduates of an HBCU. It is clear that HBCUs have and continue to \nplay a vital role in our higher education system, and for that, I honor \nthem today.\n  I would specifically like to praise the six HBCUs in my home state of \nLouisiana that produce exceptionally fine graduates: Dillard University \nin New Orleans, Grambling State University in Grambling, Southern \nUniversity and Agricultural and Mechanical College in Baton Rouge, \nSouthern University in New Orleans, Southern University in Shreveport, \nand Xavier University in New Orleans. These schools serve roughly \n30,000 Louisiana higher education students and prepare them to be \ntomorrow's leaders. For that, I say thank you.\n  Recognizing the importance of HBCUs, I am proud to lend my support to \nS. Res. 422, designating this week as ``National Historically Black \nColleges and Universities Week.'' And, I am proud to support the \nCollege Quality, Affordability, and Diversity Improvement Act, S. 1793, \nwhich extends and increases the Title V, Part B programs under the \nHigher Education Act that strengthen HBCUs. As we enter the final weeks \nof the 108th Congress, I look forward to discussing, debating, and \npassing this important piece of legislation, and as we move through the \nappropriations process, I urge my colleagues to ensure that adequate \nfunding is given to HBCUs.\n  Historically Black Colleges and Universities have given a great \namount to our higher education system through the years, and today I \ngive them my thanks and praise.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 422) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 422\n\n       Whereas there are 105 historically Black colleges and \n     universities in the United States;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities \n     provide the quality education so essential to full \n     participation in a complex, highly technological society;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities have a \n     rich heritage and have played a prominent role in the history \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas historically Black colleges and universities have \n     allowed many underprivileged students to attain their full \n     potential through higher education; and\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of historically Black \n     colleges and universities are deserving of national \n     recognition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, this resolution relates to historically \nblack colleges and universities and the designation of a period of time \nto express appreciation for the tremendous function and job they carry \nout in this great country of ours.\n  In my own city of Nashville, my hometown, and where I live now, we \nhave two wonderful historically black institutions of learning. One is \na medical center, Meharry Medical College; and the another is Fisk \nUniversity. The contributions those two institutions of learning have \nmade to our community, and indeed to the global community, and in the \nsense of Meharry to the national community of physicians, has been just \ntremendous.\n  I know both sides of the aisle take great pleasure in once again \nrecognizing this period of time that we can celebrate the great work \nthat is done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9323-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This title may be cited as the ``National Aviation \n     Heritage Area Act''.\n\n     [SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) Few technological advances have transformed the world \n     or our Nation's economy, society, culture, and national \n     character as the development of powered flight.\n       [(2) The industrial, cultural, and natural heritage \n     legacies of the aviation and aerospace industry in the State \n     of Ohio are nationally significant.\n       [(3) Dayton, Ohio, and other defined areas where the \n     development of the airplane and aerospace technology \n     established our Nation's leadership in both civil and \n     military aeronautics and astronautics set the foundation for \n     the 20th Century to be an American Century.\n       [(4) Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, is \n     the birthplace, the home, and an integral part of the future \n     of aerospace.\n       [(5) The economic strength of our Nation is connected \n     integrally to the vitality of the aviation and aerospace \n     industry, which is responsible for an estimated 11,200,000 \n     American jobs.\n       [(6) The industrial and cultural heritage of the aviation \n     and aerospace industry in the State of Ohio includes the \n     social history and living cultural traditions of several \n     generations.\n       [(7) The Department of the Interior is responsible for \n     protecting and interpreting the Nation's cultural and \n     historic resources, and there are significant examples of \n     these resources within Ohio to merit the involvement of the \n     Federal Government to develop programs and projects in \n     cooperation with the Aviation Heritage Foundation, \n     Incorporated, the State of Ohio, and other local and \n     governmental entities to adequately conserve, protect, and \n     interpret this heritage for the educational and recreational \n     benefit of this and future generations of Americans, while \n     providing opportunities for education and revitalization.\n       [(8) Since the enactment of the Dayton Aviation Heritage \n     Preservation Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-419), partnerships \n     among the Federal, State, and local governments and the \n     private sector have greatly assisted the development and \n     preservation of the historic aviation resources in the Miami \n     Valley.\n       [(9) An aviation heritage area centered in Southwest Ohio \n     is a suitable and feasible management option to increase \n     collaboration, promote heritage tourism, and build on the \n     established partnerships among Ohio's historic aviation \n     resources and related sites.\n       [(10) A critical level of collaboration among the historic \n     aviation resources in Southwest Ohio cannot be achieved \n     without a congressionally established national heritage area \n     and the support of the National Park Service and other \n     Federal agencies which own significant historic aviation-\n     related sites in Ohio.\n       [(11) The Aviation Heritage Foundation, Incorporated, would \n     be an appropriate management entity to oversee the \n     development of the National Aviation Heritage Area.\n       [(12) Five National Park Service and Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage Commission studies and planning documents ``Study of \n     Alternatives: Dayton's Aviation Heritage'', ``Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage National Historical Park Suitability/Feasibility \n     Study'', ``Dayton Aviation Heritage General Management \n     Plan'', ``Dayton Historic Resources Preservation and \n     Development Plan'', and Heritage Area Concept Study (in \n     progress) demonstrated that sufficient historical resources \n     exist to establish the National Aviation Heritage Area.\n       [(13) With the advent of the 100th anniversary of the first \n     powered flight in 2003, it is recognized that the \n     preservation of properties nationally significant in the \n     history of aviation is an important goal for the future \n     education of Americans.\n       [(14) Local governments, the State of Ohio, and private \n     sector interests have embraced the heritage area concept and \n     desire to enter into a partnership with the Federal \n     Government to preserve, protect, and develop the Heritage \n     Area for public benefit.\n       [(15) The National Aviation Heritage Area would complement \n     and enhance the aviation-related resources within the \n     National Park Service, especially the Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage National Historical Park, Ohio.\n       [(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish \n     the Heritage Area to--\n       [(1) encourage and facilitate collaboration among the \n     facilities, sites, organizations, governmental entities, and \n     educational institutions within the Heritage Area to promote \n     heritage tourism and to develop educational and cultural \n     programs for the public;\n       [(2) preserve and interpret for the educational and \n     inspirational benefit of present and future generations the \n     unique and significant contributions to our national heritage \n     of certain historic and cultural lands, structures, \n     facilities, and sites within the National Aviation Heritage \n     Area;\n       [(3) encourage within the National Aviation Heritage Area a \n     broad range of economic opportunities enhancing the quality \n     of life for present and future generations;\n       [(4) provide a management framework to assist the State of \n     Ohio, its political subdivisions, other areas, and private \n     organizations, or combinations thereof, in preparing and \n     implementing an integrated Management Plan to conserve their \n     aviation heritage and in developing policies and programs \n     that will preserve, enhance, and interpret the cultural, \n     historical, natural, recreation, and scenic resources of the \n     Heritage Area; and\n       [(5) authorize the Secretary to provide financial and \n     technical assistance to the State of Ohio, its political \n     subdivisions, and private organizations, or combinations \n     thereof, in preparing and implementing the private Management \n     Plan.\n\n     [SEC. 103.

I didn't add them up, but there are probably over 40 bills we \nneeded to dispose of to send them to the House tonight. The number is \n44, I am told.\n  This is good work. The committee should be congratulated, and that is \nwhat I am doing now.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I hold my breath right before all these are \ngoing through. But it is 43, 44 bills just done. These bills reflect a \nhuge amount of work. To see it come together is sort of the privilege \nthat the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership have, to \nsee it come together at a late hour like this afternoon. It is \ngratifying.

After we go, many of them are still around here making sure the \njournals are correct, and there are many other things they do. In \naddition, because of the terrorism threat, we have all these security \npeople here.

Mr. President, let me take a minute to review the schedule \nfor the next couple of days and next week. In observance of the Rosh \nHashanah holiday, we will not be voting tomorrow. In addition, we are \nin a pro forma session which will allow people to appropriately use \nthat time for themselves to work, to catch up with families, to see \nconstituents, to get back to their States.\n  We were able to reach agreement to complete two additional \nappropriations bills with short time limits which allows us to be in a \npro forma session tomorrow. We will not be conducting business on the \nfloor tomorrow.\n  Earlier today, we completed debate on the Military Construction \nappropriations bill with the vote on final passage which will occur, as \njust mentioned, at 5:30 on Monday. For the information of my \ncolleagues, that will be the next rollcall vote. Today we also reached \nagreement on the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, and that will \nbe scheduled for consideration early next week with the vote likely to \nbe Tuesday morning.\n  Next week we may be able to reach additional agreements on \nappropriations bills, and we will continue to pursue those in the same \nspirit that the assistant Democratic leader just mentioned.\n  In addition, we have the Goss nomination that, in all likelihood, \nwill become available for full Senate consideration. We will certainly \nschedule that nomination to come to the floor just as soon as we \npossibly can, as soon as it is ready. I expect that to be in the early \nto mid part of next week.\n  We also have discussions continuing on the expiring family tax \nprovisions. If possible, we would like to be able to pull that package \ntogether and bring it to the floor just as soon as it is ready as well.\n  Next week, on Thursday, September 23, Prime Minister Allawi of Iraq, \nwho is also a physician and doctor, will be addressing a joint meeting \nof Congress. That address will be on that Thursday at 10 a.m. in the \nHall of the House of Representatives. Members will gather in the Senate \nChamber and will proceed as a body to the House at approximately 9:30 \nthat morning.\n  We will have a very full schedule next week. I know that quite often, \nas the galleries watch what is occurring in the Senate Chamber or view \non C-SPAN II what happens in the Senate, when we have days like \ntomorrow or the rest of this afternoon, things seem to be slow. In \ntruth, there is all sorts of work going on, especially now as we are \nworking toward that October 8 adjournment date. People are busy in \ncommittee hearings and working on various issues that we must address \nand negotiate through this legislative process.\n  A perfect example is with the bills that the assistant Democratic \nleader just referred to--the 44 bills that he held up and that we were \nable to pass quickly. A huge amount of work goes into bringing those to \nthe floor and having them prepared appropriately. These bills had to do \nwith land, water conservation, park measures, and a whole range of \nenergy issues. It took about a minute on the Senate floor to pass them, \nbut literally hundreds of hours were involved in getting that \nlegislation available and ready for consideration.\n  I only mention that as another example of what is going on and what \nthe challenge is and the huge demands on all of us to accomplish what \nwe must before October 8.\n  I opened this morning by thanking Senator Thad Cochran for his \ntremendous leadership over the course of the week on Homeland Security \nappropriations. We were here very late last night and we were able to \ncomplete that bill. Members showed a lot of patience during the day and \ninto the evening as we pushed through to final passage. I thank \neverybody for their tremendous efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/15/senate-section/article/S9361-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
