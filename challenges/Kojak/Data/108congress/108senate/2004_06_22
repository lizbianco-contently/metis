If we are unable to complete the bill this evening, we would \nthen return tomorrow for a series of votes on any remaining amendments \nand conclusion with final passage. Under this scenario, we should \nfinish the bill either late tonight or tomorrow morning.\n  There is much more work to do before the Fourth of July recess. \nAlthough an earlier agreement allows us to go to class action, we will \npostpone consideration of that measure in order to begin the Defense \nappropriations bill in order to provide the vital support, vital \nmonetary support, for our troops who are fighting at this moment in the \nwar on terror overseas.\n  Once again, I remind my colleagues we will continue to schedule votes \non the remaining judicial nominations this week, and I anticipate \nconsideration of several of those today.\n  I also remind Senators to be in their seats at 2:15 today for the \nofficial photograph. This will take just a very few minutes if we have \npeople on time. I ask Senators to be here promptly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7117-8", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7117-S7118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CANCER IN WOMEN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to speak on a totally \nunrelated issue on leader time and then we will move to the bill unless \nthere is another comment to be made. It is a very important message. It \nis an issue most people do not understand and it has to\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\ndo with an issue of health care and emergency health. It is regarding a \nfundamental question which most people cannot answer, cancer in women.\n  I ask people to be thinking what the appropriate answer is, What is \nthe deadliest cancer in women today? What is the leading cause of \ncancer death among 55 percent of our population today? Most people \nthink breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, or one of the \ngynecological cancers. It is not. The deadliest cancer is lung cancer.\n  It is preventable and it does not have to be that way. Therefore, the \nsolution comes with education. I will take 3 or 4 minutes to comment.\n  The Journal of the American Medical Association this spring published \nthe astonishing finding that lung cancer is the No. 1 cause of cancer \ndeaths in American women. In fact, breast cancer, all the gynecological \ncancers, add those up and they still do not equal the number of women \nwho die from lung cancer.\n  The female death rate from lung cancer has risen 600 percent over the \nlast six decades. The last lung cancer operation I performed was about \n10 years ago. Since then, the death rate has increased. It is a problem \nthat is getting worse. The death rate continues to grow, even though \nthe rate of smoking among women has begun to taper off since the 1960s. \nThe whole point is that lung cancer can continue to strike even after \nsomeone stops smoking.\n  Lung cancer is the deadliest of all cancers. It tends to spread to \nthe brain. It tends to spread to the bones. It is usually diagnosed \nvery late. The 5-year survival, which is the end point that we in \nmedicine use, is very low. If you take all women who were diagnosed \nwith lung cancer from 1992 to 1999, only 12 percent--1 in 10--survived \n5 years. In the Journal of the American Medical Association article, \nthe survival rates, according to the researcher, to use his words, are \n``dismal.''\n  It is interesting that the disease affects women differently than \nmen. Probably estrogen plays a role in that. We see female smokers \nsuffer a higher result of genetic damage from the smoke and the \ningredients in smoke. Females are less able to repair genetic damage \nfrom the smoke. It is an epidemic. It is an epidemic in this country \nwith these high death rates, but there are also great smoking increases \nacross the world, so it becomes a pandemic when we look at Asia, or a \ncontinent I go to on a regular basis, Africa, where smoking is gaining \nin popularity. Thus, lung cancer and death will be increasing in \ndecades to come.\n  The good thing is we can prevent it. Up to 80 percent of lung cancer \nis caused by one thing: smoking. It is as simple at that. A lot of \npeople try to dance around it but it is as simple as that. It does not \nmatter statistically whether you are smoking light cigarettes or \nregular, even heavy smokers versus social smokers. There is no such \nthing as a safe cigarette today.\n\n  You can quit and that is tough to do. I have counseled hundreds and \nhundreds of patients, being a heart surgeon, a lung surgeon, and lung \ncancer surgeon before. I have counseled hundreds of patients, probably \nthousands of patients. It is tough to quit smoking. Nevertheless, if \nyou put your mind to it, you can quit, and if you quit you can reduce \nthat risk.\n  The best thing we can do is have people never start. That means we \nhave an obligation to take the very latest scientific data, what we \nknow today, and educate the American people. I argue, also, we need to \neducate people in high school today because the easiest thing to do is \nstop people from smoking up front.\n  I urge my colleagues, educators, parents, and the media to convey \nthat message loud and clear. We know where smoking leads. It leads to \naddiction, to cancer, contributes to heart disease, to stroke, blood \nvessel disease, and cardiovascular disease. We need to educate young \nwomen to the consequences of smoking before they have done irreparable \ndamage to their lungs.\n  Although I know my colleagues will not read the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, the article itself is factual, very well \nresearched. I believe at least I have an obligation to share this with \nmy colleagues so they can share the current state of the art with their \nconstituents and reverse a growing challenge to women's health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could we speak for a minute before the quorum call?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Daschle is going to give a speech.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was going to recommend that our colleague from Alaska, \nwho has commitments early this morning, be able to initiate on this \nside comments in rebuttal to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin \nand the Senator from Michigan can follow and then the Presiding Officer \nwishes to say something, and I will wrap.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure that is appropriate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, no question more occupied the minds of \nour Founding Fathers than how to keep American democracy from devolving \ninto despotism.\n  The delicate and elaborate structure of our Government is designed \nnot merely to represent the will of the American people but to prevent \nthe concentration and abuse of power. To eliminate the prospects that \ntyranny could take hold, the Framers not only created a separation of \nequal powers, but they gave each branch authority over its peers.\n  ``Unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give \neach a constitutional control over the others,'' James Madison wrote in \nThe Federalist Papers, ``the degree of separation . . . essential to a \nfree government, can never in practice be duly maintained.''\n  For our system to work, no part of Government can be free from \nscrutiny--not Congress, not the judiciary, and not the White House.\n  Unfortunately, Congress seems to have abdicated its role in our \nsystem of checks and balances. Partisan loyalty is taking precedence \nover our constitutional responsibilities, and oversight has ground to a \nhalt. There are few clearer examples than Congress' failure to \ninvestigate the decision to withhold the cost estimates for its \ncontroversial Medicare proposal.\n  There have been serious allegations that the administration misled \nCongress about the projected cost of the Medicare legislation, denying \naccess to a study that projected much higher costs than those \nadministration officials, including the President, discussed publicly. \nThese allegations included charges that the former Administrator of the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services violated Federal law by \nthreatening to fire Medicare's Chief Actuary if he disclosed the cost \ninformation to Members of Congress. Yet the allegations are being \nignored in both the House and the Senate. The White House, too, has \nstonewalled. There have been no hearings, no inquiries, nothing but \nsilence.\n  These charges are too serious to ignore. There are four crucial \nquestions relating to those facts that urgently need investigation.\n  First, who in the administration knew about the higher cost \nestimates? CMS Chief Actuary Richard Foster has said that the HHS cost \nestimates were shared with White House officials.\n  To assess whether there was a coordinated effort within HHS and the \nWhite House to mislead Congress, we need to know who in the \nadministration knew about the higher cost estimates and when they knew \nit.\n  Second, who in the administration participated in the decision to \nwithhold the cost estimates from Congress?\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, Federal employees \nhave a statutory right to communicate with\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\nCongress, as well as certain whistleblower and employment protections. \nMoreover, HHS is expressly prohibited from using funds to pay the \nsalary of anyone who prevents or attempts to prevent an executive \nbranch employee from providing information to Congress if that \ninformation relates to relevant official matters.\n  CRS has found that the CMS may have violated these laws when the \nAdministrator threatened Mr. Foster. We need to know if others above \nthe Administrator's level participated in or authorized this activity.\n\n  Third, were senior leaders in Congress part of the effort to withhold \nthe cost estimates from the rest of Congress?\n  In a letter to Representative Henry Waxman, the Department of Health \nand Human Services has asserted that ``[Health and Human Services] made \nconferees aware that HHS expected its final scoring to be higher than \nCBO's final scoring'' and cited Republican conferee Nancy Johnson as \none of the Members who ``knew about these numbers.''\n  If the administration shared the cost estimates with selected \nRepublican leaders, why did these leaders not share the estimates with \nall conferees and all Members?\n  Fourth, is the administration seeking to obstruct congressional \ninvestigations?\n  To date, the administration has refused to cooperate with legitimate \nefforts to investigate its actions. White House Counsel Alberto \nGonzales has intervened to prevent officials from testifying before the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee about White House involvement. President \nBush has failed to respond to a request for information from 12 U.S. \nSenators. These actions suggest there may be a concerted effort by the \nadministration to block oversight of its actions.\n  There could be no clearer case demonstrating the need for \ncongressional oversight.\n  To preserve our system of checks and balances and maintain citizens' \ntrust that the power they have vested in their elected leaders is being \nexercised responsibly, we must take very seriously allegations that \nexecutive branch officials misled Congress in this case. Therefore, \nalong with several of my colleagues, I have requested that the \nleadership in both the House and the Senate take the following two \nsteps:\n  First, Congress should ask the administration to provide copies of \nany documents relevant to this investigation.\n  Second, Congress should hold hearings at which Mr. Scully; Doug \nBadger, Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and \nJames Capretta, Associate Director for Human Resource Programs at OMB, \nbe called to testify. Mr. Scully's relevance is self-evident. Mr. \nBadger and Mr. Capretta received cost estimates from Mr. Foster and are \nlikely to have information about the White House involvement in this \nmatter. Their testimony would, therefore, be critical to establishing \nkey facts about this affair.\n  These actions are essential if Congress is to fulfill its oversight \nresponsibilities. They are simple and straightforward and will enable \nCongress to learn why the Medicare cost estimates were withheld and who \nis actually responsible.\n  In addition, we are writing President Bush to urge him to clarify \nwhat he knew about the Medicare cost estimates, the administration's \nattempts to suppress them, and the administration's communications with \nCongress about this issue. The credibility of the White House on all \nmatters of policy is at stake.\n  These concerns are not limited to the Medicare debacle. As the cost \nof operations in Iraq have climbed past $200 billion, American \ntaxpayers have been asking questions regarding whether every dollar \nspent has been necessary.\n  Of late, those questions have centered on Halliburton. Even before \nthe invasion of Iraq, there were concerns about Halliburton's \ncontracts. Very quickly, these concerns proved to be justified.\n  Last year, an investigation found that Halliburton charged American \ntaxpayers $2.64 per gallon for gasoline shipped into Iraq, which was \ndouble the price other suppliers were charging. That gasoline was then \nsold to Iraqis for as little as 5 cents per gallon.\n  Recently, the reports of waste, fraud, and abuse have literally been \npiling up. This week, we learned Halliburton charged taxpayers $10,000 \nper day to house its employees in Kuwait's five-star Kempinski Hotel. \nThe same employees could have stayed in air-conditioned tents like \nthose used by American troops for $600 a day. The company purchased \nembroidered towels that cost three times that of standard towels. One \nemployee discovered that Halliburton was charging for 37,200 cases of \nsoda every month even though they were only providing 37,200 cans. In \neffect, Halliburton was charging the remarkable price of $45 for each \n30-can case of soda for which supermarkets charge about $7. When the \nemployee began making progress in reducing Halliburton's overcharges in \nthis and other areas, she was taken off the accounts.\n  Most troubling, a former Halliburton truck convoy commander disclosed \nthat Halliburton removed all the spare tires from its brand-new $85,000 \ntrucks. When the tires went flat, the trucks were abandoned or torched. \nIn addition, there seemed to be near total disregard of maintenance on \ntrucks.\n  ``There were absolutely no oil filters or fuel filters for months on \nend. I begged for filters, but never got any,'' the convoy commander \nsaid. ``I was told that oil changes were `out of the question.' ''\n  The convoy commander also indicated that convoys of empty trucks \noften were sent out. He said Halliburton ``would run trucks empty quite \noften.\n  Sometimes they would have five empty trucks, sometimes they would \nhave a dozen. One time we ran 28 trucks, and only one had anything on \nit.''\n  Well, whatever they are putting on the trucks, one thing is clear: \nThe American taxpayer is being taken for a ride.\n  When other Halliburton employees reported similar examples of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, they were told, ``Don't worry about it. It's a cost \nplus contract.'' ``Cost plus,'' evidently, is jargon for war \nprofiteering.\n  Despite these abuses, none of the Senate committees controlled by the \nRepublican majority have investigated Halliburton's activities in Iraq \nor indicated that they intend to look into this matter.\n  Such scrutiny, we are told, could jeopardize the rebuilding efforts.\n  This attitude could not be more misguided. The danger in our \nrebuilding of Iraq is that the American people will lose faith in this \neffort because they feel it is too expensive or that they are being \ncheated.\n  There is one way to guarantee that the American taxpayer is not being \ncheated: that is, for Congress to step up to its constitutional \nobligations to oversee the actions of the executive branch of \ngovernment.\n  Sunlight, it's been said, is the best disinfectant. But for too long, \nthe administration has been able to keep Congress and the American \npeople in the dark.\n  Medicare and Halliburton represent only the tip of the iceberg.\n  Still more major allegations of misconduct, such as the outing of the \nidentity of a covert CIA agent for political gain, have been ignored.\n  And other serious matters, such as the manipulation of intelligence \nabout Iraq, have received only fitful attention.\n  This is fundamentally wrong. Our constitutional oversight \nresponsibilities should not be driven by political expediency.\n  Regardless of the party affiliation of the President, there are some \nmatters that are too important to be ignored.\n  The American people are looking to us to provide leadership.\n  If no wrongdoing has been committed, let our investigations reaffirm \npeople's faith in the government's credibility.\n  But if there has been wrongdoing, the American taxpayer has a right \nto see that those responsible are held accountable.\n  Ensuring accountability is one of the roles the Framers set out for \nus.

Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form in relation to the \nLevin missile defense amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to strongly \noppose the Levin amendment. This amendment would realign critical funds \nfor the ground-based midcourse interceptors. The consequences of that \ndecision, in my judgment, would be devastating. By reallocating those \nfunds, Congress would effectively cripple the deployment and testing of \nthe interceptors in Alaska. Let me hasten to add, that decision to go \nto Alaska with these interceptors was not a political decision. It was \nmade by the scientists. But I support that decision, and I believe \nAlaskans do also.\n  Ballistic missiles are a serious threat to the United States, and our \ninterests, forces, and allies throughout the world are threatened by \nthem. The missiles our enemies possess are growing in range, \nreliability, accuracy, and number. A missile carrying nuclear, \nbiological, or chemical weapons could inflict damage that would make \nthe tragedy our country experienced on September 11 pale by comparison.\n  We cannot afford to ignore this threat. We must confront it, if we \nwant to address the challenges that characterize our Nation's new \nsecurity environment. The new security challenges of the 21st century \nrequire us to think and act differently.\n  With that in mind, the decision was made to field the ground-based \nmidcourse system in Alaska. Alaska's location gives us a strategic \nadvantage. Interceptors launched from Alaska will be capable of \nprotecting all 50 States. If Congress rejects Senator Levin's amendment \nand remains committed to the ground-based midcourse program, the United \nStates will be able to meet any potential threat from a rogue nation or \nterrorist group.\n  The Fort Greely interceptors are the centerpiece of our integrated, \nlayered, national missile defense system. The funding contained in the \n2005 budget is a downpayment on additional interceptors that will \nenable us to conduct additional flight testing and maintain industrial \nbase production lines for key components of the ground-based system. \nSenator Levin's amendment cuts this funding.\n  The amendment also disregards what years of experience have shown--\nthat it is wise to move into a deployment phase before the testing \nphase of a program has been completed. I remind Congress of the gulf \nwar, when we fielded a number of systems that were under development at \nthat time, including JSTARS. I personally witnessed that test in the \ndeployment phase, in the testing phase, and early deployment of JSTARS \nin the gulf war. The Patriot missile was also tested in this way.\n  Over many years we enhanced the Patriot batteries that first saw \naction by 1991, by implementing a follow-on enhancement program and \nreplacing the original missile with a completely new interceptor.\n  Similarly, the B-52 bomber that first flew in 1952 is hardly the same \naircraft that dropped the bombs over Afghanistan in the war against \nterror. The original B-52 gave us early intercontinental bombardment \ncapability, and it was enhanced over time with hardware and software \nimprovements that helped us meet evolving operational challenges. These \nexamples are reminders that a requirement written into a system's \ndevelopment phase can quickly become irrelevant or yield a dead end. \nThat is a lesson we must keep in the forefront of our minds as we \nconfront today's dynamic security environment.\n  The time to move forward with the deployment of a ground-based \nmidcourse operational capability is now. We must continue to improve \nthe system. It must be allowed to evolve over time and take advantage \nof the breakthroughs in technology as they occur. Congress should \nfollow the proven wisdom of experience and resist the urge to build to \nperfection a national security strategy that has never served us well.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment would have us do--turn our backs \non the proven wisdom of experience and wait until there is a tragedy to \nconfront the national security threats we know are emerging now.\n  I urge the Senate to support the ground-based midcourse system and \noppose Senator Levin's amendment.\n  Again, this system has been deployed in my State already in the test \nphase. We should continue that concept.\n  I yield back any time I have not used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 25 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Michigan has 30 minutes remaining. \nWho yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment which I am offering does not \ntouch the first 20 interceptors. They are fully funded. They are going \nto be deployed before they are independently tested. The Senate decided \nthat last week in a number of debates and in a vote on an amendment, \nthe Boxer amendment. Whether it was the right decision or the wrong \ndecision, time will tell, but nonetheless it is the decision and was \nthe decision of this Senate that those 20 interceptors be deployed in \nthose silos in Alaska prior to their being independently tested.\n  The question before us now is whether the added missiles--21 through \n30, those interceptors that are paid for in this bill--are going to be \nprovided or whether we will use that money, $515 million, for a much \ngreater need, to address a much more immediate threat, and that is the \nthreat of loose nukes, the threat of nuclear fissile material\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nfalling into the hands of terrorists, and also whether we will use at \nleast some of that money to put more into the security of our borders, \nthe security of our ports.\n  I will start with a CIA assessment that was made not too many years \nago. It was made after September 11. There was an unclassified \nassessment made by the CIA as to what our greatest threat was. They \nwere comparing the missile threat to the nonmissile threat. ``Foreign \nMissile Developments and Ballistic Missile Threats Through 2015,'' was \nthe title. They were looking at the missile threat. Here is the \njudgment:\n\n       The Intelligence Community judges that U.S. territories are \n     more likely to be attacked with WMD using non-missile means, \n     primarily because such means, 1, are less expensive than \n     developing and producing ICBMs; 2, can be covertly developed \n     and employed; 3, the source of the weapon could be masked in \n     an attempt to evade retaliation; 4, probably would be more \n     reliable than ICBMs that have not completed rigorous testing \n     and validation programs; 5, probably would be much more \n     accurate than emerging ICBMs over the next 15 years; 6, \n     probably would be more effective for disseminating a \n     biological warfare agent than a ballistic missile; 7, would \n     avoid missile defenses. For all of those reasons, we have an \n     assessment that non-missile means of delivery are a more \n     serious threat than a missile means of delivery.\n\n  Now, the amendment I offered does not touch those 20 missiles that \nwere part of that test bed announced last year. Last year, the chairman \nof our committee, Senator Warner, said this body is authorized in \nmoving ahead on 20 test bed sites, 16 in Alaska and the balance in \nCalifornia. That was the decision that we made last year--a 20-silo \ntest bed site in Alaska and in California.\n  Now, this year, the administration said they want additional \ninterceptors. It is those additional interceptors on which we are \nfocusing.\n  My amendment would take $515 million of the $1.7 billion proposed for \nfiscal year 2005 and say let's put that $515 million into far more \nneeded, immediate purposes; in other words, to try to address this \nmassive fissile material threat, the loose nuke threat, the dirty bomb \nthreat, which everybody says is the most serious terrorist threat we \nface.\n  That is what this $515 million should be spent on; also, security of \nour borders, security of our ports. Most of the containers coming into \nthis country are still uninspected.\n  We still do not have a means of determining what is an explosive \nmaterial at a distance. We must, if we are going to stop terrorists \nfrom blowing up themselves and us, be able to identify explosive \nmaterial at a distance. We don't have that technology. My amendment \nwould add money for that technology.\n  We had the near destruction of the USS Cole because a tiny boat was \nable to get next to it. If we could identify that explosive material at \na distance before the explosion of the car bomb or the suicide bomb or \nthe little boat that almost blew up the USS Cole, we would be making \nourselves far more secure. That is the kind of expenditure my amendment \nwould provide. It leaves, I emphasize, $1.2 billion in funding for \ninterceptors, which is more than we have provided in any prior fiscal \nyear. In 2002, we provided $1.1 billion. In fiscal year 2003, we \nprovided $763 million. In 2004, we provided $1.1 billion for \ninterceptors.\n\n  If my amendment is adopted and we use this money to address the loose \nnuke issue and the other issues I have identified, we would still have \n$1.2 billion for interceptors. Now, would there be an effect on \ntesting? No, for two reasons. No. 1, there is no effect of this \namendment on the funding for interceptors which are dedicated to flight \ntests. The only interceptors affected by this amendment are the \ndeployed interceptors, 21 through 30. Those interceptors are not \nplanned for flight testing.\n  We were told last night, many of you folks say you want testing, but \nthen you cut interceptors that are going to be used for testing. Let me \nemphasize that none of the interceptors that we cut are going to be \nused for flight testing; they are not going to be launched. They are \ngoing to sit in those silos. They will not be launched. We just \nreceived that word, again, from the missile defense folks.\n  We asked them: Is it still your plan not to launch those interceptors \nfrom the silos in Alaska?\n  Their answer is: That is correct. That is not our plan for testing. \nWe are not going to launch those interceptors. The interceptors used \nfor testing will be used somewhere else. They are not going to be part \nof this test bed. We are not cutting those three test interceptor \nmissiles that are going to be used for testing.\n  When we are all done, if this amendment is adopted, there would still \nbe more spent on missile defense than on any weapons system in the \nhistory of this country in any single year. So the idea that somehow or \nother this is a devastating blow to missile defense is simply not \ncorrect. It is 5 percent of the missile defense budget request for this \nyear. It is less than one-third of the interceptors, and none of the \ntest interceptors. These are the extra missiles that were not asked for \nlast year when we were assured by Senator Warner that the test bed was \nfor 20 silos in Alaska, mainly, and 4 in California.\n  Now, we talk about the greatest threats that we face. It seems to me \nthat it is almost a consensus that the greatest threats we face come \nfrom the loose nukes. As a matter of fact, this body just adopted a \nDomenici-Feinstein amendment, and that amendment said we ought to fund \nwhat is called the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, which has \nrecently been announced by Secretary Abraham.\n  Secretary Abraham, with great fanfare, announced the $450 million \nGlobal Threat Reduction Initiative on May 26. That is just a month \nago--not even a month ago. Speaking to the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, Secretary Abraham said that this new effort, the $450 million \nGlobal Threat Reduction Initiative, aimed at the loose nukes, aimed at \nthis fissile material that is distributed around the world--any few \nkilograms or pounds of which fell into the hands of a terrorist could \nblow up a city--this new effort, according to Secretary Abraham will \n``comprehensively and more thoroughly address the challenges posed by \nnuclear and radiological materials and related equipment that require \nattention anywhere in the world, by ensuring that they will not fall \ninto the hands of those with evil intentions.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the initiative was to secure, \nconsolidate, destroy, or return to the United States and Russia nuclear \nmaterials from around the world, concentrating on the least secure and \nthe most dangerous materials first. Secretary Abraham committed the \nUnited States to dedicate more than $450 million to this effort. Well, \nthere is no money in the 2005 budget for the effort.\n  The words are there, the commitment is there, Lord knows the threat \nis there, but the money is not there. So in our bill, Senators \nDomenici, Feinstein, and others--and I was a cosponsor--offered an \namendment which authorized this new initiative about which Senator \nDomenici said the following:\n\n       Many of us have worked very hard to put together a program \n     where we and other nations will go to work at ridding the \n     world of proliferation of nuclear products from the nuclear \n     age. We think it is an exciting approach. Eventually, we have \n     to fund it and Presidents have to implement it. But the \n     Senate would be saying today it is good policy to get the \n     world concerned about getting rid of radioactive material \n     from the nuclear age.\n\n  This amendment today does what Senators Domenici and Feinstein said \nand this Senate said when we adopted their amendment, which is to fund \nthe initiative. Not just to talk about it, not just to say words which \nare important, but to actually put dollars behind the words.\n  As Senator Domenici said in offering the amendment, which we adopted, \nwhich added this provision in this bill which authorized the Global \nThreat Reduction Initiative, this amendment:\n\n       [I]s aimed--\n\n  As his amendment was and is--\n\n     at expediting global cleanout of nuclear materials and \n     equipment that could represent proliferation risks.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Even though we are making progress, the focus on terrorism \n     over the last few years has substantially amplified the level \n     of our concern. In the process, we have learned more about \n     the complicated routes through which important equipment \n     technologies, such as enrichment capabilities, has moved to \n     unfortunate destinations.\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\n       Our focus on Russia was appropriate a decade ago. But it is \n     very clear today that proliferation must be viewed as a \n     global problem. We must broaden our programs so that they \n     have a global impact, not only focused on the former Soviet \n     Union.\n       The increased threat of terrorism should encourage us to \n     seek new ways to expedite the management, security, and \n     disposition of materials that could be dangerous to our \n     national security if they were to fall into the wrong hands. \n     These materials include a range of fissile materials, with \n     highly enriched uranium and plutonium being the ones of \n     greatest concern.\n\n  My amendment today would ensure that this real and immediate threat \nto our security is funded, that the money is there.\n  The money is being transferred from these extra missiles, missiles \nwhich have not been tested. If we decide we are going to proceed to \ndeploy 20 untested missiles, so be it, but 21 through 30, not discussed \nlast year when the test bed of the of 20 was described, but added this \nyear, those additional missiles do not come close to being as important \nto our security as trying to help get rid of fissile and nuclear \nmaterial that can fall into the hands of terrorists.\n  Secretary Abraham said, and the words were good:\n\n       We will take these steps because we must. The circumstances \n     of a dangerous world have thrust this responsibility on the \n     shoulders of the civilized world. We don't have the luxury of \n     sitting back and not taking action.\n\n  We do not have that luxury, Mr. President. We do not have the luxury \nof not addressing that new global initiative that Secretary Abraham and \nthe administration said was so important. We have a responsibility to \nlook at how we allocate resources and to weigh the greater risks with \nthe available resources.\n  It seems so obvious to me that when we compare what is provided in an \nadditional 10 missiles, not tested and not to be used as part of a \ntest--we do not touch any test missiles. We do not touch the 20 \nmissiles in the test bed in Alaska and California. When we compare the \nfunding of $515 million for those additional 10 missiles, those extra \n10 missiles not in the 20 silo test bed, with the critical need to \nobtain this fissile material and to secure it around the world before \nit falls into the hands of terrorists, it seems to me that the outcome \nshould be very clear. We should put that $515 million into securing \nthat material, to obtaining that material, to securing our ports, and \nto doing some of the other homeland defense needs that are provided for \nin my amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 5 additional minutes. \nHe has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan reserves the \nremainder of his time. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I rise to strongly oppose the Levin amendment. Senator Levin proposes \nto cut $515 million from missile defense and shift funds to a variety \nof homeland security and counterterrorism provisions. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment on a number of grounds.\n  First, it makes a false distinction between missile defense and \nhomeland security. Missile defense is quintessentially homeland \nsecurity. That is right, missile defense is homeland security. It \nprotects our homeland from long-range missiles and the most destructive \nweapons on the planet.\n  Second, it makes a false distinction between missile defense and \ncounterterror. Throughout the cold war, we were concerned with the \nbalance of terror. Rogue nations with missiles and weapons of mass \ndestruction will use those missiles and weapons to threaten and \nterrorize the United States, our allies, and our friends.\n  Third, it would do serious harm to the Missile Defense Program. The \n$515 million cut in the Levin amendment is for the next 10 ground-based \nmidcourse defense interceptors. Cutting these funds would break the \nproduction line for these missiles. It would cause the loss of key \npersonnel, expertise, subcontractors, and suppliers, and then they \nwould have to start all over again, with lead-in delays and extra costs \nto the program.\n  The Missile Defense Agency would have to reconstitute the production, \nrequalify and recertify subcontractors and suppliers, and it would have \nto restart production. Losing these funds for a year could result in a \nlong delay in fielding the next 10 interceptors--between 2 and 3 \nyears after we would have fielded them, I am told--and result in \nrestart costs of nearly $300 million.\n\n  Those who oppose missile defense obviously would like to delay. That \nis what we have been arguing over the last few days. They would like to \nadd costs and then come back and say how this program is not proceeding \nthe way it should. This is an essential program. We should not have \ndelays. We should do everything we possibly can to cut down unnecessary \ncosts because of time delays.\n  Fourth, it would do serious harm to the defense of the Nation against \nlong-range missile threats. The Missile Defense Agency's assessment is \nthat delaying the next 10 interceptors would leave us critically short \nof assets in the 2007 timeframe to defend against known and potential \nthreats.\n  We cannot talk about all the information that is available that \ninforms Senators and how that judgment comes about, but it is available \nto all Senators, and if they have any questions about that, I urge them \nto get that information and review it.\n  And fifth, this amendment is inconsistent with national policy \nestablished in legislation and signed into law by President Clinton. \nThe National Missile Defense Act of 1999 established a national policy \nto deploy a national missile defense as soon as technologically \nfeasible. It is feasible, and these additional interceptors are \nimportant to that effort. The Senate approved that act by a vote of 97 \nto 3, I remind Members of the Senate.\n  Furthermore, this amendment would move the funds to accounts that are \nalready well funded. Again, I remind my colleagues in the Senate, this \nmissile defense is homeland security.\n  I want to talk a little bit about these funds. For example, the \nPresident's budget includes $47.4 billion for homeland security \nactivities, not including ballistic missile defense throughout the \nGovernment, an increase of $6.1 billion, or 15 percent, compared to \nlast year, a $26.8 billion increase to fiscal year 2002.\n  Being on the Budget Committee, I had an opportunity to do a \ncomparison. Homeland security is getting far more percentage increase \nthan any other agency the President proposed in his budget. Now we are \npiling in on top of that.\n  Funding for the Department's activities to counter terrorism has more \nthan doubled in 3 years to $10.2 billion. Of that amount, the \nPresident's budget request included $8 billion in DOD programs for \nhomeland defense. The committee's mark added more than $300 million \nabove the budget request.\n  All of the programs for which Senator Levin proposes to add funds in \nhis amendment were funded either at or above the amount of the \nPresident's budget request. Many of the recommendations for increased \nfunding in this measure are simply flawed.\n  For example, one of the first items recommends an increase of $50 \nmillion in Air Force research and development to be allocated to NORAD \nfor low altitude threat detection and response technology. This item \nappears to be directed at cruise missile defense, but it is not clearly \nenough defined to know how the proposed funding increase would be used. \nA $50 million increase for ill-defined purposes would not be \nexecutable.\n  I note that the proposal was apparently justified on the basis that \nthe NORTHCOM integrated priority list includes cruise missile defense. \nThis proposed amendment also reduces one of the highest NORTHCOM \npriorities on its list--that is ballistic missile defense--by $515 \nmillion, again reminding the Members of the Senate that missile defense \nis homeland security.\n  Finally, I have a letter that was sent to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee from Admiral Ellis, commander of the Strategic \nCommand at Omaha, NE, the head military integrator for missile defense, \nwho expresses his opposition to any cuts to missile defense funding. I \nwill read this letter for the benefit of my colleagues.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\n       I am writing to express concern about possible efforts to \n     cut funding from the President's FY05 budget request for \n     continued fielding of missile defense capabilities, including \n     additional Ground-based Interceptors. As the operational lead \n     for Global Missile Defense, USSSTRATCOM supports the \n     continued appropriate development of missile defense \n     capabilities that will be incrementally fielded and improved \n     under the evolutionary approach of Concurrent Test and \n     Operations. It is especially important to our early success \n     that we have funding support for the production of ground-\n     based interceptors at a rate and quantity sufficient to \n     sustain the evolutionary developmental approach, testing \n     milestones, and our initial defense operational capabilities.\n       A reduction of interceptor funding would: (1) limit the \n     capability and capacity of the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     System to defend the U.S. against long-range missile attack, \n     and (2) limit the opportunity to gain operational test \n     experience as it will reduce the number of interceptors \n     available to replace deployed interceptors subsequently used \n     in operational testing.\n\n  He goes on to say he further appreciates the chairman's support to \nboth develop and provide the Nation with a rudimentary missile defense \ncapability and indicated that this letter was also forwarded to the \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. So the sponsor \nof this amendment has seen this letter, which is from an individual \nwhom I have had before my committee and somebody whom I highly respect. \nSo there we have it, somebody who is part of STRATCOM giving us a clear \nreason for why we need to have those additional missiles.\n\n  In response to what the sponsor of the amendment said about whether \nall the missiles are going to be used, that was addressed in a full \ncommittee hearing on March 9 in which Senator Levin himself, the \nsponsor of the amendment, asked General Kadish, after he commented \nabout the fact that the missiles would work: How many of the Fort \nGreeley ones would be launched?\n  General Kadish answered--and this is not new evidence or new facts \nthat have been brought before the Armed Services Committee or even \nbefore the full Senate. General Kadish said: Eventually, all of them.\n  That response was further pursued by my colleague on the Armed \nServices Committee, who asked: They would be moved somewhere else, is \nthat it?\n  General Kadish said: No. Well, they may--this is part of the ongoing \nplanning. That is why we all get frustrated from time to time when we \nchange our plans.\n  The current plan is to use all of those out at Fort Greeley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield myself an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object, will the Chair advise both sides as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining now on the \nside of the Senator from Virginia and 14 minutes remaining on the side \nof the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will respond to the concerns that were raised by the \nsponsor of the amendment about what he referred to as ``loose nukes,'' \nand from that same report which he quoted, I would point out that in \nthe report it says the probability that a weapons of mass destruction \narmed missile will be used against U.S. forces or interests is higher \ntoday than during most of the cold war.\n  This is a real threat, and we should not be saying we have a higher \npriority on homeland defense or a higher priority on missiles. The fact \nis we are vulnerable in all areas. We need to address that, and we have \nbeen adequately addressing it with our funding for homeland security. \nNow we need to take care of missile defense and make sure we have \nadequately taken care of the threat with weapons of mass destruction \nthrough missiles that might be launched.\n  In response to a hearing we had earlier on the need for a missile \ndefense test bed, I will share with my colleagues some testimony by \nAdmiral Ellis, who is the commander of STRATCOM. I asked Admiral Ellis: \nDo you support the use of the missile defense test bed to provide \nlimited operational capability, yes or no?\n  Admiral Ellis replies: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\n  Then I asked him a further question: Does such a capability \ncontribute to deterrence?\n  Admiral Ellis says: Absolutely.\n  Then I responded back: Does such a capability provide a useful \nstrategic option?\n  Admiral Ellis says: Yes, it does.\n  Then I further questioned: Does such a capability raise the nuclear \nthreshold?\n  Admiral Ellis says: It certainly does.\n  The fourth point I would like to talk about is the funding of the \nnonproliferation initiative. The biggest portion of Senator Levin's \nproposal adds $211 million for a new nonproliferation initiative in the \nDepartment of Energy, but DOE cannot spend the funding it has already \nfor nonproliferation. Right now, DOE has $735 million in unobligated \nbalances for nonproliferation programs, and Senator Levin's amendment \nwould push that total up to nearly a billion dollars.\n  In summary, we are on the right track. The Armed Services Committee \nhas received testimony both in my subcommittee as well as in the full \ncommittee and the testimony indicates we have a real need in missile \ndefense and we are taking care of homeland security. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama seeks recognition.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, for his leadership. I \nsupport his position on this issue that is before us today, as well as \nthat of Senator Allard who chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of \nthe Armed Services Committee where this matter is dealt with in \ndepth. Both these Senators have worked on this issue for quite some \ntime and have given it serious consideration. I believe they are \ncorrect. Indeed, I believe the Levin amendment runs counter to the \npolicy of this Senate that has been established for some time. It is, I \nbelieve, now the fourth amendment of its kind, designed to erode the \nsupport and commitment we made to deploying a national missile defense \nsystem.\n\n  A number of years ago, in 1998 or so, this Senate in a bipartisan way \nadopted the Cochran-Lieberman amendment that declared it was the policy \nof the U.S. Congress that we should deploy a national missile defense \nsystem as soon as practical--not develop one, not research one, but to \ndeploy it as soon as possible. That passed, I believe, with about 90-\nplus votes in the Senate and was signed by President Clinton. It \nrepresents the policy and commitment of the United States.\n  Over the years, we have moved toward that goal. We were told it could \nnot be done. We were told a missile could not hit a missile in the air. \nWe were told, yes, there may be a threat out there, but it probably is \nnot very real, and even if it is you can't make the technology work. \nThis is Star Wars. It goes back to some degree to the ridicule that was \ndirected toward former President Reagan for his steadfast belief that \nthis country needed to move from just trying to see how many missiles \nwe can aim at our enemies, see how much threat we can focus on them, to \nthe concept he believed was more peaceful, which would be to develop a \nsystem that would allow us to defend ourselves against attack. That is \nwhat we voted on, and we voted on it virtually unanimously. I think 90 \npercent plus of the Senators in this body voted for that amendment.\n  That is where we are today. Now we have here at the last minute, as \nthis bill moves forward, one more attempt to drawdown money and to \nspend it on other things. Yes, there are a lot of needs in this \ncountry. You can go to education, you can go to health care, you can go \nto homeland security, you can go to a lot of things we believe we need \ndesperately in America, but we are here to make choices. We made a \ncommitment and a choice to field a national missile defense system.\n  I will point out that a lot of Americans probably do not know this \nsystem is working. The science is being proven\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\nday after day. In fact, in September we will be placing in the ground \nin Alaska a national missile defense system that can help protect us \nfrom missile attack--not just from North Korea, but from an accidental \nlaunch. They could be effective in protecting this country, and as we \ngo forward we will continue to improve this system.\n  As you test and develop this system, spiraling as we are doing now, \nthen we may find we can develop a better radar system, we can develop a \nsystem that can be deployed on ships more effectively than what we have \ntoday. We may be able to develop a local land-based system. We may \nimprove our computer system. We may be able to improve our guidance \nsystems. We may be able to improve our ability to defeat even the most \nsophisticated attempts to confuse a national missile defense system. \nBut it does not have to be perfect before we put it into place today. I \nsay we are going to continue to do that.\n  I believe we are committed to going forward with this. It would be a \nterrible mistake to cut $515 million from a system that is on track now \nto be effective and to be deployed. This will shut down the assembly \nlines. This will shut down the production that is ongoing. It is going \nto cost us much more money in the long run. It is not going to be good \nfor our productive system. It is the kind of on-again, off-again \npolitical management of the production and deployment of systems that \nis not healthy for our Defense Department.\n\n  I see my time has expired. I thank the chairman for his leadership. I \nalso oppose the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Virginia has 5 minutes 5 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague from Alabama. He has \nbeen in the forefront of this debate for all the years he has been a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee.\n  At this time, I think it would be fair we allow the distinguished \nproponent of the amendment to speak for a bit. Then I will follow, and \nI presume he would like to do a few minutes' wrap-up; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That will be great. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I will yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the threat we are talking about addressing in my \namendment is not one of our domestic priorities. As important as those \npriorities are, it is not transferring money from missile defense to \neducation or health care. It is transferring money from the next 10 \nmissiles, untested, numbers 21 through 30, which were not stated to be \npart of that 20-silo test bed which was presented to us last year, \ninstead taking that money and using that money not for my project but \nfor the administration's stated project of trying to address the \n``loose nuke'' issue.\n  This is a program, this $450 million program, the administration \nannounced a few weeks ago in Vienna. With great fanfare, Secretary \nAbraham said we have to address the loose nuke problem around the \nworld. Agreements were signed to counter a nuclear threat; $450 million \nto prevent research materials going to terrorists as part of a global \ncleanup plan.\n  But there is no money in this program. So the Senate comes along a \nfew days ago, and Senator Domenici and Senator Feinstein, with the \nsupport, I believe, of most of us--surely mine--say we have to move in \nthis direction. They authorize the program. But still no money. The \nwords are there, but the money is not there.\n  We are talking about the money for a global program, not cleanup in \nRussia. That money has already been identified. This is for nuclear \nmaterial around the world that we and the Russians have to identify and \nsecure. That is what that $450 million is. There is not a penny in this \nbudget to secure that nuclear material.\n\n  The Russia task force of the Secretary of Energy said that the most \nurgent unmet security threat to the United States is the danger that \nweapons of mass destruction or weapons-usable material could be sold to \nterrorists and used against us. That was the so-called Baker-Cutler \ntask force. Then they said the funding that is provided in the \nDepartment of Energy budget falls short of what is required to \nadequately address the threat.\n  We had the Harvard task force come forward and say the facts are that \nthe amount of inadequately secured bomb material in the world today is \nenough to make thousands of nuclear weapons, that terrorists are \nactively seeking to get it, and that with such material in hand a \ncapable and well-organized terrorist group plausibly could make, \ndeliver, and detonate at least a crude nuclear bomb capable of \nincinerating the heart of any major city in the world. Securing the \nvast stockpiles of nuclear materials and weapons around the world is an \nessential priority for nonproliferation, for counterterrorism, and for \nhomeland security. That is the issue we have to face. Are we going to \nfund this kind of program, or are we just going to talk about it?\n  The hundreds of millions of dollars which were identified by Senator \nAllard have nothing to do with this effort to secure nuclear material \naround the world. The money he identified has to do with a program to \ntry to secure plutonium between ourselves and Russia, a program which \nis currently stalemated. That is something which hopefully can be \nworked out between the Russians and the State Department. But the money \nwe are talking about which was so widely proclaimed by Secretary \nAbraham as being forthcoming has not been forthcoming. There is no \nmoney in the budget for it.\n  It is the loose nuke material that exists around the world that \nthreatens us more than any other single threat, and we don't have any \nmoney for it in here. The question is whether we are going to do it or \nwhether we are going to add another 10 interceptors, numbers 21 through \n30, add them to the test bed. That is the issue we face. Which is a \nhigher priority for us? Again, I emphasize this amendment does not \ntouch those 20 interceptors which are part of that test bed. We do not \ntouch that. That debate was last week. That is not this amendment.\n\n  Last week, we decided we are going to deploy those interceptors. Even \nthough they have not been independently tested, they will still be \ndeployed. Maybe they will work, maybe they will not work, but they will \nbe deployed. OK, that decision was made.\n  We are talking now about Nos. 21 through 30 and whether that $550 \nmillion is better spent the way it is proposed in this budget, or to \naddress the loose nuke problem around the world, to address our border \nsecurity, to try to inspect the containers by the tens of thousands \nthat come into this country, to put additional funds into new \ntechnologies to address how we can identify explosive material at a \ndistance so we do not face a blowup of a ship like the USS Cole, a car \nbomber, or a suicide bomber. That is the issue, whether we are serious \nabout the effort to address the greatest terrorist threats we face or \nwhether we want to put another $500 million into another 10 \ninterceptors which have not yet been tested.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes. The time \nremaining on the Senator's side is 7 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our colleagues, I think the \nSenator and I can agree on this point that there is no vote on this \ncurrent 2005 authorization bill of greater significance than the vote \nwe will take momentarily.\n  I frame this vote as follows: The whole of America watched within the \npast few days the September 11 Commission, its Chairman, face the \ncameras and say, in response to the astonishment of the American people \nabout the tragic events of September 11, we didn't foresee it, we \ndidn't plan for it, we didn't fund for it, we didn't train for it, and \nit happened.\n  I say respectfully to my colleagues, that is precisely what this vote \nis all about.\n  The Senator laid down the priorities of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. I have them before me. I should repeat this one. They say the \npossibility that a WMD armed missile will be used\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\nagainst the U.S. forces or interests is higher today than during most \nof the cold-war period.\n  Senator Levin and I have been partners for 25 years on this \ncommittee. We went through the cold-war era together. That is an \nastonishingly high expectation. True, the CIA put somewhat greater \nemphasis on a number of the programs that will be funded should the \nSenator's amendment pass, but the Senator would acknowledge to me, I \nthink, that the administration, in sending forth this budget, covered \nthose 10 programs. Six of those programs receive more money than asked \nfor in the budget, and the remaining four programs were funded at the \nbudget level.\n  He points out a most recent program raised by the Secretary of \nEnergy. I share his concern, but the Secretary of Energy said that can \nbe financed through reprogramming, which is a procedure we follow \nregularly.\n\n  In summary, we are at the crossroads momentarily of whether the \nMissile Defense Program that this Nation has been working on for these \nmany years, that has been acted upon by the Congress in successive \nsessions, will continue.\n  While the Senator said we are not dislodging what has been done by \nthe past Congress, I ask, why we should even go forward with those \nexpenses if we are going to stop the program and gap it, gap it for an \nindeterminate period? Should we be able to put it together again after \nseveral years, at a minimum, who can assure the technical workforce \nthat put together the first missiles will be there? Who can say the \ncontractor wants to pick up, once again, the burden of trying to \nrestart a program, given the background of the stop/start by the \nCongress if this Levin amendment is adopted?\n  This amendment will spread uncertainty into this program. The world \nwill begin to say: America is not serious about missile defense.\n  Much of the technology of these programs for missile defense could \nwell be used in future years by other nations that will recognize their \nvulnerability to the missiles. When we say ``vulnerability,'' it is not \nnecessarily limited to an aggressor firing, it could be an accidental \nfiring. That has happened. I need only point out the tragic submarine \nexperience. Both Russia and the United States have experienced errors \nwith those magnificent platforms, causing death and destruction. \nAccidents happen even with the best of intent with military equipment.\n  We see China coming on, we see North Korea. I think there is no \ndispute as to their potential today.\n  We must look at ourselves and go back to that refrain of Lee \nHamilton: We didn't plan, we didn't foresee, we didn't train, and it \nhappened. A future generation of America can look on this Senate at \nthis very moment and would have to see, henceforth, if this Nation ever \nexperiences the type of attack to which the Central Intelligence Agency \nsays we are vulnerable.\n  I urge Members to stay the course and not send a signal that America \nhas stumbled backward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we should stay the course. We have to \naddress the threats that we know are the major threats. We are not \ndoing that. The loose nuke threat in this world is the No. 1 threat \nagainst us. That is what we all believe.\n  Yet a $450 million program to address those loose nukes is not funded \nin this budget. There is not a dollar for that program in this budget. \nWe are told now that the Department of Energy will reprogram $450 \nmillion. I would like to see that request come in from the Department \nof Energy. But we do not have that request, either.\n  What we do have, what we do know, is that the major threat we face is \nthe loose nuke threat. That is what the experts at the Department of \nEnergy tell us. We surely have to address the less likely threats. I \ncould not agree with that more. We should address threats that are not \nas likely.\n  But, my heavens, to put nothing in this budget when we have adopted \nthe Domenici-Feinstein amendment which says we will have this global \nprogram--there is no money authorized behind it in this budget. We have \nadopted the Domenici amendment. Senator Domenici is exactly right. This \nis the greatest threat we face, loose nukes. Loose nukes globally are \nthe greatest threat we face. What he said is someday we have to put the \nfunds behind it. That someday is now. We have to compare that threat \nwhich we all believe is the most certain threat against the less likely \nthreat identified by the CIA, which is a missile attack.\n  Now it has been suggested that maybe we should then totally disband \nthe missile defense we have in Alaska. That is not what this amendment \nis about. I want to emphasize that because it has been \nmischaracterized. This does not end missile defense in Alaska. Quite \nthe opposite, it continues the funding for those first 20 missiles.\n  My dear friend from Virginia said last year that test bed is 20 \nmissiles in Alaska. He asked Senator Boxer a few days ago whether this \nbody last year ``authorized moving ahead on 20 test bed sites, 16 in \nAlaska and the balance in [California].'' And Senator Boxer said: \n``Yes.'' That is what we decided last year. It would be a 20-silo test \nbed site.\n  We do not disturb that in any way. We leave more money in this budget \nafter the $500 million is put into ``loose nukes.'' We leave more money \nin there for interceptors than has been in any fiscal year budget. Mr. \nPresident, $1.2 billion is left in the budget this year after my $500 \nmillion subtraction. That is more than was there in 2004, 2003, 2002. \nAny of those years had less money for interceptors.\n  So the idea that somehow or other we are destroying a missile defense \nsystem--when we leave that test bed in Alaska the way it is, we leave \nthe funding for it exactly the way it is, with 20 silos, the way it was \nstated to be last year, but what we are saying is: Do not add another \n10. Do not add another 10 interceptors, not independently tested. We \nhave been through that argument, but they are not tested missiles.\n  The money that goes into those 10 missiles can be used for a much \ngreater threat, not just the ``loose nuke'' threat, but the threats \nthat have been identified by NORAD and by the Northern Command. There \nare many unfunded needs we have listed from NORAD, including low-\naltitude threat detection and response technologies.\n  This is another one from the Navy which we fund. Let me read this \nbecause it goes right to the USS Cole issue. They have an unfunded \nprogram that would procure ``mobile and shore Explosive Ordnance \nDisposal detachments to fill gap in required capability to detect \nchemical, biological, and explosive hazards during Improvised Explosive \nDevice/Weapons Mass Destruction and Force Protection responses.'' So \nthe Navy says they have an unfunded program need of $21 million to try \nto identify explosives at a distance.\n  We all know--surely the chairman of our committee knows--what \nhappened with the USS Cole. If we could have identified those little \nboats carrying explosives at a distance, we would not have had the \ndamage and loss of life we had on the USS Cole.\n  So we have these real needs we would fund in my amendment. We have to \ncompare that to the extra 10 interceptors, Nos. 21 through 30, that do \nnot touch that 20-silo test bed in Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of documents be \nprinted in the Record. One would be the NORAD statement relative to \ntheir shortfalls, some of which are funded in my amendment. Second \nwould be two editorials, one from the Washington Post and one from the \nLos Angeles Times.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will not object, but I would state that \nthe Department of Energy, addressing the ``loose nuke'' issue, says \nthey expect to spend $87 million on it this year, and they can't spend \nany additional money on it. So I think that should be stated likewise.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If it is $87 million, despite the $450 million which the \nSecretary of Energy announced, that $87 million is not provided for in \nthis authorization bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\n               Low Altitude Air Defense of North America\n\n       NORAD is leading the development and employment of \n     capabilities for the air defense of North America. Given the \n     proliferation of advanced technologies and improvised \n     delivery platforms operated by terrorist groups and others, \n     on 13 June 2002 the Joint Requirements Oversight Council \n     directed NORAD to develop the ``Low Altitude Air Threat \n     Defense of North America Capstone Requirements Document.''\n       This critical homeland defense effort addresses the \n     increasing gap between the growing danger from low altitude, \n     low observable threats and NORAD's current air defense \n     capabilities.\n       Such threats include cruise missiles, unmanned aerial \n     vehicles, crop dusters, radio controlled low observable \n     aircraft and ultra-lights.\n       Limited capabilities exist for fusing surveillance \n     information and the effective engagement and elimination of \n     these increasingly advanced threats launched from air, land \n     or sea.\n       Emerging technologies should be examined to enable NORAD to \n     detect, identify, track, engage and assess these threats.\n       There are two aspects to this NORAD-led multi-year effort, \n     which is supported by U.S. Northern Command and the Joint \n     Theater Air Missile Defense Organization:\n       a. Develop and write a Capstone Requirements Document. The \n     Capstone Requirements Document will provide the overarching \n     set of ``plug and play rules''--called requirements--by which \n     all systems, regardless of Service or interagency origin, are \n     to be developed and/or employed in support of detecting, \n     deterring and defending against low altitude air threats. \n     That is, regardless of agency or Service of origin, the \n     systems necessary for the full-spectrum air defense of North \n     America must be interoperable in order to provide NORAD the \n     actionable information it needs to defend against such low \n     altitude air threats.\n       b. Complete development and evaluation of a suite of \n     technologies. The following technologies have great potential \n     for the successful detection of and defense against low \n     altitude air threats:\n       Homeland Defense Battle Management Command and Control \n     architecture--will ensure the requisite interoperability of \n     systems to fuse sensor information and pass actionable \n     information to NORAD command and control centers and \n     defending forces;\n       Technologies for cruise missile detection and \n     identification, including lightweight radar technologies;\n       Stratospheric airship;\n       Maritime surveillance;\n       Surveillance platforms and other sensors; and\n       Defensive weapons.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Nanette Nadeau.\n     Sent: Wednesday, May 5, 2004.\n     To: Evelyn Farkas, (Armed Services).\n     Subject: Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection.\n\n       Hello Evelyn: Here is the information you requested on \n     Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP).

Ike Skelton,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Skelton: In response to your letter of \n     February 9, 2004, I am providing a list of unfunded programs \n     to which additional funding could be applied. While the Navy \n     is grateful for and has benefited from the increased \n     resources recently provided by the President and the \n     Congress, there still remain additional shortfalls that are \n     detailed herein.\n       The Department's FY 2005 Budget continues to focus on our \n     new defense strategy and emergent challenges of the 21st \n     Century. The resources contained in this budget go far in \n     helping us to maintain heightened readiness in uncertain \n     times, to provide further investment in transformational \n     programs, and to take care of our sailors and their families. \n     However, the Global War on Terrorism and current operations \n     incident to Operation Iraq Freedom continue to stretch our \n     resources in many areas. Additionally, the road to attaining \n     our shipbuilding and aircraft procurement program goals \n     remains exceptionally challenging.\n       For FY 2005, Naval unfunded programs total $2.5 billion. \n     These unfunded items are listed under Enclosure (1).\n       As always, if I may be of any further assistance, please \n     let me know.

Urged on by the Bush \n     administration, the leaders of Europe, Japan, Canada and \n     Russia agreed to a one-year moratorium on supplying equipment \n     for producing fissile material to countries that do not \n     already have it. Mr. Bush seeks a permanent ban, which will \n     be discussed in the coming months. The G-8 also announced \n     seven new participants in its program for funding the \n     securing of nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union and \n     agreed to press more non-nuclear countries to accept expanded \n     inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The \n     various initiatives followed several recent steps by the Bush \n     administration--including a new $450 million program to \n     collect enriched uranium and plutonium from 40 countries \n     around the world--that have added momentum to its efforts to \n     prevent the spread of nukes to nations or terrorist groups.\n       This program nevertheless looks paltry in comparison with \n     recent developments in the opposite direction. Both North \n     Korea and Iran appear to be continuing with nuclear weapons \n     development, overcoming ineffective containment efforts by \n     the Bush administration and oft-divided groups of its allies. \n     Next week the IAEA board will meet to consider a report that \n     a formal Iranian commitment to freeze work on enriching \n     uranium was never honored. It's not clear that all the \n     nuclear equipment secretly produced and traded by the \n     Pakistan-based network of Abdul Qadeer Khan has been tracked \n     down: Some seems to have disappeared. Evidence has emerged, \n     meanwhile, that North Korea already has exported nuclear \n     technology, to Libya. Though Libya is dismantling its \n     program, there is an obvious danger that North Korea will \n     sell bombs or the technology for them to others. It's easy to \n     fault the ineffective strategies for these threats pursued by \n     the Bush administration or, in the case of Iran, by European \n     governments. But it's also unclear whether any approach, from \n     negotiation to military action, would succeed--though the \n     effort at containment must go on.\n       What's odd in such circumstances is the relative \n     sluggishness with which the world has attacked the part of \n     the nuclear menace that is relatively easier to deal with, if \n     equally frightening: that of ``loose nukes'' and the \n     materials needed to make them. All the elements needed to \n     manufacture a nuclear weapon are readily available in global \n     markets, save the fissile core of highly enriched uranium or \n     plutonium--and hundreds of tons of these materials are stored \n     under insecure conditions in the nations of the Soviet Union \n     and other countries. A decade-old U.S. program has \n     safeguarded only 20 percent of the material in Russia and \n     less than that elsewhere. According to a recent report by a \n     team of Harvard University researchers, less fissile material \n     was secured in the two years after Sept. 11, 2001, than in \n     the two years before the attacks.\n       Though it is working harder at securing the loose nukes, \n     the Bush administration is still giving this effort a \n     fraction of the resources it is spending to deploy a missile \n     defense system against a threat--a rogue state with an \n     intercontinental missile--that does not currently exist. At \n     the current rate of work, it will take 13 years to secure the \n     remaining bomb-grade material in the former Soviet Union and \n     more than a decade to collect it from other countries. Mr. \n     Bush's challenger, Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass), has laid out \n     a plan to complete the same job within four years. The \n     president could help his own political cause as well as U.S. \n     security by matching that commitment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 30, 2004]\n\n                      A Bigger Peril: Dirty Bombs\n\n       During the Cold War, the United States, under the Atoms for \n     Peace program, and the Soviet Union actively exported nuclear \n     materials abroad to friendly countries. The justification was \n     that they were helping to promote the peaceful use of nuclear \n     energy. Now the U.S. and Russia are reviving efforts to \n     retrieve uranium before it ends up in a terrorist dirty bomb \n     detonated in a major city.\n       On Thursday, in a deal that followed a welter of new terror \n     warnings from the Justice Department, Energy Secretary \n     Spencer Abraham signed a $450-million agreement with Russia \n     to retrieve nuclear materials.\n       Information about contributions to the global nuclear black \n     market by top Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan has \n     prompted the administration to revive its lagging non-\n     proliferation efforts. In a Feb. 11 speech, President Bush \n     warned that ``terrorists and terror states are in a race for \n     weapons of mass murder, a race they must lost.''\n       Yet, as a new Harvard University study obtained by the \n     Washington Post reports, not enough is being done against \n     such weapons. Less fissile material was put in safekeeping in \n     the two years after Sept. 11 than in the two years preceding \n     it. More than 40 countries could supply materials for an \n     atomic weapon. The U.S. has spent billions since 1992 to \n     secure nuclear materials, but bureaucratic wrangling has \n     stalled many programs inside Russia. According to the General \n     Accounting Office, even rudimentary safety measures to deter \n     the theft of dangerous materials are lacking at many Russian \n     nuclear labs. What's more, the Energy Department's own \n     auditors warned in February that substantial caches of \n     uranium produced here were ``out of U.S. control.''\n       Abraham's initiative states that the U.S. will retrieve \n     radiological material it has sent abroad and earmarks $100 \n     million to aid Russian efforts. According to Atomic Energy \n     Minister Alexander Rumyantsev, Moscow will remove uranium \n     from 20 Soviet and Russian-built reactors in 17 countries. \n     Russia also promises not to complete Iran's Bushehr nuclear \n     power plant without a guarantee that spent fuel will be sent \n     to Moscow.\n       Though Abraham's move is a welcome one, the Bush \n     administration continues to waste far larger sums on a \n     missile defense system intended to defend the country against \n     nuclear missile attacks from rogue states or terrorists. For \n     2005, the administration's funding request is more than $10 \n     billion, about 22 times the cost of the Energy Department \n     effort. Yet most experts agree that groups such as Al Qaeda \n     are far more likely to produce dirty bombs than nuclear \n     missiles. It makes more sense to invest in preventing nuclear \n     materials from falling into the hands of terrorists than to \n     pour billions into a system that has succeeded only in what \n     amounts to rigged testing.\n       The Abraham initiative deserves credit as a cost-effective \n     program against an immediate danger. Missile defense, on the \n     other hand, is most effective as a profit center for the \n     defense industry.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Washington Post editorial says:\n\n       What's odd in these circumstances is the relative \n     sluggishness with which the world has attacked the part of \n     the nuclear menace that is relatively easier to deal with--\n\n  And they are comparing it to the North Korean transfer of technology; \nand that is the ``loose nukes'' and the materials that are needed to \nmake them.\n  The Post editorial says:\n\n     . . .

Mr. President, I would make an offer to my distinguished \ncolleague, if he wishes to advance an amendment on the issue of the \n``loose nukes,'' to work with him to see whether, in this bill right \nnow, we could take that one change, if you feel it is inadequately \nfunded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is no funding. It is not just inadequate, we do not \nhave funding for that $450 million amount.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment is expired.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3457, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Burns \nsecond-degree amendment be modified with the technical changes at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3457), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, add the \n     following:\n       (c) Additional Factors in Indecency Penalties; Exception.--\n     Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 503(b)(2)), is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(F) In the case of a violation in which the violator is \n     determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to have \n     uttered obscene, indecent, or profane material, the \n     Commission shall take into account, in addition to the \n     matters described in subparagraph (E), the following factors \n     with respect to the degree of culpability of the violator:\n       ``(i) Whether the material uttered by the violator was live \n     or recorded, scripted or unscripted.\n       ``(ii) Whether the violator had a reasonable opportunity to \n     review recorded or scripted programming or had a reasonable \n     basis to believe live or unscripted programming would contain \n     obscene, indecent, or profane material.\n       ``(iii) If the violator originated live or unscripted \n     programming, whether a time delay blocking mechanism was \n     implemented for the programming.\n       ``(iv) The size of the viewing or listening audience of the \n     programming.\n       ``(v) Whether the obscene incident or profane language was \n     within live programming not produced by the station licensee \n     or permitee.\n       ``(vi) The size of the market.\n       ``(vii) Whether the violation occurred during a children's \n     television program (as such term is used in the Children's \n     Television Programming Policy referenced in section \n     73.4050(c) of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. \n     73.4050(c)) or during a television program rated TVY, TVY7, \n     TVY7FV, or TVG under the TV Parental Guidelines as such \n     ratings were approved by the Commission in implementation of \n     section 551 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Video \n     Programming Ratings, Report and Order, CS Docket No. 97-55, \n     13 F.C.C.

Mr. President, I am sure my colleague would want to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on his amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to the vote going forward, it is my \nunderstanding the majority has been consulted, and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, following these votes, wishes to offer his amendment \ndealing with veterans health benefits.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly want to accommodate the \nleadership. But I spoke earlier this morning outlining what I \nunderstood was going to be the sequence of events in the morning. We \ncertainly want to accommodate the distinguished Democratic leader, but \none of our Members, for very special reasons, has to be absent this \nafternoon. He is a member of the commission on WMD, and he wished to \nrebut Senator Dayton's amendment, which would be a very short period of \ntime this morning.\n  Mr. REID. How long does the Senator from Arizona wish to speak?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The votes will probably be completed shortly after 11 \no'clock. We at least hope that is the case.\n  Mr. WARNER. The two votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I meant to say 12 o'clock, which does not \nleave much time for the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Democratic leader then be recognized \nimmediately after the luncheons?\n  Mr. REID. We would ask, then, that the Democratic leader be allowed \nto lay down his amendment, and that he would complete the debate at \nsome subsequent time. And then if Senator McCain----\n  Mr. WARNER. In other words, if I understand the request now, it is \nsimply to come in and be recognized for the purpose of laying down the \namendment so it is in the queue, and then we will proceed with the \nDayton amendment and those matters we originally scheduled?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. I do not know about the Dayton matter \noriginally scheduled.\n  Mr. WARNER. Apparently my leader would like to address this issue. We \nwant to be cooperative and supportive of the procedural aspects of it. \nCould we proceed at least through the first vote and then, in that \ninterim period, be able to provide an answer?\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. I will be happy to do that. But I see no \nprejudice to anyone if he is allowed to lay down his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I share that, but any manager has to be cognizant of the \nneeds of his respective leader.

BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2004.\n\n        (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004''.\n        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase \n     the FCC's authority to fine for indecent broadcasts and \n     prevent further relaxation of the media ownership rules in \n     order to stem the rise of indecent programming.\n       (c) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1996 there has been significant consolidation in \n     the media industry, including:\n        (A) Radio.--Clear Channel Communications went from owning \n     43 radio stations prior to 1996 to over 1,200 as of January \n     2003; Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. was established in 1997 and \n     owned 266 stations as of December 2003, making it the second-\n     largest radio ownership company in the country; and Infinity \n     Broadcasting Corporation went from owning 43 radio stations \n     prior to 1996 to over 185 stations as of June 2004;\n        (B) Television.--Viacom/CBS's national ownership of \n     television stations increased from 31.53 percent of U.S. \n     television households prior to 1996 to 38.9 percent in 2004; \n     GE/NBC's national ownership of television stations increased \n     from 24.65 percent prior to 1996 to 33.56 percent in 2004; \n     NewsCorp/FOX's national ownership of television stations \n     increased from 22.05 percent prior to 1996 to 37.7 percent in \n     2004;\n       (C) Media Mergers.--In 2000, Viacom merged with CBS and \n     UPN; in 2002, GE/NBC merged with Telemundo Communications, \n     Inc., and in 2004 with Vivendi Universal Entertainment; in \n     2003 News Corp./Fox acquired\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\n     a controlling interest in DirecTV; in 2000, Time Warner, \n     Inc., merged with America Online.\n        (2) Over the same period that there has been significant \n     consolidation in the media industry the number of indecency \n     complaints also has increased dramatically. The largest \n     owners of television and radio broadcast holdings have \n     received the greatest number of indecency complaints and the \n     largest fines, including\n       (A) Over 80 percent of the fines proposed by the Federal \n     Communications Commission for indecent broadcasts were \n     against stations owned by two of the top three radio \n     companies. The top radio company alone accounts for over two-\n     thirds of the fines proposed by the FCC;\n       (B) Two of the largest fines proposed by the FCC were \n     against two of the top three radio companies;\n       (C) In 2004, the FCC received over 500,000 indecency \n     complaints in response to the Superbowl Halftime show aired \n     on CBS and produced by MTV, both of which are owned by \n     Viacom. This is the largest number of complaints ever \n     received by the FCC for a single broadcast;\n       (D) The number of indecency complaints increased from 111 \n     in 2000 to 240,350 in 2003;\n       (3) Media conglomerates do not consider or reflect local \n     community standards.\n       (A) The FCC has no record of a television station owned by \n     one of the big four networks (Viacom/CBS, Disney/ABC, News \n     Corp./Fox or GE/NBC) pre-empting national programming for \n     failing to meet community standards;\n       (B) FCC records show that non-network owned stations have \n     often rejected national network programming found to be \n     indecent and offensive to local community standards;\n       (C) A letter from an owned and operated station manager to \n     a viewer stated that programming decisions are made by \n     network headquarters and not the local owned and operated \n     television station management;\n       (D) The Parents Television Council has found that the \n     ``losers'' of network ownership ``are the local communities \n     whose standards of decency are being ignored;''\n       (4) The Senate Commerce Committee has found that the \n     current fines do not deter indecent broadcast because they \n     are merely the cost of doing business for large media \n     companies. Therefore, in order to prevent the continued rise \n     of indecency violations, the FCC's authority for indecency \n     fines should be increased and further media consolidation \n     should be prevented.\n       (d) Increase in Penalties for Obscene, Indecent, and \n     Profane Broadcasts.--Section 503(b)(2) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as \n     subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n        ``(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the violator \n     is--\n        ``(i)(I) a broadcast station licensee or permittee; or\n        ``(II) an applicant for any broadcast license, permit, \n     certificate, or other instrument or authorization issued by \n     the Commission; and\n        ``(ii) determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to \n     have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane language, the \n     amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this \n     subsection shall not exceed $275,000 for each violation or \n     each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount \n     assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a \n     total of $3,000,000 for any single act or failure to act.''; \n     and\n        (3) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by paragraph (1), \n     by striking ``subparagraph (A) or (B)'' and inserting \n     ``subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)''.\n        (e) New Broadcast Media Ownership Rules Suspended.--\n       (1) Suspension.--Subject to the provisions of paragraphs \n     (d)(2), the broadcast media ownership rules adopted by the \n     Federal Communications Commission on June 2, 2003, pursuant \n     to its proceeding on broadcast media ownership rules, Report \n     and Order FCC03-127, published at 68 FR 46286, August 5, \n     2003, shall be invalid and without legal effect.\n       (2) Clarification.--The provisions of paragraph (1) shall \n     not supersede the amendments made by section 629 of the \n     Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004 (Public \n     Law 108-199).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3466) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3235\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Brownback \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3235) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Burns amendment, likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3457\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased that amendment No. 3457 was \naccepted by unanimous consent in the Senate today. While I fully \nsupport the underlying Brownback legislation, I have offered a second-\ndegree amendment to protect the interests of small broadcasters who \nshould not be punished for events outside of their control. The \namendment agreed upon simply calls on the FCC to consider the size of \nthe stations in question as well as whether they had anything to do \nwith producing the offensive content in question.\n  I applaud the efforts of my colleague from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, for \nhis leadership on the issue of broadcast decency, and I am fully \nsupportive of his legislation. This legislation gives the Federal \nCommunications Commission the tools they need to go after those \nresponsible for exposing our children to indecent material.\n  With the recent trend of indecent events in the media, it is time to \nraise the current fine levels in order to prompt stations to more \ncarefully screen their programming. These higher fines are appropriate \nfor most stations. However, if the fines are too high for a local \nMontana broadcaster, it could well force them to close up shop.\n  In Montana, we have numerous stations that are so marginally \nprofitable that the only reason they remain on the air is because the \ngood citizens of their communities refuse to let them go dark.\n  For example, in Scobey, MT, townspeople regularly buy ``stock'' in \nKCGM because the community is so small that, in the words of manager \nDixie Halvorsen, ``there is no reason for anyone to buy advertising in \nthis station. We have but one local market, one drug store, and one \nfeed store. They buy time with us because they want their local news \nand their local high school sports and the local legion baseball and \nthe local weather . . . ''\n  Plentywood is much the same. KATQ has a local advisory board that \noversees the operation of the station. It is made up of members of the \nbusiness and non-profit community to ensure that their local stations \nremain on the air.\n  Nearly two-thirds of the radio stations in Montana are small market \n``mom and pops.'' In Libby, MT, Duane and Peggy Williams operate KLCB-\nAM and KTNY-FM with the help of several part-time stringers and some \nhigh school students. Libby has a depressed economy and is a Superfund \nsite. When the EPA held meetings and hearings with all of us in the \nCongressional delegation, along with the Governor and other State and \nFederal officials, Duane and Peggy interrupted their entire programming \nfor the day to cover the issue.\n  It is not at all inconceivable that during these hours of live \nbroadcasts, an upset citizen might utter a word or phrase that could be \nconsidered indecent under this provision of the law. An excessive fine \nwould mean the end of Duane and Peggy's stations and dreams and the end \nof local radio in Libby.\n  And there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people like Duane and \nPeggy who do not deserve such treatment for simply trying to do what is \nbest by their communities.\n  Examples such as this are why I introduced the amendment that was \nagreed to today. This amendment outlines mitigating factors that the \nCommission shall consider when determining the degree of a fine that \nwill help shield smaller stations from an unnecessarily strong \nfinancial blow.\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\n  I thank Mr. Brownback for taking the lead on this important piece of \nlegislation, and I am pleased that my colleagues have recognized the \nimportance of the small-market station amendment.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, today I rise to make a few remarks about \nmy vote today for Senator Brownback's amendment regarding broadcast \nindecency. I supported this amendment as modified by the Burns second-\ndegree amendment because it includes protections for small market \nstations. Combined, the Burns and Brownback amendments would curb the \nbroadcast of indecent material without unjustly penalizing local \nbroadcasters who unknowingly transmit it.\n  I have spoken with Missouri broadcasters who worry that the stand-\nalone Brownback legislation would subject them to large fines for \nmerely transmitting a program containing indecent material, like that \ncontained in the Superbowl halftime show, without their knowledge of \nthe indecency. Combined, the Burns-Brownback amendments would not place \nbroadcasters in this situation since it requires the Federal \nCommunications Commission to consider several factors including \nknowledge in determining whether to levy a fine, and how much that fine \nshould be.\n  Under current law, local broadcasters are essentially liable for \neverything that comes across their airwaves, even a Janet Jackson-type \nincident that they are downstream from and have had no opportunity to \nreview. This quasi-strick liability standard is simply not fair, and \nthat is one reason why I believe the law should be changed.\n  The Burns amendment in particular corrects this unfairness by \nrequiring the FCC to consider factors in assessing fines including \nwhether the material was scripted or recorded and whether the violator \nhad a reasonable opportunity to review the script or recording, thereby \ndemonstrating that the violator had knowledge that the indecent, \nobscene or profane material would be aired or, otherwise, had a \nreasonable basis to believe that live or unscripted programming would \ncontain indecent material. In determining culpability, the FCC would be \nrequired to consider mitigating factors including whether the licensee \nhad a reasonable opportunity to review the programming or had reason to \nbelieve it may contain obscene, indecent, or profane material. I \nbelieve these provisions address local broadcasters' concerns and \nprotect them from arbitrary FCC enforcement.\n  I support the Burns-Brownback amendments because of these provisions, \nbut I am still concerned about the phenomenon of congressional \noverreaction to current events. Like many other parents, I feel that \nthis year's Superbowl halftime show contained indecent material and \nthat those responsible should be held accountable. After the Superbowl, \nhundreds of Missourians contacted my to share similar views. There \nseems to be a tendency among elected officials to respond to such a \nstrong outpouring of support by not only trying to fix the problem, but \nby trying to fix it in a way that swings the legislative pendulum too \nfar in other directions, to over-regulate. I do not believe that these \namendments as combined go too far, but if they do I want to hear from \nMissouri broadcasters and work with them to address their concerns.\n  I thank Senators Burns and Brownback for their hard work on this \nlegislation, and for addressing my concerns.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are moving along quite well. All are in agreement with \ngreat cooperation on both sides. We are about to proceed to the \namendment, the ``Buy America'' from our colleague on the committee. The \nSenator from Arizona on this side is ready.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dayton indicated he wishes to speak for a short \nperiod of time. The Senator from Arizona does not usually speak very \nlong. Does the Senator have any idea how long he will talk?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No longer than 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We can complete all debate on this amendment. Senator \nDayton said he would not speak for more than 5 or 10 minutes following \nthe Senator from Arizona, and that would complete debate on the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Except the Senator from Virginia would like about 3 \nminutes to wrap up at the conclusion.\n  Mr. REID. Totally appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed 15 \nminutes for my substitute, the Senator from Minnesota be given 10 \nminutes in response, and the Senator from Virginia, 3 minutes, followed \nby a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3461\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yesterday, Senator Warner called up a substitute \namendment. I ask unanimous consent the substitute amendment be called \nup for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My reasons for offering this substitute amendment are \nsimple. It will be very harmful if we allow the Dayton amendment to be \nadopted in its original form. It is harmful to the Department of \nDefense, our soldiers in uniform, our domestic defense industry, and, \nnot least, the American taxpayer.\n  The amendment I am offering in the form of a substitute would grant \nwaiver authority for the application of a domestic source or content \nrequirement with a country that has signed a declaration of principles \nwith the United States. This substitute amendment aims to assure that \nthe Department of Defense, charged with protecting our national \nsecurity, is not limited in its ability to carry out the functions the \nAmerican public is depending on it to do.\n  The Dayton amendment would give preferential treatment to U.S. \nsuppliers and does not accomplish the more important objective, which \nis to provide our troops with the best product for the best price. It \nmay not sound like much on first consideration, but it would have far-\nreaching consequences on national security efforts and violate many of \nour trade agreements with respect to defense procurement.\n  Despite the good intentions of the proponents of the ``Buy America'' \namendment, if it passed in its current form, it could have consequences \nto our Nation, impacting jobs and our economic prosperity. Further, it \nwould harm our relationships with our allies and coalition partners and \nour collective prosecution of the war on terror.\n\n  As for the international considerations of the Dayton amendment, it \nis isolationist and go-it-alone. Currently, the United States enjoys a \ntrade balance in defense exports of 6 to 1 in favor with respect to \nEurope, and 12 to 1 with respect to the rest of the world. I don't \nthink there is any doubt if we restricted what we would buy from other \nnations, they would then, in return, respond. If we pass the Dayton \namendment without modifications, our allies will retaliate, and the \nability to sell U.S. equipment as a means to greater interoperability \nwith NATO and non-NATO allies would be seriously undercut. Critical \ninternational programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter Program and the \nMissile Defense Program would likely be terminated as our allies \nreassess our defense cooperation.\n  There are many examples of a trade imbalance that I can point to. I \nmention one government: The Dutch Government, over a 4-year period, \npurchased $2.5 billion in defense equipment from U.S. manufacturers, \nincluding air refueling planes, Chinook helicopters, Apache \nhelicopters, F-16 fighter equipment, missiles, combat radios, and \nvarious equipment. During that same period, the United States purchased \nonly $40 million of defense equipment from the Dutch. So there is a \n$2.5 billion procurement by the Dutch Government for American equipment \nand $40 million of equipment of the United States bought by the Dutch. \nRecently, the Defense Ministers of the United Kingdom and Sweden \npointed to similar situations in their country.\n  In every meeting regarding this subject I am told how difficult it is \nto buy American defense products because of our protectionist policies \nand the strong ``Buy European'' sentiment overseas. The Ambassadors of \nthe United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Denmark, allies that provided \nforces in\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\nIraq, recently sent letters to the Armed Services Committee expressing \ntheir strong support for the underlying title 8 in the Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  The letters support the Commission on the Future of the National \nTechnology and Industrial Base, the conforming standard for waiver of \ndomestic source or content requirements, and consistency with U.S. \ntrade obligations under trade agreements.\n  Over the last few years we have sold 18 variants of aircraft, 19 \ntypes of missiles, as well as ground and naval equipment, through the \nForeign Military Sales Program. These defense systems were manufactured \nin 39 States across America. Companies such as Raytheon, Lockheed \nMartin, Bell, Northrop Grumman, Missile Research Corporation, Sikorsky, \nPratt & Whitney, General Dynamics, American General, and American Truck \nCorporation are contributing to the trade surplus we have in the \ndefense technology market.\n  I want to point out also that in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 there was \n$482 million worth of military equipment purchased in the State of \nMinnesota; $482 million, Lockheed Martin; and Raytheon, 20 Stinger \nmissiles. Lockheed Martin, by the way, sold those weapons systems to \nJapan, and Raytheon, the Stinger, to Turkey.\n  I will read from a couple letters we have received from various \ncountries and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others on this issue.\n  There is no one under more assault than the British Prime Minister \nfor his continued unwavering support of our effort in Iraq. The British \nAmbassador wrote:\n\n       If approved, the measures proposed under Title VII would be \n     an important step forward towards improving interoperability \n     across the full range of our mutual defence cooperation.\n\n  The Netherlands Ambassador says:\n\n       Although not directly related to the above referenced \n     proposals, allow me to share with you the idea that in our \n     perception, part of the discussion which is seen by some as \n     the danger posed by foreign dependency can be satisfied by \n     bilateral Security of Supply agreements which can be \n     negotiated as more detailed arrangements under a Declaration \n     of Principles. . . .\n\n  As you know, Mr. President, we have Canadian troops fighting \nalongside Americans in Afghanistan.\n\n       The amendment offered by Senator Dayton sends the wrong \n     message to U.S. allies by deleting language in the \n     Committee's bill that would encourage and support \n     international defense cooperation and ultimately benefit U.S. \n     taxpayers and American troops.\n\n  Every nation that is working with us and fighting alongside the \nUnited States is deeply concerned about this issue. It is hard for me \nto understand why we would want to propose legislation which would put \nthis impediment to our relationship with our allies right now, when we \nare desperately seeking more cooperation and more effort on behalf of \nfreedom.\n  The Danish Ambassador says:\n\n       . . . it would be very difficult to understand and explain \n     if Denmark were to face new restrictions in the industrial \n     cooperation with the U.S. Especially in light of our \n     participation in Iraq since the beginning of the military \n     operations and the continued presence of 500 Danish troops--\n     one of the largest contingents in both absolute numbers and \n     certainly in proportion of population.\n\n  We are in tough times right now. The last thing we need to do is \nthrow sand in the face of our allies, particularly our European allies \nwho are fighting alongside us in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, \nand other parts of the world. I would hope that the substitute would be \nagreed to, and I would point out again the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as \nwell as the National Defense Industrial Association and the Aerospace \nIndustries Association, the Secretary of Defense, and others have \nspoken strongly on this issue.\n  Let me quote from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce letter:\n\n       On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's \n     largest federation, representing more than 3 million \n     businesses, I am writing to express serious concerns for two \n     Buy American-related amendments for consideration during \n     Senate debate on the National Defense Authorization Act. \n     These sections represent important steps in Department of \n     Defense transformation plans as it is filed.\n\n  So I would hope we would also understand the Senate needs to go into \nthese negotiations with a strong position, given the position of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee authorization. So I hope we will adopt \nthe amendment. I ask for its enactment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3197, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside, and I call up my amendment 3197 and ask unanimous consent \nthat my amendment be modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nmodifications are at the desk. We have examined them, and there is no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3197), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 172, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through page 176, line 12.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his concurrence.\n  Mr. President, I want to say at the outset, as I said yesterday, but \nin the absence of my colleague from Arizona, I have the utmost respect \nfor him and also for those who take a different position on this issue. \nBut I am a little perplexed at the dire consequences that are being \nasserted if my amendment were to be adopted, because my amendment \nsimply strikes language that is in the bill before the Senate which is \nitself modifying current law.\n  My amendment simply takes us back to current law. My amendment simply \ntakes us back to the principles and the policies and the standards and \nthe law in the Buy American Act, which has been in effect in this \ncountry for 70 years. So I am astonished that these dire consequences \nare being asserted on something that has been in existing law for 70 \nyears, that has benefited companies represented by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and the National Defense Industrial Association, that may have \ncertain members that have exported jobs and instead set up bases of \noperation in other countries, including those affected by this \namendment.\n  So there may be those who have that particular financial interest for \ntheir own companies involved, but, overall, as the Senator from Arizona \npointed out, national defense and military equipment are areas of our \ntrade where we enjoy a surplus. So it seems evident that the policies \nand the laws of this country affecting both ``Buy American''--which \nprovides exemptions for the Secretary of Defense in just the \ncircumstances that the Senator from Arizona cited: if there are not \nproducts available that are of the right quality, if there is a delay \nin obtaining them, if the prices are not competitive, if there are any \nfactors at all that would harm our ability to provide for our national \ndefense or to supply our fighting men and women who serve us so \nheroically around the globe--if there were anything at all that were an \nimpediment to them getting the best equipment, getting the most \nadvanced equipment, in a timely basis, at a competitive price, then the \nSecretary of Defense, under the current law, is entitled and has the \nauthority to make a waiver and grant an exception.\n  But this ``Buy American'' law has said--for 70 years, under six \nDemocratic administrations and five Republican administrations, until \nthis administration started to object to it--try to buy American \nbecause if you buy American, you strengthen America by supporting \nAmerican companies producing products in the United States of America, \nemploying American citizens, providing jobs in this country.\n  It is this administration which seemingly has very little concern \nabout that job base. Given that we have lost, since President Bush took \noffice, in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, over 2\\1/2\\ million manufacturing \njobs in this country--that is, 2\\1/2\\ million Americans who were \nholding those jobs when President Bush took office, who are now without \nthose jobs. Maybe some have found lesser paying service sector jobs, \nbut many of them are unemployed and have been for a long time. Under \nthose circumstances, you would think this administration would be \nunwilling to adopt any violations of the Buy American Act that would \nhave the consequence of costing more American manufacturing jobs or not \nrecovering some that would otherwise be possible\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\nto be recovered for the benefit of American citizens, for the benefit \nof American companies. But evidently that is not a concern.\n\n  I appreciate that Senator McCain has, by his proposed substitute \namendment--and I would support that if my own were not successful--\nreduced the number of countries that are going to be given this special \ntreatment, this special advantage under the existing armed services \nlanguage--section 842 that I propose to strike--and has stated that the \ncountries that will be given this special exemption are those that have \nsigned statements of principle with the United States rather than \nmemoranda of understanding regarding U.S. purchases from those \ncountries.\n  I am a little perplexed that the Senator from Arizona cited letters \nin support of his position from the countries of Canada and the \nNetherlands because, according to the information I have been provided, \nthose two countries do not have statements of principle signed with the \nUnited States, so they would not be included. In fact, they would now \nbe excluded by Senator McCain's proposed substitute amendment. As I \nunderstand it, the countries that have signed these statements of \nprinciple include Australia, Norway, Denmark, the United Kingdom, \nSweden, Spain, and Italy. I am pleased that the number of countries \nthen that would be exempted from ``Buy America'' are only 7, as opposed \nto 21 before, but those are still 7 countries, frankly, that enjoy, on \nan overall basis, a sizable trade surplus with the United States.\n  In other words, this country, if you take all goods and services, \nimports far more products from those countries, buys more products made \nin those countries than we export to those countries. One of the few \nexceptions to that is the sale of military equipment. That is to our \nadvantage. That means we are exporting more than we are importing. That \nmeans we have more jobs generated in the United States to produce those \ngoods and products than we are importing in return. But on an overall \nbasis, taking all products--commercial, industrial, agricultural, and \nservices--we are paying more money to import goods and services from \nthose countries than we are exporting.\n  So why are we willing to sacrifice one of the very few sectors in \nwhich we enjoy a trade surplus and give that up by agreeing to buy the \nsame amount of product from them as we sell to them in this one sector \nand then leaving all others aside? If we want to take that approach, if \nwe believe, as those countries do, that these kind of reciprocal \nagreements are valuable to them, as they are, because they provide jobs \nin those countries, why don't we make that requirement for everything \nwe import from those countries? Or better yet, why don't we make that \nagreement for everything we import all over the world? Because as the \nlatest figures show, we are running a world trade deficit that now \nexceeds on an annual basis $550 billion a year. That is $550 billion \nthat leaves the United States to buy foreign products. Here we are, in \none of the few sectors where we enjoy an export surplus, prepared to \ngive that up on the basis of getting contracts or selling products to \nthose countries.\n  I can understand why those countries who wrote those letters of \nsupport would do so because that kind of agreement benefits them. But \nwe are not making laws--or we should not be--and we are not making \ntrade policies--or we should not be--that benefit Canada, the \nNetherlands, Denmark--with all due respect, important friends and \nallies as they are--any more than they pass laws or make trade policies \nthat benefit the United States to their own disadvantage. So if they \nare not prepared to do so, and they should not, why would we do so when \nwe should not?\n  My goal is not to change current law; my goal is to stay with current \nlaw. It is to strike the language in this bill that would create these \nadditional exceptions, that would allow other companies in other \ncountries to gain contracts that are for goods and services that are \nnow produced in the United States by American companies, employing \nAmerican workers, paying taxes in American communities that benefit our \nschools, our local governments, our State and Federal Government, but, \nmost importantly, that provide jobs for American citizens, the same as \ncurrent law. I am not asking for any more protectionism. I am not \nasking for any more of anything affecting trade policy or trade \nagreements than exists under current law. I am simply asking my \ncolleagues not to go further.\n  I ask my colleagues--at a time when we have lost over 2.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs under President Bush and his administration--not to \ngo further, not to cost us more manufacturing jobs, but to take a stand \non behalf of those who are working in American industries today, those \nwho want to return jobs to American industries tomorrow. Let's stick \nwith current law. That is what my amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to go directly to the comments the Senator \njust made, as he and I were in our colloquy the other day, I pointed \nout that at the present time the United States, in the last fiscal \nyear, sold $63 billion in defense sales and only purchased $5 billion. \nMy point is, the Senator is going after the wrong target, the wrong \nsegment of the industry by this amendment, because it will create \ngreater loss of jobs if we go after that trade surplus that is in \ndefense right now. That is why we plead with our colleagues to leave \nthis sector of trade untouched. I believe it is very important we do \nthat.\n  The second thing that concerns me, and it is somewhat technical, in \ndrawing up this bill, I gave specific instructions to the staff to \npreserve the sanctity of that part of ``Buy America'' which I and I \nthink everybody in this Chamber supports, the Small Business Act, where \n23 percent of the dollars for small businesses have to go, the \nshipbuilding, the blind and the handicapped, and the Berry amendment. \nYet when the Senator modified his amendment, this section up here was \ntaken out. That is caught up, and takes it out also.\n  It seems to me it is important for the Senate to reaffirm the \nsanctity of those four categories of trade as being purely ``Buy \nAmerica'' and let them stay. But the Senator has taken out the work of \nthe committee when we put it in there. That is what troubles me.\n  Lastly, we have here another communication from the Secretary of \nDefense of Great Britain, who is so explicit, he says:\n\n     . . . efforts by Administration officials to introduce \n     unnecessarily restrictive language into US/UK cooperative \n     armament and research MOUs are a potentially serious blow to \n     US-UK relations in the defence equipment co-operation field. \n     They would put us under pressure domestically--\n       That is, before the parliament, their parliament would now \n     begin to examine this tremendous trade surplus that we have \n     with relationship to Great Britain\n       --to review our own policies and to consider whether we are \n     prepared to continue to place significant defence contracts \n     with US suppliers in the face of what could only be seen as a \n     demonstrably uneven playing field. The mutual operational, \n     technological, and industrial benefits we have enjoyed over \n     years of equipment cooperation could quickly evaporate with \n     both of us being losers, and with obvious political \n     ramifications.\n\n  I say to my good friend, I recognize his intention to try and help \nAmerica save jobs, but his amendment addresses the wrong sector of \ntrade. He could do serious damage to a surplus we are generating with \nadditional jobs in the United States as it currently exists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3461\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a perfecting amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3468 to amendment No. 3409.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in 1898, as the Spanish-American War drew \nto a close, then-COL Theodore Roosevelt warned his Rough Riders about \nthe reception they would receive once they returned home:\n\n       The world will be kind to you for 10 days. Everything you \n     do will be all right. After that, you will be judged by a \n     stricter code.\n\n  We have come a long way in the treatment of our veterans, and our \nrecent commemoration of Memorial Day, our dedication of the World War \nII Memorial, the observance of the 60th anniversary of D-day, attest to \nthe gratitude our Nation feels toward the men and women who have \ndefended our freedom. Ultimately, the real test of our gratitude, \nhowever, is not found in parades or ceremonies. The real test is \nwhether we honor our promises and provide our veterans with the help \nand benefits they need.\n  Sadly, we are not meeting that test. In recent years, large numbers \nof veterans have seen their health care delayed or denied outright. The \nreason is clear: Our system for funding the VA is broken. The VA's \nenrolled patient population has grown 134 percent since 1996, while \nappropriations have risen only one-third as quickly.\n  The President's task force to improve health care delivery for our \nNation's veterans, created by President Bush through Executive Order \n13214, reported a significant mismatch in VA between demand and \navailable funding. That mismatch is translated into lengthy waiting \nlists, forcing hundreds of thousands of veterans to wait for months, \neven years, to see a doctor, increased out-of-pocket payments resulting \nin veterans paying six times more for their health care than when this \nPresident took office, from $200 million in 2001 to an expected $1.3 \nbillion next year, and new enrollment restrictions.\n  Last year, Secretary Principi ruled that 200,000 priority 8 veterans \ncould no longer enter the VA health care system. If nothing is done, \nthe Congressional Budget Office now predicts the number denied access \nthrough this one policy will grow to 1.5 million by the year 2013. The \nBush administration refuses to acknowledge the system is broken and \npreaches a policy of ``demand management.''\n  Let's be clear, demand management means taking any and all steps \nnecessary to restrict the number of veterans treated by the VA, \nincluding rationing care, sending the bill collectors after veterans, \nand blocking enrollments. The principle of demand management says to \nthe veteran: Take your health concerns somewhere else because we cannot \nhelp right now.\n  That is not a policy, that is a disgrace, and it is time we reject \nthat principle that governs the care we offer our veterans today. \nVeterans have a fundamental right to health care, and we have an \nobligation to ensure that the VA has the resources to provide them. The \nanswer to the VA health care crisis is simple: We need a new funding \nsystem that will allow us to provide health care to every American\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nwho served in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  My amendment today would spell out that objective in the law. The \namendment would remove veterans health care from the annual politics of \nappropriations cycles. Instead, veterans health care would be funded \nlike other vital programs, including military retirement, Social \nSecurity, and Medicare.\n  Each year, the Veterans Health Administration receives funding from \ntwo sources: First, an annual discretionary amount which remains \nunchanged from year to year locked in at the funding level for fiscal \nyear 2004; second, an annual sum of mandatory funds. This amount would \nadjust each year to reflect changes in demand from veterans and the \nrate of health care inflation.\n\n  At the end of 2 years, Congress will be required to revisit the \ndecision, and the GAO would study whether this system has functioned \naccording to plan and whether the funding formula should be refined. \nCongress would then be required to update the law to reflect the \nlessons learned after 2 years of actual operation.\n  In effect, we would be creating a 2-year trial and then deciding how \nto refine the model and move forward. Meanwhile, every veteran who \nneeds health care would receive it. President Bush's own task force \nrecommended such a system saying: ``The Federal Government should \nprovide full funding . . . through a mandatory funding system'' or \nother modifications to the current appropriations process.\n  I reemphasize, that was the President's own task force on this \nsystem. The Committee on Veterans Affairs in the House of \nRepresentatives offered its own bipartisan endorsement of mandatory \nfunding earlier this year.\n  A February 25 letter signed by Republican chairman Chris Smith and \nDemocratic ranking member Lane Evans stated:\n\n       Rather than supporting administration proposals that could \n     reduce demand . . . and shift costs to other parts of the \n     Federal medical system, the committee recommends treating \n     spending on veterans programs the same as spending on Social \n     Security and Medicare.\n\n  Leading veterans organizations have also joined in an unprecedented \ncoalition to fight for health care budget reform. The American Legion, \nAMVETS, the Blinded Veterans, Disabled American Veterans, the Jewish \nWar Veterans, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica--they have all banded together to work toward a system that \nguarantees health care for our veterans.\n  I believe their coalition, the Partnership for Veterans Health Care \nReform, has identified a compelling solution to the VA funding crisis, \nand I have pledged my support in making it a reality. South Dakota \nveterans associated with these groups have joined in enthusiastic \nsupport.\n  This is not an abstract debate over numbers for my friends back home. \nThese veterans have sat on waiting lists, these veterans take the phone \ncalls from the VA's new bill collectors, these veterans have friends \nand neighbors who are prohibited from enrolling in the current VA \nhealth system.\n  Earlier this year, these South Dakota veterans were moved to action. \nNearly 500 veterans from nearly 50 communities in every corner of our \nvast State signed a petition urging us to adopt mandatory funding for \nthe VA.\n  South Dakota's American Legion CDR Wayne Vetter brought me this \npowerful statement, and I sent a copy to the White House. I am sorry to \nreport that I have not yet heard a response from the President or \nanyone in the White House with regard to this statement.\n  It is time that we recognized that health care for those who return \nfrom war is a cost that follows directly from our Nation's military \noperations.\n  Ask any veteran. The burden of military service lives long after the \nparades are over and the medals and ribbons have been stashed in a \ncloset. There are no more fundamental needs for these men and women \nthan access to quality, affordable health care. Our veterans once kept \nthis country safe and strong. Today they need a health care system to \nkeep them strong. We must adequately fund the system that provides that \ncare.\n  We can eliminate the annual budget problems in Washington and create \na system where veterans can rely on the VA to be there when they need \nit. We have done it for military retirees. We have done it for Social \nSecurity recipients. We have done it for Medicare. We ought to do it \nfor veterans.\n  The debt we owe our veterans must be something that lasts beyond the \nparade, beyond the ceremonies, beyond the 10 days of gratitude Teddy \nRoosevelt told his Rough Riders to expect. The debt is unending and our \nwillingness to repay that debt must be unending as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, the \nDemocratic leader, I think the Senate Armed Services Committee, working \nin conjunction with the Senate Appropriations Committee in a bipartisan \nway, over a series of years now, has addressed, together with the \nparticipation of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, a number of issues \nwhich have substantially improved the ability of the veterans to meet \ntheir obligations to their families and to themselves for the balance \nof their natural lives.\n  For 2 consecutive years and again this year, the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada brought forth a provision for concurrent receipts, \nwhich is an improvement in the bill on that. Senator Landrieu, together \nwith two other colleagues, Senators Snowe and Ensign on this side, have \nnow perfected an amendment which is going to help the widows as they \nmeet--and perhaps those of the male sex who are recipients of the \nretirement benefits of a female veteran--as a consequence of this bill, \neach of those will be able to expect to have greater certainty as to \nthe amount of money in terms of their retirement at that juncture in \nlife when Social Security becomes available to the surviving spouse in \nthat situation.\n  As to the impression that the Senate, and particularly the Armed \nServices Committee, has not been very forthcoming in fulfilling what \neach of us believe in our hearts is that tremendous debt of gratitude \nto veterans and their families, I suggest the record states the Senate \nhas worked its job and, in conjunction with the House, these matters \nhave now become matters of statutory guarantee.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader has proposed an amendment which \nrequires a combination of discretionary and mandatory funding for \nveterans health care. The modification includes a requirement for a \nComptroller General report by January 31, 2007, on the funding achieved \nby the amendment, and provides for an expedited review of a joint \nresolution of Congress to implement the Comptroller General's \nrecommendations.\n\n  The modification directs mandatory spending by the U.S. Treasury in \nthe amount of $300 billion over 10 years. I want to repeat that. The \nmodification directs mandatory spending--that is a very significant \nlegislative initiative--by the U.S. Treasury in the amount of $300 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  Every Member of the body joins with Leader Daschle in recognizing the \nneed to continue to provide adequate funding for the health care of \nveterans in this country. I would point out that, to my knowledge, \nfunding for veterans programs has increased significantly in the past 3 \nyears under the cognizance of the Congress. Spending for veterans \nhealth care has gone up 34 percent since the year 2001, and I believe \nmy colleagues Senator Nickles and Senator Bond are both prepared to \naddress the funding of health care for our Nation's veterans when they \nsoon approach the floor to actively debate this amendment.\n  The Senate budget resolution includes $29.1 billion for veterans \nhealth care, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 5 percent, in 2004.\n  In light of these increases, in this Senator's opinion, any future \nsignificant increases for veterans health care warrant careful \nconsideration by the Congress. Such consideration would be limited by \nthis amendment, which mandates funding based on a per capita formula.\n  For Federal budgeting purposes, the VA health system, as the DOD \nsystem, is discretionary, as juxtaposed against mandatory. Now that is \nwhat we are talking about, changing the manner in\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nwhich we have been funding veterans health care these many years. It \nseems to me the discretionary program has worked well. It has served \nthe veterans' needs and should remain as a matter of law.\n  The amendment does not create an entitlement to VA health care. It \nreplaces the current system of discretionary funding, which has no \nceiling, with a formula-based approach which combines discretionary and \nmandatory funding.\n  I have been informed that experts on veterans health care believe the \nproposed formula is flawed, that it will have the effect of turning the \nVA health care system into a kind of glorified HMO, with every \nincentive to enroll the young and healthy and cut corners on the care \nneeded by the old and the sick. These incentives are contrary to the \ncommitment of this Nation to the health care needs of our veterans.\n  Treating the VA health care budget as mandatory rather than \nappropriated discretionary funding will hurt the ability of Congress to \nensure accountability within the system and consistency of benefits \nthroughout the country.\n  The modification attempts to control the outcome of the \nappropriations process by, in effect, establishing a cap in the amount \nappropriated by Congress in future years equal to the amount \nappropriated in fiscal year 2004, which is $28.3 billion. It further \nyields to the Comptroller General the responsibility of determining \nwhether adequate funding for veterans is achieved, and how to fund \nthese programs in future years.\n  Neither the original amendments, numbered 3408 or 3409, nor the \nmodification proposed by the Senator from South Dakota is relevant to \nthe Defense authorization bill. I hesitate to put that to my colleagues \nbut it is clearly a fact. The only relevance is the unity of spirit is \nthat of each of us in this chamber, and indeed I think the Congress, to \nshare in supporting our veterans nationwide.\n  These funding proposals contained in this amendment require the \ncareful deliberation of Congress to the appropriate committee of \njurisdiction, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, prior to further \naction by this body.\n  I yield the floor so my colleagues can address the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I rise in strong opposition to the Daschle amendment. I \nstrongly share the Senator's goal of improving health care and benefits \nfor our Nation's veterans. I think for a number of reasons this is a \nmisguided approach and will not achieve the desired goal of assuring \naccess for all veterans.\n  I speak to this with a good deal of experience. Currently, I am \nchairman of the Appropriations VA-HUD Subcommittee. This is the \ncommittee that funds the VA. Since 1995, I have been in the leadership \nas either the chairman or the ranking member, and I can assure my \ncolleagues that throughout that timeframe VA medical care has been a \ntop priority on a bipartisan basis for that committee. The VA has \nreceived from that committee very strong support for medical care.\n  Since 1998, VA medical care has increased by $11 billion, and since \n2001 it has increased by $7.3 billion, or 34.7 percent. That is a huge \nincrease, and we made those increases because there were needs. Under \nthe appropriations process, we can respond to those needs. That is why \nI think the Daschle amendment may have some questionable long-term \nimplications.\n  Under the current system of discretionary appropriations, the \nCongress has the flexibility to make the necessary funding adjustments \non an annual basis to respond to the challenging health care needs of \nveterans and to ensure proper accountability with the system so that \nveterans' needs are being adequately addressed.\n  Under the mandatory system proposed by the Senator from South Dakota, \nthere would be a fixed funding system based solely on enrollment levels \nand a contrived inflationary index. Further, discretionary \nappropriations would be capped at the 2004 appropriations level for VA \nmedical care. Let me go back and take a look. Here is something. I am \nreading from a chart that has been prepared by the Budget Committee. It \nshows, going back to 1993, that in that year, for example, the Consumer \nPrice Index, CPIU, hospital and related services, was up 8.37 percent. \nThe CPIU medical care was up 5.97 percent. But VA medical care was up \n9.1 percent in the appropriated accounts. In other words, if we had \nbeen using either of those formulas, we would have gotten less under \nthe formula than we actually got appropriated.\n\n  Of the last 10 years, there were 4 years--1996, 1997, 1998, and \n1999--when the index would have provided more. But overall, as I said, \nlet's go back to 2002. Then the highest index on medical care was 4.72 \npercent. The budget was increased 7.6 percent. In 2003, the hospital \nand related services index went up 7.36 percent, but the VA medical \ncare budget increases in the appropriations bill went up 12.3 percent. \nThat is almost a 5-percent higher rate of increase under the \nappropriations formula.\n  I think that shows the flexibility with which the appropriations \nprocess works. But there are other things we have to do in the \nappropriations bill. First, the funding formula creates an artificially \nfixed level. It doesn't reflect the unique medical care needs of \nveterans. The VA system was specifically created to respond to the \nunique needs of veterans who suffered health problems born on the \nbattlefield. VA provides special services for veterans who have been \nexposed to environmental hazards or toxic substances or suffered spinal \ncord injuries or loss of limbs. This is especially evident in our \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom we have met \nin Walter Reed Hospital to see the care they are getting in the regular \nmilitary hospitals.\n  But our veteran population is aging. They are going to need special \nlong-term care services not accounted for under the Daschle funding \nformula. Veterans in need of nursing home care are expected to increase \nfrom some 640,000 to over 1 million by 2012 and remain at that level \nuntil 2023.\n  More importantly, I think the mandatory funding option eliminates the \nstrongest tool of the Congress, the purse strings, to ensure \naccountability within the VA health care system. We are fortunate that \nthe VA now has a very strong leader who is a great administrator and \nwho is thoroughly committed to the needs of veterans, Secretary Tony \nPrincipi. He has made tremendous strides in improving the VA health \ncare system because he demands the VA be accountable and responsive to \nthe needs of veterans. Nevertheless, I have seen years where the VA has \nnot had the same kind of leadership that it has under Secretary \nPrincipi. I believe it is necessary and was necessary at previous times \nthat Congress have the ability to ensure the VA system is held \naccountable and makes the necessary reforms so they can provide timely, \nquality health care services to our Nation's veterans.\n  Even the President's task force acknowledges that providing \nsufficient funding to the VA will not by itself guarantee timely \naccess. Let me give an example. Over 10 years ago, we were able to push \nsuccessfully for improvements to health care access by forcing the VA \nto open more community-based outpatient facilities so veterans would \nnot be forced to drive hours to receive medical care. I know how \nimportant that is. In my home State of Missouri some veterans would \nspend a whole day driving to the veterans hospital in Colombia, MO, or \nSt. Louis or Kansas City. We found by adopting a system of community-\nbased health care clinics we could provide the services, the primary \ncare services, the pre-op services, in a setting that was less \nexpensive. We could take them in a hospital that is more accessible and \nsave much time and energy for the veterans, while ensuring they get the \nhealth care they need. We have been able to successfully push the VA to \ndevelop a comprehensive capital needs assessment, known as CARES, to \nrealign the VA care and medical infrastructure so the system is \nmodernized and located closer to where veterans live.\n\n  Many people have fulminated against the CARES process because its \npurpose is to look at unneeded veterans facilities. I have heard some \nstatements that are totally unwarranted, saying that the CARES project \nis going to take away needed facilities, needed care for veterans.\n  To the contrary, the whole concept of CARES was one that we pushed in \nour\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nAppropriations Committee and that the previous administration, the \nClinton administration, adopted. The General Accounting Office had \nfound that the VA is currently wasting $1 million per day on unneeded \nand empty buildings. That comes right out of the medical care budget. \nWhen you have a huge hospital that is 10-percent full, the costs are \nastronomical for serving that small population.\n  Under the CARES process, those services will be moved to a more \nappropriate structure, and the funds will then be used to provide \nservices, whether it is community outpatient services or some other \nspecific kind of service or just putting more money into the medical \nprofessionals to make sure the veterans get the health care they \ndeserve.\n  The GAO had found that more than 25 percent of veterans enrolled in \nVA health care, over 1.7 million veterans, live over 60 minutes driving \ntime from a VA hospital. Under the Daschle system, Congress would no \nlonger have the ability to force the VA to make the reforms necessary, \nas outlined under its CARES program, to improve care and access for our \nveterans. Instead, the system could build in waste and failure to be \nresponsive to the needs of those who are supposed to benefit from the \nsystem.\n  The third problem with the amendment is that the VA cannot spend all \nof the additional funds contemplated in the Daschle amendment due to \ninfrastructure and hiring concerns. The VA has an outdated and aging \ninfrastructure. That is why we are pushing the CARES program. In many \ncases, VA does not have the space to accommodate the needs of patients \nand health care workers. We need to make sure that money is funneled \ninto providing those facilities to meet the current and future needs of \nveterans rather than the facilities designed to meet the needs of \nveterans 40 years ago when their needs were very different and their \nlocations were very different.\n  In some hospitals, patients are forced to wait in hallways because of \nthe lack of waiting area space. As mentioned earlier, CARES will \naddress these infrastructure needs, but it is going to take years to \nimplement fully the CARES restructuring process. Further, many of my \ncolleagues know that there is a severe nursing shortage in this \ncountry. In some facilities, the VA is having a difficult time \nretaining and recruiting qualified nurses. The VA is also seeking \nphysician pay reform legislation because it is currently restricted in \nwhat it can pay for doctors, which hurts the VA's ability to recruit \nand pay doctors. Those are aspects on which we have to continue to \nwork.\n  Last, the Daschle amendment imposes a set ceiling on VA health \nfunding as opposed to the current system which has no ceiling and \nallows Congress to provide more funding as necessary.\n  As I said at the outset, we provided a 34.7-percent increase in VA \nhealth care funding since 2001. If the Daschle amendment had been in \nplace using the available indexes, the likelihood would be that there \nwould be at least 10-percent less funding that would be going to the VA \nas a result of the fixed mandatory funding system.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Daschle amendment. \nMembers can oppose the Daschle amendment and be concerned about the \nneeds of veterans and help us work to make sure veterans get the health \ncare they need, continuing to support our efforts in the Senate, in the \nAppropriations Committee, to get the kind of funding we need. We have \ndone so on a bipartisan basis. I intend to continue to work to do so.\n  However, we are going to have to have the flexibility to make sure we \nhold the VA accountable, to make sure they provide the services, and \nthat they make the changes necessary.\n  Funding is critical. I certainly agree with that. I am proud to say \nwe have succeeded in providing that funding over the past several \nyears. Funding, however, is not the sole antidote for the problems \naddressing the VA health care needs. We must ensure that the VA system \nremains responsive and accountable to our veterans.\n  I fear adoption of an amendment such as this would be an empty \npromise to our Nation's veterans who have special needs and demand a \nhealth care system that is accountable and responsive to their needs. \nOur system of checks and balances has played a critical role in \ntransforming the VA health care system which is now underway to \nensuring that we will be able to meet the health care needs of veterans \nwell into the 21st century.\n  The Daschle amendment significantly reduces the role of Congress in \nensuring improvements in reforms to the VA health care system so it is \nmore accountable to the needs of the veterans. By capping the \ndiscretionary amount of appropriations at the 2004 level, our hands \nwould be tied in making adjustments to the funding needs of our \nveterans. This is especially dangerous considering the hundreds of \nthousands of troops currently deployed across the globe fighting the \nwar on terror and in Iraq. I strongly believe in putting the needs of \nveterans first.\n  Those needs are not best served by these amendments which would, in \nmy opinion, based on my experience working with the system, hurt our \nability to meet that goal. That is why I close by urging my colleagues \nnot to support the amendment by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n                     TREATMENT OF FOREIGN PRISONERS\n\n       Sec.  . Policy.--(a)(1) It is the policy of the United \n     States to treat all foreign persons captured, detained, \n     interned or otherwise held in the custody of the United \n     States (hereinafter ``prisoners'') humanely and in accordance \n     with standards that the United States would consider legal if \n     perpetrated by the enemy against an American prisoner.\n       (2) It is the policy of the United States that all \n     officials of the United States are bound both in wartime and \n     in peacetime by the legal prohibition against torture, cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment.\n       (3) If there is any doubt as to whether prisoners are \n     entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva \n     Conventions, such prisoners shall enjoy the protections of \n     the Geneva Conventions until such time as their status can be \n     determined pursuant to the procedures authorized by Army \n     Regulation 190-8, Section 1-6.\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\n       (4) It is the policy of the United States to expeditiously \n     prosecute cases of terrorism or other criminal acts alleged \n     to have been committed by prisoners in the custody of the \n     United States Armed Forces at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order \n     to avoid the indefinite detention of prisoners, which is \n     contrary to the legal principles and security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (b) Reporting.--The Department of Defense shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees:\n       (1) A quarterly report providing the number of prisoners \n     who were denied Prisoner of War (POW) status under the Geneva \n     Conventions and the basis for denying POW status to each such \n     prisoner.\n       (2) A report setting forth: (A) the proposed schedule for \n     military commissions to be held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and \n     (B) the number of individuals currently held at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, the number of such individuals who are unlikely to \n     face a military commission in the next six months, and the \n     reason(s) for not bringing such individuals before a military \n     commission.\n       (3) All International Committee of the Red Cross reports, \n     completed prior to the enactment of this Act, concerning the \n     treatment of prisoners in United States custody at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Such ICRC reports should be \n     provided, in classified form, not later than 15 days after \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (4) A report setting forth all prisoner interrogation \n     techniques approved by officials of the United States.\n       (c) Annual Training Requirement.--The Department of Defense \n     shall certify that all federal employees and civilian \n     contractors engaged in the handling and/or interrogating of \n     prisoners have fulfilled an annual training requirement on \n     the laws of war, the Geneva Conventions and the obligations \n     of the United States under international humanitarian law.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3469\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in relation \nto that amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can I ask, is this a modification to the Leahy amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to interpose an objection.\n  Mr. REID. There is no objection in order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine; I understand.\n  Mr. REID. Is there?\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment has to be reported first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3469 to amendment No. 3387.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Attorney General to submit to the Committee on \n  the Judiciary of the Senate all documents in the possession of the \n Department of Justice relating to the treatment and interrogation of \n         individuals held in the custody of the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS.\n\n       The Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate all documents and records produced \n     from January 20, 2001, to the present, and in the possession \n     of the Department of Justice, describing, referring or \n     relating to the treatment or interrogation of prisoners of \n     war, enemy combatants, and individuals held in the custody or \n     under the physical control of the United States Government or \n     an agent of the United States Government in connection with \n     investigations or interrogations by the military, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, intelligence, antiterrorist or \n     counterterrorist offices in other agencies, or cooperating \n     governments, and the agents or contractors of such agencies \n     or governments.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will have a period for consideration \nof the bill for the purpose of debate only. No amendments will be \noffered until we clarify how we might resolve our parliamentary \nsituation.\n  I have to say our distinguished chairman has done an outstanding job \nin getting us to this point, as has our ranking member. I am very \nconcerned that as close as we are to completion, we have not been able \nnow to move forward. We have only had two votes on this bill so far \ntoday. It is now 4 o'clock. I have laid down an amendment. I am willing \nto do a side-by-side, if necessary. We have other legislation pending.\n  I was told we cannot have a vote on my amendment because the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, is in town, and we cannot allow him to \nparachute down and have a vote. I think that is very unfortunate. He is \nhere to vote, and I would think we would accord every Senator the right \nand opportunity to vote on this amendment and whatever other pending \nlegislation.\n  We can finish this bill. We have already agreed under unanimous \nconsent to finish this bill for debate purposes by the end of the day. \nAll we have left are whatever amendments are going to be offered \nbetween now and 6:30 p.m. We are so close. I only hope we consider the \nadmonition of both of our managers, that we work together as we have \nfor the last many days now to complete our work.\n  Let's have a vote on the veterans amendment, let's have a vote on the \nother pending legislation, and let's move forward with these amendments \nin the same good faith we have demonstrated to date. We could have been \nfar more confrontational with regard to unrelated amendments. We have \nnot done that. At the urging of Democratic leadership, we have withheld \nmany of those amendments. I hope we would show the same good faith as \nwe complete this bill.\n  Senator Kerry ought to have a chance to vote. There ought to be an \nopportunity to dispose of these amendments. How ironic it is that we \nare the ones who appear to want to finish, and certainly our manager \nwants to finish, but there are those on the other side, for whatever \nreason, who are unwilling, reluctant to allow us the votes that are \npending on the amendments that have now been laid down.\n  I urge reconsideration of that point of view at this point. It is \ncounterproductive. It says all the wrong things about the desire to \ncomplete our work before the end of this week with all we have to do. I \nurge my colleagues to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I must respectfully say to my good friend, \nthe Democratic leader, that I have to take a different view with regard \nto the situation on Senator Kerry. I listened to, I thought, most of \nthe conversations, and I do not feel that is the situation. I have \ntried, and I propose trust in our colleagues on the other side.\n  I say I was negligent in allowing the first-degree amendment to come \nup and be second degreed. I felt it was another first-degree amendment \nbeing offered. It was not announced as a second-degree amendment. I \ntried to interject, but the parliamentary situation did not allow me to \nget a quorum call in to ascertain the situation.\n  What is past is past. But I do not want it to stand that on this side \nof the aisle I see a lot of attempt to block, whether it is Kerry or \nanybody else, from making votes here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am not sure to which second-degree \namendment the distinguished chairman is referring.\n  Mr. WARNER. It was a Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If we can get a vote, we can certainly accommodate the \nSenator from Virginia. All we are looking for is a vote. It does not \nhave to be on this particular amendment. If he wants to offer a second-\ndegree amendment, we are certainly willing to look at ways with which \nto accommodate the majority in that regard. But a vote is important. It \nis relevant, of course. It ought to be offered.\n  As to the Kerry matter, I do not know if the distinguished chairman \nheard--he was standing here--Senator Frist noted to me as he was \nstanding here that he did not want to accord Senator Kerry the \nopportunity to vote today, knowing, of course, Senator Kerry was here \ntoday.\n  We can work through these issues if we can demonstrate a little more \npatience and a little more good will, and we can get the job done.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. In years past, when Senator Dole was running for President,\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\nwhen he was still here, we went out of our way to make sure Senator \nDole had the opportunity to do whatever he wanted to do. If he wanted \nto vote on one, two, three, or four items, we made sure he had that \nsame opportunity. It was the same with Senator McCain when he was \nrunning. We went out of our way to make sure when they were here they \nwere protected.\n  Will the distinguished Democratic leader agree this is somewhat \nunusual that Senator Kerry, who feels this veterans amendment is \nimportant--he is a distinguished, decorated veteran. He feels he should \nbe here to vote on the amendment. Isn't that somewhat unusual?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First of all, I share the recollection of the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader. Yes, we did accommodate \nthose who had to travel for purposes of national campaigns in past \nelections. One would think we would do so in this case. We are trying \nto govern. We have the campaigns to run. One would hope we could keep \nthe campaigns off the Senate floor.\n  It is ironic that some in the majority who have been pressing to get \nthis legislation done now keep us from getting it done for that reason. \nWe have wasted a couple of hours here. We could have finished this \namendment and moved on. I think everybody agrees we need to finish this \nlegislation. No one has worked harder at it than the distinguished \nchairman. But now we are being told we cannot do that. I did not know \nit was finished unless it involves giving Senator Kerry a chance to \nvote. It is not the right thing to do. We know that.\n  I hope we come to our senses and get on with getting the business of \nthe Senate done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before this colloquy started--I think we \nhave pretty much completed it, and we have different perspectives--we \nencouraged those Senators to come up and debate those amendments which \nare at the desk so we could have debate on them, but no further \namendments in the first and second degree would be sent to the desk. I \nthink that is a gentleman's understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the points I am disappointed in and \nconcerned about is I do not want the Senator from Virginia--he and I \nhave worked together for two decades--I do not want the Senator from \nVirginia to think in any way that I tricked him or misled him or \ndeceived him. That is why during the time we were here together I said \nI would be willing to withdraw the second-degree amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia must understand that the amendment will \ncome up again because we have a right to offer that amendment, and \nwhether it is offered by me, Senator Leahy, or by whomever, it will be \noffered at some subsequent time.\n  I get the feeling, in talking to the Senators who were representing \nthe majority, that simply because we were going to require a vote on \nthis there would not be any more movement on this bill, and that is not \nproductive. So my point is the offer is still there. The Senator from \nVirginia should understand that I would be willing to withdraw the \nsecond-degree amendment that is in my name but the Senator should \nunderstand that it will recur at some subsequent time.\n  Under the rules, there is no way it can be stopped, and even though \nthe Senator was not aware of my offering the second-degree amendment, \nand I told him in privacy why I did this--I did not hide anything about \nwhy I did it when I did it, and I have no reservation about having done \nit--perhaps having disappointed the Senator from Virginia I would be \nhappy to withdraw that, recognizing that at some subsequent time we are \ngoing to have a vote on it. The best way to do it would be to \nacknowledge at this time that there would be a vote on it and have a \nvote on whatever the Senator might want to do, if he decides to second-\ndegree the Leahy amendment and have the Leahy first degree and second \ndegree voted on, because that is ultimately what will happen if we are \never going to finish this bill, unless cloture is invoked.\n  So I would like a comment from the distinguished chairman as to \nwhether he would want me to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point in time I think we better go back to the \noriginal posture of the agreement we reached that we would at this \npoint in time this afternoon just continue debate on matters pending at \nthe desk.\n  Mr. REID. I want the Record to be clearly spread with the fact that \nif the Senator from Virginia feels that I misled, deceived, or tricked \nhim in any way that I will withdraw my amendment. So the Senator \nunderstands that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not wish to use any of those words. All I recall \nvery clearly when I quickly came on the floor, the Senator had the \nfloor, Senator Bond had yielded the floor to the Senator from Nevada--I \nthought he was managing--and the Senator from Nevada said he wanted to \nsend up amendments on behalf of Senators Akaka and Leahy. I said, fine, \nthat is within the rules, and that the Senator did but he did not \nindicate that there would be a third amendment in the nature of--\n  Mr. REID. So all the Senator has to do is say he wants me to withdraw \nmy second-degree amendment and I will be happy to do that, recognizing \nthat if I do not offer it somebody else will at some subsequent time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand clearly the Senator has the same rights as \nall Senators as it relates to this amendment, but at this point in time \nour side is trying to deliberate the posture we are in and I am going \nto have to remain on the floor. Others will come and send for me when I \nam ready to make my contribution, but at this time I have no other \ncolleagues on the floor so I am just going to remain. I suggest we just \ngo ahead and debate those matters at the desk.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment I offered dealing with a \nrequest for documents and records basically says:\n\n       The Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate all documents and records produced \n     from January 20, 2001, to the present, and in possession of \n     the Department of Justice, describing, referring or relating \n     to the treatment or interrogation of prisoners of war, enemy \n     combatants, and individuals held in the custody or under the \n     physical control of the United States Government or an agent \n     of the United States Government in connection with \n     investigations or interrogations by the military, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, intelligence, antiterrorist or \n     counterterrorist offices in other agencies, or cooperating \n     governments, and the agents or contractors of such agencies \n     or governments.\n\n  Because of my longstanding work with the Senator from Virginia--I \nstarted out as a new Senator on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and he was the chairman of the subcommittee there and he \nalways looked after me and extended to me more courtesies than probably \nhe should have, and all my dealings with the Senator from Virginia have \nbeen most courteous; I think he is really a gentleman and I know he is \ntoo proud to say that he wants me to withdraw this--and because he has \nnot asked me to withdraw it because I think down deep he thinks that I \nperhaps did something I should not have done, I do not want anything to \noccur--I am doing this as a personal thing between the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Nevada, but of course, as I indicated, I \nor somebody else will offer this at some subsequent time.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3469 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3469 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand there is a general agreement that we will at \nthis point in time not be sending any additional amendments to the \ndesk, but Senators will debate those that are pending and debate those \nthat may be offered at some point during the course of the day.\n  Am I not correct on that?\n  Mr. REID. Of course, this agreement would only go until 6:20.\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is understood.\n  I ask unanimous consent that between now and the hour of 6:20, the \nSenate proceed to allow Senators to speak for up to, say, 15 minutes \nwith regard to pending amendments or amendments that they may intend to \noffer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I assume that if we can \nwork something out and amendments can be disposed of between now and \n6:20, that would then be accomplished.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will take each one and examine it on its own \nindividual basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is just listed \nin the understanding on Iraq. I have talked both with the chairman of \nthe committee and the ranking member of the committee, and I was \nprepared to offer it and debate it during the course of the afternoon \nand to indicate a willingness to enter into a time agreement. It is a \nvery important amendment. I will be glad to follow what the \narrangements are between the chairman of our committee and the ranking \nmember of the committee as a way to proceed. It is somewhat difficult \nwith an amendment of this kind of importance to have only 15 minutes \nand others come during that 15 minutes. I guess we will get a chance to \ndevelop it further, but I want to speak to the amendment now and then \nfollow the recommendations of the floor managers as to when we will \ncome back and either debate this or work out a suitable time, because \nit is an important amendment.\n  I will take a moment of the Senate's time to express, quite frankly, \nmy appreciation to the Senator from Nevada in offering the amendment \nthat he had, which he did a few moments ago as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee. We know there are four committees which are in one \nway or another looking at the prisoner abuse scandal and tragedy. We \nhave the Intelligence Committee that is looking at it. They are very \nmuch tied up with the 9/11 Commission that has made its report. We had \nthe Foreign Relations Committee that had not had hearings on it. We \nhave the Armed Services Committee under the leadership of Senator \nWarner, which has done a first rate job trying to work through this \nwhole dilemma. He is recognized by the members of the committee, and by \nothers, as someone who has worked toward trying to find the facts on \nthis situation. And there is the Judiciary Committee. We have seen in \nthe published reports a number of memoranda were developed by the \nJustice Department as to the responsibility that the Executive has \nunder these circumstances of recommending, roughly, under his ability \nas Commander in Chief, that he may very well be immune from any kind of \nrules, regulations, or orders that he might support in terms of the \ntreatment of prisoners.\n\n  That concept runs counter to the view of 500 constitutional lawyers \nwho issued a press release raising very serious constitutional issues \nand questions.\n  What the Judiciary Committee has been attempting to do is to review \nthe various recommendations that have been developed by the Justice \nDepartment and the other agencies. It has been an interagency effort. \nThis is not just the Justice Department advising the President on a \nmatter of an Executive order. As a matter of fact, it was very clear \nduring the hearing of the Judiciary Committee that the Attorney General \ndid not claim executive privilege. But there was the incident where the \nAttorney General said that even though he is not claiming executive \nprivilege, and even though he is not quoting a statute that might make \nhim exempt from making these documents available, he still was refusing \nto make them available.\n  We had a brief discussion during the course of the committee hearing \nas to whether that was contempt of Congress. We are not trying to get \ninto that whole situation. We are just trying to find out what these \ndocuments said in the interagency agreements that were being developed.\n  Now we are told this afternoon that approximately 3 of the documents \nof the 23 that were actually requested are available to the committee. \nTwo of those are already on the Internet.\n  This is a matter of enormous importance and consequence. The American \npeople see on television and hear on the radio and read in the \nnewspapers about prison policy over there. We have recommendations made \nby the Justice Department, and there is a refusal to cooperate with the \nCongress. It is entirely appropriate that this institution have access \nto that material. That was the purpose of the amendment that was \noffered by the Senator from Nevada. It was entirely appropriate. I find \nit very necessary. There are many important matters in this Defense \nauthorization bill. But it certainly seems this is a matter of very \nimportant consequence.\n  I believe the amendment still has great importance and relevance. I \nthink the Senate ought to know what the Senator from Nevada was \ninvolved in is not only an honorable position but also a necessary one. \nBut as he pointed out, we are now trying to move the process forward in \nterms of the Defense authorization bill.\n  I ask if I can have the full amount of time now to address the \nsubstance. Do I understand we have 15 minutes? Could I ask for 15 \nminutes? I ask consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to 15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3377\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, at an appropriate time \nI will call up amendment No. 3377. I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on June 30, sovereignty in Iraq will be \ntransferred to the interim government. For the sake of the Iraqi people \nand our nearly 140,000 troops in Iraq, we all hope that the interim \ngovernment will succeed, that its appointment begins a new stage in \nIraq in which the security situation will improve at long last for our \ntroops, and that we will no longer see a continuation of the \nadministration's flawed policy that has generated so much turmoil in \nthe past year and so many casualties for our forces.\n  Unfortunately, the violence continues. Twenty-two American soldiers \nhave been killed in the 22 days since the announcement of the interim \ngovernment. More than 450 American soldiers have been wounded in that \nperiod.\n  Even with the transfer of sovereignty and the recent United Nations \nresolution on the Iraqi transition, the key question is, when will the \nviolence stop? When will the international community join us in \nsecuring and reconstructing Iraq? Or will the bulls-eye remain on the \nback of every member of our armed forces in Iraq?\n  The amendment I am offering today with Senators Levin, Byrd, Leahy, \nDayton, and Feingold seeks answers to these questions.\n  Our amendment requires the President to tell the American people \nwhether or when the administration's policy will bring more \ninternational troops, police, and resources to Iraq. That's what we owe \nto our forces. That's what we owe to their families. And that's what we \nowe to the American people.\n  The amendment requires the President to submit a report to Congress \non the administration's plan for the security and reconstruction of \nIraq no later than 30 days after the date of enactment of the bill.\n  The report must address whether and when the administration's \nstrategy of working with the United Nations and other nations will \nbring more international troops, police, and resources to Iraq and \nprovide relief to the men and women of our armed forces. It must assess \nthe administration's strategy for strengthening the Iraqi police and \nmilitary, its reconstruction efforts, and its progress toward \ndemocratic elections. And it must provide an estimate--an estimate--of \nthe number of American troops we anticipate will be in Iraq at the end \nof next year.\n  Two subsequent reports will provide updated assessments--one 6 months \nafter the bill becomes law and the other just before the end of 2005.\n  This week, President Bush will travel to Ireland for a summit between \nthe United States and the member nations of the European Union. He will \nalso attend a NATO summit in Istanbul. We all hope he will succeed in \npersuading the international community to join us in a more significant \nway in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the likelihood of that happening--even with the \ntransfer of sovereignty and a new UN resolution--is far from clear. At \nbest, the administration now expects that our allies in Iraq will not \nwithdraw any of their current troops from the coalition.\n  On June 7, just a day before the UN approved the resolution \nsupporting the interim government in Iraq National Security Advisor \nRice said:\n\n       I don't expect that there will be a large infusion of more \n     foreign forces. In fact, I think that what you will see, is \n     that some of the countries that have had particularly \n     difficult situations, some of our coalition partners, will \n     find this resolution makes them capable of staying the \n     course.\n\n  On June 10, after the G-8 Summit, President Bush said that he didn't:\n\n       . . . expect more troops from NATO to be offered up. That's \n     an unrealistic expectation. nobody is suggesting that.\n\n  Those were his words.\n  On June 13, Secretary of State Powell said the same thing:\n\n       We're not expecting major additional contributions of \n     troops from our NATO allies beyond the 16 nations that are \n     already involved.\n\n  The message from the administration is loud and clear: We'll stay the \ncourse, but we don't expect any more international troops. America will \ncontinue to be the only major military presence on the ground in Iraq.\n  American soldiers have been bearing a grossly disproportionate share \nof the burden for far too long.\n\n       No policy in Iraq can be considered effective if it fails \n     to bring in the international community in a way that reduces \n     the burden on our men and women in uniform, and takes the \n     American face off the military occupation in Iraq.\n\n  As General Abizaid told the Armed Services Committee on May 19--there \nare not enough troops from other nations in Iraq. The ``effort needs to \nbe not just American, but it needs to be international.''\n  The administration had a brilliant plan to win the war, but it had no \nplan to win the peace. That failure has been putting a severe strain on \nour military and their loved ones left behind in America.\n  Mr. President, 830 American soldiers have paid the ultimate price in \nIraq.\n  More than 5,130 soldiers have been sounded.\n  America has nearly 90 percent of the troops on the ground, and more \nthan 95 percent of the killed and wounded have been Americans.\n  The war is now costing us $4.7 billion every month.\n  In fact, the burden on U.S. troops has been increasing, since first \nSpain, then Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador pulled their troops \nout of Iraq.\n  More than a quarter of the current forces in Iraq are reservists, as \nare nearly half the current forces in Kuwait. Eighteen percent of our \nactive duty Army is serving in Iraq, and 16 of our 33 combat brigades \nare serving there.\n  The Army is now under a stop-loss order that prevents troops from \nleaving active duty while deployed to Iraq, and for another 90 days \nafter returning to their home bases.\n  The average tour of duty for a reservist recalled to active duty is \nnow 320 days--ten months. According to the Department of Defense, the \naverage tour of duty for a reservist during the first Gulf war was 156 \ndays. In the deployments in Bosnia, and Kosovo, it was 200 days.\n  An Army brigade commander recently spoke about the exasperation of \nour soldiers: ``A soldier just said to me, `what happened to the \nvolunteer force? This is a draft.' ''\n  Others in the military leadership have spoken out on the strain on \nthe military.\n  On January 21, LTG James R. Helmly, head of the Army Reserves, \ndiscussed the effect on reservists. He said, ``the 205,000 soldier \nforce must guard against a potential crisis in its ability to retain \ntroops.'' He said that serious problems are being masked temporarily \nbecause reservists are barred from leaving the military.\n  The same day, LTG John Riggs also spoke of the strain. He said, ``I \nhave been in the Army 39 years, and I've never seen the Army as \nstretched in that 39 years as I have today.''\n  On February 5, GEN Peter Schoomaker, the Army Chief of Staff said, \n``There is no question that the Army is stressed.''\n  On June 2, GEN Franklin L. Hagenbeck, the Army's deputy chief of \nstaff in charge of human resources and personnel, said that the Army is \n``stretched.''\n  These are the cold, hard facts. They cannot be glossed over. If we \ncontinue to go it alone, the mission is impossible. The need is urgent \nto bring in the international community in Iraq in a major way. It may \nwell be that only a new President in the White House will be able to \npersuade other nations to trust us enough to participate in the \ndifficult and dangerous mission.\n  In fact, the need for international participation was abundantly \nclear before we went to war. As former Secretary of State James Baker \nwrote on August 25, 2002, ``The costs in all areas will be much \ngreater, as will the political risks, both domestic and international, \nif we end up going it alone, or with only one or two other countries.''\n\n       Last July, by the unanimous vote of 97-0, the Senate \n     approved an amendment urging the President to consider \n     requesting formally and expeditiously that NATO organize a \n     force for deployment in post-war Iraq similar to the NATO \n     forces in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo.\n       We also asked the President to consider calling on the \n     United Nations to urge its member states to provide military \n     forces and civilian police to promote stability and security \n     in Iraq, and provide resources to help rebuild and administer \n     Iraq.\n\n  President Bush says that the administration is working with the \ninternational community. But what are the results? Are more nations \nsending troops, police, and resources? When will the American face be \ntaken off the occupying force? When will Iraq be more secure? When will \nmore American soldiers return home? How long, and how heavy will the \nburden be? Will the President obtain additional foreign commitments for \ntroops and resources at the Summits with the European Union and NATO in \nthe coming days or will he return empty-handed once again?\n  The American people and our soldiers serving in Iraq deserve to know \nthe results of the administration's efforts to work with the \ninternational community.\n  All we are asking in this amendment is a progress report from the \nPresident on the administration's efforts to work with the \ninternational community. All we are asking is how many troops we expect \nto have in Iraq in coming months.\n  Given the high stakes, the President should provide the information. \nOur troops deserve it, America deserves it, and the Iraqi people \ndeserve it.\n  I will mention past precedent for this proposal because we will hear \nfrom those opposed to it that we do not really have as much time as we \nshould, 30 days after the bill is passed. We are going to be, \nhopefully, concluding this bill. It will take the better part of the \nmonth prior to the time we recess for the August break to be able to \nconclude, I expect, the conference. The President may sign that then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I get 5 more minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand the Senator from Vermont is eager to talk. \nI will conclude and come back to this, if I can have 4 more minutes to \nconclude.\n  I draw the attention of Members to the precedence in 1995; the \nDefense authorization bill required assessing the implication of the \nU.S. military readiness, the participation of ground forces in Bosnia. \nIt had to include 11 estimates of the total number of forces required \nto carry out the operation, estimates of the duration of the operation, \nestimates of the cost, and how many Reserve units would be necessary \nfor the operation. This was true in 1997; this was true in 1998; it was \ntrue in 1999. There are all kinds of precedents for this.\n  We are entitled to this information. This amendment will make sure we \nwill be able to receive it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will say that I agree with the second-\ndegree amendment the Senator from Massachusetts has temporarily \nwithdrawn. Obviously it will be reoffered. The reason I agree, Congress \nnot only has done a very poor job of oversight; with some\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\nexceptions, the administration has taken advantage of that and made it \na practice to deny oversight cooperation to Congress.\n  The stonewalling in the prison abuse scandal has been building to a \ncrisis point. Today, finally, after huge pressure, the White House has \nreleased a small subset of the documents that offer glimpses into the \ngenesis of this scandal. All should have been provided earlier to \nCongress. We know a lot has been held back, and remains hidden from \npublic view.\n  While this is a self-serving selection on the part of the \nadministration, it is at least a beginning, a tiny beginning, a tiny \nbaby step. But if we want the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to \nfind the whole truth, we will need much more cooperation and extensive \nhearings.\n  The documents released today raise more questions than they answer. I \nwill give some examples, speaking now of the documents released today.\n  The White House released only 3 of the 23 documents that members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee requested and tried to subpoena last \nweek. In having released only 3 of the 23 we asked for, I point out \nthat 2 of the 3 were already available on the Internet. Where are the \nother 20 documents we asked for? They have given us one that was not \nalready on the Internet. Where are the other 20?\n  The White House released a Presidential memorandum dated February 7, \n2002, directing that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be treated \nhumanely. Did the President sign any directive regarding the treatment \nor interrogation of detainees after February 7, 2002, more than 2 years \nago? More specifically, did the President sign any directive after the \nUnited States invaded Iraq in March of 2003?\n  The latest document released by the White House is dated April 16th, \n2003. Why is that, when many of the worst abuses that we know of \noccurred months later, in the fall of 2003. Why has the White House \nstopped with memoranda produced in April 2003?\n\n  I live on the side of a mountain in Vermont. I know that water flows \ndownhill, but so does Government policy. Somewhere in the upper reaches \nof this administration a process was set in motion that seeped forward \nuntil it produced a scandal.\n  All of us want to put the scandal behind us, but to do that we have \nto know what happened. And we cannot get to the bottom of this until \nthere is a clear picture of what happened at the top. We need to keep \nthe pressure on until we get honesty and answers. So I will support \nSenator Kennedy's second-degree amendment when it is offered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator agree with me it is time for the \nadministration to level with the American people on this issue?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, it is time to level with the American people. We tried \nto subpoena these records last week. We were rebuffed on a party-line \nvote, with many on the other side saying: But they are going to be \nforthcoming. We now get 3 out of 23 documents, 2 of which were already \non the Internet.\n  When are they going to be forthcoming? We want to understand what \nhappened. As I said, if you are going to get to the bottom of what \nhappened, you have to start at the top. President Bush has said he \nwants to get to the bottom of this. I agree with him, but I think we \nhave to start at the top to find out what happened there. And simply \nprosecuting some corporals and sergeants and privates does not get to \nthe bottom of what happened.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, if the Senator will yield, I remember our \nranking member being at that hearing. The Attorney General was asked \nwhether he was asserting executive privilege, and he said no. Then it \nwas pointed out by members that there are times when the Attorney \nGeneral does not have to respond because it is spelled out in statute \nthat he does not have to respond. But that was not the case. So it is a \ncircumstance that the Attorney General of the United States felt he \nwould not respond to these requests on the basis of his own actions.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that there is no one who is above \nthe law in the system of jurisprudence in the United States of America? \nThe continued unwillingness to provide these documents is certainly \ngoing to prolong the agony of the administration in terms of its \nwillingness to cooperate with the committee. And would he not agree \nwith me it is better to get that material here and get the instance \nbehind us?\n  I remember--if the Senator will permit me to continue--I had the good \nopportunity to meet the new President of Iraq. I asked him about the \nprison scandal. I asked: What can the United States do in order to deal \nwith this issue? He said: It is very clear. You have to complete the \ninvestigation for which your country is noted. You have to complete the \nreview and hold those accountable who are responsible. When that \nhappens, Iraqis will take a new look at this country.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that was good guidance and good \nadvice, and that it ought to be followed, and that it is going to be \nimpossible to follow as long as they refuse to cooperate with the \ncommittee?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely right. I also had the good fortune to meet with the new \ninterim President of Iraq. I actually asked him a similar question, and \nwhat the Senator from Massachusetts says is absolutely so. He said: Get \nit all out. He spoke of making it as transparent as possible. He said: \nThe United States has always had a reputation of being honest, of being \na democratic nation, of admitting our mistakes, and, of course, of \nbeing proud of those things we have accomplished that we can be so \nproud of. If we want to maintain that credibility, get it all out.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said that in our system, nobody is \nabove the law. I thank God that is so, that the Founders of this \ncountry were wise enough to set in place a system where nobody--\nnobody--was above the law. We have demonstrated this over and over \nagain throughout our history as a nation. Anybody who has tried to step \nabove it, the checks and balances stop that.\n  What the administration can do is so easy: Answer the questions. The \nAttorney General refused to answer our questions. But he did not do it \non the basis of any of the very limited reasons that a question might \nbe refused--either because the information being sought is classified, \nwhich requires us to go into closed session, or because the President \nhas asserted executive privilege, which the President did not in this \ncase.\n  They have sent up 3 of the 23 items we requested. Two of the 3 items \nwere already on the Internet. But at least we are one item forward. \nLet's get the rest of the information and documents up here, and then \nlet the Senate do what it should do: Let the various committees \nactually ask questions and seek answers.\n  Mr. President, I see my good friend from Pennsylvania on the floor \nseeking recognition, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition on the pending legislation, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may speak up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I join my colleague and ranking member on \nthe Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Vermont, as well as my \ncolleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, in expressing support for \nthe amendment we\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\nwill vote upon either tonight or tomorrow, and to express my \ndispleasure that the documents that we have received are so inadequate \nin terms of what we have requested.\n  The first point I will make is, don't let anybody think that because \nthis is a thick pile, it really has the nub of the matter. It does not.\n  The bottom line is that I would say that an ounce of disclosure is \ngoing to buy this White House a pound of problems. These documents \nraise more questions than they answer. The White House is better off \ncoming clean and releasing all relevant and nonclassified documents.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, we have asked the administration for 23 \nspecific documents as a starting point. Of the 13 the White House \nreleased today, only 3 are among those we asked for; 3 out of 23 is not \na very good average. It is not even a good batting average, and we are \npretty lenient there when we are above a third.\n  It seems painfully clear that this administration devised a \nstrained--some would say tortured--new definition of torture. Then \nsomeone in the administration authorized the use of new ``interrogation \ntechniques'' that would have run afoul of the old definition of torture \nbut under the new definition were permissible.\n  Anybody who thinks those line soldiers at Abu Ghraib were acting on \ntheir own initiative must have his head in the sand.\n  It is absolutely unacceptable that the actions of a few in our \nmilitary and our Government have brought shame on the 99.9 percent of \nour troops who serve us so honorably and well and are fighting for the \nfreedom of the Iraqi people.\n  We must not compound that error by letting a few soldiers at the \nbottom of the line take the fall if authorities higher up gave them the \ngreen light.\n  This matter must be pursued no matter where it leads, no matter how \nhigh it goes. If anyone at the Cabinet level or in the White House \nopened the door to the kind of abuse we saw in those pictures from Abu \nGhraib, it is time to own up to it.\n  The credibility of the administration is on the line and the release \nof a handful of documents simply doesn't do the job.\n  I will repeat that it is not enough to release a few inches of \ndocuments. The White House should publicly disclose all relevant and \nnonclassified documents. Relevant classified documents should be \nprovided to the Judiciary Committee and Armed Services Committee so we \ncan get to the bottom of this.\n  Mr. President, I am aware of the difficulties in these situations. We \nare in the post-9/11 world, a brave new world. Sometimes things do have \nto change and be adjusted. We don't know where the balance should be \nexactly. That is the difficulty. But one thing I know for sure is that \nthere should be debate as to what methods of interrogation should be \nallowed and used because that deals with the fundamental balance of \nsecurity and liberty, and that is the balance the Founding Fathers \nfocused on probably more than any other. That is the balance; they \nwanted open debate.\n\n  So the thing I am sure of is not where you draw the line. I think \nanybody who says that is certainly making a mistake. Rather, the thing \nI am certain of is, if there is open debate and discussion between the \nexecutive and legislative branches, which is what the Founding Fathers \nmost certainly intended, we will almost inevitably end up in these most \nserious and delicate matters with a very good solution.\n  The problem, of course, is this: The Justice Department and the \nAttorney General have a penchant for secrecy. They have avoided at all \ncosts open debate and discussion. The results almost always inevitably \nboomerang on them, and they end up having to backtrack anyway, but in a \nway that doesn't do justice and do right for the people they represent \nand for America and the world.\n  So the bottom line is this: At the end of the day, if we don't know \nwho authorized what, when it was authorized, and whether it explains \nwhy the detainees at Abu Ghraib were treated the way they were, then \nthe job is simply not done.\n  I thank my colleagues from Vermont, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and \nIllinois for their leadership on this issue and encourage my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3400\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first, I will call up my amendment, and \nI ask that it then be set aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is a UC in effect which indicates \nthere will be no more amendments that will be taken up at the desk. The \nSenator can speak to any amendment that is pending or another matter, \nbut as far as transactions with the Presiding Officer at this time, \nthey are not in order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand, and I wish to speak about \nan amendment that will be offered later, amendment No. 3400. It is an \namendment I am cosponsoring with Senators Murray, Dayton, Corzine, \nDurbin, and Lautenberg.\n  My amendment would bring a small measure of relief to the families of \nour brave military personnel who are being deployed for the ongoing \nfight against terrorism, the war in Iraq, and other missions in this \ncountry and around the world. It is actually an amendment the Senate \nadopted unanimously to last year's Iraq supplemental spending bill, and \nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure again this \nyear.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces undertake enormous sacrifices \nin their service to our country. They spend time away from home and \nfrom their families in different parts of the country and different \nparts of the world and are placed in harm's way in order to protect the \nAmerican people and our way of life. We owe them a huge debt of \ngratitude for their dedicated service.\n  The ongoing deployments for the fight against terrorism and for the \ncampaign in Iraq are turning upside down the lives of thousands of \nActive-Duty National Guard and Reserve personnel and their families as \nthey seek to do their duty to their country and honor their commitments \nto their families, and, in the case of the Reserve components, to their \nemployers as well. Today, there are more than 160,000 National Guard \nand Reserve personnel on active duty.\n  Some of my constituents are facing the latest in a series of \nactivations and deployments for family members who serve our country in \nthe military. Others are seeing their loved ones off on their first \ndeployment. All of these families share in the worry and concern about \nwhat awaits their relatives and hope, as we do, for their swift and \nsafe return.\n  Recently, many of those deployed in Iraq have had their tour extended \nbeyond the time they had expected to stay. Sometimes this extension has \nplayed havoc with the lives of those deployed and their families. \nWorried mothers, fathers, spouses, and children expecting their loved \nones home after more than a year of service must now wait another 3 or \n4 months before their loved ones' much anticipated homecoming. The \nemotional toll is huge. So is the impact on a family's daily \nfunctioning, as bills still need to be paid, children need to get to \nschool events, and sick family members have to be cared for.\n  Our men and women in uniform face these challenges without complaint, \nbut we should do more to help them and their families with the many \nthings that preparing to be deployed requires.\n  During the first round of mobilizations for operations in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, military personnel and their families were given only a \ncouple days' notice that their units would be deployed. As a result, \nthese dedicated men and women had only a very limited amount of time to \nget their lives in order. For members of the National Guard and \nReserve, this included informing their employers of the deployment. I \ncommend the many employers around the country for their understanding \nand support when their employees were called to active duty.\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\n  In preparation for deployment, military families often have to \nscramble to arrange for childcare, to pay bills, to contact their \nlandlords or mortgage companies, and take care of other things we \nusually deal with on a daily basis.\n  The amendment I will be formally offering later today will allow \neligible employees whose spouses, parents, sons, or daughters are \nmilitary personnel who are serving on or called to active duty in \nsupport of a contingency operation to be able to use their Family and \nMedical Leave Act, FMLA, benefits for issues directly relating to or \nresulting from that deployment. These instances could include \npreparation for deployment or additional responsibilities that family \nmembers take on as a result of a loved one's deployment, such as \nchildcare.\n  I do not want you to just take my word for it. Here is what the \nNational Military Family Association has to say in a letter:\n\n       The National Military Family Association has heard from \n     many families about the difficulty of balancing families' \n     obligations with job requirements when a close family member \n     is deployed. Suddenly, they are single parents, or, with the \n     grandparents, assuming the new responsibility of caring for \n     grandchildren. The days leading up to a deployment can be \n     filled with predeployment briefings and putting legal affairs \n     in order.\n\n  In that same letter, the National Military Family Association states:\n\n       The military families, especially those of deployed \n     servicemembers, are called upon to make extraordinary \n     sacrifices. This amendment offers families some breathing \n     room as they adjust to this time of separation.\n\n  Let me make sure there is no confusion now about what this amendment \ndoes and does not do. This amendment does not expand eligibility for \nFMLA to employees not already covered by FMLA. It does not expand FMLA \neligibility to Active-duty military personnel. It simply allows those \nalready covered by FMLA to use the benefits they already have in one \nadditional set of circumstances, and that is to deal with issues \ndirectly related to or resulting from the deployment of a family \nmember.\n  I was proud to cosponsor and vote for legislation that created the \nlandmark Family and Medical Leave Act during the early days of my \nservice to the people of Wisconsin as a Member of this body. This \nimportant legislation allows eligible workers to take up to 12 weeks of \nunpaid leave per year for the birth or adoption of a child, the \nplacement of a foster child, to care for a newborn or newly adopted \nchild or newly placed foster child, or to care for their own serious \nhealth condition or that of a spouse, a parent, or child. Some \nemployers offer a portion of this time as paid leave in addition to \nother accrued leave, while others allow workers to use accrued vacation \nor sick leave for this purpose prior to going on unpaid leave.\n  Since its enactment in 1993, the FMLA has helped more than 35 million \nAmerican workers to balance responsibilities to their families and \ntheir careers. According to the Congressional Research Service, between \n2.2 million and 6.1 million people took advantage of these benefits in \n1999 through 2000.\n  Our military families sacrifice a great deal. Active-duty families \noften move every couple of years due to transfers and new assignments. \nThe 10 years since FMLA's enactment has also been a time when we as a \ncountry have relied more heavily on National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel for more and more deployments of longer and longer duration. \nThe growing burden on these service members' families must be \naddressed, and I think this amendment is one way to do so.\n  This legislation has the support of a number of organizations, \nincluding the Wisconsin National Guard, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Enlisted Association of National Guard of \nthe United States, the National Guard Association of the United States, \nthe Reserve Officers Association, the National Military Family \nAssociation, and the National Partnership for Women and Families. The \nMilitary Coalition, an umbrella organization of 31 prominent military \norganizations, specified this legislation as one of five meriting \nspecial consideration during the Iraq supplemental debate.\n  We owe it to our military personnel and their families to do all we \ncan to support them in this difficult time. I hope this amendment will \nbring a small measure of relief to our military families.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when we \nhave the opportunity to vote on it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 3264, \nwhich I have offered. It accomplishes three important goals. First, it \nrecognizes and honors the dedication and sacrifice of American military \npersonnel killed and injured in combat and the heroic efforts of our \nmedical teams through a sense of the Senate.\n  Secondly, it eases the stress of families who are attempting to \nfollow the whereabouts of loved ones injured in combat by requiring the \nSecretary of Defense to establish a tracking system for wounded \npersonnel.\n  Third, it authorizes $10 million to modernize medical combat \nequipment to support our medics in their fight to save lives.\n  Supporting my amendment tells the 5,138 military personnel who have \nbeen injured in Iraq that we care. It begins to address this harsh \nreality of war by providing the care soldiers and marines deserve and \nthe resources combat medics need.\n  I have heard from distraught Arkansas families--I am sure many of my \ncolleagues have heard from families in their States--who felt left in \nthe dark after a loved one's injury because they were not given \nadequate details of their condition or whereabouts. Congress can \nalleviate that anxiety by establishing a tracking system to keep \nfamilies better informed. We can also help save lives and reduce combat \ninjuries by ensuring that our military medical teams have the equipment \nthey need to provide critical frontline treatment. I cannot think of a \nbetter investment.\n  On June 14, 2004, I introduced S. 2516, the Service Act for Care and \nRelief Initiatives for Forces Injured in Combat Engagements Act of \n2004, or, as we call it, SACRIFICE. The Record includes a full \nstatement on the provisions of that bill. My amendment is almost \nidentical to the SACRIFICE bill.\n  Currently, the SACRIFICE amendment has 11 cosponsors. Many Arkansans \nasked me about the partisan working environment in the Senate. I want \nto go on record stating that the SACRIFICE amendment has had bipartisan \nsupport from Senators Sessions, Chambliss, Graham of South Carolina, \nReed of Rhode Island, Nelson of Nebraska, Nelson of Florida, Dole, \nCornyn, Collins, Clinton, and Lincoln. The amendment also has the \nsupport of the Disabled American Veterans and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars. I have been working with the cosponsors and the staff of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee to refine the language of the \namendment.\n  I am deeply grateful for the support and assistance I have received \nfrom Members on both sides of the aisle. I want to specifically thank \nRick DeBobes, Arun Seraphin, Gary Leeling, Judy Ansley, Dick Walsh, and \nElaine McCusker for the many hours they have spent on this amendment \nand for their very precious and wise counsel.\n  I understand there may be an opportunity for the managers to accept \nmy amendment. I appreciate that consideration. I am also hopeful that \nwe can work out an agreement. I thank Chairman Warner and Senator Levin \nfor their consideration of this very important issue. It is an honor \nfor me, as a freshman Senator in my first Congress, to serve under the \nleadership of Chairman Warner and Senator Levin. Their aid in helping \nme address a problem my constituents are experiencing firsthand with \nsuch productive interaction amongst both parties is truly a testament \nto the dedication of the members and the staff of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We owe that to their leadership, and I appreciate it very \nmuch.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I want to congratulate the Senator from Arkansas. He has \nadded a new dimension to the Senate. He is someone who is thoughtful, \nand above all he is so concerned about the partisan contentiousness in \nthe Senate, and he has spoken to Senator Daschle and me and others \nabout the need to do something about this. I want the Senator from \nArkansas to know how much we appreciate his being the good Senator that \nhe is and being concerned about what is going on here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  We have worked on this bill--I do not know, but I think this is about \nthe 12th day. Some of those days were Mondays and Fridays, so I really \ndo not know how many real days we have had to work on this bill, but it \nhas been a long, tedious process to work through more than 300 \namendments. We can see light at the end of the tunnel.\n  When the majority learned the minority was going to offer an \namendment calling for the Attorney General to divulge certain \ninformation, as a result action was brought to a standstill. I have \nsome difficulty understanding that, but I believe that on difficult \namendments the majority and minority should face it and just vote on \nthem rather than bring legislation to a standstill, but the decision \nhas been made to not do anything on this legislation.\n  At first glance, I thought I did not agree with what the majority was \ndoing, but they have done this in the past and that is what they want \nto do, and we just have to live with it. It has been brought to my \nattention, though, that a bus pulled up in front of the Senate, and now \nthe Republican Senators are at a reception at the White House. I do not \nknow how many of them but enough that there is nothing being done here. \nWe are trying very hard to finish this bill and we are not doing \nanything because the Republican Senators are at the White House for a \nreception? If, in fact, we had been told that, we could certainly have \nhad people offering amendments and have no votes during that period of \ntime. We do that on many occasions. But I think this legislation is not \nturning out as well as I thought it should, which has been handled so \nwell by the two managers of this bill.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee thought I should not have \noffered a second-degree amendment because he thought he should have \nthat right. Perhaps he was right. So I withdrew my amendment and we are \nin the position where we would be if I had not offered that amendment. \nThat is the status of the Senate today.\n\n  But as I have said and others have said, including Senator Leahy, \nthat is an amendment we will need to vote on before we finish this \nlegislation. At 6:20, the managers are going to offer all amendments \nthat have not even been agreed upon, voted upon, or somehow that are on \nthe list that haven't been offered. The way things are going we could \nend up with quite a few amendments to vote on because each of those \namendments do carry with them the potential of having a second-degree \namendment offered to each one of them. If we wind up with 15 amendments \nthat haven't been offered, we could wind up with 30 votes. I hope that \nis not the case.\n  We have also been told there is a need to vote on judges. I \nunderstand the reason for that. We will have to take that into \nconsideration over here.\n  My only point is after the reception is over, which should be around \n5 to 6, maybe we could get back to working on this most important \nlegislation. I think it has not accomplished what we need to accomplish \nhere by simply bringing the Senate to a standstill this afternoon. \nSince the Senate picture was taken, we haven't done anything. We might \njust as well have stayed here and had other poses, I guess.\n  I hope we can work our way through this little situation we have \nhere. We have some amendments. Senator Kennedy's amendment, I am sure, \nwill require a little more debate. Most of the amendments have been \ndebated. People have come over, those who are going to offer \namendments, and stated their positions.\n  I recognize the importance of this legislation. As we speak, in Iraq \nand Afghanistan we have men and women who are actually on the firing \nlines. I don't know how many in Iraq have been injured or killed today. \nWe know what happens every day. We know in Baghdad there are scores of \nattacks by these terrorists. Iraqis are being killed every day. This \nbill is an important piece of legislation. I think we all need to \nrecognize that.\n  Yesterday, when I was here at my desk, my BlackBerry went off. I \nlooked at it and it was CNN breaking news, to report four American \nsoldiers had been shot. They had been found dead, shot multiple times \nin the head. There were 2 other soldiers killed and 11 who had been \nwounded in that same action.\n  What we do here is extremely important. There is nothing that we do \nduring the year more important than this Defense authorization bill. I \nhope we can finish it because there is no reason we should not be able \nto. I hope the majority will not prevent us from completing action on \nthis bill because we have requested a vote on the Leahy amendment.\n  Let me read again what this amendment says. The purpose is:\n\n       To direct the Attorney General to submit to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary of the Senate all documents in the \n     possession of the Department of Justice relating to the \n     treatment and interrogation of individuals held in the \n     custody of the United States.\n\n  That is directly related to this Defense bill.\n  I read the purpose. The amendment says:\n\n       The Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate all documents and records produced \n     from January 20, 2001, to the present, and in the possession \n     of the Department of Justice, describing, referring or \n     relating to the treatment or interrogation of prisoners of \n     war, enemy combatants, and individuals held in the custody or \n     under the physical control of the United States Government or \n     an agent of the United States Government in connection with \n     investigations or interrogations by the military, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, intelligence, antiterrorist or \n     counterterrorist offices in other agencies, or cooperating \n     governments, and the agents or contractors of such agencies \n     or governments.\n\n  This is directly related to what is going on in Iraq, what is going \non in Afghanistan, and other trouble spots in the world.\n  I hope after a very short debate we can bring this before the Senate, \nvote on it, and complete the other issues on this bill, some of which \nare contentious, some of which are not. Most of them are not. We could \ndispose of them in a few minutes.\n  But it is not as if this has nothing to do with this legislation. We \non this side have been very careful. Even though we had a number of \nSenators who wanted to offer amendments dealing with unemployment \ncompensation, overtime, minimum wage, and things of that nature, we \ndecided not to put them on this bill because of the importance of this \nbill. But this amendment which Senator Leahy or someone will offer at a \nsubsequent time is directly related to this legislation.\n  I hope during this quiet time the staffs are able to clear a lot of \namendments. That will save us a significant amount of time. The staffs \nof this committee are as good as any staffs we have in the Senate. I am \nsure if it is possible to clear those, they will be cleared.\n  But I hope in clearing these amendments we will get back to where we \nwere prior to the Senate picture that was taken at 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Reid amendment, \nwhich I understand has been formally withdrawn at this moment but \ncertainly is the topic of consideration and discussion.\n  Mr. REID. And will come back.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It will return, according to the Senator from Nevada, for \nthe consideration of the Senate.\n  That amendment by Senator Reid of Nevada would require Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft to provide the Judiciary Committee with all the \ndocuments in the Justice Department's possession relating to the \ntreatment and interrogation of detainees.\n  This is an extremely serious issue for America. Literally, the world \nis watching us and asking whether the United States will stand behind \nits treaty obligations in this age of terrorism.\n  It is clear that our enemies do not respect the rules in their \nrelentless quest to kill Americans. The barbaric treatment of Nicholas \nBerg and Paul Johnson have reminded us all of that fact.\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\n  But this is what distinguishes the United States from the terrorists \nwe fight. There are some lines we in the United States will not cross. \nTorture is one of them. We have said repeatedly, since the time of \nPresident Abraham Lincoln, that torture is inconsistent with the \nprinciples of liberty and the rule of law that underpins our democracy.\n  Two weeks ago, Attorney General Ashcroft appeared before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee as our Nation's chief law enforcement officer. He \nsaid on the record that the administration opposes torture and that \ntorture is not justified or, in his words, productive. But he refused \nat that time to provide us with the Justice Department memos dealing \nwith coercive interrogation tactics.\n  I asked him repeatedly: Attorney General Ashcroft, under what legal \nor constitutional basis would you deny this committee copies of these \nmemos?\n  I asked him if he was asserting executive privilege on behalf of the \nPresident. He said he was not.\n  I asked him if he could identify any statute by which he would be \nabsolved from his duty to respond favorably and positively to a request \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee for these memos, and he could not \ncite any statute.\n  At one point he said he personally believed that it was not \nappropriate to produce these memos. I responded by saying that, as \ninteresting as that may be, the Attorney General's personal beliefs are \nnot the law. It is the law which governs us.\n  Now, at the eleventh hour, today, in an effort to defeat the growing \npressure to release these memos, the White House has provided Congress \nwith a number of documents, including one of the Justice Department's \ntorture memos. But a quick review of the documents provided reveals \nthey have given us only a small part of what we have asked for. Just \nlast week the Senate Judiciary Committee considered a request for some \n23 documents of the Department of Justice related to interrogation \ntechniques and torture. That request for subpoena was defeated in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote, 10 to 9, all \nRepublicans voting against disclosure of the documents, all Democrats \nvoting in favor. We take a look at the documents produced voluntarily \nby the White House today and find only 3 of the 23 documents subject to \nthe subpoena have actually been produced.\n  But the Justice Department's torture memo, which has been produced \nafter it was leaked on the Internet for all to read, is a memo which we \nnow know raises very troubling questions and completely contradicts \nstatements made by Attorney General Ashcroft before the Judiciary \nCommittee. It makes it clear if Congress and the Senate are to meet \ntheir obligation under the Constitution, we must ask harder questions \nand we must dig deeper.\n\n  In the memo, the Justice Department makes unprecedented assertions \nabout executive power, assertions that I believe violate basic \nconstitutional principles. The Justice Department concludes the torture \nstatute, which makes torture a crime, does not apply to interrogations \nconducted under the President's Commander in Chief authority.\n  At the hearing 2 weeks ago before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nAttorney General Ashcroft said unequivocally it was not his job to \ndefine torture. He went on to say, it is not the job of the \nadministration to define torture. He said that is the job of Congress.\n  Sadly, as we take a look at this Department of Justice memo produced \nlong before the Attorney General's testimony, we find on page 13 the \nfollowing statement, and I ask listeners to reach their own conclusion \nas to whether what I am about to read from Attorney General Ashcroft's \nmemo on interrogation is an attempt to define torture. I quote from the \nDepartment of Justice memo dated August 1, 2002:\n\n       The victim must experience intense pain or suffering of the \n     kind that is equivalent to the pain that would be associated \n     with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ \n     failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of \n     significant body function would likely result.\n\n  How can anyone read those words and reach any other conclusion but \nthat the Department of Justice in August of 2002 issued this memorandum \ndefining torture. That, of course, is something the Attorney General \nsaid was not their job. He is right; it was not their job. But it was \ndone, anyway.\n  They also claim torture must involve ``intense pain or suffering of \nthe kind that is equivalent to the pain associated with serious \nphysical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent \ndamage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely \nresult.''\n  Ask yourself the obvious question: Why did the Department of Justice \nproduce this memo? Who asked for it? Was it the intelligence agencies \nof the U.S. Government? The White House? We honestly do not know the \nanswer to that.\n  If this opinion by the Attorney General's office was at the request \nof some other agency of Government, we should know that. We should know \nwhich agency of Government said to the Attorney General, we need an \nadvisory opinion, we need your best guess as to how far we can go in \ninterrogation techniques.\n  Although the Attorney General said to us repeatedly, the law speaks \nfor itself--when he said that, he was referring to our laws, our \nConstitution, the treaties we have entered into--in fact, the Attorney \nGeneral and his Department of Justice decided the law was not enough. \nThey needed to add very graphic and specific definitions such as the \none I read.\n  Now, of course, there is an important and underlying issue here. \nUnder our Constitution, which we have all sworn to uphold--not only \nMembers of Congress but members of the President's Cabinet--the \nPresident does not have the authority to choose which laws he will obey \nor to make his own laws. There is no wartime exception to \nour Constitution.\n\n  Article I, section 1 of the Constitution says all legislative powers \nare vested in Congress. Article II, section 3 of the Constitution says \nthe President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. \nArticle VI provides that laws made by Congress and treaties ratified by \nthe Senate are the supreme law of the land.\n  Retired RADM John Hutson was a Navy judge advocate for 28 years. From \n1997 to the year 2000 he was the judge advocate general, the top lawyer \nin the Navy. He rejects the Justice Department interpretation of \ntorture law, saying:\n\n       If the president's inherent authority as commander in chief \n     trumps domestic and international law, where is the limit? If \n     every sovereign can ignore the law, then no one is bound by \n     it.\n\n  The Supreme Court considered a similar question related to the \nJustice Department position. President Truman, faced with a steel \nstrike during the Korean war, issued an Executive order to seize and \noperate the Nation's steel mills. In the historic Youngstown steel \ncase, the Court found the seizure of the steel mills was an \nunconstitutional infringement on Congress's lawmaking power and that it \nwas not justified in wartime as an exercise of the President's \nCommander in Chief authority.\n  Justice Hugo Black, writing for the majority, said:\n\n       The Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who \n     shall make laws which the President is to execute . . . The \n     Founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking power to the \n     Congress alone in both good and bad times.\n\n  It seems clear the Justice Department memo was the basis for a \nDefense Department memo that makes very similar arguments about \ntorture. For example, the Department of Defense memo argues the statute \noutlawing torture does not apply to the detention and interrogation of \nenemy combatants by the President pursuant to the Commander in Chief \nauthority.\n  The difficult question we have to answer is this: What have these \nmemos produced by the Department of Justice wrought? We know, now, \nbecause of the graphic illustration of the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison, \nthat soldiers in the uniform of the United States of America performed \nsome horrible and shameful acts for which no one has made any excuses. \nEven the President has said that does not represent America. What they \ndid was clearly wrong.\n  The important and obvious question for all to ask as a follow-on is, \nWas this an incident involving the conduct of a handful of officers or \ndid it represent a policy promulgated by this Government, supported by \nmemoranda from\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nthe Department of Justice and those from the Department of Defense? \nTherein lies the critical question.\n  Last week, President Bush was asked about the Justice Department \ntorture memo and he said he did not remember if he had ever seen it; he \nsaid he issued an authorization that conformed with U.S. law and treaty \nobligations, and he would not say whether he would authorize the use of \ntorture but that we should be ``comforted'' by the ``laws on the \nbooks.''\n  The President is correct; the law is very clear. The United States is \nnot permitted to engage in torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading \ntreatment. But I am not comforted because we don't know if the \nadministration followed the Justice Department interpretation which \nwould allow the President to set aside these laws. We have gone too \nfar.\n\n  We have to follow the paper trail to determine who requested the \nmemos and what was done in response to them. We need to find out \nwhether the legal arguments contained in these memos were used to \njustify the use of torture at Guantanamo, at Abu Ghraib, or any other \nfacility controlled by the United States of America. We need to know \nwhether the President or anyone else in this administration authorized \nthe use of torture as defined by the Department of Justice memo.\n  The Senate has an obligation to the Constitution and the American \npeople to answer these questions. The only way to do that is to obtain \nall of the relevant documents.\n  The great challenge of our age in combatting terrorism while \nremaining true to the principles which our country is based upon is to \nmake certain we respect liberty and the rule of law. We must not \nsacrifice freedom and the rule of law at the altar of security. We must \nrespect the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights. Our laws must not \nfall silent during time of war.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Reid amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thought I might take advantage of this \nmoment while so many of the Republicans are at a White House reception \nto share a few thoughts about a bill we are obviously not going to be \nable to vote on today.\n  Sixty years ago, Franklin Roosevelt signed the GI bill. He showed us \nin doing so how to honor our veterans and he launched the greatest \nexpansion of the middle class in our Nation's history. Never before has \nan act of legislation and the vision of and the investment by one \nPresident done so much for so many Americans.\n\n  President Roosevelt said that on the day it became law, the signing \nof this bill ``gave emphatic notice to the men and women in our Armed \nForces that the American people do not intend to let them down.''\n  Today, throughout the day, the Senate has had an opportunity to make \nhistory in the spirit of Roosevelt and his commitment to the Greatest \nGeneration. Senator Daschle's amendment, which he tried to bring up \nearlier, would take an important step toward the full mandatory funding \nof veterans health care. It would say to the 500,000 veterans closed \nout of the VA health system in the last 2 years: You are welcome. There \nis care for you.\n  In the 10th year of its enactment, it will provide care to 3 million \nveterans who otherwise will be shut out of the system, and it will end \nthe practice of rationing health care for those who have already given \nso much to this country and who have had an expectation that health \ncare will be there for them.\n  Now, last night, in the normal course of business in our Senate, I \nwas informed by the minority leader that his amendment would proceed \ntoday and that he would, under the normal procedures of the Senate, \nbring it up in an effort to have an early vote. I cancelled my events \nand I returned here hoping to be able to vote on this important issue. \nThere was no request for lengthy debate. There has been--I know the \nSenator from Virginia will agree with this--no effort to delay this \nbill. In fact, the minority leader has expressed every good intention \nto try to move forward as fast as possible on this bill.\n  Under the normal courtesies of an institution that runs on courtesy, \nnormally, it is absolutely consistent with the rules and traditions of \nthe Senate that time might be made available to a minority leader to \noffer an amendment and for a vote to be ordered. But, evidently, this \nis not a normal time for those courtesies in the life of the Senate. I \nregret that for the Senate and for the country and for veterans. So \ntoday we could have acted and have honored 26 million Americans who \nwore the uniform and provided important funding for them.\n  More than a decade ago, Senator Daschle and I worked to help veterans \nexposed to Agent Orange receive the recognition, the care, and the \nbenefits they deserved. I am very happy to join him today in supporting \nthis amendment, whenever it will come up, in whatever way I can, \nwhether I am here or not here. I will support this effort in the days, \nmonths, and in the years ahead to provide to our veterans the resources \nthey deserve and increasingly have been denied.\n  Yes, there have been increases in the veterans budget, but the test \nis not whether you have increased the budget, the test is whether you \nare meeting the need. And the need is not being met.\n  I am honored to stand with the veterans who are backing Senator \nDaschle's amendment. The VFW, the American Legion, AMVETS, the \nParalyzed Veterans Association, Disabled American Veterans, the Blinded \nVeterans Association, Jewish War Veterans, the Military Order of the \nPurple Heart, and Vietnam Veterans of America--all of them would have \nloved to have seen the Senate do its business today when it could have.\n\n  That is a distinguished group of veterans. A lot of courage, a lot of \nhonor, a lot of kindness comes from the men and women who belong to \nthose organizations. They are Americans whose opinions and guidance I \ntrust. And they deserve to be heard.\n  In this time of great sacrifice, it is even more important that we \nshow our veterans we honor them and respect them. We have to do so with \nmore than words. We have to show them by our actions and our deeds.\n  During a time of war, a time when tens of thousands of Americans are \nasked to fight and possibly die for their country, our message ought to \nbe loud and clear: When you come home, your country will take care of \nyou because you took care of us.\n  This is an important issue to our country, to our veterans, and to \nthe men and women in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the \nworld--today's service members who will be tomorrow's veterans.\n  I have been around here long enough not to worry about these kinds of \nthings. This day will pass and others will come. But Americans will \nmeasure how we do our business, and they will measure the seriousness \nof purpose and the courtesies we extend to each other. So while this \nvote may not take place while I am here, my support will never wane and \nmy commitment to veterans will never be diminished. I regret whatever \nrationale has entered into this decision that we cannot proceed for a \nvery simple vote on a very straightforward issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend--and we have been \ngood friends for many years--you made reference to President Roosevelt \nand the GI bill. With my very humble and modest naval service in the \nlast year of World War II, I was a beneficiary of that.\n  But I would say to my good friend, I am proud of what our Senate has \ndone over the past several years to assist veterans. This is another \nmatter that is now pending and has yet to be resolved.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Nevada, who has been in the \nforefront with colleagues on my side on the issue of concurrent \nreceipts. Prior to that, I worked with my good friend from Michigan on \nTRICARE for Life. I could enunciate others.\n  We are about to have a vote here sometime, perhaps tonight or \ntomorrow. The Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Nevada and \nthe Senator from Maine are trying to close that gap when a retiree's \nwidow, in most instances, reaches the eligibility for Social Security. \nOftentimes there is a very significant dropoff.\n  So we have done a lot in this body. I know well of my old friend's \ncareer in\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nthe Navy. I was Secretary of the Navy, as you well know, and Under \nSecretary at the time the decorations you earned through your valor and \nyour courage came before the Navy Department for approval. While I do \nnot have specific recollections--I had to deal with many during those \ndifficult days of a very stressful and tough period in American \nhistory; and how well both of us remember that--as far as I know, I \nparticipated in some way and look with a sense of pride on approving \nthose decorations. Whether I was Under Secretary or Secretary, it was \nright in that period of time. We chatted about that in years past.\n\n  But as to the events of this day, I would say this is my 26th year in \nthe Senate, working with Senator Levin, and I would ask the Senator to \nstep back. If you had the totality of the picture, the majority leader \nwas hopeful, and we have not lost that hope, of continuing through the \nnight and tomorrow to get our final vote on this bill. Much remains to \nbe seen at the hour of 6:20, when we will have the opportunity to look \nat the amendments our colleagues still feel require their attention.\n  But in that context, it was at the hour of 6:20 when we would have \nthat body of information to give us some clear indication as to what \ntime agreements we could make with the Daschle amendment, time \nagreements with a number that are pending at the desk. I certainly, \nspeaking for myself--we are not trying to preclude our colleague from \nhis rightful duty to participate today in the affairs of the Senate in \nany way, but we have to move ahead with not only this bill but the \nappropriations bill, which is soon to follow. My understanding is, it \nwas to be brought up immediately, assuming this bill were voted on \nfinally tomorrow.\n  But then there was another impediment, as I understand, regarding \ndebt limit and some other things--which I admit I am unfamiliar with--\nwhich then indicated to the majority leader, for whom I have great \nrespect, Senator Frist, who wants to operate in a sense of fairness: \nWas he not able, as majority leader, to guide the package of \nlegislation, both authorization and appropriations, which he felt \nnecessary?\n  So I am not suggesting the Daschle amendment could not perhaps at a \nlater time tonight be brought up and voted on.\n  I say to the Senator, I recognize the tough schedule you have, but I \nwould not want to say that I feel on this side there is any conspiracy \nin this area, certainly from my perspective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. One of my good friends on the other side of the aisle is \nthe senior Senator from Virginia, and I am a good friend with the \njunior Senator, too. I will say to him that I respect the position he \nhas been put in. I have been here 20 years. I know how this place works \nand how it negotiates. I know exactly what the conversation was in the \nwell of the Senate earlier.\n  I have no illusions about where we find ourselves now. I am not \ncomplaining. I am just here to make my statement of support. I will \ncontinue to do what I am doing because I believe we can do better by \nveterans in this country. I will continue to take that issue to the \ncountry over these next days.\n  We have an opportunity to make a choice today. If we don't, then we \nwill continue to talk about this issue over the next months, and the \nAmerican people will make a choice in November.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would my colleague address what is a major concern with \nthis Senator. I say this with total humility. I am a veteran and \npossibly could benefit someday by what this package contains. I don't \nknow.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suspect under the health care and benefit plans the \nSenate gives itself, the Senator won't need this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I don't know, Senator. I am just trying to say that \nthe Senate is looking at this in terms of its fiscal impact. This is \nsomewhere between $200 and $300 billion.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, not this particular proposal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I believe it is involved.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is if you did the full funding. This \nis a compromise that has been worked out which is a lesser amount of \nmoney, recognizing the significant amounts that are available.\n  Be that as it may, we are talking over 10 years. The last tax cut for \npeople earning more than $200,000 a year was over $1.2 trillion. So it \nis a question of where the rubber meets the road. You have veterans \nover here who served their country who have a need for health care, and \nyou have a lot of wealthy Americans over here who don't particularly \nhave a need for a new tax cut. This is a place for choices. All we are \nasking is for a choice to be made.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the distinguished junior Senator from \nMassachusetts leaves the floor, I wish to say this, from a total Nevada \nperspective, how proud we are of the campaign he has been running in \nNevada. The Senator from Massachusetts has run all positive ads. The \npeople of Nevada recognize that and, as a result of that, all the polls \nshow him ahead at this time.\n  I compliment the Senator. When he comes to Nevada, he is totally open \nto the press. Each time he comes he answers any questions that the \npeople have to ask him. The press is there. For example, last time he \nwas there, he not only did a press conference but he was on individual \nprograms, Ed Bernstein's show, for example, John Alston, where he was \nanswering any questions they had to ask him.\n  I compliment the Senator from Massachusetts from a Nevada perspective \nfor the type of campaign that has been run. Positive campaigning is \nsomething that is so necessary. We have far too much negative \ncampaigning. We need to make ourselves available to questions of the \npress. We should not hide ourselves from the press. Senator Kerry has \nnot done that, which makes us in Nevada feel very good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I looked at the cost to the American \ntaxpayers for TRICARE for Life, and that is $3.9 billion a year. The \nconcurrent receipts were $22 billion in the 2004 cycle. Through this \nadministration, in veterans funding, there has been a 34-percent \nincrease in funding for health care since 2001. Overall spending for \nhealth care has doubled since 1993. So I am not going to take second \nplace to anyone with regard to the achievements we have had in this \nbody by way of trying to care for our veterans. I feel very strongly \nabout that.\n  My military career is very modest: service in World War II and \nservice in Korea in the Marines. I have served with the courageous \nones, the ones who lost life and limb. I am not going to take second \nplace to anybody in my trying to work hard to support proper \nrecognition for them and what they have achieved. I am just one of the \nlucky ones who had the opportunity to serve alongside these veterans \nand work with their families. For 5 years as Secretary of the Navy, I \nworked with families in that stressful period of time in Vietnam.\n  I feel so strongly to be a supporter of the veterans' causes, not for \npolitical reasons. Some vote for me; some don't. That is all right. The \nimportant thing is that this Nation takes them to heart, particularly \nat this time when, at this very moment, who knows which veteran, which \nservice Active-Duty man in Iraq or Afghanistan, where all of us have \nvisited those battlefields, might have his or her life taken, life or \nlimb. I feel ever so strongly about it. Day or night they are in my \nmind.\n  I see others desiring to speak so I shall yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments on one \nof the pending amendments, the so-called Daschle amendment dealing with \nveterans. In many cases, this amendment is more about helping \npoliticians than it is helping veterans. We have done a lot to help \nveterans--we being the Members of this body, Members of this Congress. \nI want to go to the facts.\n  Just look at history. In 1993, we were spending less than $15 \nbillion. If you look throughout the next several years, the year 2000, \nit still increased only to about $17 billion, $18 billion. Since then, \nin the last 4 years, we have gone up from about $18 billion to now we \nare about $28.5 billion. So we have\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nhad a dramatic increase in the last few years, frankly, in large part \ndue to President Bush's requests.\n  Those are the facts.\n  If you want to gauge our support for veterans on how much money we \nare spending, we see a relatively flat, very slow growth during the \nClinton years and a very rapid increase under President Bush's last 3 \nyears.\n  Now we have an amendment that says, we know this is discretionary, as \nit always has been. Appropriators take care of discretionary items. As \nalluded to by Senator Bond, we have had big increases because we had \nsome demands, and the appropriators and budgeteers met those demands. \nNow we have an amendment that says: Let's throw that away, an amendment \nthat will increase spending by $300 billion.\n  It also increases the deficit by $300 billion. Some of the people who \nsay they are in favor of this say they believe in pay-go. They make \nspeeches: We want pay-go. But they don't pay for this amendment. So \nthis amendment would increase the deficit by $300 billion.\n  Then I look at the way it is written, and it is one of the worst \namendments, as far as putting something together from a fiscal \nstandpoint, that I have ever seen. It says: Let's take the 2004 \ndiscretionary figure and freeze it; for the next 10 years we will \nfreeze it. Then we will set up a new entitlement, not based on the \nnumber of veterans receiving care but on the number of people who are \neligible to receive care. On the eligibility side, we will come up with \nsome type of per capita contribution and figure it all out. CBO \nestimates over 10 years it will cost $300 billion.\n  We are spending a little less than $30 billion a year right now, but \nwe are going to multiply that based on the number of people who might \nbe eligible.\n  Senator Warner is eligible but my guess is he doesn't receive all of \nhis health care in a veterans hospital. My father-in-law is eligible \nbut he doesn't receive his health care under veterans. A lot of people \nin the military served with great distinction but they don't receive \ntheir health care through the VA health care system.\n  I don't know who designed this new formula. This kind of amendment \nbelongs on the budget, not on a DOD authorization bill. This is really \namending the budget, saying we are going to take a discretionary item \nand turn it into a mandatory item, and we have decided to grab some \nkind of fictitious name based on the number of people eligible, not the \npeople who are in the system, not the people who are likely to receive \nthe care, and pluck it out of the air and say: Here is what we are \ngoing to do.\n  And then it also says GAO, after a couple of years, if they don't \nlike it and think it is enough, we will set some other kind of process \non automatic pilot to have Congress vote on it in the next 10 days or \nso. It is just a ridiculous way to fund a department or to take care of \nveterans.\n  I am all in favor of taking care of veterans. Senator Warner alluded \nto the fact that we have done a lot for veterans in the last few years. \nYou bet we have. Last year, concurrent receipts--I believe there was an \namendment agreed to, and the ultimate cost was $22 billion. Senator \nWarner agreed to an amendment last week to expand that almost another \nbillion dollars. We did TRICARE for life. We did Service Members Group \nLife Insurance. We did expanded benefits for former POWs, auto and \nhousing grants, and veterans buying first homes. We increased the VA \nhome loan guarantee up to a maximum mortgage of $240,000. We did the \nMontgomery GI bill to assist transitioning from military to civilian, \nand we enacted a 52-percent increase in education benefits. I can go on \nand on. We have done a lot. It is expensive. So this line will continue \nto increase.\n  Then I look at this amendment. It doesn't really say anything about \nneed. It comes up with a very awkward formula, almost like an HMO-type \nthing, and says, by the number of eligibles, we are going to figure out \nso much money and multiply it and throw it in. That will not meet \nveterans needs. In the appropriations process, we have committees that \nhave hearings. What do you need? What is pressing? We vote and \nappropriate money. We have had a faster rate of increase in veterans \ncare than in almost any other area in the Federal budget.\n  The amendment we have pending before us has a budget point of order, \nand appropriately so. It would increase the deficit by $300 billion \nover and above the budget. Maybe some people don't care about deficits. \nThis Senator does. This amendment is not paid for. It violates pay-go. \nFor those people who voted for pay-go, they should say this is not paid \nfor. They make speeches in their States and say, I believe we should \nhave pay-go. This doesn't meet that test.\n  At the appropriate time, I will make a budget point of order, and I \nhope our colleagues will sustain that. I might also note that I am \nkeeping a record of all the budget points of order that have been made \nand the number of people who vote to waive those points of order. Since \nlast year's budget was adopted, we have had amendments to increase \nspending and increase the debt by over $1.4 trillion. This amendment \nwill just be a couple hundred billion dollars on top of that. We are \nkeeping a running log.\n  In the last month, there was an amendment to make IDEA an \nentitlement. We made a budget point of order and defeated that. That \nwould have increased the debt by $87 billion. A week or so before that, \nthere was an amendment to expand retroactively unemployment \ncompensation that would have increased the deficit by $9 billion. We \ndefeated that. A week before that, there was an amendment on trade \nadjustment assistance, and it would have cost an additional $6 billion. \nNone of these amendments were paid for, and we defeated them. So in the \nlast month, I think we have had three votes that would have increased \nspending--i.e., the deficit--by over $100 billion. The amendment we \nwill be voting on will increase the deficit by a couple hundred \nbillion dollars. Again, I hope my colleagues will show a little sanity \nand say, let's try to really help veterans, let's not try to help \npoliticians. Let's sustain the budget point of order on this amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will my colleague yield for a couple questions?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask my colleague, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, how big was the deficit in the budget you brought to \nthe Senate floor, the budget you voted out of committee?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would have to look at the figures. The baseline scored \nby OMB was 521. The baseline scored by CBO was 477. The figure we had \nbefore us in the budget resolution, I would want to check. CBO is in \nthe process of revising that. We use CBO scoring. My guess is it would \nbe significantly less than the 521 by OMB, and 477 by CBO, and we now \nexpect, if we stay with the projections--i.e., the spending figures \nthat we had assumed in the budget resolution, 821 on discretionary \nspending--the debts would probably be in the neighborhood of not 477 \nbut closer to 420, in spite of the fact that I know my friend from \nDelaware made a speech last week saying he thought it would be 600. It \nwould be closer to 420.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are already starting off with the Senator recommending \na vote for a budget that has $400 billion-plus.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am not sure. I think the Senator from Delaware has the \nfloor. I don't want him stating----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask the Senator if he wants to respond to that comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to debate my colleague, or any \ncolleague, on the budget. We spent several days debating the budget. I \nam more than happy to debate it. I will tell my colleague that we \nbasically have assumed a freeze in nondefense, non-homeland security in \nthe budget resolution. I hope we will be able to enforce that freeze. I \nhave been very vigilant in trying to enforce the budget.\n  We have made about 80 points of order to contain the growth of \nspending, most all of which have been sustained. There were very few \nvotes by our colleagues on the Democrat side, with the exception of \nSenator Miller, and I thank him and compliment him for that. Since we \nwere successful in sustaining those budget points of\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\norder, we have saved Federal spending to the tune of in excess of over \n$1.3 trillion. I happen to have these votes, and I happen to have a \nchart that shows the votes, just like this vote. CBO scores this vote--\nif this amendment were to be adopted--saying it would increase spending \nby $300 billion. It basically doubles VA. I hope we will be successful. \nThat will be scored on the running chart I am keeping. I mentioned over \n$100 billion of additional spending. We defeated that in the last month \nusing budget points of order.\n  I hope we will defeat this amendment, and it will save $300 billion-\nplus and I think make us a lot more responsive. I happen to believe we \nare making a serious mistake to put everything into that side of the \nequation.\n  I mentioned discretionary spending of $821 billion, which is our \nbudget figure. We are going to be spending $2.4 trillion. Two-thirds of \nthe budget is now entitlements. One-third is discretionary spending. I \nbelieve we would have a better control, better oversight if we would \nkeep more in the discretionary side. This is the opposite of that \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I didn't want to debate \nit. I was trying to get the facts. The facts are that, notwithstanding \nwhat he suggested he has saved by budget points of order, he brought a \nbudget to the Senate floor that is in deficit over $400 billion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To inform my colleague, the budget also would reduce the \ndeficit by half in 3 years. That is not easily done when you have a \n$400 billion deficit. So please keep that in mind as well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Again, I am not here to debate this. The facts are that he \nbrought a budget to the floor of the Senate that is over $430 billion, \nand some believe it is over $500 billion in deficits. I agree with my \nfriend that we should be careful about putting in \nentitlements. Entitlements, in a sense, if you think about the effect \non the budget--I know the Presiding Officer is a former Governor--there \nare two types of expenditures: direct expenditures and tax \nexpenditures.\n\n  My friend also wants to essentially, in layman's terms, make an \nentitlement of the tax cuts; in other words, make them permanent. They \ndo not want to make permanent the ability of veterans to have what this \namendment calls for. I understand that. It is a logical argument. I do \nnot begrudge that. I think it is an intelligent argument to make.\n  I want to point out this is about values and priorities. If you want \nto know what a country values, if you want to know what a company \nvalues, if you want to know what a nonprofit values, look at its \nbudget, and you will know. You will know what it values, on what it \nputs the highest value.\n  I can understand one can make the argument, and there is truth to the \nargument, that tax cuts spur the economy, everything gets better, and \nit works out better. I got all that. Believe it or not, after 30 years \nhere, I figured that out, and there is some truth to it. Really, this \nis a values debate, not wanting to put something permanently into the \nlaw that is an entitlement in the case of what veterans now and in the \nfuture would be entitled to. It is not a lot different fundamentally in \nits effect on the actual budget, the numbers in the budget, than \nessentially making permanent tax cuts from now infinitum. And they are \nbig numbers.\n  Again, the disagreement is real, genuine, and intellectually is \ndefensible, but it is a difference of perspective. The reason the \nSenator from Delaware comes to the floor, very seldom my colleagues \nwill notice, is that in this case, when you think about a budget that I \nvoted against--I do not support the budget, I do not support the \npriorities within the budget by the Budget Committee--to turn around \nand say that when I vote not to sustain a point of order that somehow I \nam the one increasing the budget, it is a little bit like my saying to \nyou: Here is the deal. What we are going to do in the family, we are \ngoing to have one car, drive it 22 miles a week, and not drive it any \nfurther than that. We are not going to turn the thermostat up over 60 \ndegrees. And, by the way, we are going to build a new swimming pool in \nthe backyard.\n  If I do not get a vote on that--it seems to me when I come along and \nsay we should be able to drive the car to church more often because the \nkids are not going to church because the church is 14 miles away, we \nshould have more money for gas in the car, we should not have built the \nswimming pool--we do not get a chance to do that.\n  I get a budget, which is legitimate, shoved on me because you guys \nrun the show, the Republicans run the show. I got that. I understand \nit. I do not complain about that. More people voted for Republican \nSenators than Democratic Senators. But the idea that somehow when I \nsuggest we should have a different priority and seek to change the \nbudget I am busting the budget when, in fact, what has happened is the \npriorities that the chairman of the Budget Committee has placed in the \nbudget--and very successfully, and he has led that committee very \nsuccessfully and he has led it unanimously; there are no diversions on \nhis side from what he proposes--is a little bit disingenuous in terms \nof the average person listening to this.\n  It is as if I have to accept we are building a swimming pool instead \nof providing more gas in the car to get the kids to church. So I want \nto get more gas in the car to get the kids in church. I do not want to \nbuild a swimming pool. I do not want to do that.\n  The only vehicle I have as a Senator is to vote for changing the \nbudget that I do not want. What these are attached to is we say: What \nyou put down in the budget, these tax cuts and the way they work and \nyou are seeking to make them permanent, all those things, they are not \nmy priorities. So the way I want to pay for that is I do not want to \nbuild a swimming pool.\n  Now, you have built a swimming pool, but what I do not want to do is \nkeep it open because it costs me a lot of money to keep it open. The \nmoney I can save by not filling the pool, not having a pool service \ncome, not having to buy the chlorine, not having to buy the equipment \nis enough money for me to get the gas to get the kids to church on \nSunday. That is what I want to do. That is what I am doing here.\n  The fact is, the difference between 1993 and now is we are at war. My \nfriend will say a lot of veterans who are going to benefit from this \nproposal are ones who are not at war now. One of the things we are \ntrying to do in an All-Volunteer Army is make it more appealing for \npeople to get into the service, to stay in the service, so that, in \nfact, when they volunteer to get in this Army, there are benefits that \nflow from it. They make enough sacrifices already in this Volunteer \nArmy.\n  We had trouble getting money early for bulletproof vests for these \nguys. I was just in Iraq, and I met a young man in Kuwait. Our generals \nintroduced him to us. We had dinner, and they said: These are the \nheroes; these are the kids who drive the transport trucks from Kuwait \nCity all the way up to Baghdad. Do my colleagues know what they are \ndoing because we have not provided them what they need? They have been \ngiven the authority to augment their vehicles any way they want. I was \njoking with them. A lot of them are becoming spot welders. They are \nliterally getting scrap metal and welding it to their vehicles. They \nare given the authority to do what they want because they are getting \nshot dead.\n  We were out there, and these kids were on this incredibly dangerous \nmission. We said: Do the mission, but we realize you have to improvise.\n  So they are telling me: I got this piece of steel, and I put it on my \nside door and welded it on. What I wanted to do was get some underneath \nso that when the bombs blow up, they don't blow through the seat. It is \namazing.\n  My point is, we are asking these kids to do all this. Right now in \ncategory 7 and 8, there are 400,000 veterans seeking VA help who are \ntold: Don't apply. To the best of my knowledge--I do not claim to have \na real expertise in this area--but there are 90,000 veterans under the \npresent system waiting for admission to get into veterans hospitals, \nand there are 40,000 who wait 2 to 6 months just to get a doctor to \nsign off on them qualifying to get prescriptions from their local VA \nhospital at the lower price.\n  Whether or not this proposal that has been put forward is the answer \nto any of this, I cannot guarantee, but there is\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nsomething wrong in Denmark. Something is wrong here. Something is not \nworking. If you wonder if I am telling the truth, go home and ask your \nDemocratic- or Republican-registered veterans. Ask them if they are \nhappy with the way things are working right now. Find out how many of \nthose 400,000 people are told do not apply, and 90,000 are trying to \nget into the hospital.\n\n  Again, I acknowledge, based on the fact we decided to build a \nswimming pool in this budget instead of doing this, this will increase \nthe deficit. I got it. Just like the administration budget initially \nproposed did not even include money for Iraq. Does anybody think $25 \nbillion is going to get us through next year in Iraq? Raise your hand. \nCome to the floor and tell me. Anybody. I want you to stand here and go \non record and say: I believe that $25 billion is going to cover the nut \nin Iraq and Afghanistan for next year.\n  Let's get a little truth in budgeting here. I understand the Senator. \nI got it. I respect him. He has made a basic value judgment. He \nbelieves very strongly--and there is some evidence for his belief--that \nif, in fact, we have these massive tax cuts, the bulk of which go to \nthe wealthiest, it will, in fact, trickle down. He will argue--and \nthere is some evidence to it--that some of it has already started to \nhappen, and the best way to help veterans, poor folks, IDEA folks, and \nall those folks is get the economy roaring. That will bring in more \nrevenue. I got it. That is a legitimate argument. But the basic \nfundamental argument we have is the die are not even cast. The table \nhas been set, and I either sit down and sup at the table when I do not \nlike the menu and refrain from trying to change the menu, or I attempt \nto change the menu.\n  So this notion that the VA health care system is in good shape, that \nwe have done so much for veterans--which we have done more--we are \ncreating a whole heck of a lot more veterans now, a whole heck of a lot \nmore, and the need is going to increase more because we are at war and \nwe are likely to be at war for a while.\n  Again, I do not want to belabor the point. I respect my friend, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I respect the fact he has little \nchoice but to ask us to vote for a budget that is already, by his \nstandards, $435 billion or so out of whack. I respect that.\n  I respect the fact that he believes, notwithstanding the fact that \nhis own outfit points out a significant portion of that deficit last \nyear and this year relates to the tax cuts, we will earn it all back; \nwe will be able to cut the deficit because of the economic growth and \nall of that. I have that. But I have also been through this once \nbefore. I went through this once before in the Reagan era. It did not \nwork then. Reagan came back and raised taxes. I do not think it is \ngoing to work now.\n  I will yield the floor with one final comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Was there a time? There is a time. Well, I respect that, \nand I thank my friend from Oklahoma. We just have a difference in our \npriorities and the way in which we value our value system.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour being 6:20, the managers are \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on our side we have taken about 40 \namendments from our list, I say to my good friend from Michigan, and of \nthe 40, roughly 19 of them are being prepared to be put in a package \nfor the Senator from Virginia to forward to the desk in accordance with \nthe UC. I say almost all of them, except one or two, we have been \nworking on with the Senator's staff, and we have modified the \namendments to conform with what we believe will be acceptable on the \nSenator's side. So as I send my package to the desk, they will be in a \nmodified form. Logistically, I simply need the time in which to do the \nmodification, and I presume the Senator from Michigan would desire to \ndo pretty much the same thing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before we accept modifications, however, we would have to \nlook at the modifications. They may be fine, by the way, but we need to \nlook at them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, all the modifications are somewhere within \nthe Senator's system. The Senator from Michigan is on notice as to what \nthey are. The corollary situation is we have been notified as to a lot \nof their modifications. So I say most respectfully to my two colleagues \non the other side, if we could put in a quorum call we could quickly \nresolve the status of the modifications on our side, and to the extent \nthe Senator has knowledge of the status of the modifications on his \nside, reciprocally what we understand----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished leader, the chairman of the \ncommittee, 6:30 is coming. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \ngo into effect and that the two managers of the bill still have 10 \nminutes to offer these amendments when the quorum call is called off.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I wish to speak for a few \nminutes. I did not complete my remarks in the last debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, he has the right to object, but we \nreally are trying to structure this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if it would be agreeable to the two managers \nof the bill that the 6:20 time will now become 6:40?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is an excellent idea. We can make it 6:45.\n  Mr. LEVIN. More than agreeable.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator from Oklahoma need 10 minutes to finish \nhis remarks in the intervening period?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Five minutes will be fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. At which time the Senator will put in a quorum.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I enjoyed having a little colloquy with \nmy very good friend, Senator Biden. I just want to put in the Record a \ncouple of facts. One, the deficit under the budget resolution we had \nestimated is $474 billion. I believe it will come in significantly less \nthan that, possibly $420 billion to $440 billion. I am not sure. The \nbudget resolution was for 2005, and that figure is $367 billion, \nconsiderably less than what OMB was estimating this year at $521 \nbillion or CBO at $477 billion. So the budget resolution shows over \n$100 billion in deficit reduction by 2005, and also $255 billion in \n2006. So it goes down by over $100 billion in over 2 years. That cannot \nbe done unless there is some constraint on the growth of spending.\n  That being said, we had significant assumptions for growth in VA. \nTotal spending in 2004 for VA was growing from $61.45 billion in budget \nauthority to $70.8 billion, about a 15-percent increase just in 2004 to \n2005 in VA. Now, that is a lot, especially when one assumes or if one \nknows that we are basically going with a freeze in nondefense spending. \nThat means other things have to be cut to make room for veterans. We \nhave done that in our budget, and we have shown probably a greater \npercentage increase in veterans care than almost any other section of \nthe budget.\n  So I wanted to state for the record, when I heard my friend saying--\nlast week I think he said it was $600 billion, and I said I think it is \ngoing to be more like $420 billion. In the budget resolution for 2004, \nwe estimated $474 billion. I believe it will be much less than that. \nFor 2005, we were assuming $367 billion. I hope it will be less than \nthat. For 2006, it will be $255 billion, with revenues coming in now \ngreater than anticipated because the economy is working and because the \ntax cuts we passed did stimulate the economy. The stock market and the \nNASDAQ are up 40 or 50 percent since the tax bill we passed last year \nand the tax cuts.\n  I heard my colleague say it is because we want tax cuts for the \nwealthy. The only tax cuts we assumed in the budget resolution were \nextending what I call family friendly tax cuts: the tax credit per \nchild staying at $1,000 per child instead of going to $700; marriage \npenalty relief, so married couples who have taxable income up to \n$58,000 will pay a 15-percent rate instead of a 25-\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\npercent rate; and an expansion of the 10-percent bracket. Those are all \nfamily friendly. A lot of veterans want those tax cuts, too.\n  There are a lot of allusions to, we really need higher taxes so we \ncan spend more for veterans. Veterans want these tax cuts. A lot of \nveterans have children. A lot of veterans are married and want to \neliminate the marriage penalty, at least if they have incomes up to \n$58,000. That is where the bulk of the tax cuts we are trying to pass \nthis year are. That is what we assumed in the budget.\n  So I wanted to make those few points. We hope to get the deficit \ndown. I believe if we pass the budget, or if we adhere to the \ndiscipline we recommended in the budget, we will have the deficit down \nby over $100 billion. We will not if we adopt amendments that call for \nthis program to double or another program to double and call it all an \nentitlement. That is a great way to have runaway spending.\n  This amendment is very irresponsible, and I would urge my colleagues \nto vote to sustain the budget point of order.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3433, 3179, 3239, 3429, 3220, 3319, 3293, 3198, 3431, \n   3373, 3403, 3325, 3280, 3441, 3442, 3443, 3444, and 3445, en bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to authorize the managers of the \nbill to offer en bloc amendments from the filed list on my side of the \naisle. I send to the desk a list of 22 such amendments out of some 40 \nthat we have designated as being filed by Republican Senators, just \nslightly over half. I note the unanimous consent provides an exception \nfor the managers' amendment which has to be cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are now pending. The Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 3157, 3378, 3367, 3423, 3286, 3204, 3303, 3327, 3328, \n3329, 3330, 3203, 3311, 3310, 3400, 3399, 3365, 3300, 3388, 3336, 3337, \n   3339, 3201, 3377, 3289, 3234, 3264, 3355, 3351, and 3242, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. In accordance with the terms of the unanimous consent \nagreement, I call up the amendments contained in the list that I now \nsend to the desk and ask they appear separately in the Record, that the \nreading of the amendments be waived. There are 31 amendments here out \nof a list of 77.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are now pending.\n  (The amendments are printed in the Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been informed that the last item on \nthis list, item No. 3242, may have already been agreed to, which in \nthis case if it has already been agreed to, I ask it be deleted from \nthe list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be deleted from the list.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under that circumstance.\n  And I ask these be ruled to be pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They are pending amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is provided for by the unanimous consent request; am \nI not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendments of the Senator from Virginia are pending \nat the time the Senator from Michigan sent his list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, if the Senator from Virginia would yield, the only \nreason I made reference to that is that the Senator from Virginia had \nmade reference to that fact, or that the Presiding Officer more \naccurately said the amendments of the Senator from Virginia were now \npending. I just wanted the same ruling.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine.\n  In addressing my colleague from Michigan, I speak to the Senate in \nits entirety, if you will give the managers of the bill a period of \ntime to look through this, we might be able to quickly advise the \nSenate as to those we think we can accept. They will require some \nmodification because in the procedure each side has voiced its own \nsuggestions as to how they will be modified and shortly after we \nindicate to the Senate those amendments which we require would require \nmore debate and possibly a recorded vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I fully agree \nwith his proposed course of action. I am wondering if he might suggest \nwhat that period of time might be.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to think a 30-minute time \nperiod, so about 7:20. I can ask for a quorum call until such time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be fine with us.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will be able to advise the Senate as to the status of \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Yes. After the first vote, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Second, that there be 2 minutes between each of these \namendments. Senator Byrd has always asked that we do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is acceptable.\n  Mr. REID. Two minutes equally divided. That is fairly standard. The \nmajority leader didn't want any time, as the chairman will recall.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand. I have to look at it in the interest of my \ncolleagues--no disrespect to the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is fine with us. But I want the Record \nto reflect that we would agree to even less time on amendments. As we \nproceed with the debate on this group of amendments, we could have \nsaved 30 minutes if we did not use all of our time.\n  We have no objection to the request of the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I accept responsibility for increasing the \ntime. I just feel that these are important issues, and some of my \ncolleagues are very anxious to express their views. I want to make that \npossible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one other issue, because we are trying to \npush this bill very quickly, we always appreciate and admire the \nSenator from Virginia for his forthright statements and knowledge. We \nthink it might be possible as we proceed on at least these amendments \nthat some of the time could be yielded. That would be in everybody's \ninterest, if it is possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be an option with equal division of time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3409\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle \namendment, and in strong support of our Nation's veterans.\n  Our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have my steadfast \nsupport. So do those who served before them. Our veterans need to know \nthat America is with them and that we owe them a debt of gratitude. \nCongress must show that gratitude not just with words, but with deeds. \nThat means making our troops and our veterans a priority in the Federal \ncheckbook.\n  That is why I am such a strong supporter of the Daschle amendment. \nThe goal of this amendment is simple and straightforward--to guarantee \nenough funding in the Federal checkbook each year to provide health \ncare to every single veteran enrolled in the VA system.\n  This amendment does four things to support our Nation's veterans:\n  First, the amendment sets a minimum level of funding for VA health \ncare each year. This amount is based on the number of veterans enrolled \nin the VA system. This is important to ensure that VA can provide care \nfor every veteran, without rationing care or charging deductibles, \nfees, or increased copayments.\n  Second, the amendment provides an annual adjustment for inflation, so \nthat VA can keep up with the rising costs of medical equipment, \nsupplies, and prescription drugs.\n  Third, the amendment says that after 2 years, the General Accounting \nOffice, GAO, will provide Congress with a report of whether this \nfunding was adequate to provide care for all of our veterans. The \namendment also sets up a process to correct any flaws that GAO \nidentifies.\n  Fourth, the amendment moves future increases to VA health care \nfunding from the discretionary to the mandatory side of the Federal \nbudget. This is important so that the VA-HUD Subcommittee won't have to \nhave to forage for funds each year, and veterans won't have to compete \nfor funding.\n  As the ranking member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, my \nguiding principle for the VA budget is that promises made to our \nveterans must be promises kept. And each year, the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee makes veterans health care funding the top \npriority. We do this on a bipartisan basis, because when it comes to \ncaring for our Nation's veterans, we are not members of the\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\nDemocratic or Republican parties. We are members of the red, white, and \nblue party.\n  But each year, we have to forage for funds. Over the last 3 years, we \nhave worked on a bipartisan basis to reject new fees and increased \ncopayments on our Nation's veterans.\n  In 2003, the administration proposed that Priority 7 and 8 veterans \npay a yearly $1,500 deductible just to access VA health care. On a \nbipartisan basis, Congress rejected this proposal. Instead, we put $1.1 \nbillion more in VA's budget.\n  In 2004, the administration proposed that Priority 7 and 8 veterans \npay a yearly $250 fee to access VA health care. The budget also \nproposed increases in veterans' copayments--a 50 percent increase in \nthe prescription drug copayment and a 30 percent increase in copayments \nfor doctors visits. Again, on a bipartisan basis, Congress rejected \nthese proposals. Instead, we put $1.3 billion more in the VA's budget.\n  The administration's 2005 budget again proposes a $250 annual fee and \nincreased prescription drug copayments for veterans. And again this \nyear, Senator Bond and I will fight to find the funding to reject these \nproposals.\n  But despite our efforts and these record increases, VA health care \nfunding is just not keeping up with the needs of our Nation's veterans. \nThis mismatch of funding and demand for VA health care has led the \nadministration to ration VA health care. In January 2002, the \nadministration closed enrollment to all new Priority 8 veterans. This \nis unacceptable. In addition, the VA has already treated 10,000 of our \nnewest veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Our newest \nveterans deserve to know that the VA will be there to care for them.\n  Finally, I want to point out that under this amendment, Congress \nwould keep its oversight authority over how VA health care funding is \nspent. The Appropriations and Veterans Affairs Committees would still \nbe able to hold VA accountable for how it spends its money, and how it \nprovides health care to veterans. Congress will continue to stand up \nfor our Nation's veterans.\n  The Task Force To Improve Health Care Delivery For Our Nation's \nVeterans, a bipartisan task force of experts on health care convened at \nthe request of the President, concluded that there is a definite \nmismatch between demand and funding for VA health care. The Task Force \nrecommended fixing this mismatch. The Daschle amendment is a bold \nsolution to this problem.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to stand up for our Nation's \nveterans by supporting the Daschle amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Daschle \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2005.\n  Mr. President, I introduced the Veterans Health Care Funding \nGuarantee Act in both the 107th and 108th Congress because I believe \nthe system we use to fund VA health care is broken. Both my legislation \nand the Daschle amendment would fix this problem and fully fund the \nVeterans Administration health care system by making VA medical care \nmandatory, rather than discretionary, spending.\n  Once again, we face a budget that severely underfunds VA medical care \nneeds. Under the budget submitted to Congress by the President, many \nveterans will not have access to the VA health care system, will have \nincreased copayments and fees, and will face continuing delays to \naccess the care they were promised. And once again, Congress will be \nforced to make the difficult choices in finding additional funds for \nthe VA. I am concerned that this yearly struggle to find just enough \nfunding for veterans health care is unsustainable it breaks the \npromises we made to our veterans and threatens the long-term viability \nof the entire VA health care system.\n  This is what makes legislation such as the Veterans Health Care \nFunding Guarantee Act and the Daschle amendment particularly \ninteresting. The amendment recognizes the need to automatically \ncalculate the effects of inflation and to factor in the number of \nveterans utilizing the VA health care system in determining the \nnecessary level of medical care funding.\n  Mr. President, this approach has been endorsed by the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American \nLegion. In addition, the President's Task Force to Improve Health Care \nDelivery for Our Nation's Veterans--a 15-member panel that was \nassembled to study the health care needs of our Nation's veterans--has \nweighed in on this issue. This Presidential task force released their \nrecommendations in a report on May 28, 2003. The report stated clearly \nthat the most pressing problem facing the VA health system is that \nfunding is not keeping pace with the need for care.\n  While the panel encouraged greater cooperation between the VA and the \nDepartment of Defense's health care system, they recognized this would \nnot address the fundamental problem. Instead, the panel recommended two \nsolutions to the VA's funding problems: create an independent board \nwhich will set the level of VA health care spending each year, or \nestablish a formula to provide a mandatory amount of funding for VA \nmedical care. This second recommendation is the concept contained in \nthe amendment we are debating today. I hope that my colleagues will \nread the report produced by the President's Task Force to Improve \nHealth Care Delivery for Our Nation's Veterans because I believe it \nprovides a solid basis for supporting the Daschle amendment.\n  I close by discussing why we are debating this amendment today and on \nthis particular bill. Some have questioned including a veterans health \ncare amendment as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act. \nHowever, I can think of no more appropriate bill on which to discuss \nwhether or not we are going to live up to our commitments to our \nnation's veterans. As the father of a soldier who has served in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Kosovo, and Bosnia, I know that poor treatment of our \nveterans severely impacts our ability to recruit and retain the best \nand brightest for our military. We simply can not separate the issue of \nthe treatment of our troops and the treatment of our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for offering this amendment \nand encourage my colleagues to support our veterans by voting in favor \nof the pending amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3470\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I submitted an amendment \nto the fiscal year 2005 National Defense Authorization bill that would \neliminate the current offset against annuities paid by the Department \nof Defense Survivors' Benefits Plan--SBP--for Veterans Administration \nDependency and Indemnity Compensation--DIC. I ask for my colleagues' \nsupport for this amendment and invite their cosponsorship.\n  Unfortunately, many of us do not realize that a reduction similar to \nthe current offset rules for military retirement and veterans' \ndisability compensation applies to the survivors of military retirees \nenrolled in the Survivor Benefit Plan--SBP. Payments for the survivors \nof our retirees from the military Survivor Benefit Plan--SBP--are \nreduced by benefits payable from the veterans' Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation--DIC--program. Thus, surviving spouses of 100 percent \ndisabled military retirees generally cannot receive benefits through \nboth the retirement system and the veterans' disability system.\n  Over the last few years we have made a tremendous effort to repeal \nthe law that prohibits concurrent receipt of retired pay and disability \ncompensation for our military retirees. This year we have already \nadopted a provision in the fiscal year 2005 National Defense \nAuthorization bill that will eliminate the phasing over 10 years of \nretired pay for retirees with 100 percent disability. I supported this \nprovision. We have to take care of our most deserving retirees, but we \nshould also take care of their survivors.\n  I have long supported the full implementation of concurrent receipt, \nbut I do not understand why we would leave behind the widows and \ndependent children of those retirees that have purchased the income \nprotection provided by the Survivors Benefit Plan. I know of no \npurchased annuity plan that denies its benefit based on the receipt of \nanother benefit. This is wrong and it hurts our most valuable widows--\nthose left behind by combat losses and retirees fully disabled by their \nservice.\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\n  It is difficult to justify paying military retired pay and veterans' \ncompensation concurrently to the retiree but not paying benefits from \nboth the SBP and the DIC concurrently to that retiree's widow or \nsurviving children. My amendment ensures consistency in the application \nof benefits to survivors from the SBP program and DIC. I urge the \nSenate to adopt this amendment and take care of our military widows.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not believe there are further matters \nin relation to this bill. At this point in time, I will proceed to wrap \nup on behalf of leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the chairman said just a few moments ago \non the floor, there has been a lot of hard work on the Defense bill \nover the course of the last month and over the course of the day. We \ncontinued to clear amendments on both sides. And although we have been \nin a quorum call, off and on, over the course of the night, as the \nchairman implied, there have been a lot of negotiations, and a lot of \nprogress has been made in addressing the large number of amendments \nthat we, at 6:30, realized we had. We continue to clear amendments on \nboth sides, and we have entered into an agreement for votes on \napproximately five amendments tomorrow morning.\n  Unfortunately--and I made it clear to both managers and \nrepresentatives of our leadership and leadership on the other side of \nthe aisle--it is still unclear as to exactly how we are going to bring \nthis bill to closure, how we will finish this bill. We have had this \nlarge number of consultations throughout the evening with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, and I do think it is time we bring the bill to \nconclusion. I believe it is really past that time.\n  But, again, everybody is working in good faith. I do respect Members' \nrights to offer amendments. However, as majority leader, I am charged \nwith ensuring that we finish our work and that we are able to address \nthe other very important work ahead of us. I specifically mentioned, in \nthis case, the appropriations bill which provides the funding to \nsupport our troops overseas.\n  Having said that, I will file a cloture motion so all of our options \nare preserved. I understand everybody is proceeding in good faith for \ncompletion tomorrow. We will continue to find a way to finish the bill \ntomorrow, but we will have this cloture vote on Thursday if it becomes \nnecessary.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on calendar No. \n     503, S. 2400, an original bill to authorize appropriations \n     for fiscal year 2005 for military activities of the \n     Department of Defense, for military construction, and for \n     defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the armed \n     services, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Trent Lott, \n           John W.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, soon we will be voting on the nomination of \nWalter DeKalb Kelley, Jr., to be a Federal judge for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia. My colleague, Senator \nWarner, and I know him as Walt. We very much support his nomination. I \nhave known Walt Kelley for a long time now. He is one who continues to \nimpress me as a gentleman. I have always found him to be even tempered, \nno matter the situation, no matter how fractious things might be. He \nalways has a good, steady demeanor about him, which I think is an \nimportant attribute, especially for a trial judge.\n  Senator Warner and I interviewed many outstanding nominees for this \njudgeship in the Eastern District of Virginia. The things I care about \nare experience, to the extent you can find somebody who has judicial \nexperience. Also, when you look at their experience and talk about \nthem, whether it is in the courtroom or what their beliefs are, it is \nimportant to figure out what their judicial philosophy might be.\n  On the point of judicial philosophy, as a judge, Walt Kelley will be \none who understands the proper role of the judiciary, in particular to \nadjudicate a case, applying the facts and evidence before the court, \napplying the law in the proper way, as opposed to a judge who might \nwant to invent new law.\n  As far as experience is concerned, while Walt Kelley has not served \nas a judge, he has a tremendous amount of experience in the courtroom, \narguing and taking to final adjudication 25 cases in various Federal \ncourts.\n  He has been endorsed and supported by the Virginia Association of \nDefense Attorneys and the Virginia State Bar. The American Bar \nAssociation has also given Walt Kelley a unanimous opinion of ``well \nqualified.'' He is rated ``AV'' by Martindale-Hubbell. In addition, the \nVirginia Women Attorneys Association supports his nomination.\n  He is an individual of great character, and he supports important \naspects of the community in the Hampton Roads area. He is the chairman \nor the rector of the Board of Visitors at Old Dominion University in \nNorfolk. He is a trustee at Norfolk Collegiate School, where he \nattended, and his three children currently attend school. He is an \nadjunct professor in antitrust law at Regent University School of Law. \nHe was on the Virginia Attorney General's Task Force on Higher \nEducation, and he is also the director of the Hampton Roads Salvation \nArmy Adult Rehabilitation Center Advisory Board, making sure folks are \nrehabilitated from being addicted to drugs, or using drugs, so they may \nbecome productive citizens.\n  Walt Kelley is an outstanding individual. He has the experience, the \ntemperament, and the right philosophy to be a judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia for many decades to come. I look forward to voting \nfor him and respectfully urge my colleagues to support the nomination \nof Walter Kelley to the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7162-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7162-S7163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JUAN R.

Judge Sanchez was born in Puerto \nRico, but emigrated to the United States at an early age and has an \noutstanding academic record from City College of New York, where he had \nhis bachelor's degree cum laude in 1978. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law School with his J.D. degree and has a \nvery impressive background. He served in the Legal Aid Society of \nChester County where he was staff attorney for 2 years, and then a \npartner in a private law firm. He also served the County of Chester in \nthe Public Defender's Office for some 4 years; and for the last 6 \nyears, he has been a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester \nCounty.\n  Mr. Sanchez was nominated by the bipartisan nominating committee \nwhich Senator Santorum and I have recommended to the President, \nwithstood the rigor of the examinations and has been voted out of \ncommittee unanimously. I think he will make an outstanding judge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Judge Sanchez's resume be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Juan R.

PERRY--NEVADA TRIAL LAWYER OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Robert H. \nPerry, who has been recognized as Nevada Trial Lawyer of the Year by \nthe Nevada Trial Lawyers Association.\n  Mr. Perry grew up in Topeka, KS, and attended the United States Naval \nAcademy. Following his graduation, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps. \nAfter he completed his military service, Mr. Perry worked in sales in \nMontana, and then returned to Kansas where he became a mentor for youth \nwho were detained in the justice system. That whetted his interest in \nthe legal system, and he decided to attend law school at the University \nof Kansas.\n  After he graduated law school, Mr. Perry moved to Nevada, where he \nbecame a successful prosecutor in the Washoe County District Attorney's \nOffice. After several years, he rose to the position of Deputy District \nAttorney for the Criminal Division.\n  In 1976, Mr. Perry joined the law firm of Laxalt and Berry, and a few \nyears later he formed a partnership with Richard Davenport. He ventured \nout on his own in 1991, forming Robert H. Perry, Ltd., and concentrated \non civil trial work.\n  Since then Mr. Perry has dedicated himself to representing average \ncitizens who have been harmed by the wrongful actions of others. Many \ntimes the party that did the harm was much more powerful than the \nvictim--but in our legal system, it is possible for ordinary people to \nget justice, thanks to lawyers like Mr. Perry.\n  In 2001, Mr. Perry represented a young girl whose medical treatment \nhad been delayed because the treating physician thought she was \ncomplaining in order to receive more painkillers. But in fact, she was \nreally sick. When surgery was finally performed on this girl, only \nthree feet of her small intestine remained. Today, and for the rest of \nher life, she must receive her nourishment intravenously.\n  Mr. Perry fought for her and she won the largest verdict for medical \nmalpractice in Nevada history.\n  This is just an example of the kind of battles that Robert Perry \nwages on behalf of his clients. I salute him for his selection as Trial \nLawyer of the Year, and extend my best wishes for success in all his \nfuture ventures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7163-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In Wichita, KS, on June 29, 2001, a 58-year old openly gay \nhairdresser, Marcell Eads, was beaten and died from burns and smoke \ninhalation after the alleged bashers set his home on fire. Zachary \nSteward, 18, and Brandon Boone, 17, were arrested in connection with \nthe crime. Steward claimed that Eads had made sexual advances toward \nhim, prompting Boone to start beating Eads with a broomstick and later \nwith the end of a table and a rock. The perpetrators accused each other \nof setting the fire that killed Eads, and both took credit for trying \nto put out the fire.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7163-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAITH IN ACTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the 21st century, advances in \nmedicine are allowing Americans to live longer than ever before. Today, \nthe average American will live to be over 76 years old. As the \ncollective age of society increases, so does the need for increased \nhelp, care, and support, as long-term illnesses and the frailties of \nage become the rule, not the exception. Faith in Action volunteers play \na crucial role in ensuring that help is there for neighbors in need.\n  Faith in Action is a nationwide, interfaith coalition that works to \nhelp people with long-term health needs or disabilities maintain their \nindependence by providing assistance with daily activities. Funded by \nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Faith in Action boasts 100,000 \nnationwide volunteers serving over 200,000 care recipients.\n  Through Faith in Action, Americans of every faith--including \nCatholics, Protestants, Hindus, Jews and Muslims--work together to \nimprove the lives of their neighbors in need. Faith in Action \nvolunteers help others maintain their independence by doing simple \nthings: watering flowers, shopping for groceries, taking people to the \ndoctor, and simply listening. Sometimes they open doors that people \ncan't open on their own.\n  In my home State of Iowa, over 2,100 dedicated volunteers work in \nlocal programs to contribute approximately 315,000 volunteer hours per \nyear--a service valued at nearly $5.2 million.\n  But the value of Faith in Action is measured not by dollars and \ncents. Nor is the value measured by the number of volunteers, or the \nnumber of hours donated. The real value of Faith in Action is measured \nby the warm smiles of gratitude that line the faces of those whose \nlives have been enriched by the kind touch of a stranger.\n  Fred Jones is a man who knows firsthand the value of Faith in Action. \nFred lives with his wife in the rural farmhouse where he was born, on \nthe outskirts of Parnell, IA. Fred is, by any measure, a big man--\nstanding 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighing over 200 pounds. Twelve \nyears ago, Fred had a major stroke--a stroke that left half of his body \nparalyzed, and left Fred confined to a wheelchair in a home not built \nwith wheelchairs in mind.\n  After the stroke, Fred's wife did not want to put him in a care \nfacility and dreaded the thought of leaving the home where he was born. \nSo at 76 years old and without any help, Mrs. Jones assumed the burden \nof lifting Fred up and down the 6-inch step from the front door of \ntheir home to the sidewalk below.\n  When Faith in Action was notified of the situation, the dedicated \nstaff found resources to pay for the materials and a volunteer to \ninstall a wheelchair ramp for the elderly couple. Now Mrs. Jones is \nable to maneuver her husband in and out of their home with ease. Fred \ncan now go to church, enjoy the sunshine, and watch his grandchildren \nplay.\n  As an Iowan and a Member of Congress, I greatly appreciate the \nselfless acts of charity done by Faith in Action volunteers and I look \nforward to even greater accomplishments in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7163-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7163-S7164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE CRISIS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the lamentable \nsituation in Haiti. After suffering political upheaval and widespread \nviolence over the last few months, the Haitian people are now facing \neven more desperate circumstances.\n  During the last 2 weeks of May, floods devastated major sections of \nHaiti and parts of the Dominican Republic. The death toll in Haiti has \nreached nearly 2,600 people not including the missing and medical \npersonnel expect that number to climb higher as the waters recede and \nreclamation efforts become possible.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, aid workers, Haitian \nofficials, and foreign troops--including U.S. soldiers scrambled to \nprevent the crisis from worsening. They have been delivering emergency \nsupplies of food and water, building temporary housing, and working to \nprevent the spread of disease.\n  I am concerned, however, by reports that the efforts are sorely \nunder-funded\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\nand risk being overwhelmed by the sheer size of the disaster. Doctors \nare struggling to combat outbreaks of malaria and dengue, and the New \nYork Times reports that aid workers were using mules for \ntransportation, since the U.S. military is no longer airlifting aid to \nisolated communities. The U.S. Agency for International Development has \npledged $50,000 in emergency aid, but we ought to do much more.\n  I wish I could say that the devastation was solely an act of nature, \nbut it was not. Had these same rains fallen over Florida, the damage \nwould have been much less severe and the death toll would be in the \nsingle digits instead of the thousands.\n  As my esteemed colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, described in his \nstatement on June 1st, Haiti's economic underdevelopment exacerbated \nthe effects of the flooding. Widespread deforestation of hillsides \nmeant that, when the rains came, there was nothing to hold the soil in \nplace. The subsequent landslides devastated many of the villages. And \nwithout roads and emergency services, there was no way to evacuate the \nHaitians who were caught in the path of the floods.\n  Yet the devastation is not over. For the tens of thousands of \nHaitians who were left homeless, whose crops were destroyed, and whose \ncommunities were razed by the floodwaters, the next few months will be \na struggle between life and death.\n  It pains me to say that the floods are only the most recent setback \nfor a country already struggling to overcome economic and social \ncrises. Haiti, by most measures, is the poorest country in the \nhemisphere with nearly 80 percent of its population living in abject \npoverty. The life expectancy has fallen to 52 years and more than 6 \npercent of Haitians are infected with the HIV virus.\n  In recent years Haiti has become a major trans-shipment point for \ncocaine trafficking. The State Department, in its annual Narcotics \nControl Strategy Report, describes Haiti as, ``a key conduit for drug \ntraffickers transporting cocaine from South America to the United \nStates.'' Sadly, more than half of all Haitians are unable to \nparticipate in the formal economy, and, as a consequence, many of these \npeople turn to the illegal drug trade as a source of income.\n  This influx of drug money into Haiti has further eroded the rule-of-\nlaw. Corruption now seems endemic in even the highest levels of \ngovernment and private enterprise.\n  Not all the news from Haiti is bad, however. Recently, I had the \nopportunity to meet with Prime Minister [Gerard] Latortue while he was \nvisiting Washington. I was impressed by his vision for Haiti, and \nencouraged by the efforts he has made since his appointment to \nstabilize the country. During our meeting, Prime Minister Latortue \nemphasized the need for major improvements in infrastructure, \nparticularly in the power sector. He also stressed to me the urgent \nneed for capacity-building amongst government institutions which cannot \ncarry out their responsibilities without the trained personnel and \nresources to do so.\n  Unfortunately the Bush Administration has been extremely slow to \nrespond to Prime Minister Latortue's requests for aid. President \nAristide was deposed in late February, but it wasn't until late May--\nnearly 3 months later--that the Administration finally cobbled together \na $160 million aid package for Haiti--$60 million of which was already \nin the pipeline before the February departure of President Aristide. \nI'm afraid that the amount they have allotted, about $20 per Haitian, \nis too little, too late.\n\n  This lukewarm response only continues a trend in the Bush \nadministration's policy toward Haiti. Since 2000, the U.S. Government \nhas taken a shameful, hands-off approach to Haiti, turning its back on \na growing crisis. After the Bush administration facilitated President \nAristide's removal, citing his incompetence as the justification for \nsupporting the involuntary departure of an elected president, one would \nhave hoped that there was some sense of obligation on the part of the \nadministration to do right by the Haitian people. Sadly, that sense of \nobligation is minimal at best, even in the face of the natural disaster \nthat has recently befallen the Haitian people.\n  So what should the U.S. response be to the political, economic, and \nsocial crises in Haiti? Should we continue the hands-off approach of \nthe Bush administration? Or, should we offer Haiti a hand up? I believe \nthat we have a special obligation to help Haiti, and I'm offering three \nproposals for how we can do that.\n  First, we should halt the removal of the 1,900 U.S. troops currently \nstationed in Haiti. Prime Minister Latortue has asked that we extend \nthe U.S. military presence, fearing that U.S. troops are the only ones \ncapable of dissuading further violence. The original decision to depart \nupon the arrival of the Brazilian-led UN Peacekeeping force was made \nbefore last month's flooding--and before the destabilizing effects of \nthe current humanitarian crisis.\n  Let me take a moment here to talk about the security situation. Many \nhave speculated about the re-establishment of the Haitian Army. Because \nthis is ultimately a question for the Haitian people to answer--\nespecially in light of the Haitian Army's history of abuses--I believe \nthat the decision should be left for the next elected government to \naddress. Given the scarcity of resources and the absence of a specific \nnational security mission, I for one believe that reestablishing the \narmy is a luxury that Haiti can ill afford. In any event, the current \ncaretaker government should concern itself with establishing domestic \nstability and security, preparing for elections, and, most critical of \nall, working to end the current humanitarian crisis.\n  The Bush administration can help the LaTortue government move forward \nwith its stated agenda by working with the international community and \nthe Haitian National Police to establish the rule of law. Clearly \nreestablishing security requires that we step up efforts to disarm all \nthe various illegal armed groups. So far less than 200 arms have been \nrounded up. And the focus seems to be solely on Aristide supporters, \nnot the armed thugs who have perpetrated a reign of terror throughout \nthe countryside for the last nine months.\n  Next, in accordance with the resolution agreed upon by the \nOrganization of American States, we must undertake to foster full \nrestoration of democracy in Haiti. Our first obligation is to get to \nthe bottom of allegations that the United States participated in the \nouster of President Aristide. The OAS has just begun an investigation \ninto the matter, and we should cooperate fully to dispel any myths or \nredress any errors.\n  My last proposal is for a $1 billion emergency aid package for Haiti \nover the next 4 years. If we are willing to devote hundreds of billions \nof dollars for the endeavors in Afghanistan and Iraq--half a world \naway--doesn't it make sense for us to devote a fraction of that amount \nto assist one of our nearest and most impoverished neighbors? \nAnnouncing a multiyear aid package, we demonstrate our commitment to \nthe Haitian people and also serve as an example for others in the \ninternational community to offer up multiyear assistance packages as \nwell. As UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated in March, getting it \nright in Haiti this time, ``means keeping international attention and \nresources engaged for the long haul.''\n  It is long past time for the United States to address the mounting \ncrisis in Haiti. It is time for us to offer the Haitian people a hand \nup. Toward that end, I believe that this body should give serious \nconsideration to making a down payment on the $1 billion aid proposal \nfor Haiti in the FY 2005 Appropriations process when the Senate deals \nwith this legislation. Only through concrete and meaningful U.S. \nassistance on a scale commensurate with Haiti's needs can we ever hope \nto reverse the misery, suffering, and hopelessness that have become \ncommonplace in the lives of close neighbors--8 million of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7164-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7164-S7165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF RAY CHARLES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this moment to reflect on the life \nof Ray Charles. I feel lucky to have grown up with the innovative and \npassionate sounds of Ray Charles unique mix of gospel and blues. His \nwork took listeners from the depths of his profound sadness to \ncathartic heights in his love\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\nand performance of music. Ray Charles will be deeply missed by fans and \nfellow musicians alike.\n  Ray Charles Robinson was born September 23, 1930, in Albany, GA. The \nchild of a mechanic, Bailey Robinson, and a saw-mill worker, Aretha, \nRay Charles' life was a lesson in triumph over adversity. A young \nCharles began losing his sight at infancy and was clinically blind by \nthe age of 7. Two years prior his brother had accidentally drowned, and \nby age 15, Charles lost both parents and had no immediate family. \nAlone, sad, and orphaned, Ray Charles went to live with friends of his \nmother, nearly 200 miles away from home, in Jacksonville, FL.\n  Charles lived in Jacksonville for a year developing his talent as a \nmusician before moving to Orlando, supporting himself, a 16 year-old \norphan, with only his seemingly dauntless optimism to help him along. \nWork was sparse, and income was never guaranteed. He left Florida, \nlooking for a new city with potential for new challenges, took what \nlittle money he had and made a five-day bus trip to Seattle, WA. It was \nhere that Charles formed his first group, a small jazz group called the \nMcSon Trio.\n  Emulating the vocal styles of his musical idol, Nat King Cole, Ray \nCharles formed a rhythm and blues group led by vocalist Ruth Brown. The \nband played night after night in smoky back-alley clubs throughout \nSeattle's red light district. As Charles reflected in his \nautobiography, these clubs consisted of little more than a big room \nwith a band in one corner, liquor in the other, and a shoulder to \nshoulder audience. Playing in Seattle, Ray Charles met Quincy Jones, \nshowing the young future producer how to write and compose music. It \nwas the beginning of a lifelong friendship.\n  It was on the West Coast that Ray Charles' famous career truly began \nto develop. Swingtime Records signed Charles in Seattle, giving him his \nfirst break in the music business. And in 1950, the company flew him to \nLos Angeles to record. In 1952 his contract was purchased by Atlantic \nRecords, and by 1954, Charles had formed his own band recording his \nunique raw and tortured mix of gospel and rhythm n' blues a style that \nwould later be known as soul music--with songs like ``I Got A Woman,'' \nand the later ``Georgia on my Mind,'' with ABC-Paramount. Ray Charles, \nthe innovator and musical provocateur was being called ``The Genius'' \nby contemporaries and playing at such famous venues as Carnegie Hall \nand the Newport Jazz Festival.\n  In the 1960s, Ray Charles would truly come to call Los Angeles home. \nHe had his own studio designed and built by long time friend and \nbusiness manager Joe Adams, and recorded his first album, ``Country and \nWestern Meets Rhythm and Blues,'' at the studio in 1965. Charles would \ncontinue his recording career here for nearly 40 years until his death, \nand once said of the studio, ``I love this place. It's the only home \nI've truly had for most of my professional career, and I would never \nleave it.'' Charles would go on to produce numerous hits in his Los \nAngeles location, continuing an impressive career that would later earn \nhim 12 Grammy Awards between 1960 and 1966, including best R \nrecording for three consecutive years. The Ray Charles Studio was \ndesignated a Los Angeles historical landmark on April 30, 2004 thanks \nto the hard work of Councilman Martin Ludlow and City Council President \nAlex Padilla. Ray Charles made his last public appearance in Los \nAngeles at his studio as the site was designated a city historic \nlandmark, a living testament to Charles' 40 years living and working in \nthe city of Los Angeles.\n  The music of Ray Charles was a deep and powerful reflection of the \nAmerican musical tradition. From troubled origins in the south that \nwould characterize the blues aspect of Charles lyrical style to the \ngospel influences present in so many of Charles' hits, soul music \nencapsulates so much of the American story. From racism, to heartache, \nto loneliness, to redemption, Ray Charles was writing the songs that \ncould only come from an American artist and influencing a generation of \nmusicians. He was at once expert composer, rock and roller, long-\nsufferer, genius, and poet. He was, to say the least, one of America's \ngreatest artists, and will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7165-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO ASSISTANT SECRETARY JESSE ROBERSON\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on Tuesday, June 15, I received some very \nsad news, that Jessie Roberson had announced her resignation as the \nAssistant Secretary for Environmental Management at the Department of \nEnergy effective July 15.\n  I have known Jessie since I was first elected to the Senate in 1996. \nAt the time she was the site manager for the Rocky Flats Environmental \nTechnology site in my State of Colorado. Through our common interest at \nRocky Flats, I got to know her quite well. She not only impressed me \nwith her depth of knowledge but here innovation and determination in \nmaking sure that Rocky Flats would be one of the first major DOE sites \nto close. Under her watch from 1996 to 1999, the Rocky Flats closure \ndate went from 2015 to 2006. I know it was her leadership that moved \nthis ambitious plan forward.\n  When President Bush was elected in 2000, it was that same leadership \nand determination that convinced me to put her name forward knowing \nthat she would be the best person for the job of Assistant Secretary \nfor Environmental Management at the Department. And I can say, \nunequivocally, that she has not disappointed.\n  When I met with her shortly after being confirmed, I told her that \nthe environmental management program was broken and in need of major \nreforms. I added that this would not be easy and that some people would \nnot like the changes which are necessary to make the program work. She \nagreed and she promised that she would work hard to effect change. \nWhile she later told me that it has not been easy, she kept the course \nand has transformed the program from one of just motion to true action. \nThe Department has made tremendous progress in getting sites closer to \nclosure. I can honestly say that what some people did not think \npossible 3 years ago is closer to happening; and that is that sites \nwill be closing. I can only attribute this to the leadership of this \nextraordinary woman.\n  During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on May 16, I inserted into the Record a Denver Post \neditorial entitled ``Roberson a Top Flight Pick'' and quoted one line \nfrom the editorial. It said:\n\n       The Department's environmental management job is in fact \n     one of the toughest positions in the Federal Government. \n     There likely is not a better person around to tackle the \n     task, than Jessie Roberson.\n\n  I believed that statement then, and after 3 years on the job, she \nproved that statement to be true.\n  She has done a tremendous job not just for President Bush and \nSecretary Abraham, but for the entire country. She has made our country \nsafer by accelerating the cleanup of some of the world's most dangerous \nplaces. She is making sure that our children and grandchildren are not \ngoing to have to bear the burden of these contaminated sites.\n  While I am saddened to see her leave her post at the Department, I \nknow that she has nothing but the brightest future ahead of her. I am \nproud to call her my friend and I wish Jessie and her daughter Jessica \nall the best. Thank you, Jessie Roberson, for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7165-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7165-S7166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      60TH ANNIVERSARY OF GI BILL\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 60th \nanniversary of one of the most important bills to ever be passed by \nthis body, the GI bill. Just like the recent remembrance of D-Day and \nthe unveiling of the World War II memorial, the passage of this \nlandmark legislation is another part of the World War II legacy.\n  Sixty years ago today, President Roosevelt signed into law the \n``Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944.'' That bill created \nunprecedented access to education and training for tens of thousands of \nmilitary members returning home after World War II.\n  Even before the War ended, Congress and the Administration were \npreparing for the return of over 15 million men and women serving in \nthe armed services. Without intervention, those 15 million would have \nno jobs or opportunities when they returned home. To\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\nprevent postwar depression caused by mass unemployment, an agency \nwithin the Administration, called the National Resource Planning Board, \nrecommended a set of programs to provide education, training and \nemployment for returning soldiers. One of these recommendations became \nthe Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, which was supported by the \nAmerican Legion and other veteran organizations, and was unanimously \npassed both chambers of Congress. President Franklin D. Roosevelt \nsigned it into law on June 22, 1944.\n  This bill became know as GI bill, and it provided a range of benefits \nto help veterans reintegrate into the workforce and American society. \nIt provided education and training; loan guaranty for a home, farm, or \nbusiness; unemployment pay for up to a year; job-search assistance; \nbuilding materials for veterans hospitals; and military review of \ndishonorable discharges.\n  Veterans were entitled to one year of full-time education or \ntraining, plus a period equal to their time in service, up to four \nyears. This program had a tremendous impact on college enrollment in \nthis country. In fact, in 1947, which was the peak year of the program, \nveterans accounted for 49 percent of college enrollment.\n  Out of a veteran population of 15.4 million, just over half--7.8 \nmillion--were trained, including 2.23 million in college, 3.48 million \nin other schools, 1.4 million in on-job training, and 690,000 in farm \ntraining.\n  Millions of veterans, who would have flooded the labor market, \ninstead opted for education, which reduced joblessness during the \ndemobilization period. When they did enter the labor market, most were \nbetter prepared to contribute to the support of their families and \nsociety.\n  The GI bill created an initiative called the Local Veterans \nEmployment Representative Program, or LVER. This program hired wartime \nveterans to work in employment centers across the U.S. to help other \nveterans secure counseling and employment. For 60 years, the LVER \nProgram has helped veterans find jobs, training, and education. It has \nbecome an integral part of employment services and has been \ninstrumental in helping veterans to resume normal lives after \nreturning.\n  Today, LVER staff in my home State include some of the best-trained \nworker placement and retraining experts in the country. For Washington, \nwhich has one of the largest concentrations of servicemen and women, \nveterans, and their families, this is very important. Within my state, \nPierce County has a particularly high active military and veteran \npopulation, and the LVER program there is a terrific example of what is \npossible.\n  The Pierce County LVER program ensures that over 25,000 veterans \nreceive the vital re-employment support they deserve. With staff \nassistance, they write resumes that reflect the breadth of their \nexperience and skills, draft cover letters, and research employment \nopportunities. Veterans are also provided with leads on specific jobs \nand employers who seek the unique skills and talents of experienced \nveterans.\n  Staff of the Pierce County LVER also set up three major job fairs \neach year, which attract over more than 6,000 veterans and employers \neach year. The LVER office coordinates its activities with over 500 \nlocal, State, and national employers, giving veterans access to a \nunique national support network. The LVER staff includes men and women \nlike Sam Mack, Sal Cantu, Tanya Brewster, and Vicki Bishop, all of whom \nare decorated veterans who are proud to support their fellow servicemen \nand women.\n  Sal Cantu, a resident of Pierce County, epitomizes the dedication and \ncommitment of his colleagues. Sal coordinated a national effort to not \nonly celebrate the GI bill, but specifically to recognize the LVER \nprogram and its tremendous impact on service members who seek \nmeaningful employment once they return home. More than 25 State \ngovernors wrote letters lauding the efforts of the Pierce County LVER \nstaff to recognize the significant impact of their program.\n  Most importantly, Sal, a 40 percent-disabled Vietnam era veteran, \nknows how to build trusting and lasting relationships with veterans. \nFor him, helping veterans chart the next stage of their careers is a \nlabor of love. I am extremely proud of the many men and women like Sal \nwho, after serving honorably in the military, have made it their second \ncareer to support and help locate jobs for their fellow veterans.\n  Yet before the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, the United \nStates did not provide employment or vocational services for veterans \nupon their completion of military service. Since the first GI bill, \nthere have been five subsequent programs enacted to provide benefits to \nveterans of other military conflicts--from the Korean conflict to the \nwar in Iraq. The most recent bill, the Montgomery GI bill enacted in \n1985, is the largest contemporary program providing education benefits \nto military personnel. All enlisted soldiers and veterans are eligible \nfor between $7,500 and $35,000 in educational aid. This program has \nattracted men and women into the armed forces by helping to pay for \ncollege. Today, over 90 percent of those who enter the military enroll \nin the Montgomery GI bill program.\n  As we reflect on the history and success of the GI bill, we should \nconsider how this program can translate to all Americans. The spirit of \nthe GI bill that in exchange for contributing to society, this country \nshould help individuals invest in themselves also holds true for those \nwho have not served in the military. As the cost of education rises, \nmany low- and middle-income students--whether they have served in the \nmilitary or not need help covering educational expenses. We need to \nmake the same kind of investment in the human capital, not just of our \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, but for all Americans. We \nneed a GI bill for all Americans.\n  In the ever-changing global economy, the success of our companies \ndepends on adaptability and innovation. As a result, we must change the \nway we educate and prepare workers to compete in the global economy. \nWhen national leaders were confronted with fundamental changes in the \nsize and nature of the country's workforce following World War II, they \nstepped up to address the challenge with the GI bill. The economic sea \nchanges we face today demand a similar response.\n  To maintain our economic competitiveness, we must keep up with the \ndemand for skilled workers across all sectors of the economy. The \nchanging economy has increased the demand for a college degree. In \nFebruary, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 6 of the 10 \nfastest-growing occupations in the U.S. economy require an associate's \ndegree or bachelor's degree, and that all ten of these careers will \nrequire some type of skills training. By 2010, 40 percent of all job \ngrowth will require some form of post-secondary education.\n  To keep pace in the new, knowledge- and information-based economy, \nit's imperative that we equip our workforce with the skills to succeed \nin high-wage jobs. If we fail, those who lack skills will fall further \nand further behind, imperiling not just their individual futures, but \nAmerica's ability to compete in the global economy.\n  It is the responsibility of this body to return to the level of \ninvestment in higher education that this country made 60 years ago. We \ndo need a new GI bill for all Americans, and I, for one, intend to \nfight to make the idea of universal post-secondary education come to \nfruition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7166-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7166-S7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TOBY GROSSMAN\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share \nwith the Senate the memory of an extraordinary woman. Toby Grossman, of \nAlbuquerque, NM, lost her battle with cancer on May 25, 2004. Her \nhusband, Leonard, and daughter, Jennifer, survive her.\n  Ms. Grossman was the senior staff attorney at the American Indian Law \nCenter, Inc, the oldest existing Indian-controlled and operated legal \nand public policy organization in the country, having joined the center \nin 1971. She also served as the administrator of the Southwest \nIntertribal Court of Appeals, a voluntary court of appeals available to \ntribes in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and west Texas.\n  Ms. Grossman was a graduate of the University of Florida and the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Law, and\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\na member of the New Mexico Bar. A lecturer at the UNM School of Law, \nshe regularly taught courses on the Indian Child Welfare Act and tribal \ngovernment and she co-taught a course on Tribal-State relations. Ms. \nGrossman was a superb teacher. In class, she was serious, probing and \nenthusiastic. She set high standards for herself and expected the same \nfrom her students. Yet she was also friendly and caring in her \nrelations with students, many of whom she remained close with long \nafter they graduated.\n  She specialized in child welfare issues including child abuse and \nneglect, drafting of tribal codes, as well as assisting several tribes \nin negotiating Tribal-State agreements on the Indian Child Welfare Act \nand trained social workers and judges on child welfare law. She also \nled the American Indian Law Center team that developed the first Model \nChildren's Code for tribes, as well as Model Codes for Child Welfare, \nAdoption, and Prevention of Elder Abuse. In these and other areas, \nlocal, State and tribal governments, as well as attorneys, frequently \nsought her advice and services.\n  Ms. Grossman's private life was no less exemplary than her public \nwork. She was a good friend and was devoted to her synagogue.

CROIX ISLAND, MAINE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I mark the celebration of the \n400th anniversary of the settlement of St. Croix Island, in Calais, ME, \none of the earliest European settlements in North America. It is an \nextraordinary site with a remarkable story to tell--a narrative \noverflowing with adventure, courage, risk, and a very special \nfriendship between the Native tribes who peopled this region long ago \nand the pioneers who crossed an ocean in pursuit of opportunity, \nprosperity, and freedom.\n  There is an old Sioux proverb: ``A People without History is like \nWind in the Buffalo Grass.'' When expedition leader Pierre Dugua and \nhis company of 120 settlers arrived on the shores of what is now the \ngreat State of Maine, the First Peoples, the ``People of the Early \nDawn,'' or Wabanaki, had already occupied these lands for thousands of \nyears. Nevertheless, they came out of their villages with open hearts \nand open hands to welcome Dugua and the 120 noblemen, artisans, and \nsoldiers who had sailed with Dugua across the Atlantic from their \nnative France.\n  At that moment, the European settlers began to craft a new history \nfor this place they called ``Acadie.'' But it is important to remember \nthat the Native Peoples, the Wabanaki, had already authored their own, \nproud history of North America, although it has taken us, in some \ncases, all too many years to understand that. That the Native tribes \nwelcomed Dugua and his followers speaks to one of the noblest aspects \nof human nature--an instinct to reach out to men and women in need, to \nour human neighbors, whenever we can help, whether they live across the \nstreet, or across the world. Certainly, that generous impulse lives on \ntoday among the members of the Passamaquoddy Nation.\n  The historical bond between the Native Peoples is also one to \ncelebrate and remember. The lives and personalities of the people in \nthis region continue to be shaped, generation after generation, by the \nhistory, legends, and purpose forever invested in this coastal stone \nand soil by Pierre Dugua and his companions, one of whom was the great \nSamuel Champlain, the ``Father of Canada.'' Let us not forget that 23 \nof the original French settlers remain interred on this island today, \nmaking this a sacred, as well as a historical, site.\n  After four centuries, the settlement of St. Croix remains a powerful \nlesson, a parable that is not only about a journey of a thousand miles, \nbeginning with a single step, but also about the extraordinary ability \nof diverse cultures to support and enrich one another, and, in the end, \nto create new cultures, new peoples who bring unique and singular \nstrengths to the never-ending, universal campaign to build a peaceful \nand prosperous world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7167-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND BOBBY WELCH\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize Reverend Bobby Welch, a native of Fort Payne, \nAL. Recently, Reverend Welch was elected President of the 16.3 million \nmember Southern Baptist Convention. A 1965 graduate of Jacksonville \nState University, Reverend Welch entered the Army and was sent to fight \nin Vietnam, where he demonstrated his bravery and commitment to our \ngreat Nation. Reverend Welch was shot by Vietnamese forces and left for \ndead on the battlefield. This United States paratrooper, Ranger, and \nGreen Beret received a Bronze Star and Purple Heart in recognition of \nhis courage and service.\n  The achievements of Reverend Welch demonstrate the leadership \nqualities of Americans. Reverend Welch has upheld the principles of our \nFounding Fathers through his military service to his country. His \ncourage in harm's way mirrors that of the brave soldiers who now risk \ntheir lives daily for the maintenance of democracy.\n  After his military service, he chose to answer his highest call, the \nChristian ministry. He has poured himself into that calling with \nconviction and zeal, and the harvest has been tremendous. He now \npastors the 4,000 member First Baptist Church of Daytona Beach, FL. \nAnd, now, his Southern Baptist Convention has chosen him as their \npresident.\n  His leadership of this vibrant and growing denomination will continue \nits success in touching the lives of millions who are struggling to \nfind meaning in their lives. This denomination every day provides aid, \ncomfort, purpose, and hope to people that are hurting and in need. They \nhelp those who are sick and dying, those with marital problems, those \nin jail, those with alcohol and drug problems. They sanctify marriage, \ncelebrate births, and provide solace at times of death and loss. They \nfurther these goals through a worldwide ministry. They provide specific \nadvice and financial help and a vision of an new and better life in \nChrist. That's what they do--and they do it every day. And they do it \nwithout government aid or direction. They do it also with fidelity, as \nthey understand it, to the Word contained in the Holy Scriptures. \nFaithfulness to righteous living, even in times of corruption and \nexcess, has always been a cornerstone of the Baptist way and it has \nbenefitted our Nation in far more ways than we can list. So, it is \nappropriate that we pause a moment to recognize Reverend Welch and his \nlife and the many contributions of the Baptist denomination he \nleads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7167-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7167-S7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO DAVID HENRY, SR. AND DAVID HENRY, JR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to recount a special \ndiscovery made recently in south Georgia by a Birmingham constituent of \nmine. The discovery was of a letter dated April 8, 1943, that was sent \nfrom a 24-year-old Alabama soldier serving in North Africa to his \nnewborn son back home. A world war was raging and the letter's author, \nDavid Henry, Sr., of Roanoke, AL, was concerned that he might never get \nto see his newborn son. It is a special letter, indeed, sent from \nanother continent and reflecting the essential values and life's \nlessons that Mr. Henry wanted to impart to his 3-month-old son, David \nHenry, Jr. Among other things, the letter tells young David about the \nvalue of choosing work you enjoy, developing a love of reading, finding \na hobby, and guarding against greed and selfishness.\n  Fortunately, Mr. Henry, Sr., survived the war and returned home to \nhis wife and young son. The letter and the penned wisdom, however, has \nlain dormant for more than 60 years. Mr. Henry, Jr., discovered the \nletter recently while cleaning out his parents' house in south Georgia. \nMr. Henry's dad died this past February. Mr. Henry sent me a copy of \nhis father's letter,\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\nurging that it be used in some productive way. I found the lessons and \nwisdom in the letter profound, and as relevant today as they were in \n1943. I forwarded the letter to The Birmingham News, which ran a timely \nand touching Page 1 story on May 29, 2004, over the Memorial Day \nweekend.\n  Written far away from his home and loved ones, Mr. Henry, Sr.'s, \nletter truly reflects the thoughts of a young man wise beyond his \nyears. I ask consent that the letter and the accompanying newspaper \narticle by Birmingham News reporter Carla Crowder be printed in the \nRecord, so that all can benefit from its timeless wisdom.\n  The material follows:\n\n                     (North Africa, April 8, 1943)\n\n       ``My Dear Son:\n       ``This is the first letter your dad has ever written you, \n     and I expect it will be the last until I see you. Today you \n     are almost three months old. Tomorrow will be your birthday, \n     and I can only say `Happy birthday, son.'\n       ``When you were born I was a long, long way from your \n     mother doing my little part toward preserving the freedom of \n     our country. Had there been no war, nothing could have kept \n     me from being with your mother on January the ninth. There \n     was a war, though, and I am glad that I can say that I had a \n     part toward making our country a safe place so that our \n     mothers can live in peace and comfort.\n       ``There are lots of things I have learned in the past few \n     years, things that I would like for you to know and things \n     that I am sure you will find to be true as you grow older.\n       ``If I were asked to make an eleventh commandment I think I \n     should say. `Thou shall not be selfish.' You will find as the \n     years roll by that it is very hard to keep from being \n     selfish. In this greedy world of ours we run over each other \n     trying to get, we know not what, but with the idea that we \n     must get it before the other fellow does. We do not know when \n     we have enough. We never want to turn anything loose, even if \n     we do not need it. We always want more if we have no place to \n     put it. I think that the first lesson toward happiness is to \n     learn to share what you have with some one else.\n       ``I should like for my son to know how to work and to enjoy \n     it. I think that the secret toward learning to like to work \n     is to believe that you can do your job just a little better \n     than anyone else. I think that every successful man enjoys \n     hard, strenuous outside work as much or maybe more than the \n     office. Start early, learn to cut wood, learn the art of \n     rolling a wheelbarrow or how to handle a hoe. Take long \n     walks. Like through wooded country and by all means never \n     miss a rabbit hunt.\n       ``Begin early to read. Always have something in your pocket \n     to read while waiting on a bus or while trying to go to \n     sleep. Reading is knowledge and knowledge is success.\n       ``Until you are one hundred years old, never be without a \n     hobby. If you are interested in woodwork, then you shall have \n     a shop before you are 10 years of age. If you are interested \n     in radio, then you shall have any type of equipment to tinker \n     with that you wish. Gather information from every source \n     possible. Gather reading material from every place where you \n     might find it. What you learn from your hobbies goes a long \n     way toward your success in life.\n       ``Learn early to make friends. Always remember that you \n     cannot buy real friendship. Remember that a real friend is \n     one of the most valuable possessions a person may have. Learn \n     new names, new faces, facts about people. Learn to really \n     know people.\n       ``There is quite a bit of difference between saving and \n     being selfish. If a person should throw something away, and \n     you come along and save it until you need it, than that would \n     be saving. If you have something you do not need and you \n     throw it away, even though you know someone else might be \n     able to use it, then you are being selfish. Learn to appraise \n     an article, and if it has a value, then save it. Remember \n     what it is and where it is, so that when you or someone else \n     needs it you will be able to find it. Learn to save money. \n     Put it where it can be used. Do not hide it so that no one \n     else can use it.\n       ``One of the most important things that I want my boy to \n     know is that it always pays to be honest. No matter how small \n     or how insignificant, it always pays to tell the truth. Be \n     honest, do not take that which does not belong to you. Do not \n     bother with other people's things. However deep you get in \n     trouble, go to someone, tell them the truth and you will find \n     the easiest way out.\n       ``Very soon you will make a trip from Birmingham to \n     Roanoke, a distance of about one hundred and twenty miles. \n     That is farther away from home than I was until I was about \n     19 years old. You will learn as you grow older that a city is \n     a city whether it is in Alabama, Georgia, New York, England \n     or Africa. I want you to travel early, to find out what it \n     took me years to find out, that every country has its hills \n     and dells, its rivers and branches, its oceans and seas. That \n     you can find all sorts of people in any country, city or \n     village. Never-the-less I want you to travel a lot, see the \n     world. See for yourself that all people want a chance for \n     freedom, a chance to worship as they choose, a chance to talk \n     as they choose and a chance to earn their own living.\n           ``Your loving Dad''\n     David P.

But David Henry Sr. had a \n     lot to say back then as he penned a letter to his newborn \n     son.\n       ``This is the first letter your dad has ever written to \n     you, and I expect it will be the last until I see you. Today \n     you are almost three months old,'' the letter begins.\n       It is dated April 8, 1943, Sixth-one years later, David \n     Henry Jr. read his father's words.\n       For the first time.\n       His mother apparently forgot to pass the letter along, and \n     he had no idea it existed. ``With seven children, and us \n     moving around a lot, a lot of things just got packed up, \n     pictures and letters,'' he said.\n       What he uncovered while going through his parents' \n     belongings last fall revealed a young father wise beyond his \n     years.\n       ``It meant so much to me to be able to hear what he thought \n     was important, and the things he mentioned in there contained \n     such wisdom for a young person,'' said Henry Jr., 61, who \n     works as director of information services for American Cast \n     Iron Pipe Co. ``It was so important, I just want to share it \n     with the world.''\n       Henry Jr. was a toddler when his father returned from the \n     war. His parents had grown up in Roanoke in Randolph County, \n     but lived throughout the Southeast while his father was in \n     the military.\n       The 1943 letter extols the value of honesty, friendship and \n     hard work, as might be expected. But it goes much further.\n       ``You will find as the years roll by that is it very hard \n     to keep from being selfish. In this greedy world of ours, we \n     run over each other trying to get, we know not what, but with \n     the idea that we must get it before the other fellow does . . \n     . I think the first lesson toward happiness is to learn to \n     share what you have with someone else,'' his father wrote.\n       This advice was no surprise, Henry Jr. said.\n       His father once dropped the price of some property he was \n     selling, right at closing time, much to the surprise of the \n     buyer and the lawyers in the room. ``I feel like I'm \n     overcharging you,'' he told the buyer.\n       After his father retired from the Air Force and the U.S. \n     Postal Service, he began cutting limbs and trees, ``big old \n     water oak trees,'' down in southwest Georgia where he lived. \n     He charged next to nothing. ``He probably cut trees for half \n     the widows in Bainbridge,'' his son said.\n       There's a bit of that in the letter as well.\n       ``Learn to cut wood, learn the art of rolling a wheelbarrow \n     or how to handle a hoe. Take long walks. Hike through rough \n     wooded country,'' it reads.\n       He encouraged his boy to never be without a hobby. Henry \n     Jr. loves photography.\n       He encouraged travel.\n       ``You will learn as you grow older that a city is a city \n     whether it is in Alabama, Georgia, New York, England or \n     Africa,'' it says. ``See for yourself that all people want a \n     chance for freedom, a chance to worship as they choose, a \n     chance to talk as they choose and a chance to earn their own \n     living.''\n       Henry Jr. took that advice as well. He recently returned \n     from a trip to Morocco, where he tried to seek out places his \n     father might have been during the war.\n       By the time the letter was discovered, the hopeful young \n     airman was dying from dementia in an assisted living center.\n       Though the son could not determine how much his father \n     understood, he had to tell him what he'd found.\n       ``But he didn't understand, he couldn't communicate with me \n     about it,'' Henry Jr. said. ``I did talk to him about it, and \n     I thanked him for it.''\n       He read the letter at his father's funeral in February, and \n     everyone in the church told him ``that's exactly how dad \n     was.''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7168-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7168-S7169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO CONGRESS CONCERNING THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE'S \n  CERTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 8 OF THE FISHERMAN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF \n   1967, AS AMENDED (THE ``PELLY AMENDMENT'') (22 U.S.C. 1978) THAT \n      ICELAND HAS CONDUCTED WHALING ACTIVITIES THAT DIMINISH THE \n      EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) \n                      CONSERVATION PROGRAM--PM 88\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On June 16, 2004, Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans certified under \nsection 8 of the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967, as amended (the \n``Pelly Amendment'') (22 U.S.C. 1978), that Iceland has conducted \nwhaling activities\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\nthat diminish the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission \n(IWC) conservation program. This message constitutes my report to the \nCongress consistent with subsection (b) of the Pelly Amendment.\n  The certification of the Secretary of Commerce is the first against \nIceland for its lethal research whaling program. In 2003, Iceland \nannounced that it would begin a lethal research whaling program and \nplanned to take 250 minke, fin, and sei whales for research purposes. \nThe United States expressed strong opposition to Iceland's decision, in \nkeeping with our longstanding policy against lethal research whaling. \nIceland's proposal was criticized at the June 2003 IWC Annual Meeting \nby a majority of members of the IWC Scientific Committee, and the IWC \npassed a resolution that urged Iceland not to commence this program. In \naddition, the United States, along with 22 other nations, issued a \njoint protest asking Iceland to halt the program immediately. The \nUnited States believes the Icelandic research whaling program is of \nquestionable scientific validity. Scientific data relevant to the \nmanagement of whale stocks can be collected by non-lethal techniques. \nSince Iceland's 2003 announcement, Iceland reduced its proposed take to \n38 minke whales and in implementing its lethal research program, killed \n36 whales last year. For this year, Iceland has proposed taking 25 \nminke whales. The United States welcomes this decision to reduce the \ntake and to limit it to minke whales, and we appreciate Iceland's \nconstructive work with the United States at the IWC on a variety of \nwhaling issues. These adjustments, however, do not change our \nassessment that Iceland's lethal research whaling program is of \nquestionable scientific validity and diminishes the effectiveness of \nthe IWC's conservation program.\n  In his letter of June 16, 2004, Secretary Evans expressed his concern \nfor these actions, and I share these concerns. I also concur in his \nrecommendation that the use of trade sanctions is not the course of \naction needed to resolve our current differences with Iceland over \nresearch whaling activities. Accordingly, I am not directing the \nSecretary of the Treasury to impose trade sanctions on Icelandic \nproducts for the whaling activities that led to certification by the \nSecretary of Commerce. However, to ensure that this issue continues to \nreceive the highest level of attention, I am directing U.S. delegations \nattending future bilateral meetings with Iceland regarding whaling \nissues to raise our concerns and seek ways to halt these whaling \nactions. I am also directing the Secretaries of State and Commerce to \nkeep this situation under close review and to continue to work with \nIceland to encourage it to cease its lethal scientific research whaling \nactivities. I believe these diplomatic efforts hold the most promise of \neffecting change in Iceland's research whaling program, and do not \nbelieve that imposing import prohibitions would further our objectives.\n                                                        George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSTATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS--Friday, June 18, \n                                  2004\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2549. A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \nDel Refugio Plascencia; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez \nand his wife, Maria Del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals who live \nin the San Bruno area of California.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States \ncitizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, \nwithout this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much \nlonger.\n  The Plascencias have worked for years to adjust their status through \nthe appropriate legal channels, only to have their efforts thwarted by \ninattentive legal counsel. Repeatedly, the Plascencias' lawyer refused \nto return their calls or otherwise communicate with them in anyway. He \nalso failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even notify \nthe Plascencias that he had them. Because of the poor representation \nthey received, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia only became aware that they had \nbeen ordered to leave the country 15 days prior to their deportation. \nAlthough the family was stunned and devastated by this discovery, they \nacted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and to file the appropriate \npaperwork to delay their deportation to determine if any other legal \naction could be taken.\n  The Plascencias' current date of removal from the United States is \nset for June 23rd.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed \nfrom the United States.\n  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. \nPlascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded \ncouple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to family \nand devotion to community.\n  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's \nShellfish for the past 13 years, where his dedication and willingness \nto learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial \nposition. He now oversees the market's entire packaging operation and \nseveral employees. The president of the market, in one of the several \ndozen letters I have received in support of Mr. Plascencia, referred to \nhim as ``a valuable and respected employee'' who ``handles himself in a \nvery professional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' to other \nemployees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. Plascencia's job \nperformance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' ``trusted,'' \n``honest,'' and ``reliable.''\n  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as \na medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. \nNot satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia \nwent to school, earned her high school equivalency degree and improved \nher skills to become a medical assistant. Until her work permit expired \nlast week, Mrs. Plascencia was working in Kaiser Permanente's Oncology \nDepartment, where she attended to cancer patients. Those who have \nwritten to me in support of Mrs. Plascencia, of which there are \nseveral, have described her work as ``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and \n``compassionate.'' In fact, Kaiser Permanente's Director of Internal \nMedicine, Nurse Rose Carino, wrote to say that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an \nasset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we Americans extol: \nhardworking, devoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] \ninvolved in her community. She and her family are a solid example of \nthe type of immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.'' \nMrs. Carino went on to write that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an excellent \nemployee and role model for her colleagues. She works in a very \ndemanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by the \nphysicians she works with.''\n\n  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional \nsuccesses to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. \nThey saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health \ncare benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want \nto send their children to college and give them an even better life.\n  This legislation is important because it would preserve these \nachievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to \nmake substantive contributions to the community in the future. It is \nimportant, also, because of the positive impact it will have on the \ncouple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen and\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\neach of whom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the \nBay Area community.\n  Christina, 13, is the Plascencias' oldest child, and an honor student \nwith a 3.0 grade-point average at Parkside Intermediate School in San \nBruno.\n  Erika, 9, and Alfredo, Jr., 7, are enrolled at Belle Air Elementary, \nwhere they have worked hard at their studies and received praise and \ngood grades from their teachers. In fact, last year, the principal of \nErika's school recognized her as the ``Most Artistic'' student in her \nclass. Recently, Erika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked on a report \ncard, ``Erika is a bright spot in my classroom.''\n  The Plascencias' youngest child is 2 year-old Daisy.\n  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be \ntragic for their children. Children who were born in the United States \nand who through no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation \nthat has the potential to dramatically alter their lives.\n  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencias' older children--\nChristina, Erika, and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They \nare old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their \nteachers, their friends and their home. They would leave everything \nthat is familiar to them. Their parents would find themselves in Mexico \nwithout a job and without a house. The children would have to acclimate \nto a different culture, language and way of life.\n  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave \ntheir children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which \nno parents should have to make.\n  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are \nnot my own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with \nthe Plascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the \nAmerican spirit. I have sponsored this legislation, and asked my \ncolleagues to support it, because I believe that this is a spirit that \nwe must nurture wherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to \nleave the United States would extinguish that spirit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that six of more than 50 letters of support \nmy office has received from members of the San Bruno community be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                         H Food Int'l, Inc.,\n\n                            San Francisco, CA, September 30, 2002.\n     Re Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and/or Maria Plascencia\n     Immigration and Naturalization Service,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       I have known Alfredo Plascencia Lopez for at least nine \n     years.

I deal directly with Alfredo \n     regarding the quality of seafood that Vince's Shellfish \n     receives from me.\n       Working with Alfredo on a daily basis, I have come to know \n     Alfredo as an honest, reliable, and hard working family man. \n     Even though we do a tremendous amount of business, I really \n     consider him a good friend and caring person.\n       If Alfredo were to be deported, it would be a great loss \n     not only to the fish business, but also importantly to his \n     young and growing family.

I first came to know \n     them in our church when they came to worship on a Sunday. \n     This happened around January in 1998.\n       And so for the last 4 years both Alfredo and Maria have \n     been two of our outstanding parishioners at St. Bruno's \n     Church. They come to Sunday Mass and worship, and have been \n     involved in many ministries and services here in our church \n     at St. Bruno's. Alfredo has been especially a minister of \n     hospitality, always welcoming people to church and to \n     participation in the life of the community, helping to \n     provide a spirit of acceptance and concern among our people \n     and providing bread and refreshments for some gatherings. \n     Maria has been especially involved as a teacher, faithfully \n     giving to our children the fundamentals of our Faith, of the \n     Gospel and of a Christian moral life. They have four children \n     all of whom have been baptized at St. Bruno's Church and come \n     to our School of Religion and our church.\n       Alfredo and Maria have been most generous with their time, \n     their talents and their money, sharing all these with the \n     members of our Church Community. They have also frequently \n     donated food to the church and to the Pastor. I have found \n     them to be really good Christian people, most generous, \n     considerate, kind, honest and reliable. If they would have to \n     leave the United States, it will be most difficult for them \n     and for their children who have been growing in a Christian \n     environment and are doing so well; it would be a tremendous \n     loss. We too here in our church would find it difficult \n     without them. For they are a great asset to this country and \n     to our church and to many people.\n       We appreciate whatever you can do for them to help them get \n     their legal papers of residence in the United States.\n       Thank you very much.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Rev.

I \n     am the Director of Medicine at Kaiser Permanente, South San \n     Francisco. I have known Maria since she was hired as a \n     medical assistant into my department in July 2000.\n       Maria is an excellent employee and role model for her \n     colleagues. She is extremely dependable; in the two years she \n     has worked for me she has called in sick only once. She works \n     in a very demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and \n     depended on by the physicians she works with. Maria is \n     flexible, thorough and proactive. She pays attention to \n     detail and identifies potential problems before they occur. \n     In addition, her bilingual skills enhance the patient care \n     experience for our members who speak Spanish.\n       In her short tenure here, Maria found time to volunteer \n     with our community outreach programs. She served as a \n     volunteer interpreter for our recent Neighbors in Health \n     event, wherein free health care was provided to uninsured \n     children in our local community.\n       I can't say enough about Maria and the type of person she \n     is. I feel fortunate to have her in my department. She is an \n     asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we \n     Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family, \n     trustworthy and loyal employee, involved in her community. \n     She and her family are a solid example of the type of \n     immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.\n       It would be an incredible miscarriage of justice if Maria \n     and Alfredo are deported. They came to this country to pursue \n     a better life and afford their children opportunities that \n     they wouldn't have in Mexico. They have begun to do just that \n     by establishing roots in the community and purchasing a home. \n     They have never taken advantage of the ``system'' by \n     enrolling on welfare or Medi-Cal, preferring to pay their own \n     way. Deporting Maria and Alfredo would rip their family apart \n     and result in either depriving their children of a loving \n     family or depriving them of their rights as American citizens \n     if they leave the country of their birth with their parents.\n       I pray that you will allow them the opportunity to live in \n     this country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Rose Carino, RN,\n     Director, Department of Medicine.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n      The Permanente Medical Group, Inc.

She also is responsible, efficient and a pleasure \n     to work with on a daily basis. Ms. Plascencia is a vital \n     member of the oncology staff. On one occasion I mentioned my \n     concern regarding a 90-year-old cancer patient with limited \n     vision, without family or friends. Ms. Plascencia immediately \n     wanted to know if she and her church group could stop by and \n     read to this woman.\n       I have met Mr. Plascencia on several occasions. I find him \n     to be a pleasant, responsible, and a devoted family man who \n     works hard to provide for his family.\n       In conclusion, Maria Del Refugio Plascencia and Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez are two people any citizen of the United \n     States would be happy and proud to have as neighbors, \n     employees and friends.

Alfredo started as a part-\n     time employee 01/91 and I was so impressed with his work \n     ethic and loyalty that I was quick to hire him full-time \n     within a year and a half. Alfredo started full-time \n     employment at Vince's Shellfish 07/92. Throughout the past 11 \n     years I have observed Alfredo as a responsible, dependable \n     individual. I can count on him in any type of situation that \n     arises in my day-to-day business. Alfredo always handles \n     himself in a very professional manner.\n       Alfredo Plascencia Lopez is in charge of my entire packing \n     operation, which consists of managing ten employees.

A bill to authorize the use of judicially enforceable \nsubpoenas in terrorism investigations; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \nauthorize the Justice Department to issue judicially enforceable \nsubpoenas in terrorism investigations.\n  Here is how the JETS Act would work: it would allow the FBI to \nsubpoena documents and records ``in any investigation of a Federal \ncrime of terrorism.'' The bill would require the FBI to go to Federal \ncourt to enforce the subpoena in the event that the recipient declines \nto comply with it. It would also allow the recipient to make the first \nmove and go to court to challenge the subpoena. The JETS Act also would \nallow the Justice Department to temporarily bar the recipient of a JET \nsubpoena from disclosing to anyone other than his lawyer that he has \nreceived it. The FBI could bar such disclosure, however, only if the \nAttorney General certifies that ``otherwise there may result a danger \nto the national security of the United States.'' Also, the recipient of \nthe subpoena would have the right to go to court to challenge the \nnondisclosure order. And finally, the JETS Act would protect the \nrecipient from any civil liability that might otherwise result from his \ngood-faith compliance with a JET subpoena.\n  At the outset, it bears mention that the FBI already has ways of \nobtaining a subpoena when it needs one for a terrorism investigation: \nit simply finds an Assistant U.S. Attorney and asks him to issue a \ngrand-jury subpoena to investigate a potential crime of terrorism. The \nadvantages of the JETS Act--of giving the FBI direct authority to issue \nsubpoenas--are not so much substantive as procedural. These advantages \nprincipally are two: 1. A grand-jury subpoena's ``return date''--the \ndate by which the recipient of the subpoena is asked to comply--can \nonly be a day on which a grand jury is convened. Therefore, a grand-\njury subpoena issued on a Friday evening cannot have a return date that \nis earlier than the next Monday. The JETS Act would allow the FBI to \nset an earlier return date, so long as that date allows ``a reasonable \nperiod of time within which the records or items [to be produced] can \nbe assembled and made available.'' 2. Only an AUSA can issue a grand-\njury subpoena. Therefore, whenever the FBI wants to use a grand-jury \nsubpoena in a terrorism case, it must find an AUSA. This can be \ndifficult and time consuming in remote locations. The JETS Act would \nallow the FBI to forego this exercise.\n\n       The Justice Department recently made its case as to why it \n     should be given JETS authority in its answers to Senator \n     Biden's written questions to Christopher Wray, the Assistant \n     Attorney General for the Criminal Division, following Mr. \n     Wray's testimony before the Judiciary Committee on October \n     21, 2003. Senator Biden asked Mr. Wray to cite ``instances \n     where your terrorism investigations have been thwarted due to \n     an inability to secure a subpoena from a grand jury in a \n     timely fashion.'' While Mr. Wray declined to provide the \n     details of those instances when the lack of direct authority \n     has posed a problem, he did offer the ``following \n     hypothetical situations, which could well arise, [and which] \n     illustrate the need for this investigative tool:''\n       ``In the first scenario, anti-terrorism investigators learn \n     that members of an Al Qaeda cell recently stayed at a \n     particular hotel. They want to know how the cell members paid \n     for their rooms, in order to discover what credit cards they \n     may have used. When investigators ask the hotel manager to \n     produce the payment records voluntarily, the manager declines \n     to do so, explaining that company policy prohibits him from \n     revealing such information about customers without legal \n     process. If investigators had the authority to issue an \n     administrative subpoena, the hotel manager could disclose the \n     records about the Al Qaeda cell immediately without fear of \n     legal liability. In this situation, where the speed and \n     success of the investigation may be matters of life and \n     death, this disclosure would immediately provide \n     investigators with crucial information--such as the location \n     of the terrorists and the nature of their purchases--with \n     which to disrupt and prevent terrorist activity.\n       ``In the second hypothetical situation, anti-terrorism \n     investigators learn on a Saturday morning that members of an \n     Al Qaeda cell have bought bomb-making materials from a \n     chemical company. They want to obtain records relating to the \n     purchase that may reveal what chemicals the terrorists \n     bought, as well as delivery records that might reveal the \n     terrorists' location. The investigators might seek quickly to \n     contact an Assistant United States Attorney, who might \n     immediately obtain a grand-jury subpoena for the records. \n     However, the third party who holds the records could lawfully \n     refuse to furnish them until the subpoena's `return date,' \n     which must be on a day the grand jury is sitting. Because the \n     grand jury is not scheduled to meet again until Monday \n     morning, investigators may not be able to obtain the \n     information for two days--during which time the Al Qaeda cell \n     may execute its plot. If investigators had the authority to \n     issue an administrative subpoena, which can set a very short \n     or immediate response deadline for information, they may be \n     able to obtain the records immediately and neutralize the \n     cell.''\n\n  Mr. Wray concluded his answer by noting that ``[g]ranting FBI the use \nof [JETS authority] would speed those terrorism investigations in which \nsubpoena recipients are not inclined to contest the subpoena in court \nand are willing to comply. Avoiding delays in these situations would \nallow agents to track and disrupt terrorist activity more \neffectively.''\n  To place the JETS Act in context, it bears noting that granting the \nFBI direct authority to issue subpoenas in terrorism cases would hardly \nbe anomalous. As the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy \nrecently noted in a published report, ``Congress has granted some form \nof administrative subpoena authority to most federal agencies, with \nmany agencies holding several such authorities.'' (Report to Congress \non the Use of Administrative Subpoena Authorities by Executive Branch \nAgencies and Entities, Pursuant to Public Law 106-544, Section 7.) The \nJustice Department ``identified approximately 335 existing \nadministrative subpoena authorities held by various executive-branch \nentities under current law.'' Ibid.\n  Among the more frequently employed of existing executive-subpoena \nauthorities is 18 U.S.C. Sec.  3486's permission for the Attorney \nGeneral to issue subpoenas ``[i]n any investigation of a Federal health \ncare offense.'' According to the Public Law 106-544 Report, in the year \n2001 the federal government used Sec.  3486 to issue a total of 2,102 \nsubpoenas in health-care-fraud investigations. These subpoenas \nuncovered evidence of ``fraudulent claims and false\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nstatements such as `upcoding,' which is billing for a higher level of \nservice than that actually provided; double billing for the same visit; \nbilling for services not rendered; and providing unnecessary \nservices.''\n  Executive agencies already have direct subpoena authority for many \ntypes of investigations. Thus it would not be exceptional for Congress \nto grant the same authority to the FBI for terrorism cases. Indeed, as \nMr. Wray noted in his above-cited answers to questions, ``[b]ecause of \nthe benefits that administrative subpoenas provide in fast-moving \ninvestigations, they may be more necessary in terrorism cases than in \nany other type of investigation.'' One can hardly contend that although \nthe federal government can use subpoenas to investigate Mohammed Atta \nif it suspects that he is committing Medicare fraud, it should not be \nallowed to use the same powers if it suspects that he is plotting to \nfly airplanes into buildings.\n  Granting direct subpoena authority to the FBI for terrorism cases \nfirst was proposed by the President last year, near the time of the \nsecond anniversary of the September 11 attacks. There is one criticism \nof the President's proposal that was made at that time that I believe \nneeds to be addressed. The New York Times, in a September 14 story, \ndescribed unnamed ``opponents'' as denouncing the proposal for \n``allow[ing] federal agents to issue subpoenas without the approval of \na judge or grand jury.''\n  This criticism reflects a misunderstanding of grand-jury subpoenas. \nThe anonymous opponents of the President's proposal appear to be under \nthe impression that the grand jury itself issues a grand-jury subpoena. \nThis is not the case. Instead, a grand-jury subpoena is issued by an \nindividual federal prosecutor, without any prior involvement by a judge \nor grand jury. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia has noted, ``[i]t is important to realize that a grand jury \nsubpoena gets its name from the intended use of the . . . evidence, not \nfrom the source of its issuance.'' Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d at 80 n. \n11 (1985).\n  Like the grand-jury subpoenas currently used to investigate potential \ncrimes of terrorism, JET subpoenas also would be issued directly by \ninvestigators, without pre-approval from a court. It is thus important \nto keep in mind that a subpoena is merely a request for information--a \nrequest that cannot be enforced until its reasonableness has been \nreviewed by a federal judge. As Mr. Wray noted on behalf of the Justice \nDepartment in his answers to Senator Biden's questions:\n\n       The FBI could not unilaterally enforce an administrative \n     subpoena issued in a terrorism investigation. As with any \n     other type of subpoena, the recipient of an administrative \n     subpoena issued in a terrorism investigation would be able to \n     challenge that subpoena by filing a motion to quash in the \n     United States District Court for the district in which that \n     person or entity does business or resides. If the court \n     denied the motion to quash, the subpoena recipient could \n     still refuse to comply. The government would then be required \n     to seek another court order compelling compliance with the \n     subpoena.\n\n  This system guarantees protection for civil liberties. The courts \ntake very seriously their role in reviewing subpoena-enforcement \nrequests. As the Third Circuit has emphasized, ``the district court's \nrole is not that of a mere rubber stamp, but of an independent \nreviewing authority called upon to insure the integrity of the \nproceeding.'' Wearly v. FTC, 616 F.2d at 665 (1980). The prospect of \njudicial oversight also inevitably restrains even the initial actions \nof executive agents. As the Public Law 106-544 Report notes, ``an \nagency must consider the strictures of [a motion to quash or a \nchallenge to an enforcement order] before issuing an administrative \nsubpoena.'' And finally, the system of separated authority to issue and \nreview subpoenas has itself been recognized to guard civil liberties. \nThe federal courts have found that ``[b]ifurcation of the power, on the \none hand of the agency to issue subpoenas and on the other hand of the \ncourts to enforce them, is an inherent protection against abuse of \nsubpoena power.'' United States v. Security State Bank and Trust, 473 \nF.2d at 641 (5th Cir. 1973).\n  The administrative subpoena is a well-established investigative tool \nwith built-in protections for civil liberties. Its use in antiterrorism \ninvestigations should not pose a threat to individual freedom.\n  Finally, although the constitutionality of a tool so frequently used \nfor so long might safely be assumed, it nevertheless merits describing \nexactly why subpoena power is consistent with the Fourth Amendment. A \nthorough explanation recently was provided by Judge Paul Niemeyer of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. As Judge Niemeyer \nnoted, the use a subpoena does not require a showing of probable cause \nbecause a subpoena is not a warrant--it does not authorize an immediate \nphysical intrusion of someone's premises in order to conduct a search. \nRather, subpoenas are subject only to the Fourth Amendment's general \nreasonableness requirement--and they are reasonable in large part \nbecause of the continuous judicial oversight of their enforcement. As \nJudge Niemeyer stated in his opinion for the court in In re Subpoena \nDuces Tecum, 228 F.3d at 347-49 (2000) (citations omitted):\n\n       While the Fourth Amendment protects people ``against \n     unreasonable searches and seizures,'' it imposes a probable \n     cause requirement only on the issuance of warrants. U.S. \n     Const. amend. IV (``and no Warrants shall issue, but upon \n     probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,'' etc.). \n     Thus, unless subpoenas are warrants, they are limited by the \n     general reasonableness standard of the Fourth Amendment \n     (protecting the people against ``unreasonable searches and \n     seizures''), not by the probable cause requirement.\n       ``A warrant is a judicial authorization to a law \n     enforcement officer to search or seize persons or things. To \n     preserve advantages of speed and surprise, the order is \n     issued without prior notice and is executed, often by force, \n     with an unannounced and unanticipated physical intrusion. \n     Because this intrusion is both an immediate and substantial \n     invasion of privacy, a warrant may be issued only by a \n     judicial officer upon a demonstration of probable cause--the \n     safeguard required by the Fourth Amendment. See U.S. Const. \n     amend. IV (``no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable \n     cause''). The demonstration of probable cause to a neutral \n     judicial officer places a checkpoint between the Government \n     and the citizen where there otherwise would be no judicial \n     supervision.\n       ``A subpoena, on the other hand, commences an adversary \n     process during which the person served with the subpoena may \n     challenge it in court before complying with its demands. As \n     judicial process is afforded before any intrusion occurs, the \n     proposed intrusion is regulated by, and its justification \n     derives from, that process.\n       ``If [the appellant in this case] were correct in his \n     assertion that investigative subpoenas may be issued only \n     upon probable cause, the result would be the virtual end to \n     any investigatory efforts by governmental agencies, as well \n     as grand juries. This is because the object of many such \n     investigations--to determine whether probable cause exists to \n     prosecute a violation--would become a condition precedent for \n     undertaking the investigation. This unacceptable paradox was \n     noted explicitly in the grand jury context in United States \n     v. R. Enterprises, Inc., where the Supreme Court stated:\n       ``[T]he Government cannot be required to justify the \n     issuance of a grand jury subpoena by presenting evidence \n     sufficient to establish probable cause because the very \n     purpose of requesting the information is to ascertain whether \n     probable cause exists.''\n\n  The U.S. Supreme Court first upheld the constitutionality of subpoena \nauthority in 1911. United States v. Wilson, 31 S.Ct. at 542, concluded \nthat ``there is no unreasonable search and seizure when a writ, \nsuitably specific and properly limited in scope, calls for the \nproduction of documents which . . . the party procuring [the writ's] \nissuance is entitled to have produced.''\n  The Wilson Court also noted that the subpoena power has deep roots in \nthe common-law tradition roots--that stretch at least to Elizabethan \ntimes:\n\n       ``no doubt can be entertained that there must have been \n     some process similar to the subpoena duces tecum to compel \n     the production of documents, not only before [the] time [of \n     Charles the Second], but even before the statute of the 5th \n     of Elizabeth. Prior to that statute, there must have been a \n     power in the Crown (for it would have been utterly impossible \n     to carry on the administration of justice without such power) \n     to require the attendance in courts of justice of persons \n     capable of giving evidence, and the production of documents \n     material to the cause, though in the possession of a \n     stranger.''\n\n  The Supreme Court also has explicitly approved the use of subpoenas \nby executive agencies. In Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 66 S.Ct. \n494 (1946), the Court found that the investigative role of an executive \nofficial in issuing a subpoena ``is essentially the same as the grand \njury's, or the court's in issuing other pretrial orders for the \ndiscovery of evidence.'' Nearly fifty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Walling was able to conclude that\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nFourth Amendment objections to the use of subpoenas by executive \nagencies merely ``raise[] the ghost of controversy long since settled \nadversely to [that] claim.''\n  Because granting direct subpoena authority to antiterror \ninvestigators would aid them in their important work, and would neither \nintrude upon civil liberties nor conflict with the Constitution, I \npropose the following bill, which would authorize judicially \nenforceable terrorism subpoenas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2555\n\n     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 7 of title 31, United States Code, \nto provide for a technology assessment capability within the General \nAccounting Office, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nLieberman to introduce a bill that would give the Congress a modest \ncapability to assess the impacts of science and technology on the \nformulation of public policy.\n  All of us in the Senate are all too aware how science and technology \naffects almost every aspect of policy we debate.\n  For instance, advances in science and technology are critical to our \nhomeland defense oversight duties. There are many legislative proposals \nto deploy biological detection sensors in our cities. Yet, Congress \ndoes not get timely, in-depth advice on the policy implications on such \nissues as how many would be needed in a large city, or how will the \ndata be integrated into a communications network, and would such a \nlarge volume of data be accurately analyzed and disseminated in a \ntimely fashion. In another area of homeland defense, we are not \nconfident on what the policy implications are for biometrics applied to \nborder control. What are the costs for applying biometrics to the \nmillions of visas we issue every year? How might these biometrics, \nwhich record our physiological features into a single database, invade \nour notions of privacy?\n  In the jurisdiction of my committee, Energy and Natural Resources, we \nwould like to know how technology could mitigate the threat of \nwildfires, especially on urban regions adjacent to our national \nforests. We know that there are improvements in building materials and \nconstruction techniques that can reduce the danger of homes\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\nsuddenly catching fire and spreading to adjacent homes. However, the \neffect of such technology improvements on policy matters involving \nbuilding codes, fire and disaster insurance, and coordination of \ncommunications between federal and local emergency response are \nunknown, yet critical to our law making duties.\n  There are other areas where technology affects law making and \noversight duties. The Congress has supported efforts to integrate \ntechnology into one of the most crucial elements of democracy--voting. \nNevertheless, questions remain on the accountability of each vote, and \nthe cyber-security of electronic voting systems. These voting \ntechnology issues directly affect the public confidence in any law we \nmay write to bring electronic voting into the mainstream.\n  I could go on and on, but these examples lead me to the bill I am \nintroducing today.\n  Congress abolished the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995. \nWhile I disagreed with this decision, the bill I am proposing today \nseeks to establish a smaller, less costly capability in the General \nAccounting Office (GAO).\n  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) and GAO have many \ntechnology-competent personnel, but neither assesses the effects of \ntechnology on policy-making. The CRS or GAO may study or catalog \nvarious technologies, they may assess the merits of one technology \nversus another, or even its economic benefits and costs, but they do \nnot analyze how the technology can affect policy.\n  Some may assert the National Academy of Sciences performs such a \nfunction. The National Academies independently, through outside \nadvisory committees, evaluates the technological merits of programs \nthat involve technology, usually funded by the executive branch, and \nnot directly by the Congress. The majority of the technology \nevaluations by the National Academies are not technology assessments, \nthey do not consider what consequences a technology will have on the \npolicies that the Congress considers. Because the Academy maintains a \nstrong independence, the timing of their reports are not, and should \nnot be, linked to the Congressional calendar.\n  I believe it is possible have an existing legislative branch agency \nsuch as the GAO give to neutral, objective technology assessments to \nthe Congress in a timely fashion. I am of the opinion that the GAO can \nundertake this function without creating a large bureaucracy.\n  Let me first outline the history of the legislation I am proposing.\n  Three years ago, with the help of Senator Bennett, who then chaired \nthe Legislative Branch Subcommittee on Appropriations, I was able to \ninitiate a pilot program at the GAO to perform technology assessments \nof interest to the Congress. It was Senator Bennett who first suggested \nplacing this pilot at the GAO, and when contacted, the GAO stepped \nforward to accept that challenge.\n  Since that time, the three-year pilot program at the GAO has \nconducted, or has underway, technology assessments on a wide range of \ntopics, from biometrics for border control, cyber-security, cargo \ncontainer security, and technology to mitigate the impact of wildfires \non urban boundaries. All of these assessments were initiated by \nbipartisan and bicameral letters to the GAO.\n  I believe this pilot program to be a success. The first report on \nbiometrics for border control has received good evaluations from \nindustry and congressional staff. The GAO still testifies on the \nresults from the report. The second report on cyber-security has just \nbeen released, experts across government and the private sector believe \nit is of high quality. A technology assessment on cargo container \nsecurity is underway. A wildfire technology assessment has just been \ninitiated.\n  In addition, this pilot program has undergone several reviews.\n  The first review occurred in October of 2002, when the first \ntechnology assessment on biometrics ended. A group of distinguished \nscientists, familiar with the technology assessment process, reviewed \nthe GAO's organizational capability to conduct future technology \nassessments. While they were impressed with the quality of the GAO's \neffort, they made positive suggestions on how the GAO could improve the \npolicy analysis phase of the technology assessment, as this crucial \nfeature was new to the GAO. The group of experts reviewed the \norganizational mix of the GAO, and its ability to absorb the technology \nassessment process within their traditional audit and quality control \nstructure. These experts found that the GAO's Center for Technology and \nEngineering, which performed the first biometrics assessment, was a \ncapable organization, as it was accustomed to undertaking a wide range \nof technology-oriented problems. Finally, the experts commented on how \nthe GAO could utilize nongovernmental entities to perform the data \ncollection, thus reducing the potential to create a new bureaucracy. \nFor the first biometrics report, the experts supported the GAO working \nwith the National Research Council to conduct stakeholder workshops to \ngather a wide range of data, while the report writing would be by a \nlegislative branch entity--the GAO.\n\n  The second review was a workshop held in July of 2003, at the \nNational Academy of Sciences. A wide array of nongovernmental attendees \nevaluated the pilot program at the GAO in the context of other \norganization models for technology assessment, from recreating the old \nOTA to simply using the National Academies. This was the first time \nmany nongovernmental persons were exposed to the GAO pilot and many \nwere surprised that the GAO was willing to undertake such a program, \nand that its staff quickly adapted to the technology assessment \nprocess.\n  The third review occurred in December of 2003 at the request of the \nSenate Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. This review was \nconducted by the GAO. The subcommittee asked what would be required to \nconduct this pilot on a sustained basis. The GAO concluded that four \nfull time staff would be required at a cost of $420,000, plus $125,000 \nfor additional expenses to work with outside groups such as the \nNational Research Council to collect data. This request has appeared as \npart of GAO's Fiscal Year 2005 budget submission. The GAO also \nrequested additional legislative authorities so that the assessments \ncould be part of their annual budget process.\n  This bill is in response to the December 2003 findings of GAO; it has \nbeen fully coordinated with the GAO and their findings. This bill also \nreflects the comments from the July 2003 National Academies workshop \nand the first review of the GAO by the expert panel in October of 2002.\n  Let me now outline several feature of this bill, and then I will \ncomment on what this bill does not have.\n  First, the bill proposes to modify the GAO's organic act to give it \nthe statutory authority to perform technology assessments as part of \nits advice to the Congress. In doing so, the GAO is directed make such \ntechnology assessments in a timely and objective fashion. One of the \nmajor issues with the OTA was that many of its reports were so in-depth \nthat they missed the legislative cycle to make a substantive impact on \na bill under consideration by the Congress. In addition to the longer, \nmore in-depth reports, I expect that the GAO will give quick turn-\naround phone consultations on singular technology assessment questions \nby staff.\n  Second, it directs the Comptroller General to ensure that the GAO has \nthe human resources expertise in technology and policy to ensure a high \nquality product.\n  Third, it directs the Comptroller General, to the maximum extent \npracticable, to be apprised of other ongoing efforts that may be \nproviding information to the Congress.\n  Fourth, it directs the Comptroller to peer review all the technology \nassessment reports.\n  Fifth, it directs the Comptroller General to establish an advisory \nboard in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences. This board \nshall provide external advice on the assessment topics, how they are \nselected, and methods to their improve timeliness and quality. Many \ntimes advisory boards are an extra overhead burden, but in this case, \nwhere the GAO is acting as a bridge between the outside technical \ncommunity and the Congress, I feel it is important that some form of \nexternal peer review of the technology assessment process be present.\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\n  Sixth, it gives the GAO the necessary authority to enter into \ncontracts with outside groups to obtain the information and technical \nfeedback that does not reside within the GAO, thus avoiding the \ncreation of a bureaucracy within the GAO.\n  Finally, it requires the GAO to submit an annual report to the \nCongress on its technology assessment activities from the prior year.\n  Let me explain what this authorization does not do.\n  First, it does not create a Technology Assessment Board consisting of \nmembers of Congress to help select topics. There was much concern that \nthe OTA became almost beholden to its Technology Assessment Board to \nthe dismay of other members of Congress. I have left the topic \nselection process to the GAO within their existing authorities, similar \nto the way they currently schedule and produce reports for members and \ncommittees. This process has been refined and tested over many years, \nand it is flexible enough to accommodate sudden high priority demands. \nI see no reason why scheduling technology assessments cannot be part of \nthis bigger scheduling process, so that its demands are reflected in \nthe overall scheduling priorities of the GAO.\n  Second, this legislation does not create a large legislative branch \nentity. The OTA had upwards of 200 people and a $30 million budget \nbefore it was disbanded in 1995. This authorization relies on a core \ninternal group at the GAO that relies on outside entities to provide \ninformation where needed and to be a technical sounding board through \nworkshops on a particular technology and its various policy \nimplications.\n  This legislation strikes an important balance. It establishes some \ninternal legislative branch capability to analyze how technology \naffects our policymaking duties. It fills a void left when the OTA was \nabolished by relying on a core team at the GAO using their existing \nauthorities for topic selection. Finally, it provides an important \nbridge to the many nongovernmental entities and societies that give \nadvice to the executive branch and Congress, while ensuring legislative \nbranch objectivity and quality.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in supporting this legislation. I hope \nthat it receives a hearing in the Governmental Affairs Committee, so \nthat all sides of the fact finding process can be brought to bear on \nthis bill's strengths and weaknesses, and in so doing, be improved and \nreported to the floor of the Senate for its full consideration and \npassage.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Technology assessments.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that would \nrepeal a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004, \nregarding the amount of time that records of approved gun sales can be \nretained.\n  This provision, which will be enacted within the next month, was a \nmeasure that the House and Senate conferees agreed to drop, but \nnonetheless was inserted at the last minute into the Conference Report. \nThat provision is opposed by law enforcement and threatens public \nsafety because each year, it would allow hundreds of convicted felons, \nfugitives, and possibly even terrorists, to have firearms--even though \nthey are prohibited by Federal law from having one.\n  Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed firearms \ndealers generally are prohibited from transferring firearms to an \nindividual until a search of the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System (NICS) determines that the transfer would not violate \napplicable Federal or\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nState law. For example, these background checks determine if someone is \na convicted felon; convicted of a crime of domestic violence or under a \ndomestic violence restraining order; or a fugitive. Current regulations \nallow the records of approved firearms sales to be retained in a \ncomputer database, known as the NICS Audit Log, for up to 90 days, \nafter which the records must be destroyed.\n  The NICS Audit Log provides many useful and necessary functions. \nFirst, it allows examiners to determine if, based on new information, \nsomeone who was allowed to receive a firearm is in fact prohibited by \nfederal law from doing so. Second, the NICS Audit Log allows the FBI to \nsearch for patterns of fraud and abuse by both gun dealers and \npurchasers. Finally, it can help determine if gun buyers have submitted \nfalse identification in order to thwart the background check system.\n  The provision that my legislation today would repeal reduced the time \nthese records may be retained from 90 days to 24 hours. This will \ndecrease the effectiveness of the NICS Audit Log and have a dramatic, \nnegative impact on public safety.\n  In July 2001, the Department of Justice proposed an almost-identical \nchange to the NICS regulations. In response to that proposal, I asked \nthe non-partisan General Accounting Office to conduct a study on its \npossible effects. The key finding of this study was: ``Regarding public \nsafety, the FBI would lose certain abilities to initiate firearm-\nretrieval actions when new information reveals that individuals who \nwere approved to purchase firearms should not have been. Specifically, \nduring the first 6 months of the current 90-day retention policy, the \nFBI used retained records to initiate 235 firearm-retrieval actions, of \nwhich 228, 97 percent, could not have been initiated under the proposed \nnext-day destruction policy.''\n  Therefore, if this provision is not repealed, each year, more than \n450 people who are prohibited by federal law from having a firearm \nnonetheless will have one.\n  This number could even be much higher. In the 6 months examined by \nthe GAO, the FBI determined that an additional 179 transactions were \ninitially approved and reversed more than one day later, but did not \nresult in actual firearm sales. In other words, during this six-month \nperiod, the background checks yielded a total of 407 mistakes that \nwould not have been caught if the NICS record retention period had been \nshortened to 24 hours.\n  Given this negative effect on public safety, many law enforcement \nagencies and officials have expressed their opposition. For example, \nthe Law Enforcement Steering Committee (LESC), a nonpartisan coalition \nof organizations representing law enforcement management, labor, and \nresearch, is ``concerned with provisions included in the omnibus bill \naddressing firearms purchasing and the reduction of law enforcement \noversight.'' The nine organizations in the LESC are the following: the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, \nthe Major County Sheriff's Association, the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives, the National Troopers Coalition, the Police \nExecutive Research Forum, and the Police Foundation.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association, a non-\ngovernmental professional association with a membership of nearly 9,000 \ncurrent and more than 2,000 retired FBI agents nationwide has written: \n``The more the retention period is reduced, the more difficult it would \nbecome to use the paperwork to investigate or prosecute crimes related \nto the use of sales of the firearms in question. Any such efforts can \nonly complicate the already difficult task of law enforcement and \njeopardize public safety.''\n  Although the FBI Agents Association does not speak for the official \nFBI, it is worth noting that the FBI's NICS Operations Report in March \n2000 recommended extending the retention period from 90 days to one \nyear and noted that the Advisory Policy Board concurred with that \nrecommendation.\n  Finally, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nworld's oldest and largest association of law enforcement executives, \nwith more than 19,000 members in 90 countries, stands behind its 2001 \nletter to the FBI, in which the IACP wrote: ``We believe that \ndecreasing the amount of time the purchase records are kept will weaken \nthe background check system and allow more criminals to illegally \nobtain weapons. . . . The IACP believes that the 90-day retention \nperiod should not be shortened. Decreasing the retention period of \nthese records to one business day will not provide law enforcement with \nsufficient time to perform the necessary audits on the NICS system as \nestablished by the Brady Act.''\n  In addition to the threat to public safety, this provision will have \nmonetary costs. According to the GAO report, the FBI has determined \nthat when this change in the NICS retention policy is implemented, many \nof the audits currently conducted on a monthly or quarterly basis would \nhave to be conducted on a real-time basis--either hourly or daily. The \nFBI has said it would need to add 10 staff members to conduct these \nreal-time audits, which would bring the total number of audit staff to \n19.\n  Especially in this time of increased attention to homeland security, \nthis is not the proper allocation of our limited resources. Unless we \nrepeal this provision, we will be funding ten additional FBI staff \nmembers to implement a policy that would allow hundreds of convicted \nfelons and fugitives to keep their firearms. That clearly does not make \nsense.\n  The clock is ticking: this provision will go into effect in less than \na month, before July 21, 2004. We must act now to keep firearms out of \nthe hands of hundreds of convicted felons, fugitives, and terrorists \neach year. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant, commonsense legislation to promote public safety and to \nensure that similar provisions are not enacted in future appropriation \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2558. A bill to improve the health of Americans and reduce health \ncare costs by reorienting the Nation's health care system towards \nprevention, wellness, and self care; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Health Care Assurance Act of 2004, which is legislation designed to \ncover the 43 million Americans who are currently not covered, and to \nprovide for offsets in cost to cover the expenditures in covering the \n43 million Americans who are now not covered.\n  The United States has the greatest health care system in the world, \nand it is desirable, in my opinion, to incrementally change the health \ncare system to cover those who are now not covered as opposed to having \nsome vast bureaucracy take over, with the Government taking all of the \nresponsibility.\n  I have introduced health care legislation in some detail during the \ncourse of my tenure in the Senate and have been privileged to be the \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human \nServices since 1995, where, working collaboratively with Senator \nHarkin, the ranking, senior Democrat on the subcommittee, we have \nincreased funding in the National Institutes of Health, done extensive \nwork on stem cell research, and provided a great many health care \nprograms. The legislation which I am introducing today I introduce on \nbehalf of Senator Harkin and myself.\n  The essence of this legislation would provide for small employer and \nindividual group purchasing so small employers or individuals can have \nthe benefit of what large companies get by virtue of more purchasing \npower. That expenditure would run, over a 10-year period, at $300 \nmillion.\n  There is considerable loss of coverage when people change jobs. On \nthe so-called portability, this legislation provides in some detail for \ncovering people between jobs, at a cost of about $101 billion over the \ncourse of the 10-year period.\n  Financial incentives for young adults are provided. There is an \noutreach program for Medicaid-eligible low-income families. There is \nexpanded coverage for the State Children's Health Insurance Program and \ntheir families.\n  The total cost of the programs over a 10-year period would be $540 \nbillion. There are savings specified and identified in the course of \nthis bill to make\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nup for that money, for one thing, improving the program integrity and \nefficiency in the Medicare Program by having more audits to stop fraud \nin a very active way by reducing medical errors. The Institute of \nMedicine published a report identifying up to 98,000 deaths a year due \nto medical errors. They specified a program for saving up to $150 \nbillion over a 10-year period by reducing medical errors.\n  The Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, which I chair, had \nprovided funding to move ahead in implementing the reduction in those \nerrors. There would be savings from improving health care quality, \nefficiency, and consumer education, and there would be considerable \nsavings in primary and preventative care providers.\n  There needs to be a great deal of additional education. One statistic \nwhich I found of concern was that there are 14 million Americans who \nqualify for Medicaid programs, being below the 200 percent of poverty, \nwho don't seek the coverage and don't know of its availability. In our \nHealth and Human Services bill, we are providing funding to try to move \nahead with an educational program.\n  Last month, a nonpartisan campaign was launched to call attention to \nthe plight of more than 43 million Americans under age 65 who lack \nhealth insurance coverage. Two former presidents--Gerald Ford and Jimmy \nCarter--cochaired the effort. They were supported by nine former \nSurgeons General and Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretaries, as well as some of the most influential organizations in \nthis country, including the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \nNearly 1,500 public events took place throughout the country, all \ndesigned to bring together diverse interests around a single objective: \nto insist that all Americans have access to health insurance coverage.\n  Here in the Senate, a special task force appointed by Majority Leader \nFrist and headed by my distinguished colleague Senator Judd Gregg \nissued a series of recommendations for addressing this problem.\n  Well before last month, we knew that, contrary to what some assume, \nthe ranks of the uninsured consisted primarily of working families with \nlow and moderate incomes--not just the unemployed.\n  We knew that the lack of insurance ultimately compromises a person's \nhealth because he or she is less likely to receive preventive care, is \nmore likely to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems, and is \nmore likely to be diagnosed in the late stages of diseases.\n  And we knew that the lack of insurance coverage leaves individuals \nand their families more financially vulnerable to higher out-of-pocket \ncosts for their medical bills.\n  As I have said many times, we can fix the problems felt by uninsured \nAmericans without resorting to big government and without completely \noverhauling our current system, one that works well for most \nAmericans--serving over 82 percent of our non-elderly citizens. We must \nenact reforms that improve upon our current market-based health care \nsystem, as it is clearly the best health care system in the world.\n  When you hear the term ``uninsured'' you immediately think of men and \nwomen who are unemployed and their children. The unemployed make up \napproximately 18 percent of Americans who lack health insurance. \nHowever, nearly 26 million individuals are employed and still are \nwithout health care coverage. Approximately 14 million employed \nindividuals have household incomes below 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level and are eligible for public health insurance programs, \nbut have not applied. This statistic includes 4 million children who \nare eligible for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nprogram.\n  Because of early retirements, nearly 10 percent of people between the \nages of 55 and 64, are uninsured.\n  Approximately 25 to 30 percent of young adults between the ages of 18 \nand 34 are uninsured.\n  Immigrants and their U.S.-born children represent more than 90 \npercent of the increase in the uninsured population since 1989.\n  In the United States, in 2003, $1.7 trillion was spent on health care \nor more than $5,800 per person. It is projected that annual health care \nexpenditures will exceed $3.4 trillion by 2013 or 18 percent of gross \ndomestic product. Costs of covering the uninsured in 2004 dollars is \napproximately $48 billion or $500 plus billion over 10 years. These \ncosts are in addition to the $125 billion per year currently spent for \nMedicare and Medicaid payments, out of pocket expenses paid by the \nuninsured and other state and local programs.\n  Accordingly, today I am introducing the Health Care Assurance Act of \n2004. This legislation would provide health care coverage for all \nAmericans who are currently uninsured. The bill's $540 billion price \ntag, over the next 10 years, would be offset by improving program \nintegrity and efficiency, a reduction in medical errors, increasing the \nuse of medical technology, and preventive health measures, including \nimproving health care quality and consumer education. Let me briefly \nsummarize the provisions of this legislation.\n  (1) Small Employer and Individual Purchasing Groups: This legislation \nestablishes voluntary small employer and individual purchasing groups \ndesigned to provide affordable, comprehensive health coverage options \nfor employers, their employees, and other uninsured individuals and \ntheir families. Health plans offering coverage through such groups \nwill: (1) provide a standard, actuarially equivalent health benefits \npackage; (2) adjust community rated premiums by age and family size in \norder to spread risk and provide price equity to all; and (3) meet \nguidelines for marketing practices. This provision would cost $300 \nmillion over 10 years and provide coverage to approximately 15.6 \nmillion Americans who are currently uninsured.\n\n  (2) COBRA Portability Reform: For those persons who are uninsured \nbetween jobs and for insured persons who fear losing coverage should \nthey lose their jobs, this legislation would reform the existing COBRA \nlaw by: (1) extending to 24 months the minimum time period in which \nCOBRA may cover individuals through their former employers' plan; (2) \nexpanding coverage options to include plans with a lower premium and a \n$1,000 deductible--saving a typical family of four 20 percent in \nmonthly premiums--and plans with a lower premium and a $3,000 \ndeductible--saving a family of four 52 percent in monthly premiums. \nThis provision would cost $101.7 billion over 10 years and would cover \n8.5 million people.\n  (3) State Based Program of Financial Incentives to Young Adults: This \nlegislation creates a $4 billion a year grant program which consists of \nfinancial incentives for full-time independent college students, part-\ntime students, recent graduates and other young adults without health \ninsurance coverage. Coverage would be offered through existing State \nprograms, such as State high risk insurance pools and would be limited \nso that when individuals are hired, they receive health insurance \nthrough their employer. This provision would cost $40 billion over 10 \nyears and would cover 4 million people who are currently uninsured.\n  (4) Outreach Programs for Low-Income Families Who are Eligible to \nEnroll in Medicaid: This program is designed to improve coverage \nthrough existing public and private health care programs by making low-\nincome parents aware of State child health insurance programs. The \nlegislation would also improve knowledge concerning public health \nbenefits of health insurance coverage, including the advantages of \nreceiving prevention and wellness services. This new outreach program \nwould involve the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human \nServices, the Social Security Administration and other Federal agencies \nto improve knowledge about health insurance coverage available through \npublic programs. Outreach will be targeted to eligible populations and \nbe designed in a culturally appropriate manner and identify \nparticularly hard to reach populations, including recent immigrants and \nmigrant and seasonal farm workers. This provision would cost $4 billion \nover 10 years and would cover up to 3 million previously uninsured \nindividuals.\n  (5) Expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program and \nFamily Coverage: The legislation would increase the income eligibility \nto families with incomes at or below 235 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel,\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\n$44,486 annually for a family of four, and would also, for the first \ntime, provide health insurance to the child's family. This provision \nwould cost $394 billion over 10 years and would cover 12.4 million \nchildren and extend coverage to their families.\n  (6) Improving Program Integrity and Efficiency in the Medicare \nProgram: The bill would raise the cap on Medicare contractor audit \nfunding/program integrity from $720 million to $1 billion over a 5-year \nperiod. This provision would save an estimated $60 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  (7) Reducing Medical Errors and Increasing the Use of Medical \nTechnology: A provision is included that would provide for \ndemonstration programs to test best practices for reducing errors, \ntesting the use of appropriate technologies to reduce medical errors, \nsuch as hand-held electronic medication systems, and research in \ngeographically diverse locations to determine the causes of medical \nerrors. To assist in the development by the private sector of needed \ntechnology standards, the bill would provide for ways to examine use of \ninformation technology and coordinate actions by the Federal Government \nand ensure that this investment will further the national health \ninformation and infrastructure. This section of the legislation is \nprojected to save $150 billion over the next 10 years.\n  (8) Improving Health Care Quality, Efficiency and Consumer Education: \nThe legislation would set up demonstration projects to educate the \npublic regarding wise consumer choices about their health care, such as \nappropriate health care costs and quality control information. The \nDepartment of HHS would be tasked with developing public service \nannouncements to educate the public about their coverage choices, \neligibility and preventive care services. Also included in this title \nis a provision on ways to improve the effectiveness and portability of \nadvance directives and living wills. Projected cost savings of this \nsection of the bill is $70 billion over the next 10 years.\n  (9) Primary and Preventive Care Services: Language is included to \nencourage the use of nonphysician providers such as nurse \npractitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists by \nincreasing direct reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid without \nregard to the setting where services are provided. The bill also seeks \nto encourage students early on in their medical training to pursue a \ncareer in primary care and it provides assistance to medical training \nprograms to recruit such students. The savings from this provision is \nestimated at $260 billion over a 10 year period.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today is distinct from my longstanding \nefforts regarding managed care reform. During the 105th, 106th, and \n107th Congresses, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce \nthe Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998, 1999, and 2001 \nbalanced proposals which would ensure that patients receive the \nbenefits and services to which they are entitled, without compromising \nthe savings and coordination of care that can be achieved through \nmanaged care.\n  I have advocated health care reform in one form or another throughout \nmy 24 years in the Senate. My strong interest in health care dates back \nto my first term, when I sponsored S. 811, the Health Care for \nDisplaced Workers Act of 1983, and S. 2051, the Health Care Cost \nContainment Act of 1983, which would have granted a limited antitrust \nexemption to health insurers, permitting them to engage in certain \njoint activities such as acquiring or processing information, and \ncollecting and distributing insurance claims for health care services \naimed at curtailing then escalating health care costs. In 1985, I \nintroduced the Community-based Disease Prevention and Health Promotion \nProjects Act of 1985, S. 1873, directed at reducing the human tragedy \nof low birth weight babies and infant mortality. Since 1983, I have \nintroduced and cosponsored numerous other bills concerning health care \nin our country.\n  During the 102nd Congress, I pressed the Senate to take action on the \nhealth care market issue. On July 29, 1992, I offered an amendment to \nlegislation then pending on the Senate floor, which included a change \nfrom 25 percent to 100 percent deductibility for health insurance \npurchased by self-employed individuals, and small business insurance \nmarket reforms to make health coverage more affordable for small \nbusinesses. Included in this amendment were provisions from a bill \nintroduced by the late Senator John Chafee, legislation which I \ncosponsored and which was previously proposed by Senators Bentsen and \nDurenberger. When then-majority leader Mitchell argued that the health \ncare amendment I was proposing did not belong on that bill, I offered \nto withdraw the amendment if he would set a date certain to take up \nhealth care, similar to an arrangement made on product liability \nlegislation, which had been placed on the calendar for September 8, \n1992. The majority leader rejected that suggestion, and the Senate did \nnot consider comprehensive health care legislation during the balance \nof the 102nd Congress. My July 29, 1992 amendment was defeated on a \nprocedural motion by a vote of 35 to 60, along party lines.\n  The substance of that amendment, however, was adopted later by the \nSenate on September 23, 1992, when it was included in a Bentsen/\nDurenberger amendment which I cosponsored to broaden tax legislation, \nH.R. 11. This amendment, which included essentially the same self-\nemployed tax deductibility and small group reforms I had proposed on \nJuly 29 of that year, passed the Senate by voice vote. Unfortunately, \nthese provisions were later dropped from H.R. 11 in the House-Senate \nconference.\n  On August 12, 1992, I introduced legislation entitled the Health Care \nAffordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992, S. 3176, that would \nhave enhanced informed individual choice regarding health care services \nby providing certain information to health care recipients, would have \nlowered the cost of health care through use of the most appropriate \nprovider, and would have improved the quality of health care.\n  On January 21, 1993, the first day of the 103rd Congress, I \nintroduced the Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993, S. 18. This \nlegislation consisted of reforms that our health care system could have \nadopted immediately. These initiatives would have both improved access \nand affordability of insurance coverage and would have implemented \nsystemic changes to lower the escalating cost of care in this country. \nS. 18 is the principal basis of the legislation I introduced in the \nlast five Congresses as well as this one.\n  On March 23, 1993, I introduced the Comprehensive Access and \nAffordability Health Care Act of 1993, S. 631, which was a composite of \nhealth care legislation introduced by Senators Cohen, Kassebaum, Bond, \nand McCain, and included pieces of my bill, S. 18. I introduced this \nlegislation in an attempt to move ahead on the consideration of health \ncare legislation and provide a starting point for debate. As I noted \nearlier, I was precluded by majority leader Mitchell from obtaining \nSenate consideration of my legislation as a floor amendment on several \noccasions. Finally, on April 28, 1993, I offered the text of S. 631 as \nan amendment to the pending Department of the Environment Act, S. 171, \nin an attempt to urge the Senate to act on health care reform. My \namendment was defeated 65 to 33 on a procedural motion, but the Senate \nhad finally been forced to contemplate action on health care reform.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, January 4, 1995, I introduced \na slightly modified version of S. 18, the Health Care Assurance Act of \n1995, also S. 18, which contained provisions similar to those \nultimately enacted in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, including \ninsurance market reforms, an extension of the tax deductibility of \nhealth insurance for the self employed, and tax deductibility of long \nterm care insurance.\n  I continued these efforts in the 105th Congress, with the \nintroduction of Health Care Assurance Act of 1997, S. 24, which \nincluded market reforms similar to my previous proposals with the \naddition of a new Title I, an innovative program to provide vouchers to \nStates to cover children who lack health insurance coverage. I also \nintroduced Title I of this legislation as a stand-alone bill, the \nHealthy Children's Pilot Program of 1997, S. 435, on March 13, 1997. \nThis proposal targeted the approximately 4.2 million children of the \nworking poor who lacked health insurance at that time. These are \nchildren\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\nwhose parents earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid, but do not \nearn enough to afford private health care coverage for their families.\n  This legislation would have established a $10 billion/5-year \ndiscretionary pilot program to cover these uninsured children by \nproviding grants to States. Modeled after Pennsylvania's \nextraordinarily successful Caring and BlueCHIP programs, this \nlegislation was the first Republican-sponsored children's health \ninsurance bill during the 105th Congress.\n  I was encouraged that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed into \nlaw on August 5, 1997, included a combination of the best provisions \nfrom many of the children's health insurance proposals throughout this \nCongress. The new legislation allocated $24 billion over 5 years to \nestablish State Child Health Insurance Programs, funded in part by a \nslight increase in the cigarette tax.\n  During both the 106th and 107th Congresses, I again introduced the \nHealth Care Assurance Act. These bills contained similar insurance \nmarket reforms, as well as new provisions to augment the new State \nChild Health Insurance Program, to assist individuals with disabilities \nin maintaining quality health care coverage, and to establish a \nNational Fund for Health Research to supplement the funding of the \nNational Institutes of Health. All these new initiatives, as well as \nthe market reforms that I supported previously, work toward the goals \nof covering more individuals and stemming the tide of rising health \ncosts.\n  My commitment to the issue of health care reform across all \npopulations has been consistently evident during my tenure in the \nSenate, as I have taken to this floor and offered health care reform \nbills and amendments on countless occasions. I will continue to stress \nthe importance of the Federal Government's investment in and attention \nto the system's future.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I can personally report on the miracles \nof modern medicine. Nearly 10 years ago, an MRI detected a benign \ntumor, meningioma, at the outer edge of my brain. It was removed by \nconventional surgery, with 5 days of hospitalization and 5 more weeks \nof recuperation.\n  When a small regrowth was detected by a follow-up MRI in June 1996, \nit was treated with high powered radiation using a remarkable device \ncalled the ``Gamma Knife.'' I entered the hospital on the morning of \nOctober 11, 1996, and left the same afternoon, ready to resume my \nregular schedule. Like the MRI, the Gamma Knife is an innovation, \ncoming into widespread use only in the past decade.\n  In July 1998, I was pleased to return to the Senate after a \nrelatively brief period of convalescence following heart bypass \nsurgery. This experience again led me to marvel at our health care \nsystem and made me more determined than ever to support Federal funding \nfor biomedical research and to support legislation which will \nincrementally make health care available to all Americans.\n  My concern about health care has long pre-dated my own personal \nbenefits from the MRI and other diagnostic and curative procedures. As \nI have previously discussed, my concern about health care began many \nyears ago and has been intensified by my service on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which \nI now have the honor to chair.\n  My own experience as a patient has given me deeper insights into the \nAmerican health care system beyond my perspective from the U.S. Senate. \nI have learned: (1) our health care system, the best in the world, is \nworth every cent we pay for it; (2) patients sometimes have to press \ntheir own cases beyond doctors' standard advice; (3) greater \nflexibility must be provided on testing and treatment; (4) our system \nhas the resources to treat the 40.9 million Americans currently \nuninsured, but we must find the way to pay for it; and (5) all \nAmericans deserve the access to health care from which I and others \nwith coverage have benefited.\n  I have long been convinced that our Federal budget of $2.4 trillion \ncould provide sufficient funding for America's needs if we establish \nour real priorities. Over the past 10 years, I believe we have learned \na great deal about our health care system and what the American people \nare willing to accept from the Federal Government. The message we heard \nloudest was that Americans do not want a massive overhaul of the health \ncare system. Instead, our constituents want Congress to proceed at a \nslower pace and to target what is not working in the health care system \nwhile leaving in place what is working.\n\n  While I would have been willing to cooperate with the Clinton \nadministration in addressing this Nation's health care problems, I \nfound many areas where I differed with President Clinton's approach to \nsolutions. I believe that the proposals would have been deleterious to \nmy fellow Pennsylvanians, to the American people, and to our health \ncare system as a whole. Most importantly, as the President proposed in \n1993, I did not support creating a large new government bureaucracy \nbecause I believe that savings should go to health care services and \nnot bureaucracies.\n  On this latter issue, I first became concerned about the potential \ngrowth in bureaucracy in September 1993 after reading the President's \n239-page preliminary health care reform proposal. I was surprised by \nthe number of new boards, agencies, and commissions, so I asked my \nlegislative assistant, Sharon Helfant, to make me a list of all of \nthem. Instead, she decided to make a chart. The initial chart depicted \n77 new entities and 54 existing entities with new or additional \nresponsibilities.\n  When the President's 1,342-page Health Security Act was transmitted \nto Congress on October 27, 1993, my staff reviewed it and found an \nincrease to 105 new agencies, boards, and commissions and 47 existing \ndepartments, programs and agencies with new or expanded jobs. This \nchart received national attention after being used by Senator Bob Dole \nin his response to the President's State of the Union address on \nJanuary 24, 1994.\n  The response to the chart was tremendous, with more than 12,000 \npeople from across the country contacting my office for a copy; I still \nreceive requests for the chart nearly ten years later. Groups and \nassociations, such as United We Stand America, the American Small \nBusiness Association, the National Federation of Republican Women, and \nthe Christian Coalition, reprinted the chart in their publications--\namounting to hundreds of thousands more in distribution. Bob Woodward \nof the Washington Post later stated that he thought the chart was the \nsingle biggest factor contributing to the demise of the Clinton health \ncare plan. And during the November 1996 election, my chart was used by \nSenator Dole in his presidential campaign to illustrate the need for \nincremental health care reform as opposed to a big government solution.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has stated that the \nhealth care, education, and child care for the 3.5 to 4 million low-\nbirth-weight infants and children from their births to the time they \nreach 15 years old costs between $5.5 and $6 billion more than what it \nwould have cost if those children had been born at normal weight. We \nknow that in most instances, prenatal care is effective in preventing \nlow-birth-weight babies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that low \nbirth weight does not have a genetic link, but is instead most often \nassociated with inadequate prenatal care or the lack of prenatal care. \nThe short and long-term costs of saving and caring for infants of low \nbirth weight are staggering.\n  It is a human tragedy for a child to be born weighing 16 ounces with \nattendant problems which last a lifetime. I first saw one pound babies \nin 1984 when I was astounded to learn that Pittsburgh, PA, had the \nhighest infant mortality rate of African-American babies of any city in \nthe United States. I wondered how that could be true of Pittsburgh, \nwhich has such enormous medical resources. It was an amazing thing for \nme to see a one pound baby, about as big as my hand. However, I am \npleased to report that as a result of successful prevention initiatives \nlike the Federal Healthy Start program, Pittsburgh's infant mortality \nhas decreased 20 percent.\n  To improve pregnancy outcomes for women at risk of delivering babies \nof low birth weight and to reduce infant mortality and the incidence of \nlow-birth-weight births, as well as improving the health and well-being \nof mothers and their families, I initiated action that led to the \ncreation of the\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nHealthy Start program in 1991. Working with the first Bush \nadministration and Senator Harkin, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee, we allocated $25 million in 1991 for the development of \n15 demonstration projects. This number grew to 22 in 1994, to 75 \nprojects in 1998, and the Health Resources and Services Administration \nexpects this number to continue to increase. For fiscal year 2004, we \nsecured $98 million for this vital program.\n  To help children and their families to truly get a healthy start \nrequires that we continue to expand access to Head Start. This \nimportant program provides comprehensive services to low income \nchildren and families, including health, nutritional and social \nservices that children need to achieve the school readiness goal of \nHead Start. I have strongly supported expanding this program to cover \nmore children and families. Since FY'00, funding for Head Start has \nincreased from $5.3 billion to the FY'04 level of $6.8 billion. \nAdditional funding has extended the reach of this important program to \nthe current level of approximately 920,000 children.\n  Our attention to improved health of children shifts to the school \nhouse door, as all children enroll in schools throughout the Nation. \nAnd it is in the schools where we have taken our next steps to improve \nthe overall health of the Nation and reduce preventable health care \nexpenditures. In the past 15 years, obesity has increased by over 50 \npercent among adults and in the past 20 years, obesity has increased by \n100 percent among children and adolescents. A recent analysis by the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, Study \nof Early Child Care and Youth Development found that third grade \nchildren in the study received an average of 25 minutes per week in \nschool of moderate to vigorous activity, while experts in the United \nStates have recommended that young people should participate in \nphysical activity of at least moderate intensity for 30 to 60 minutes \neach day. That is why I have supported increased funding for the Carole \nM. White Physical Education for Progress program. Since it was first \nfunded at $5 million in FY 2001, this program has grown to $70 million \nin FY 2004. These funds help school districts and community based \nprograms across the country improve and expand physical education \nprograms in school, while also helping children develop healthy \nlifestyles to combat the epidemic of obesity in the Nation.\n\n  The Labor-HHS bill also has made great strides in increasing funding \nfor a variety of public health programs, such as breast and cervical \ncancer prevention, childhood immunizations, family planning, and \ncommunity health centers. These programs are designed to improve public \nhealth and prevent disease through primary and secondary prevention \ninitiatives. It is essential that we invest more resources in these \nprograms now if we are to make any substantial progress in reducing the \ncosts of acute care in this country.\n  As chairman of the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have greatly encouraged the development of prevention \nprograms which are essential to keeping people healthy and lowering the \ncost of health care in this country. In my view, no aspect of health \ncare policy is more important. Accordingly, my prevention efforts have \nbeen widespread.\n  I joined my colleagues in efforts to ensure that funding for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, increased $3.9 billion \nor 390 percent since 1989, for a fiscal year 2004 total of $4.9 \nbillion. We have also worked to increase funding for CDC's breast and \ncervical cancer early detection program to $209.5 million in fiscal \nyear 2004, almost double its 1993 total.\n  I have also supported programs at CDC which help children. CDC's \nchildhood immunization program seeks to eliminate preventable diseases \nthrough immunization and to ensure that at least 90 percent of 2-year-\nolds are vaccinated. The CDC also continues to educate parents and \ncaregivers on the importance of immunization for children under 2 \nyears. Along with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, I have \nhelped ensure that funding for this important program together with the \ncomplementary Vaccines for Children Program has grown from $914 million \nin 1999 to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2004. The CDC's lead poisoning \nprevention program annually identifies about 50,000 children with \nelevated blood levels and places those children under medical \nmanagement. The program prevents the amount of lead in children's blood \nfrom reaching dangerous levels and has grown from $38.2 million in \nfiscal year 2000 to $41.7 million in fiscal year 2004.\n  In recent years, we have also strengthened funding for Community \nHealth Centers, which provide immunizations, health advice, and health \nprofessions training. These centers, administered by the Health \nResources and Services Administration, provide a critical primary care \nsafety net to rural and medically underserved communities, as well as \nuninsured individuals, migrant workers, the homeless, residents of \npublic housing, and Medicaid recipients. Funding for Community Health \nCenters has increased from $1 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $1.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2004.\n  As former chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence and \ncurrent chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover nondefense biomedical research, I have worked to transfer CIA \nimaging technology to the fight against breast cancer. Through the \nOffice of Women's Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices, I secured a $2 million contract in fiscal year 1996 for a \nresearch consortium led by the University of Pennsylvania to perform \nthe first clinical trials testing the use of intelligence technology \nfor breast cancer detection. My Appropriations subcommittee has \ncontinued to provide funds to continue these clinical trials.\n  In 1998, I cosponsored the Women's Health Research and Prevention \nAmendments, which was signed into law later that year. This bill \nrevised and extended certain programs with respect to women's health \nresearch and prevention activities at the National Institutes of Health \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  In 1996, I also cosponsored an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1997 VA-\nHUD Appropriations bill which required that health plans provide \ncoverage for a minimum hospital stay for a mother and child following \nthe birth of the child. This bill became law in 1996.\n  I have also been a strong supporter of funding for AIDS research, \neducation, and prevention programs.\n  During the 101st Congress I cosponsored the Ryan White Comprehensive \nAIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 which amended the Public Health \nService Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nthrough the administrator of the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, to make grants in any metropolitan area that has \nreported and confirmed more than 2,000 acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome, AIDS, cases or a per capita incidence of at least 0.0025, \neligible area. This legislation requires that the grants be directed to \nthe chief elected official of the city or urban county that administers \nthe public health agency serving the greatest number of individuals \nwith AIDS in the eligible area. This bill became law in 1990.\n  During the 104th Congress I cosponsored the Ryan White CARE \nReauthorization Act of 1995 which provided federal funds to \nmetropolitan areas and states to assist in health care costs and \nsupport services for individuals and families affected by acquired \nimmune deficiency syndrome, AIDS, or infection with the human \nimmunodeficiency virus, HIV. This bill became law in 1996.\n  Funding for Ryan White AIDS programs has increased from $757.4 \nmillion in 1996 to $2.02 billion for fiscal year 2004. Within the \nfiscal year 2004 funding, $73 million was included for pediatric AIDS \nprograms and $749 million for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP. \nAIDS research at the NIH totaled $742.4 million in 1989, and has \nincreased to an estimated $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2004.\n  The health care community continues to recognize the importance of \nprevention in improving health status and reducing health care costs. \nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Consolidated Omnibus \nAppropriations Act of fiscal year 2001 established new and enhanced \npreventive benefits within the Medicare program, such as flu\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nshots, bone mass measurements, yearly mammograms, biennial pap smears \nand pelvic exams, and coverage of colonoscopy for high risk patients. \nHowever, some of these ``wellness'' benefits have cost obligations, \nsuch as co payments or deductibles. In this bill, I have also included \nprovisions which refine and strengthen preventive benefits within the \nMedicare program, including coverage of yearly pap smears, pelvic \nexams, and screening and diagnostic mammography with no copayment or \nPart B deductible; and coverage of insulin pumps for certain Type I \nDiabetics.\n  During the 102nd Congress, I cosponsored an amendment to the \nVeterans' Medical Programs Amendments of 1992 which included \nimprovements to health and mental health care and other services to \nveterans by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This bill became law in \n1992.\n  During the 106th Congress, I sponsored the Veterans Benefits and \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 2000 which increased amounts of \neducational assistance for veterans under the Montgomery GI Bill and \nenhanced health programs. This bill became law in 2000.\n  I also sponsored the Department of Veterans Affairs Long-Term Care \nand Personnel Authorities Enhancement Act which improved and enhanced \nthe provision of health for veterans. This bill became law in 2003.\n  I cosponsored the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act which \nbecame law in 2003. This Act provided $20 billion in fiscal relief to \nthe states, half of which went toward Medicaid relief.\n  In 1996, I cosponsored the Health Coverage Availability and \nAffordability Act, which improved the portability and continuity of \nhealth insurance coverage in the group and individual markets, combated \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and health care delivery, \npromoted the use of medical savings accounts, improved access to long-\nterm care services and coverage, and simplified the administration of \nhealth insurance. This bill became law in 1996.\n  On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine, IOM, issued a report \nentitled ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' The IOM \nReport estimated that anywhere between 44,000 and 98,000 hospitalized \nAmericans die each year due to avoidable medical mistakes. However only \na fraction of these deaths and injuries are due to negligence; most \nerrors are caused by system failures. The IOM issued a comprehensive \nset of recommendations, including the establishment of a nationwide, \nmandatory reporting system; incorporation of patient safety standards \nin regulatory and accreditation programs; and the development of a non-\npunitive ``culture of safety'' in health care organizations. The report \ncalled for a 50 percent reduction in medical errors over 5 years.\n  After the report was issued I held a series of three LHHS hearings on \nmedical errors: Dec. 13, 1999--to discuss the findings of the Institute \nof Medicine's report on medical errors; Jan. 25, 2000--a joint hearing \nwith the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to discuss a national error \nreporting system and the VA's national patient safety program; Feb. 22, \n2000--a joint hearing with the HELP Committee to discuss the \nAdministration's strategy to reduce medical errors.\n\n  After hearing from Government witnesses and experts in the field on \nmedical errors, I included $50 million in the FY 2001 Senate Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education for a patient safety \ninitiative. In the Senate report I also directed the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, to: (1) develop guidelines on \nthe collection of uniform error data; (2) establish a competitive \ndemonstration program to test ``best practices;'' and (3) research ways \nto improve provider training.\n  The committee also directed AHRQ to prepare an interim report to \nCongress concerning the results of the demonstration program within 2 \nyears of the beginning of the projects. The FY 2002 Senate report \ndirected AHRQ to submit a report detailing the results of its \ninitiative to reduce medical errors. HHS combined both reports into \none, which it submitted to me earlier this year.\n  Since FY 2001 the Labor/HHS Subcommittee has included within the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality funding for research into \nways to reduce medical errors. The FY 2002 appropriation was $55 \nmillion, in FY 2003 another $55 million was provided, in FY 2004 the \nappropriation was increased to $79.5 million and in FY 2005, while \nstill pending Senate action a figure of $84 million is proposed.\n  Statistics find that 30 percent of Medicare expenditures occur during \na person's last year of life and beyond the last year of life, a \ntremendous percentage of medical costs occur in the last month, in the \nlast few weeks, in the last week, or in the last few days.\n  A New England Journal of Medicine article stated that as much as 3.3 \npercent of national health care costs could be saved yearly by reducing \nthe use of end of life interventions. While some estimates of the end \nof life costs have been projected to be over $500 billion, over a 10-\nyear period, the cost analysis in this bill does not include any of \nthese estimates in the projected savings calculations.\n  The issue of cutting back on end of life treatments is such a \nsensitive subject and no one should decide for anybody else what that \nperson should have by way of end-of-life medical care. What care ought \nto be available is a very personal decision.\n  Living wills give an individual an opportunity to make that judgment, \nto make a decision as to how much care he or she wanted near the end of \nhis or her life and that is, to repeat, a matter highly personalized \nfor the individual.\n  As part of a public education program, I included an amendment to the \nMedicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 which directed \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to include in its annual \n``Medicare And You'' handbook, a section that specifies information on \nadvance directives and details on living wills and durable powers of \nattorney regarding a person's health care decisions.\n  As chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to provide much-needed \nresources for hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other health care \nprofessionals. The National Institutes of Health provides funding for \nbiomedical research at our Nation's universities, hospitals, and \nresearch institutions. I led the effort to double funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health over 5 years. Funding for the NIH has \nincreased from $11.3 billion in fiscal year 1995 to $28 billion in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  An adequate number of health professionals, including doctors, \nnurses, dentists, psychologists, laboratory technicians, and \nchiropractors is critical to the provision of health care in the United \nStates. I have worked to provide much needed funding for health \nprofessional training and recruitment programs. In fiscal year 2004, \nthese vital programs received $436 million. Nurse education and \nrecruitment alone has been increased from $58 million in fiscal year \n1996 to $142 million in fiscal year 2004.\n  Once recruited and trained, health professionals must be given the \nresources to provide quality health care in all areas of the country. \nDifferences in reimbursement rates between rural and urban areas have \nled to significant problems in health professional retention. During \nthe debate on the Balanced Budget Refinement Act 2, which passed as \npart of the FY 2001 consolidated appropriations bill, I attempted to \nreclassify some Northeastern hospitals in Pennsylvania to a \nMetropolitan Statistical Area with higher reimbursement rates. Due to \nthe large volume of requests from other states, we were not able to \naccomplish these reclassifications for Pennsylvania. However, as part \nof the FY 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill, I secured $7 million for \ntwenty northeastern Pennsylvania hospitals affected by area wage index \nshortfalls.\n  As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement \nAct of 2003, which passed the Senate on November 25, 2003, a $900 \nmillion program was established to provide a one-time appeal process \nfor hospital wage index reclassification. Thirteen Pennsylvania \nhospitals were approved for funding through this program in \nPennsylvania.\n\n  The following table outlines the $540 billion in projected health \ncare costs offset by the $540 billion in health care saving assumptions \ncontained in the\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nprovisions of the Health Care Assurance Act of 2004. These costs and \nsavings are for a 10-year period.\n\n \n                                                       Projected health\n                                                          care costs\n \nSmall Employer and Individual Purchasing Groups.....        $300,000,000\nCOBRA Portability Reform............................     101,700,000,000\nFinancial Incentives for Young Adults...............      40,000,000,000\nOutreach Program for Medicaid Eligible Low-Income          4,000,000,000\n Families...........................................\nExpanded Coverage for the State Children's Health        394,000,000,000\n Insurance Program and Their Families...............\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total--Projected Health Care Costs............     540,000,000,000\n \n\n\n \n                                                       Projected health\n                                                         care savings\n \nImproving Program Integrity/Efficiency in the            $60,000,000,000\n Medicare Program...................................\nReducing Medical Errors and Increasing Medical           150,000,000,000\n Technology.........................................\nImproving Health Care Quality, Efficiency and             70,000,000,000\n Consumer Education.................................\nPrimary and Preventive Care Providers...............     260,000,000,000\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total--Projected Health Care Savings..........     540,000,000,000\n \n\n  The provisions which I have outlined today contain my ideas for a \nframework to provide affordable, quality health care for all Americans. \nI am opposed to rationing health care. I do not want rationing for \nmyself, for my family, or for America. I believe we can provide care \nfor the 43 million Americans who are now not covered by savings in \nother areas of the $1.7 trillion currently being spent on health care. \nThe time has come for concerted action in this arena. I urge my \ncolleagues to move this legislation forward promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Frist, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Graham of South Carolina, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2560. A bill to amend chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code, \nrelating to inducement of copyright infringement, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise with my esteemed colleague and \nfriend, Senator Leahy, ranking Democrat Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, to introduce the ``Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act \nof 2004.'' This Act will confirm that creative artists can sue \ncorporations that profit by encouraging children, teenagers and others \nto commit illegal or criminal acts of copyright infringement. Senator \nLeahy and I are pleased that Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader \nDaschle and Senators Graham and Boxer are co-sponsoring this important \nbipartisan legislation.\n  It is illegal and immoral to induce or encourage children to commit \ncrimes. Artists realize that adults who corrupt or exploit the \ninnocence of children are the worst type of villains. In ``Oliver \nTwist'', Fagin and Bill Sikes profited by inducing children to steal. \nIn the film ``Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang'', the leering ``Child-Catcher'' \nlured children into danger with false promises of ``free lollipops.'' \nTragically, some corporations now seem to think that they can legally \nprofit by inducing children to steal--that they can legally lure \nchildren and others with false promises of ``free music.''\n  Such beliefs seem common among distributors of so-called peer-to-peer \nfilesharing (``P2P'') software. These programs are used mostly by \nchildren and college students--about half of their users are children. \nUsers of these programs routinely violate criminal laws relating to \ncopyright infringement and pornography distribution. Criminal law \ndefines ``inducement'' as ``that which leads or tempts to the \ncommission of crime.'' Some P2P software appears to be the definition \nof criminal inducement captured in computer code.\n  Distributors of some P2P software admit this. The distributors of \nEarthStation 5 state, ``While other peer 2 peer networks like Kazaa or \nImesh continue to deny building their programs for illegal file \nsharing, at ES5 we not only admit why we built ES5, we actually promote \nP2P, endorse file sharing, and join our users in swapping files!''\n  Recently, in the Grokster case, a Federal court drew similar \nconclusions about the intent of other distributors of P2P software. It \nwarned that some P2P distributors ``may have intentionally structured \ntheir businesses to avoid secondary liability for copyright \ninfringement, while benefiting financially from the illicit draw of \ntheir wares.'' In other words, many P2P distributors may think that \nthey can lawfully profit by inducing children to break the law and \ncommit crimes.\n  They are dead wrong. America punishes as criminals those who induce \nothers to commit any criminal act, including copyright infringement. \nThe first sentence of our Criminal Code states:\n\n       Whoever commits an offense against the United States or \n     aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its \n     commission, is punishable as a principal . . . .\n\n  Indeed, it is absurd to think that our law might be otherwise. No \ncivilized country could let sophisticated adults profit by tempting its \nmost vulnerable citizens--its children--to break the law.\n  I think we must understand how some corporations came to confuse \nchild endangerment with a legal business model. Their confusion seems \nto arise from court cases misinterpreting a well-intended Supreme Court \ndecision that tried to clarify two critical components of federal law: \nthe law of secondary liability and the law of copyright.\n  The Supreme Court states that secondary liability is ``imposed in \nvirtually all areas of the law.'' Secondary liability is universal \nbecause its logic is compelling. It does not absolve lawbreakers of \nguilt. But it recognizes that we are all human: We are all more likely \nto break the law if encouraged or ordered to do so. Secondary liability \nthus discourages lawlessness by punishing people who manipulate others \ninto doing the ``dirty work'' of breaking the law. Secondary liability \nusually targets two types of persons: 1. those who induce others to \nbreak the law, and 2. those who control others who break the law.\n  Though secondary liability is nearly ubiquitous, it has almost always \nremained as a judge-made, common-law doctrine--and for a good reason. \nSecondary liability prevents the use of indirect means to achieve \nillegal ends. Consequently, the scope of secondary liability must be \nflexible--otherwise, it would just instruct wrong-doers on how to \nlegally encourage or manipulate others into breaking the law. The \ncommon-law judicial process is ideally suited to evolve flexible \nsecondary-liability rules from the results of many individual cases.\n  As a result, Congress rarely codifies secondary liability. It has \ncodified secondary liability to narrow it, as in the Patent Act. \nCongress has codified secondary liability in the Criminal Code to \nensure that the narrow construction given criminal statutes would not \nforeclose secondary liability. In the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, \nCongress codified a complex balance between opposed interests that \nexpanded one type of secondary liability and narrowed another.\n  Congress has always assumed that infringers could readily induce \nconsumers to accept infringing copies of works. It thus created ``a \npotent arsenal of remedies against an infringer . . . .'' But secondary \nliability often arises if a third party can be ordered or induced to \nmake the infringing copies. Consequently, only after copying devices \nbecame available to people who might be induced to infringe did \nquestions about secondary liability for infringement become pressing.\n  In 1984, these questions reached the Supreme Court in Sony Corp. v. \nUniversal City Studios, Inc. Sony held that the makers of the Betamax \nVCR could not be held secondarily liable in a civil suit brought by \ncopyright holders--even though some consumers would use VCRs to make \ninfringing copies of copyrighted TV broadcasts.\n  Sony also created a broader limitation on secondary liability by \nimporting a limitation that that Congress had codified only in the \nPatent Act; this was the substantial-noninfringing-use rule, also \ncalled the ``staple article of commerce'' doctrine. Sony intended this \nrule to strike, as between creators of works and copying equipment, the \nsame ``balance'' that it had struck under the Patent Act between the\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nrights of patent holder and makers of staple products.\n  Under the Patent Act, the substantial-noninfringing-use rule bars \nsecondary liability for selling a ``staple'' product that has a \n``substantial noninfringing use''--even if that staple could also be \nused as a component in an infringing copy of a patented invention. This \nrule protects makers of staples without changing the nature of \nsecondary liability. In particular, it does not immunize bad actors who \nintend to distribute ``patent-infringement kits.'' Even in the rare \ncase of a novel invention that consists only of ``staple'' components, \nan ``infringement kit'' must bundle components and include assembly \ninstructions. Neither the bundle nor the instructions will likely have \na ``substantial noninfringing use.''\n\n  Sony intended this rule to strike the same admirable ``balance'' \nunder the Copyright Act. Unfortunately, Sony also proposed that if this \nrule proved problematic, Congress should alter it on a technology-by-\ntechnology basis. This proposal was flawed: In 1976, Congress redrafted \nthe Copyright Act to avoid the need to re-adjust copyrights on a \ntechnology-by-technology basis because legislation could no longer keep \npace with technological change. Returning to this impractical \ntechnology-based approach would create an endless procession of ``tech-\nmandate'' laws that discriminate between technologies Congress deems \n``good'' or ``bad.'' But technologies are rarely inherently either \n``good'' or ``bad.'' Most can be used for either purpose; the effect \ndepends on details of implementation impossible to capture--or \npredict--in prospective legislation.\n  Of course, the dysfunctional corrective mechanism that Sony proposed \nwould have become problematic only if the Sony limitation was \nmisunderstood or misapplied by lower courts. Unfortunately, that has \nnow happened.\n  In cases like Napster and Grokster, lower courts misapplied the \nsubstantial-non-infringing-use limitation. These courts forgot about \n``balance'' and held that this limitation radically alters secondary \nliability. In effect, these cases retained secondary liability's \ncontrol prong but collapsed its inducement prong. The results of these \ncases prove this point: Napster imposed liability upon a distributor of \ncopying devices who controlled infringing users; Grokster did not \nimpose liability upon distributors who appeared to induce and profit \nfrom users' infringement.\n  A secondary-liability rule that punishes control and immunizes \ninducement is a public policy disaster. It seems to permit the \ndistribution of ``piracy machines'' designed to make infringement easy, \ntempting, and automatic. Even Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and \nsociety suggests that this is happening. The Center warns that ``it can \nbe extremely difficult for a non-expert computer user to shut down'' \nthe viral redistribution that can otherwise automatically make the user \nan international distributor of infringing works. The Center notes that \nthe ``complexity of KaZaA's installation and disabling functions'' may \nleave many users unaware that they have become a contributor to global, \nfor-profit copyright piracy. Unfortunately, ``piracy machines'' \ndesigned to mislead their users are just one of the perverse effects of \na secondary liability rule that punishes control and immunizes \ninducement.\n  Perhaps the least perverse of these effects has been years of \nconflict between the content and technology industries. Content \ncreators sought the tech-mandate ``corrections'' that Sony proposed. \nTechnology industries opposed such laws because they too easily \nforeclose innocent or unforeseen applications. P2P software illustrates \nthe problem: Today, most P2P software functions like Earthstation 5's \n``piracy machine.'' Yet all agree that non-piracy-adapted \nimplementations of P2P could have legitimate and beneficial uses.\n  A rule that punishes only control also produces absurd results. \nSecondary liability should focus on intent to use indirect means to \nachieve illegal ends. A rule that punishes only control degenerates \ninto inane debate about which indirect means was used. Thus Napster and \nGrokster are regulated differently--though they function similarly from \nthe perspective of the user, the distributor, or the copyright holder.\n  A rule that punishes only control also acts as a ``tech-mandate'' \nlaw: It mandates the use of technologies that avoid ``control''--\nregardless of whether they are suited for a particular task. Napster \nwas punished for processing search requests efficiently on a \ncentralized search index that it controlled. Grokster escaped by \nprocessing search requests less efficiently on a decentralized search \nindex that it did not control. Rewarding inefficiency makes little \nsense.\n  A secondary-liability rule that punishes only control also punishes \nconsumers: It encourages designers to avoid ``control'' by shifting \nrisks onto consumers. For example, Napster incurred billion-dollar \nliability because it controlled computers housing a search index that \nlocated infringing files. Programs like Kazaa avoid Napster's \n``control'' by moving their search indices onto computers owned by \nunsuspecting consumers. Consumers were never warned about the risks of \nhousing these indices. As a result, many consumers, universities, and \nbusinesses now control computers that house ``mini-Napsters''--parts of \na search index much like the one that destroyed Napster. These indices \ncould still impose devastating liability upon anyone who ``controls'' a \ncomputer housing them. A secondary-liability rule that punishes only \ncontrol thus rewards Kazaa for shifting huge risks onto unsuspecting \nconsumers, universities and businesses.\n  And search indices are just one of the risks that designers of P2P \nsoftware seem to impose upon their young users to avoid control. For \nexample, the designers of most filesharing software choose to lack the \nability to remove or block access to files known to contain viruses, \nchild pornography or pornography mislabeled to be appealing to \nchildren. This ability could create ``control'' and trigger liability. \nAiding distributors of viruses and pornography may be just an \nunfortunate side effect of avoiding control while inducing \ninfringement.\n  A secondary-liability rule that immunizes inducement also encourages \nattempts to conceal risks from consumers: It is easier to induce people \nto take risks if they are unsure whether they are incurring a risk or \nits severity. The interfaces of most P2P software provide no warnings \nabout the severe consequences of succumbing to the constant temptation \nof infringement.\n  Another risk to users of P2P software arises when pornography \ncombines with the ``viral redistribution'' that thwarts removal of \ninfringing copies of works. Most filesharing networks are awash in \npornography, much of it mislabeled, obscene, illegal child pornography, \nor harmful to minors. Anyone risks criminal prosecution if they \ndistribute pornography accessible to minors over these child-dominated \nnetworks. As a result, one P2P distributor who does distribute \n``adult'' content demands that it be protected by access controls. But \nevery adult who uses this distributor's software as intended to \ndownload one of millions of unprotected pornographic files \nautomatically makes that pornography available for re-distribution to \nmillions of children. This distributor has sat silently--knowing that \nits software exposes millions of its users to risks of criminal \nprosecution that the distributor cannot be paid to endure.\n  Perhaps the worst effect of punishing control and rewarding \ninducement is that it achieves precisely what Sony sought to avoid: It \nleaves copyright holders with an enforcement remedy that is ``merely \nsymbolic'': It seems real, but it is illusory.\n  In theory, a rule that immunizes inducement still permits enforcement \nagainst those induced to infringe. At first, this remedy seems viable \nbecause copyrights have traditionally been enforced in lawsuits against \ndirect infringers who actually make infringing copies of works.\n  But a fallacy lurks here: The ``direct infringers'' at issue are not \nthe traditional targets for copyright enforcement. In fact, they are \nchildren and consumers: They are the hundreds of millions of \nAmericans--toddlers to seniors--who use and enjoy the creative works \nthat copyrights have helped create.\n  There is no precedent for shifting copyright enforcement toward the \nend-\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\nusers of works. For nearly 200 years, copyright law has been nearly \ninvisible to the millions who used and enjoyed creative works. \nCopyright law was invisible to consumers because the law gave creators \nand distributors mutual incentives to negotiate the agreements that \nensured that works reached consumers in forms that were safe to use in \nforeseeable ways. Now, those incentives are collapsing. As a result, \nartists must now waive their rights or sue consumers--their fans.\n  Worse yet, artists must sue their fans for the sin of misusing \ndevices designed to be easy and tempting to misuse. That is unfair: \nWhen inducement is the disease, infringement can be seen as just a \nsymptom. Yet artists must ignore inducers who profit by chanting, \n``Hey, kids, infringement is cool, and we will help you get away with \nit.'' Instead, artists can only sue kids who succumb to this \ntemptation. They must leave Fagin to his work--and sue Oliver Twist.\n  This sue-Oliver ``remedy'' is a debacle. For example, immunizing \ninducement ensures that artists will have to sue their fans: Inducers \nwill have both the incentive and the means to thwart less extreme \nmeasures, like educational campaigns. For example, RIAA tried to avoid \nlawsuits against filesharers by sending educational instant messages to \ninfringers. Kazaa, for ``privacy'' reasons, disabled instant messaging \nby default in the next version of its software. Lawsuits then followed.\n  And imagine the poor parent who tries to tell a teenager that free \ndownloading of copyrighted music is illegal. The teenager, confused \nbecause ``everyone is doing it,'' consults a leading technology-news \nsite promising a ``trusted source of information for millions of \ntechnology consumers.'' There, the teenager finds a P2P distributor \npromoting ``Morpheus 4.0, the only American filesharing software ruled \nlegal by a U.S. federal court.'' This statement is false: Grokster did \nnot rule Morpheus ``legal''; in fact, the case only confirmed that \ndownloading copyrighted works is illegal. Below this misinformation, \nthe teenager will find an independent editorial review rating Morpheus \n4.0 as a ``Recommended'' download and ``an excellent choice'' for those \nseeking ``the latest and greatest.'' Who will the teenager believe?\n  Worse yet, if artists must sue only the induced, they just feed the \ncontempt for copyrights that inducers breed. Inducers know that people \ninduced to break a law become that law's enemies: Once you break a law, \nyou must either admit wrongdoing or rationalize your conduct. \nRationalization is often so easy. You can blame the law: Copyright is a \nstupid law needlessly enshrined in the Constitution by naives like \nJames Madison. You can blame the victim: Some rock stars still make \nmoney; I do not like the ``business model'' of the record labels. You \ncan blame the randomness of enforcement: Everyone else was doing it, so \nwhy not me? Anyone who has talked to young people about filesharing has \nheard such rationalizations time and again.\n  And forcing artists to ignore inducers and sue the induced locks \nartists into a war of attrition that they are unlikely to win. If you \nimagine inducement as a bush, this ``remedy'' forces artists to spend \ntheir money to sever each leaf--while the inducer makes money by \nwatering the root. Artists may not be able to sustain this unending \nbattle.\n  This may let inducers attempt an extortionate form of \n``outsourcing.'' Inducers can increase or decrease their devices \npropensity to encourage piracy. Inducers can thus tell American artists \nthat if the artists pay the inducers to become licensed distributors of \ntheir works, perhaps fewer bad things will happen. Implicitly, if \nartists do not pay, perhaps more bad things will happen. Were artists \nto succumb to such tactics, jobs and revenues created by the demand for \nAmerican creative works would go overseas to some unsavory locales.\n  Worst of all, inducers will inevitably target children. Children \nwould be easily induced to violate complex laws like the Copyright Act. \nAny child is a terrible enforcement target. And because most adults \nnever induce children to break laws, children induced to infringe \ncopyrights would not even be ``bad kids.'' Indeed, they would probably \nbe smart, mostly law-abiding young people with bright futures. \nInnocent, mostly law-abiding children make the worst enforcement \ntargets--and thus the best ``human shields'' to protect an inducer's \nbusiness model.\n  This threat to children is real. Today, artists are suing high-volume \nfilesharers who cannot be identified until late in the process. One \nfilesharer sued for violating federal law over 800 times turned out to \nbe a 12-year-old female honor student. This otherwise law-abiding young \ngirl and her family then faced ruin by the girl's favorite artists. The \npublic knew that something was wrong, and it was outraged. So the \npeople who gave that girl an easily misused toy--and profited from her \nmisuse of it--exploited public outrage with crocodile tears about the \ntactics of ``Big Music.'' And then, I imagine, they laughed all the way \nto the bank.\n  The Supreme Court could not have intended to force artists to sue \nchildren in order to reduce the profits that adults can derive by \nencouraging children to break the law. No one would intend that. Yet it \nseems to be happening.\n  These are the inevitable results of a secondary-liability rule that \nimmunizes inducement. This ``rule'' has created the largest global \npiracy rings in history. These rings now create billions of infringing \ncopies of works, and reap millions in profits for leaders who insulate \nthemselves from direct involvement in crime by inducing children and \nstudents to ``do the dirty work'' of committing illegal or criminal \nacts. These rings then thwart deterrence and condemn attempts to \nenforce the law. These rings may now use profits derived from rampant \ncriminality to extort their way into the legal Internet distribution \nmarket--a market critical to the future of our artists and children.\n  This must stop--and stop now. Artists have tried: They targeted for-\nprofit inducers. But artists were thwarted by a court ruling that held, \nin effect, that although artists can sue exploited children and \nfamilies into bankruptcy, courts need ``additional legislative \nguidance'' to decide whether artists can, instead, sue the corporations \nthat profit by inducing children to break the law. I find this \nassertion wholly inconsistent with the intent of both Congress and the \nSupreme Court. But until this fundamentally flawed ruling is overruled \nby legislation or higher courts, artists cannot hold inducers liable \nfor their actions.\n  Fortunately, Congress has charged the Department of Justice to \nenforce the Criminal Code. In the Criminal Code, Congress made it a \nFederal crime to willfully infringe copyrights or to distribute obscene \npornography or child pornography. Congress also made it a crime to \ninduce anyone--child or adult--to commit any Federal crime.\n  Indeed, Congress codified many forms of criminal secondary liability \nin the Criminal Code. I have already quoted its first sentence. Here is \nits second: ``Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if \ndirectly performed by him or another would be an offense against the \nUnited States, is punishable as a principal.'' One court has said that \nthis ensures that ``[a] crime may be performed through an innocent \ndupe, with the essential element of criminal intent residing in another \nperson.'' Not coincidentally, some Federal prosecutors worry that P2P \nsoftware makes infringement so tempting, easy and automatic that many \nof its users will lack criminal intent. Perhaps--but their relative \ninnocence will not protect their inducers.\n  The Criminal Code also codifies other forms of secondary liability, \nlike this one:\n\n       If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, \n     threaten any person in any State . . . in the free exercise \n     or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the \n     Constitution or the laws of the United States, . . . [t]hey \n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \n     ten years, or both. . . .\n\n  These examples of laws imposing secondary criminal liability have \nsomething in common: Congress codified no exceptions for ``substantial \nnon-criminal uses.'' The message is clear: Those who induce others to \ncommit crimes cannot avoid prison by showing that some of them \nresisted. I will work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the \nDepartment of Justice enforces the Federal laws that prevent\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nanyone from inducing violations of any Federal law by our citizens, our \nstudents, or our children.\n  Congress, too, must do its part by enacting the Inducing Infringement \nof Copyrights Act, S. 2560. This bill will protect American artists, \nchildren and taxpayers by restoring the privately funded civil remedy \ncrippled by the Grokster ruling. Congress must act: A Federal court has \nheld that artists can only enforce their rights by suing exploited \nchildren and students pending ``additional legislative guidance'' about \nwhether artists can, instead, sue the corporations that profit by \ninducing children to break laws and commit crimes. Silence could be \nmisinterpreted as support for those who profit by corrupting and \nendangering others. This bill will restore the tried, privately funded \ncivil enforcement actions long used to enforce copyrights.\n  This bill will also preserve the Sony ruling without reversing, \nabrogating or limiting it. The Inducement Act will simply import and \nadapt the Patent Act's concept of ``active inducement'' in order to \ncover cases of intentional inducement that were explicitly not at issue \nin Sony. The Inducement Act also preserves the Section 512 safe harbors \nfor Internet service providers.\n  The bill also contains a savings clause to ensure that it provides \nthe ``guidance'' courts have requested--not an iron-clad rule of \ndecision for all possible future cases. This flexibility is critical \nbecause just as infringement cases are fact specific, so should \ninducement cases center on the facts of a given case, with courts \nendowed with the flexibility to impose just results. This bill does not \npurport to resolve or affect existing disagreements about when copies \nmade and used within an individual's home environment are permissible \nand when they are infringing.\n  Rather, this bill is about the intentional inducement of global \ndistribution of billions of infringing copies of works at the prodding \nand instigation of sophisticated corporations that appear to want to \nprofit from piracy, know better than to break the law themselves, and \ntry to shield themselves from secondary liability by inducing others to \ninfringe and then disclaiming control over those individuals.\n\n  I also want to thank everyone who has worked with us to craft a bill \nthat addresses this serious threat to children and copyrights without \nunduly burdening companies that engage in lawful commerce in the wide \nrange of devices and programs that can copy digital files. As Sony \nillustrates, clear knowledge that a copying device can be used to \ninfringe does not provide evidence of intent to induce infringement. It \nwas critical to find a way to narrowly identify the rare bad actors \nwithout implicating the vast majority of companies that serve both \nconsumers and copyright-holders by providing digital copying devices--\neven though these devices, like all devices, can be misused for \nunlawful purposes. In particular, I would like to thank the Business \nSoftware Alliance for its invaluable assistance in crafting a bill that \nprotects existing legitimate technologies and future innovation in all \ntechnologies--including peer-to-peer networking.\n  Senator Leahy and I look forward to working with all affected parties \nto enact this bill and restore the balance and private enforcement that \nSony envisioned. But until Congress can enact the Inducing Infringement \nof Copyrights Act, the duty and authority to stop inducement that \ntargets children and students resides in the Department of Justice that \nCongress has charged to protect artists, commerce, citizens and \nchildren. The Department must act now to clarify some simple facts: \nAmerica has never legalized the ``business model'' of Fagin and Bill \nSykes. Modern ChildCatchers cannot lawfully profit by luring children \ninto crime with false promises of ``free music.''\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 2560, the \nInducing Infringement of Copyrights Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 2560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Inducing Infringement of \n     Copyrights Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INTENTIONAL INDUCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.\n\n       Section 501 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g)(1) In this subsection, the term `intentionally \n     induces' means intentionally aids, abets, induces, or \n     procures, and intent may be shown by acts from which a \n     reasonable person would find intent to induce infringement \n     based upon all relevant information about such acts then \n     reasonably available to the actor, including whether the \n     activity relies on infringement for its commercial viability.\n       ``(2) Whoever intentionally induces any violation \n     identified in subsection (a) shall be liable as an infringer.\n       ``(3) Nothing in this subsection shall enlarge or diminish \n     the doctrines of vicarious and contributory liability for \n     copyright infringement or require any court to unjustly \n     withhold or impose any secondary liability for copyright \n     infringement.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nobody can deny that the digital age has \nbrought many benefits and many challenges to all of us.\n  In my home state of Vermont, the Internet has revolutionized how we \nwork and how we learn: Distance learning brings the best teaching tools \nright into rural communities, and new business models let Vermont \nbusinesses reach new and far-flung customers. As suppliers who use the \nInternet, we enjoy access to a range of goods and services unimagined \nwhen I was growing up, and the vast panoply of information and \nentertainment offerings on the World Wide Web are at the fingertips of \nmany Vermonters. Of course, we must work to ensure that everyone can \nreap the benefits of the digital age, and I am striving both here in \nWashington and in my state to do what is necessary to bring affordable \nand reliable Internet access to every household.\n  I am confident that, with continued focus and perseverance, the day \nof universal access is coming and we will all take part in the many \nadvantages of the digital age. But there are other problems that \nrequire immediate attention, because they threaten the development of \nthe web. We will never be able to make the Internet an entirely \ntrouble-free zone, but we will also never be justified in failing to \nmake efforts to defend and improve it.\n  One important effort to improve it is the bill that I am proud to \nintroduce today--along with Senators Hatch, Daschle, Frist, Boxer, and \nGraham of South Carolina--the ``Inducing Infringement of Copyright Act \nof 2004.''\n  The ``Inducing Infringement of Copyright Act of 2004'' is a \nstraightforward bill. Our legislation treats those who induce others to \nviolate copyrights as infringers themselves. This is not a novel \nconcept; it is the codification of a long-standing principle of \nintellectual property law: that infringement liability reaches not only \ndirect infringers but also those who intentionally induce illegal \ninfringement. And while the legal principle is an old one, the problems \nof inducement for copyright are a relatively new byproducts of the \ndigital age--an age in which it is easy, and often profitable, to \ninduce others to violate copyrights through illegal downloading from \nthe Internet.\n  The principle at the heart of this bill--secondary copyright \nliability--has long been in the common law. In fact, such secondary \nliability is provided for by statute in the patent law. The patent code \nprovides liability for inducing infringement and for the sale of \nmaterial components of patented machines, when the components are not a \nstaple article of commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing use. \nThis is because it has long been relatively simple and economically \nworthwhile to induce patent infringement. By contrast, until recently \nthe ability to illegally download music, books, software, and films has \nnot existed. Recent developments, however, now make it necessary for \nCongress to clarify that this principle also applies to copyrights.\n  What the inducement bill does not do is just as important as what it \ndoes: It does not target technology. Useful legislation on this topic \nmust address the copyright issue and not demonize certain software. As \na practical matter, if a law is targeted at certain software, the \ndesigners will simply design around the law and render it useless. And \nas a matter of effectiveness, if the law addresses only well-understood \npresent threats, it will necessarily be too narrow to encompass future \ntechnologies that may pose the same threat to copyrights. A law that \ndeals simply with\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\nthe copyrights--and their violation--is far less likely to be \ncircumvented or out-dated before it can do any good. It will be both \nbroad enough and sufficiently flexible to accommodate situations we \ncannot foresee.\n  This legislation is also carefully crafted to preserve the doctrine \nof ``fair use.'' Indeed by targeting the illegal conduct of those who \nhave hijacked promising technologies, we can hope that consumers in the \nfuture have more outlets to purchase creative works in a convenient, \nportable digital format. Similarly, the bill will continue to promote \nthe development of new technologies as it will not impose liability on \nthe manufacturers of copying technology merely because the possibility \nexists for abuse. Finally, the bill will not affect Internet service \nproviders who comply with the safe harbor provisions of the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act.\n  Copyright law protecting intellectual property is one of the taproots \nof our economy and of our creativity as a nation. For copyright law to \nwork as the Founders intended, it needs effective enforcement. That \nmeans adapting enforcement tools to meet new challenges, in the digital \nage or in any age. And that is the straightforward purpose of this \nbill.\n  I would like to take a moment also to emphasize another important, if \nobvious, point about this bill that some detractors have ignored. The \nlaw only penalizes those who intentionally induce others to infringe \ncopyrights. Thus, the makers of electronic equipment, the software \nvendors who sell email and other programs, the Internet service \nproviders who facilitate access to the Web--all of these entities have \nnothing to fear from this bill. So long as they do not conduct their \nbusinesses with the intention of inducing others to break the law--and \nI certainly have not heard from anyone who makes that claim--they \nshould rest easy. The only actors who have anything to fear are those \nthat are already breaking the law; this bill simply clarifies and \ncodifies that long-standing doctrine of secondary liability.\n  The ``Inducing Infringement of Copyright Act of 2004'' is a simple \nfix to a growing problem. The bill protects the rights inherent in \ncreative works, while helping to ensure that those same works can be \neasily distributed in digital format.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Inducing \nInfringement of Copyrights Act of 2004 introduced today by Senators \nHatch and Leahy. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. The Inducement \nAct addresses the growing problem of online piracy--the illegal \ndownloading of copyrighted music. Piracy is devastating the music \ncommunity and threatening other forms of copyrighted work. This \ncommonsense, bipartisan legislation takes important steps in protecting \nour Nation's intellectual property.\n  When I return home to Nashville and drive down Music Row, my heart \nsinks as I see the ``For Sale'' and ``For Rent'' signs everywhere. The \nonce vibrant music community is being decimated by online piracy. No \none is spared. It is hitting artists, writers, record companies, \nperforming rights organizations, and publishers.\n  Every month 2.6 billion music files are illegally downloaded using \npeer-to-peer networks, and it is not unusual for albums to show up on \nthe Internet before they make it to the record store. The effect of \nthis theft of intellectual property is disastrous to the creative \nindustry. In the end, rampant piracy dries up income and drives away \nprofessional musicians. We get fewer artists and less music.\n  Online piracy affects more than just the music industry. It affects a \nbroad swath of the creative field, including the movie and software \nindustries. Music, movies, books, and software contribute well over \nhalf a trillion dollars to the U.S. economy each year and support 4.7 \nmillion workers. When our copyright laws are blatantly ignored or \nthreatened, an enormous sector of our economy and creative culture is \nthreatened.\n  The intent of the anti-piracy bill being introduced today is simple. \nIt holds liable those who intentionally induce others to commit illegal \nacts of copyright infringement. In other words, it targets the bad \nactors who are encouraging others to steal. In addition, the general \ncause of action in this bill is not new or revolutionary. It is based \non the theory of secondary liability that is found squarely in our \nNation's laws.\n  This bill should not and does not threaten in any manner the further \nadvancement of technology. It is not a technology mandate. Only \nindividuals or organizations which profit from intentionally \nencouraging others to violate our copyright laws should fear this \nlegislation. It has been carefully crafted and will be thoroughly \nreviewed to ensure that its language accurately reflects its sound \nintent.\n  The future of the music community is with advancing technology, and I \nencourage those in the music field to continue to offer innovative \nchoices to consumers. It is important to recognize, however, that no \none in the music industry or any other intellectual property field can \nsurvive when his or her work is being stolen. Those who are \nintentionally and actively encouraging this theft should be held \naccountable.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hatch for his hard work on this bill \nand his dedication to this issue. I would also like to thank Senator \nLeahy for his work. This is truly a bipartisan issue, and I look \nforward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure \nthat our intellectual property laws are respected and enforced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/22/senate-section/article/S7193-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7193-S7195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 387--COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                             WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Warner, Mr. Chafee, Ms. \nSnowe, and Ms. Collins) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S. Res. 387\n\n       Whereas September 3, 2004, will mark the 40th Anniversary \n     of the enactment of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et \n     seq.), which gave to the people of the United States an \n     enduring resource of natural heritage as part of the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System;\n       Whereas great American writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, \n     Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, and John Muir \n     joined poets like William Cullen Bryant, and painters such as \n     Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, Frederic Remington, Albert \n     Bierstadt, and Thomas Moran to define the United States' \n     distinct cultural value of wild nature and unique concept of \n     wilderness;\n       Whereas national leaders such as President Theodore \n     Roosevelt reveled in outdoor pursuits and sought diligently \n     to preserve those opportunities for molding individual \n     character, shaping a nation's destiny, striving for balance, \n     and ensuring the wisest use of natural resources, to provide \n     the greatest good for the greatest many;\n       Whereas luminaries in the conservation movement, such as \n     scientist Aldo Leopold, forester Bob Marshall, writer Howard \n     Zahniser, teacher Sigurd Olson, biologists Olaus and Adolph \n     Murie, and conservationist David Brower believed that the \n     people of the United States could have the boldness to \n     project into the eternity of the future some of the \n     wilderness that has come from the eternity of the past;\n       Whereas Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, a Democrat from \n     Minnesota, and Representative John Saylor, a Republican from \n     Pennsylvania, originally introduced the legislation with \n     strong bipartisan support in both bodies of Congress;\n       Whereas with the help of their colleagues, including \n     cosponsors Gaylord Nelson, William Proxmire, and Henry \n     ``Scoop'' M.

Byrd, Senator Daniel Inouye, and \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy, who came into office in \n     1961 with enactment of wilderness legislation part of his \n     administration's agenda, was assassinated before he could \n     sign a bill into law;\n       Whereas 4 wilderness champions, Aldo Leopold, Olaus Murie, \n     Bob Marshall, and Howard Zahniser, sadly, also passed away \n     before seeing the fruits of their labors ratified by Congress \n     and sent to the President;\n       Whereas President Lyndon B.

Ford stated that the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System ``serves a basic need of all \n     Americans, even those who may never visit a wilderness area--\n     the preservation of a vital element of our natural heritage'' \n     and that, ``wilderness preservation ensures that a central \n     facet of our Nation can still be realized, not just \n     remembered''; and\n       Whereas President Gerald R. Ford has joined with President \n     Jimmy Carter and more than 100 other prominent United States \n     citizens as honored members of Americans for Wilderness, a \n     committee formed to celebrate this national achievement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 40th Anniversary of the Wilderness Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.);\n       (2) recognizes and applauds the extraordinary work of the \n     individuals and organizations involved in building the \n     National Wilderness Preservation System; and\n       (3) is grateful for the tremendous asset the United States \n     has been able to pass along as a gift to future people of the \n     United States.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as founder of the Senate Wilderness \nCaucus, I am submitting a Senate resolution today to commemorate the \n40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which was signed into \nlaw on September 3, 1964, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. I thank the \nfollowing colleagues for their support as cosponsors: Senator Sununu, \nSenator Hagel, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, Senator McCain, Senator \nMurray, Senator Lugar, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Snowe, \nand Senator Collins.\n  The Wilderness Act became law seven years after the first wilderness \nbill was introduced by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. The \nfinal bill, sponsored by Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 73-12 on April 9, 1963, and passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 373-1 on July 30, 1964. The Wilderness Act \nof 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ``to \nsecure for the American people of present and future generations the \nbenefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.'' The law gives \nCongress the authority to designate wilderness areas, and directs the \nFederal land management agencies to review the lands under their \nresponsibility for their wilderness potential.\n  Under the Wilderness Act, wilderness is defined as ``an area of \nundeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influence \nwhich generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces \nof nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable.'' \nThe creation of a national wilderness system marked an innovation in \nthe American conservation movement--wilderness would be a place where \nour ``management strategy'' would be to leave lands essentially \nundeveloped.\n  The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest \nService land in 54 wilderness areas. Now, after passage of 102 pieces \nof legislation, the wilderness system is comprised of over 104 million \nacres in 625 wilderness areas, across 44 States, and administered by \nfour federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the National Park Service in the Department of the \nInterior.\n  As we in this body know well, the passage and enactment of the \nWilderness Act was a remarkable accomplishment that required steady, \nbipartisan commitment, institutional support, and strong leadership. \nThe United States Senate was instrumental in shaping this very \nimportant law, and this anniversary gives us the opportunity to \nrecognize this role.\n  As a Senator from Wisconsin, I feel a special bond with this issue. \nThe concept of wilderness is inextricably linked with Wisconsin. \nWisconsin has produced great wilderness thinkers and leaders in the \nwilderness movement such as Senator Gaylord Nelson and the writer and \nconservationist Aldo Leopold, whose A Sand County Almanac helped to \ngalvanize the environmental movement. Also notable is Sierra Club \nfounder John Muir, whose birthday is the day before Earth Day. \nWisconsin also produced Sigurd Olson, one of the founders of the \nWilderness Society.\n  I am privileged to hold the Senate seat held by Gaylord Nelson, a man \nfor whom I have the greatest admiration and respect. Though he is a \nwell-known and widely respected former Senator and former two-term \nGovernor of Wisconsin, and the founder of Earth Day, some may not be \naware that he is currently devoting his time to the protection of \nwilderness by serving as a counselor to the Wilderness Society--an \nactivity which is quite appropriate for someone who was also a co-\nsponsor, along with former Senator Proxmire, of the bill that became \nthe Wilderness Act.\n  The testimony at congressional hearings and the discussion of the \nbill in the press of the day reveals Wisconsin's crucial role in the \nlong and continuing American debate about our wild places, and in the \ndevelopment of the Wilderness Act. The names and ideas of John Muir, \nSigurd Olson, and, especially, Aldo Leopold, appear time and time again \nin the legislative history.\n  Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, chairman of what was then \ncalled the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, stated that his \nsupport of the wilderness system was the direct result of discussions \nhe had held almost forty years before with Leopold, who was then in the \nSouthwest with the Forest Service. It was Leopold who, while with the \nForest Service, advocated the creation of a primitive area in the Gila \nNational Forest in New Mexico in 1923. The Gila Primitive Area formally \nbecame part of the wilderness system when the Wilderness Act became \nlaw.\n  In a statement in favor of the Wilderness Act in the New York Times, \nthen-Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall discussed ecology and what \nhe called ``a land ethic'' and referred to Leopold as the instigator of \nthe modern wilderness movement. At a Senate hearing in 1961, David \nBrower of the Sierra Club went so far as to claim that ``no man who \nreads Leopold with an open mind will ever again, with a clear \nconscience, be able to step up and testify against the wilderness \nbill.'' For others, the ideas of Olson and Muir--particularly the idea \nthat preserving wilderness is a way for us to better understand our \ncountry's history and the frontier experience--provided a justification \nfor the wilderness system.\n  In closing, I would like to remind colleagues of the words of Aldo \nLeopold in his 1949 book, A Sand County Almanac. He said, ``The \noutstanding scientific discovery of the twentieth century is not the \ntelevision, or radio, but rather the complexity of the land organism. \nOnly those who know the most about it can appreciate how little is \nknown about it.'' We still have much to learn, but this anniversary of \nthe Wilderness Act reminds us how far we have come and how the \ncommitment to public lands that the Senate and the Congress \ndemonstrated forty years ago continues to benefit all Americans.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \ncosponsoring this resolution to honor and celebrate the 40th \nAnniversary of the Wilderness Act, and the contributions of those who \nhave created a glorious wilderness system throughout the United States \nfor all Americans to enjoy.\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\n  This anniversary provides a time for personal reflection on what wild \nplaces mean to us as individuals and society as a whole. As I consider \nthe fact that this July 4 our country will celebrate her 228th year of \nindependence, I marvel at the great changes she has seen. America has \nseen wars, the Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, the \nTechnology Age, times of prosperity and times of challenge. With all of \nthese changes, much of America's landscape has been transformed.\n  I also think back to America as I knew her as a child and how she has \nrapidly grown and changed during my 77 years. I feel indebted to those \nwhose foresight resulted in the Wilderness Act legislation, and whose \ntireless efforts saw this act signed into law. In addition, I recognize \nall those who have championed the expansion of the wilderness system \nwhich now encompasses 106,000,000 acres nationwide.\n  During my 26 years in the U.S. Senate, I have worked to pass three \nVirginia wilderness bills through Congress. In fact, I recently \nintroduced the Virginia Ridge and Valley Wilderness and National Scenic \nAreas Act of 2004 which, if passed, would create an additional 29,000 \nacres of wilderness in southwest Virginia. With 177,214 acres of \nwilderness, Virginia's wild and beautiful landscapes will remain \nuntouched by civilization. Visitors from across America can experience \nVirginia's wilderness and enjoy great beauty, solitude, primitive \nrecreation, and nature in its true form.\n  I feel very strongly that the Wilderness Act is a vehicle whereby we \ncan pay tribute to our great country by preserving some of her heritage \nand history. Though development, growth and change continue, we will \nhave pockets of undisturbed lands for solitude, reflection, and \nrecreation. In these areas we can keep America's natural diversity, \nwildlife habitats, and vegetation intact. Through the efforts, passion, \nand vision of many, we will leave a natural legacy of wildlands to \nfuture generations of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 388--COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n             FOUNDING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Dorgan (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. \nCantwell)) proposed an amendment to\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\namendment SA 3235 proposed by Mr. Brownback to the bill S. 2400, to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2005 for military activities \nof the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for \ndefense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Services, and for other \npurposes; as follows;\n\n       In the amendment, strike all beginning on page 1, line 2, \n     through page 3, line three, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .BROADCAST DECENCY ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2004.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase \n     the FCC's authority to fine for indecent broadcasts and \n     prevent further relaxation of the media ownership rules in \n     order to stem the rise of indecent programming.\n       (c) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1996 there has been significant consolidation in \n     the media industry, including:\n       (A) Radio.--Clear Channel Communications went from owning \n     43 radio stations prior to 1996 to over 1200 as of January \n     2003; Cumulus Broadcasting, Inc. was established in 1997 and \n     owned 266 stations as of December 2003, making it the second-\n     largest radio ownership company in the country; and Infinity \n     Broadcasting Corporation went from owning 43 radio stations \n     prior to 1996 to over 185 stations as of June 2004;\n       (B) Television.--Viacom/CBS's national ownership of \n     television stations increased from 31.53% of U.S. television \n     households prior to 1996 to 38.9% in 2004; GE/NBC's national \n     ownership of television stations increased from 24.65% prior \n     to 1996 to 33.56% in 2004; NewsCorp/FOX's national ownership \n     of television stations increased from 22.05% prior to 1996 to \n     37.7% in 2004;\n       (C) Media mergers.--In 2000, Viacom merged with CBS and \n     UPN; in 2002, GE/NBC merged with Telemundo Communications, \n     Inc. and in 2004 with Vivendi Universal Entertainment; in \n     2003 News Corp./Fox acquired a controlling interest in \n     DirecTV; in 2000, Time Warner, Inc. merged with America \n     Online.\n       (2) Over the same period that there has been significant \n     consolidation in the media industry the number of indecency \n     complaints also has increased dramatically. The largest \n     owners of television and radio broadcast holdings have \n     received the greatest number of indecency complaints and the \n     largest fines, including:\n       (A) Over 80% of the fines proposed by the Federal \n     Communications Commission for indecent broadcasts were \n     against stations owned by two of the top three radio \n     companies. The top radio company alone accounts for over two-\n     thirds of the fines proposed by the FCC;\n       (B) Two of the largest fines proposed by the FCC were \n     against two of the top three radio companies;\n       (C) In 2004, the FCC received over 500,000 indecency \n     complaints in response to the Superbowl Halftime show aired \n     on CBS and produced by MTV, both of which are owned by \n     Viacom. This is the largest number of complaints ever \n     received by the FCC for a single broadcast;\n       (D) The number of indecency complaints increased from 111 \n     in 2000 to 240,350 in 2003;\n       (3) Media conglomerates do not consider or reflect local \n     community standards.\n       (A) The FCC has no record of a television station owned by \n     one of the big four networks (Viacom/CBS, Disney/ABC, News \n     Corp./Fox or GE/NBC) pre-empting national programming for \n     failing to meet community standards;\n       (B) FCC records show that non-network owned stations have \n     often rejected national network programming found to be \n     indecent and offensive to local community standards;\n       (C) A letter from an owned and operated station manager to \n     a viewer stated that programming decisions are made by \n     network headquarters and not the local owned and operated \n     television station management;\n       (D) The Parents Television Council has found that the \n     ``losers'' of network ownership ``are the local communities \n     whose standards of decency are being ignored;''\n       (4) The Senate Commerce Committee has found that the \n     current fines do not deter indecent broadcast because they \n     are merely the cost of doing business for large media \n     companies. Therefore, in order to prevent the continued rise \n     of indecency violations, the FCC's authority for indecency \n     fines should be increased and further media consolidation \n     should be prevented.\n       (d) Increase in Penalties for Obscene, Indecent, and \n     Profane Broadcasts.--section 503(b)(2) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as \n     subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the violator \n     is--\n       ``(i)(I) a broadcast station licensee or permittee; or\n       ``(II) an applicant for any broadcast license, permit, \n     certificate, or other instrument or authorization issued by \n     the Commission; and\n       ``(ii) determined by the Commission under paragraph (1) to \n     have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane language, the \n     amount of any forfeiture penalty determined under this \n     subsection shall not exceed $275,000 for each violation or \n     each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount \n     assessed for any continuing violation shall not exceed a \n     total of $3,000,000 for any single act or failure to act.''; \n     and\n       (3) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated by paragraph (1), \n     by striking ``subparagraph (A) or (B)'' and inserting \n     ``subparagraph (A), (B), or (C)''.\n       (e) New Broadcast Media Ownership Rules Suspended. (1) \n     Suspension.--Subject to the provisions of paragrapls (d)(2), \n     the broadcast media ownrship rules adopted by the Federal \n     Communications Commission on June 2, 2003, pursuant to its \n     proceeding on broadcast media ownership rules, Report and \n     Order FCC03-127, published at 68 FR 46286, August 5, 2003, \n     shall be invalid and without legal effect.\n       (2) Clarification.--The provisions of paragraph (1) shall \n     not supersede the amendments made by section 629 of the \n     Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 2004 (Public \n     Law 108-199).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA. 3466. Mr. REID (for Mr. Hollings) proposed an amendment to \namendment SA 3235 proposed by Mr. Brownback to the bill S. 2400, to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2005 for military activities \nof the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for \ndefense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Services, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of all \n     American children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent, video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have a greater tendency to assume \n     that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and therefore \n     to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming have an increased fear of becoming \n     a victim of violence, resulting in increased self-protective \n     behaviors and increased mistrust of others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) A significant amount of violent programming that is \n     readily accessible to minors remains unrated specifically for \n     violence and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis \n     of its violent content.\n       (10) Age-based ratings that do not include content rating \n     for violence do not allow parents to block programming based \n     solely on violent content thereby rendering ineffective any \n     technology-based blocking mechanism designed to limit violent \n     video programming.\n       (11) The most recent study of the television ratings system \n     by the Kaiser Family Foundation concludes that 79 percent of \n     violent programming is not specifically rated for violence.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions, such as the V-chip, may be \n     helpful in protecting some children, but cannot achieve the \n     compelling governmental interest in protecting all children \n     from violent programming when parents are only able to block \n     programming that has, in fact, been rated for violence.\n       (13) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n       (14) After further study, pursuant to a rule making, the \n     Federal Communications Commission may conclude that content-\n     based ratings and blocking technology do not effectively \n     protect children from the harm of violent video programming.\n       (15) If the Federal Communications Commission reaches the \n     conclusion described in paragraph (14), the channeling of \n     violent video programming will be the least restrictive means \n     of limiting the exposure of children to the harmful \n     influences of violent video programming.\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n     SEC. 203. ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT RATING \n                   SYSTEM FOR VIOLENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF V-CHIP \n                   IN BLOCKING VIOLENT PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Report.--The Federal Communications Commission shall--\n       (1) assess the effectiveness of measures to require \n     television broadcasters and multichannel video programming \n     distributors (as defined in section 602(13) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 522(13)) to rate and \n     encode programming that could be blocked by parents using the \n     V-chip undertaken under section 715 of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 715) and under subsections (w) and (x) of \n     section 303 of that Act (47 U.S.C. 303(w) and (x)) in \n     accomplishing the purposes for which they were enacted; and\n       (2) report its findings to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the United States \n     House of Representatives, within 12 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter.\n       (b) Action.--If the Commission finds at any time, as a \n     result of its ongoing assessment under subsection (a), that \n     the measures referred to in subsection (a)(1) are \n     insufficiently effective, then the Commission shall complete \n     a rulemaking within 270 days after the date on which the \n     Commission makes that finding to prohibit the distribution of \n     violent video programming during the hours when children are \n     reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the \n     audience.\n       (c) Definitions.--Any term used in this section 2 that is \n     defined in section 715 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 715), or in regulations under that section, has the \n     same meaning as when used in that. section or in those \n     regulations.\n\n     SEC. 204.
