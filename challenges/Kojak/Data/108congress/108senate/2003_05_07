Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period for \nmorning business until 12 noon. Following morning business, the Senate \nwill begin consideration of the NATO expansion treaty. This treaty is a \nnecessary step to include seven new member countries in the NATO \nalliance.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will debate the treaty and \ndispose of all amendments during today's session. I advise my \ncolleagues that rollcall votes are possible with respect to the two \namendments to the resolution of ratification. Once those amendments are \ndisposed of during today's session, the Senate will set aside the \ntreaty, so the Senate will vote on the adoption of the resolution of \nratification at 9:30 tomorrow morning.\n  As a reminder, cloture motions were filed on the nominations of both \nPriscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada. This will be the second attempt to \nend the filibuster on the Owen nomination and our sixth effort with \nrespect to Miguel Estrada. The cloture votes on Owen and Estrada will \noccur during Thursday's session.\n  In addition, I want to inform all Members that negotiations are \nongoing to continue to clear several important pieces of legislation \nfor floor action. These items include the State Department \nauthorization bill, the bioshield bill, air cargo security legislation, \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, the FISA legislation, and a number of \npending nominations. Therefore, Members should anticipate additional \nvotes throughout the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \nin the Chamber, I wonder if he has any idea how much time he wants for \nthe debate on the two cloture motions tomorrow or are we just going to \nvote on them?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have not talked to our caucus about that, \nbut I will get back to Senator Reid shortly so we can plan out the day \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. The other question I have is, we have people ready to offer \namendments on the energy bill. Is the majority leader still planning on \nspending some time on that bill tomorrow?\n  Mr. FRIST. The plan is to be on the energy bill and continue the \ndebate and start the amendment process tomorrow, Thursday. The plan is \nto hopefully start that--although I am not sure--in the morning after \nwe finish the vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5793-6", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But the most responsible voices \nsay at this particular time: No tax cuts.\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\n  The present Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Alan Greenspan, \nsays: No tax cuts. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \narticle from the New York Times, dated May 1, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2003]\n\n  Greenspan Says Tax Cut Without Spending Reductions Could Be Damaging\n\n                        (By David E. Rosenbaum)\n\n       Washington, April 30.--Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the \n     Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that the economy \n     was poised to grow without further large tax cuts, and that \n     budget deficits resulting from lower taxes without offsetting \n     reductions in spending could be damaging to the economy. \n     Opponents of the large cut favored by President Bush took Mr. \n     Greenspan's testimony as support for their position.\n       Mr. Greenspan's statements to the House Financial Services \n     Committee were made as new Treasury data showed that tax \n     revenues have arrived at a much slower pace than expected \n     this spring. As a consequence of the revenue shortfall and \n     increased spending enacted this month, government and private \n     analysts said today, the budget deficit this fiscal year will \n     be at least $80 billion higher than the Congressional Budget \n     Office projected last month.\n       With a large deficit, Mr. Greenspan said, ``you will be \n     significantly undercutting the benefits that would be \n     achieved from the tax cuts.''\n       The combination of Mr. Greenspan's testimony and the \n     prospects of a higher deficit gave added ammunition to Mr. \n     Bush's political opponents, as the president continued today \n     to press Congress to approve a $550 billion, 10-year tax cut.\n       ``These deficit numbers are just the latest reminder that \n     what many of us have expressed concern about is becoming even \n     more of a problem,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South \n     Dakota, the Democratic leader.\n       The president met today on the tax issue with Republican \n     Congressional leaders. Afterward, Senator Bill Frist of \n     Tennessee, the majority leader, said that the president and \n     all the leaders wanted as large a tax cut as possible and \n     that Congress might consider more than one tax measure this \n     year.\n       Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, played down any \n     disagreement with Mr. Greenspan. Last week, the president \n     announced that he would renominate Mr. Greenspan to his fifth \n     term as Fed chairman, and Mr. Greenspan, 77, said he would \n     accept.\n       Mr. Fleischer said today that Mr. Bush's first priority was \n     creating jobs immediately and that the government could \n     reduce the deficit ``over time.'' He agreed with Mr. \n     Greenspan that the best way to lower the deficit was to hold \n     the line on government spending.\n       Mr. Greenspan said that with the end of the uncertainties \n     associated with the war in Iraq, the economy was in a \n     position for strong growth. But if that does not occur, he \n     said, the Fed was prepared to lower interest rates further.\n       As is his practice, Mr. Greenspan spoke elliptically in his \n     Congressional testimony and never addressed the tax \n     legislation before Congress specifically.\n       But he said that even without additional stimulus, ``the \n     economy is positioned to expand at a noticeably better pace \n     than it has during the past year.''\n       He also said new academic evidence had strengthened his \n     opinion that budget deficits led directly to higher interest \n     rates.\n       Mr. Greenspan's view on tax cuts is similar to one he \n     expressed in February, but the environment has changed. \n     Congress is now on the verge of drafting and voting on actual \n     tax legislation, and the Fed chairman's views on economic \n     matters carry more weight in Congress than the opinions of \n     any other economist.\n       In response to a question about the need for additional \n     economic stimulus, Mr. Greenspan said that with the tax cuts \n     enacted in 2001 and sizable growth in government spending, \n     ``we already have a significant amount of stimulus in \n     place.''\n       He added that he was skeptical of the ability of changes in \n     tax and spending policy to ``fine tune'' the economy in the \n     short term.\n       Mr. Greenspan said he strongly supported the president's \n     tax policy, particularly the proposal to eliminate taxes on \n     most stock dividends, ``provided it is matched by cuts in \n     spending.''\n       Deficits are especially important in the near future, he \n     said, because of the pressure on the economy early in the \n     next decade when the baby boom generation begins to reach \n     retirement age.\n       The shortfall in tax revenues has been apparent all spring, \n     but the magnitude did not become clear, economic analysts \n     said, until they examined the Treasury's daily reports of tax \n     receipts in the two weeks since the April 15 filing deadline.\n       William C. Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said \n     he was seeing ``a pretty sizable shortfall relative to \n     expectation.''\n       Goldman is forecasting a $425 billion deficit in the \n     current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In February, the \n     White House projected a deficit of $304 billion. Last month, \n     the Congressional Budget Office, using a different method of \n     calculation, projected a deficit of $246 billion.\n       A senior Republican staff member in Congress who has \n     analyzed the Treasury data said that revenues were running \n     about $40 billion lower than the Congressional Budget Office \n     expected. He said tax refunds were about $20 billion higher \n     than anticipated and tax payments about $20 billion lower.\n       One reason for the shortfall in revenues, economists say, \n     is that the poor performance by the stock market in 2002 \n     resulted in smaller tax payments of capital gains taxes and \n     fewer taxes paid by business executives who exercised stock \n     options.\n       In addition to the deficit increase resulting from lower \n     revenues, the projections by the White House and the \n     Congressional Budget Office do not count the $42 billion in \n     additional spending, mostly for the war, that Congress \n     approved this month. Nor do they consider the likelihood that \n     Congress will approve tax cuts and make at least some of them \n     retroactive to Jan. 1 and the probability that the \n     administration will ask Congress for additional spending \n     authority for reconstruction costs in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Paul Volcker, the former Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin, \nas well as the former Secretary of Commerce, Pete Peterson, call for no \nnew tax cuts. They took this stand in an article in the New York Times \non April 9, 2003. The position they take is that budget deficits \nmatter. There is no question that we had a conscience with respect to \ndeficits. The economists at the Federal Reserve have said that every \n$100 billion in deficits raises the interest rate a quarter of a \npercent, and our friends at the Brookings Institution say, no, every \n$100 billion in deficits raises the interest rate one-half to 1 \npercentage point.\n  The point is, look at what we are doing. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record a chart of the budget realities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be pritned in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Mr. President, you can see that the debt rises during \nthe 10-year period from 2003 to 2013. Mr. President I want you to \nparticularly listen to this--the debt rises from $6 trillion to $12 \ntrillion. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer remembers well how \nwe had the balanced budget amendment running around here for 15 years.\n  Remember back in 1994, the Republicans stood on the Capitol steps and \nsaid: Government is going to be different; we have a contract; we are \nnot going to run any deficits; we are going to have a balanced budget. \nThis particular budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives without \na single Democratic vote, all Republicans.\n  In the Senate, there was only one Democratic vote, the Senator from \nGeorgia. Otherwise, Vice President Cheney had to come in and adopt this \ncourse of $6 trillion to $12 trillion. That is $600 billion a year in \ndeficits each year for 10 years.\n  The Chair can see I am trying to gain the attention, for Heaven's \nsake, of this body to where we can get down to reality so that we do \nnot just willy-nilly go on and not even pay for the war.\n  I put up an amendment to pay for the war. I could get no support for \nthat. We tell GIs to go into Iraq and we hope they do not get killed, \nand the reason is we want them to hurry back so we can give them the \nbill. This generation, this Congress, this Government, aren't going to \npay for the war.\n  Now what happens? Treasury Secretary Snow says: Wait a minute now, \nyou have to stimulate, you have to stimulate. Of course, we had that \nback when President Reagan started that nonsense of tax cuts. That is \nwhat President George Herbert Walker Bush called voodoo, and I will \nnever forget\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Dole. He was against all \nof this growth and voodoo. He said: There is good news and bad news.\n  I said: Senator, what is the good news?\n  He said: The good news is a busload of supply siders have just driven \nover the cliff.\n  I said: Well, what is the bad news?\n  He said: There was one empty chair.\n  He was talking about Jack Kemp. We were against supply side and \nvoodoo. But two years ago, we had voodoo 2, with President George \nWalker Bush's tax cut, which the distinguished Presiding Officer helped \npass. Now let us see what President Bush's newest tax cuts, voodoo 3, \nwill do.\n  Secretary Snow said a dividend cut would boost stocks by 10 percent. \nBut, look, stocks are up 14 percent since March 11. Do you believe you \nare getting rich? Do you see all the jobs busting out all over?\n  On the contrary, you see Robert Samuelson talking about ``Stubborn \nStagnation.'' I ask unanimous consent that article from this morning's \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Stubborn Stagnation\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       The economic news since the war in Iraq suggests that we \n     remain in the grips of what I've called ``the new \n     stagnation.'' It's a baffling twilight zone. We're not in an \n     economic free-fall, indeed, most Americans enjoy almost \n     unprecedented prosperity. But there's also rising insecurity \n     (over jobs, stock prices) and a persisting squeeze on both \n     government social spending and corporate profits. People \n     yearn for clarity and confidence, while the new stagnation \n     provides mainly uncertainty and contradictions.\n       Consider some contrasts. Since late 2000, annual U.S. \n     economic growth has averaged about 1.5 percent (1996-2000 \n     average: 4 percent). This barely exceeds the rate of \n     population growth. By one government survey, 2.1 million jobs \n     have vanished. The stock market has lost about 40 percent of \n     its value (roughly $7 trillion) since its peak in early 2000, \n     says Wilshire Associates. But most people are doing all \n     right. There are still 130 million non-farm jobs. And the \n     median price of existing homes--most Americans' biggest \n     financial asset--rose 7.1 percent last year.\n       Japan pioneered the new stagnation. In the 1990s, its \n     economy foundered; unemployment rose gradually. But most \n     people lived well. Prosperity, if not growth, was widespread. \n     There was no alarm. The Japanese were cocky. Hadn't they \n     overtaken the United States economically? Everyone \n     acknowledged ``bubbles'' in stocks and real estate. But once \n     the aftershocks passed, the economy would revive smartly. It \n     never did. Since 1992 Japan's growth has averaged 1 percent \n     (1980s average; 3.8 percent).\n       We're not Japan--but we could slip into the same trap. \n     After the euphoria of the '90s, Americans believe that their \n     economy can't be held down for long. The standard diagnosis \n     now is that it's suffered from temporary setbacks: the stock \n     bubble, Sept. 11, corporate scandals and, most recently, the \n     war in Iraq. These will fade; the economy will rebound. \n     Perhaps. Since the war, oil prices have declined and consumer \n     confidence has risen. But the standard diagnosis minimizes \n     deeper weaknesses.\n       First, the boom's aftermath. It wasn't just stocks. As \n     consumers celebrated new stock wealth, they borrowed heavily \n     and went on a spending spree. The personal savings rate \n     dropped sharply. Now the market's decline suggests sluggish \n     spending as households rebuild savings. Similarly, businesses \n     went on an investment binge in the 1990s. They overinvested \n     in computers, fiber optics, office buildings and machinery. \n     There's huge surplus capacity. Consumer spending and business \n     investment represent about 80 percent of the economy; if \n     they're weak, growth can't be strong.\n       Second, Europe and Japan. Their stagnation deepens global \n     stagnation. Germany, Europe's largest economy, is a mess. Its \n     banks are weak; unemployment is almost 9 percent. Together, \n     Europe and Japan account for about 30 percent of the global \n     economy and a similar share of U.S. exports. If vibrant, they \n     would cushion the U.S. slowdown. They would import more from \n     the United States and elsewhere.\n       Third, twisted trade. Global trade is usually a force for \n     good. Countries specialize and spend abroad (via imports) \n     what they earn abroad (via exports). Unfortunately, most \n     Asian countries--led by Japan--strive for permanent trade \n     surpluses. This depresses the global economy by breaking the \n     chain of spending. In 2002 Asia had a current account surplus \n     of roughly $230 billion, reports the International Monetary \n     Fund. Much of this was with the United States. Jobs and \n     production flow from here to there. China looms increasingly \n     large in this process.\n       These fierce demons are devouring economic growth--and \n     efforts to revive it. Recall: Since early 2001 the Federal \n     Reserve has cut overnight interest rates from 6.5 percent to \n     1.25 percent. Meanwhile, the Bush tax cuts and weak economy \n     have shifted the federal budget toward ``stimulus.'' A \n     surplus of $236 billion in 2000 became a $157 billion deficit \n     in 2002 (and is headed higher). Tax cuts enhanced purchasing \n     power. Low interest rates enabled millions of homeowners to \n     refinance mortgages. Auto companies provided cheap credit for \n     buyers. Still, the economy sputters. In the past six months, \n     consumer spending has grown at less than half the rate of the \n     previous year. The housing boom may have stalled.\n       Stubborn stagnation has led some economists--notably \n     Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley--to fear deflation, which is \n     a general decline in prices. A few years ago, this seemed \n     preposterous. No more. Global demand remains weak; surplus \n     capacity discourages new investment; gluts depress prices. \n     Deflation could be dangerous: Lower prices could squeeze \n     profits and depress stocks; and lower prices could prevent \n     corporate debtors from repaying loans, leading to defaults \n     and bank failures.\n       Whenever the economy unexpectedly weakens, we're told it's \n     a ``pause.'' Maybe. But the present bust may be as \n     misunderstood as was the previous boom. It is worldwide, not \n     just American. It defies textbook economic models and \n     therefore may defy textbook remedies. In Japan, low interest \n     rates and big budget deficits haven't restored growth. \n     European and Japanese weaknesses fundamentally reflect social \n     and political preferences. The desire for social protections \n     has stifled economic growth with regulations and taxes. As \n     for America, recovery requires patience. Surplus capacity \n     must be shut or absorbed; debt levels must be cut.\n       What can be done? Good question. Unfamiliar problems may \n     require unfamiliar responses. If things get dramatically \n     worse, that may concentrate people's attention. But for now, \n     Republicans and Democrats are using the petty debate over the \n     proposed dividend tax exclusion to avoid harder questions. In \n     Japan, those questions rarely got raised, because the \n     economy's slow-motion unraveling never presented a clear \n     crisis. The danger of the ``new stagnation'' is that, by \n     creating a false sense that a strong recovery is always \n     imminent, it could cause the same thing to happen here.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We all know it is not going to stimulate anything in \nthat we already have a $428 billion budget deficit this year that is \nstimulus, plus $600 billion next year. We have over $1 trillion in \nstimulation. That is why Alan Greenspan says we do not need any further \nstimulation, and adding $30 billion or $40 billion more is not going to \ndo it. But let's assume that it does. It is not going to stimulate \nPeoria. It is going to stimulate Shanghai.\n  What has happened is, and Mr. Samuelson talks about this, is that we \nhave made it too expensive to do business with our high standard of \nliving. Before one can open, for example, Jones Manufacturing in the \nUnited States, you have to meet requirements for clean air, clean \nwater, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing, parental \nleave, safe working place, safe machinery, just go right on down the \nlist.\n  You can go down to Mexico for $1 an hour, $2 an hour, or you can go \nto China for 50 cents an hour. So they are going like gang busters \nthere. We have a tremendous imbalance of trade--a $500 billion \nimbalance. We are going out of business. We have to get with reality. \nWe cannot treat foreign trade as foreign aid any longer. We have to get \na competitive trade policy. We have to cut out the tax benefits \ncompanies have when they go overseas, and instead include tax benefits \nfor manufacturing in this country.\n  We have to straighten out many other items dealing with trade. There \nis no question that we have to say to the Export-Import Bank and the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation that they shall not finance any \nproduct that does not have at least 80 percent U.S. content; that we \nought to prohibit the sale in interstate commerce of any manufactured \nproduct by an individual 12 years of age or younger. We have to require \nthe Buy America provision not just in defense but in homeland security. \nWe have to get what Senator Dole tried to do 10 years ago with the \nWorld Trade Organization judicial body to review the WTO \ndeterminations. There are a lot of things we have proposed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article of mine from the State \nnewspaper in Columbia last week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the State, May 3, 2003]\n\n                 Washington's Wild Ways Choke Recovery\n\n                        (By Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       President Bush storms the country, lamenting that ``people \n     are looking for jobs and can't find them.'' Two big reasons: \n     First, industry is not about to invest or re-hire with \n     Washington spending like drunken sailors. Second, any \n     expansion of jobs will probably be in China, Mexico or India.\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\n       Business people look at how government does business. For \n     30 years, from 1945 to 1975, the sum total of government \n     deficits, including the costs of World War II, Korea and \n     Vietnam, amounted to $358 billion. Last year's fiscal \n     deficit--without the cost of Iraq--amounted to $428 billion.\n       Instead of levying taxes to pay for Iraq, the president \n     says: ``In time of war, a country runs deficits.'' False. The \n     United States raised taxes to pay for every war since the \n     Revolution--until now. President Lincoln put a tax on estates \n     and dividends to pay for the Civil War. This president says \n     to eliminate the tax on estates and dividends; the economy \n     needs stimulating.\n       We just had a $428 billion deficit, or stimulus, last year; \n     and this year's deficit (stimulus?) will exceed $500 billion. \n     A tax cut of $50 billion more is not going to stimulate. \n     What's more, the business executive sees on Page 4 of the \n     Republican Conference budget just passed that the national \n     debt in the next 10 years goes from $6 trillion to $12 \n     trillion.\n       Interest costs are headed through the roof. Economists at \n     the Federal Reserve have just estimated that each $100 \n     billion of deficit raises interest costs a quarter of one \n     percentage point. The Brookings Institute says interest costs \n     rise between one-half and one percentage point for every $100 \n     billion of deficits.\n       Interest rates will soar, and this is no time to invest or \n     re-hire. We have just lost 2.6 million jobs with the 2001 tax \n     cut stimulus, and there is no education in the second kick of \n     a mule.\n       Let's assume the Bush tax cut stimulates. Jobs created will \n     not be in Columbia, but in Shanghai. Corporate America's is \n     moving fast to cut labor and environmental costs. Before \n     opening Jones Manufacturing, U.S. law requires clean air, \n     clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum \n     wage, a safe workplace, safe machinery, plant closing \n     notice, parental leave, etc. A plant can locate in Mexico \n     for $2 an hour labor and none of these requirements--or to \n     China for less than 50 cents an hour.\n       Corporate America has banded together a conspiracy for \n     ``free trade'' to facilitate imports and export jobs faster \n     than we can create them. Led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     the conspiracy includes the Business Roundtable, National \n     Association of Manufacturers, Conference Board, think tanks, \n     funded universities, the retailers making bigger profits on \n     the imported articles and newspapers making most of their \n     profits from retail advertising, all for ``free trade.''\n       As a result, we have lost most of our hard manufacturing. \n     And now we have a $5 billion deficit in the balance of trade \n     in semiconductors and the worst trade deficit in farm \n     products in 16 years, including such products as cotton, with \n     China.\n       Free trade is an oxymoron. We must stop treating trade as \n     aid and compete in the global economy. We must first \n     eliminate the tax benefits for offshore production. Second, \n     prevent the Export Import Bank or Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation from financing any product that does not contain \n     at least 80 percent U.S. content. Third, prohibit the sale in \n     interstate commerce of any manufactured product by anyone \n     under 12 years of age. Fourth, require the Buy America \n     provisions for both the Defense Department and Homeland \n     Security. Fifth, eliminate the International Trade \n     Commission, which never finds ``injury'' from a dumping \n     violation. Sixth, return anti-dumping money to injured \n     parties. Seventh, reform the World Trade Organization dispute \n     settlements by establishing a panel of federal judges to \n     review WTO determinations.\n       In 1993 with a similar fiscal deficit and gross domestic \n     product, we cut spending and raised taxes, putting the \n     government on a pay-as-you-go basis. This resulted in the \n     strongest economy in the history of the United States. Eight \n     million jobs were created. Today, we must put government \n     again on a pay-as-you-go basis, reform trade and create jobs.\n       In addition to rebuilding Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq, now \n     is the time to rebuild America.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now is the time to sober up and approach it the way we \ndid in 1993. When Governor Clinton was first elected, he invited the \nbest of the best in financial minds to Little Rock. Greenspan went. The \nGovernor was advised: you are going to not only have to cut spending \nwhen you take office, you are going to have to raise taxes. And we did.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, said: I will \ngive you my home if this works. Newt Gingrich said: This is going to \nput us into a depression.\n  John Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said: I will \nchange parties and become a Democrat if this thing works. Oh, it was \ngoing to be disastrous.\n  The disaster turned out to be 8 years of the strongest economy. We \npaid the bills, putting Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. We created \n22 million jobs. Now with President Bush's voodoo 2 that we passed in \n2001, we are just more in debt. And the Democratic proposal just \nannounced is nothing but Bush lite. You can either have the Bush \nproposed program of $756 billion in tax cuts, or $550 billion in tax \ncuts from the House, or Bush lite of $150 billion. None of them are \ngoing to stimulate anything.\n  Since the President has taken office, the country has lost 2.6 \nmillion jobs already. Don't you think we ought to stop now and get a \nhold of ourselves and realize what we have with all of these deficits; \nthat interest rates are bound to go up, as well as the cost of a car, \nhome payments, the cost of a washing machine, the cost of a \nrefrigerator, and everything else? America is seeing this because back \nhome every mayor is having to cut back, every Governor is having to cut \nback. They are having to release prisoners from the penitentiary. They \nare having to charge children to ride on the schoolbus. They are doing \nany and everything to try to get fiscal discipline back into their \nparticular budgets.\n  But up here, we're like drunken sailors, saying oh, no, do not worry \nabout it. We have to get reelected next year. To dickens with the needs \nof the country. It is the needs of the campaign, and we have to have \ntax cuts. So there we go. We have a big argument around here whether it \nshould be $750 billion or $550 billion or $150 billion in tax cuts. And \nthe best of minds say: Wait a minute, we are in trouble.\n  As Mr. Samuelson says, we have financial stagnation. We have the \nthreat right this minute of deflation, and we are not creating jobs at \nall. We have a deficit in the balance of trade in not only hard \nmanufacturing, but in high tech, high tech the motor of growth.\n  Again, with respect to the service economy, the Wall Street Journal \nthis last week, said:\n\n       U.S. financial-services companies plan to transfer 500,000, \n     or 8 percent, of total industry employment to foreign \n     countries.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Wall Street \nJournal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 1, 2003]\n\n              The Economy: More Financial Jobs Go Offshore\n\n                         (By Michael Schroeder)\n\n       In an accelerating trend, U.S. financial-services companies \n     plan to transfer 500,000 jobs, or 8% of total industry \n     employment, to foreign countries during the next five years, \n     according to a new study.\n       Offshore job transfers have primarily focused on back-\n     office functions such as data entry, transaction processing \n     and call centers. But the job shift now is involving a wider \n     range of professional lines of work, including financial \n     analysis, regulatory reporting, accounting and graphic \n     design, according to A.T. Kearney, a management-consulting \n     subsidiary of Electronic Data Systems Corp.\n       The main reason remains the same: cost cutting. The study \n     estimates an annual cost savings of $30 billion for the \n     financial-services industry. A call-center employee earns \n     about $20,000 in the U.S. and about $2,500 in India. A Wall \n     Street researcher with a college business degree and a few \n     years experience can earn as much as $250,000, compared with \n     $20,000 in India.\n       The study was based on interviews in February and March \n     with senior executives from 100 of the largest U.S. banks, \n     brokerage firms, insurance companies and mutual funds. \n     Corporate chiefs list India as the most attractive country \n     overall for offshore business processing, followed by China, \n     the Philippines, Canada, the Czech Republic, Mexico, \n     Australia, Brazil, Ireland, Hungary and Russia.\n       China particularly should see significant growth, despite \n     U.S. companies' experience with the Chinese violating \n     intellectual-property laws. A.T. Kearney Managing Director \n     Andrea Bierce said that problem is being addressed by a major \n     U.S. insurer that is developing a new policy protecting \n     intellectual property.\n       Among the most aggressive U.S. companies are General \n     Electric Co.'s GE Capital Corp. unit, Citigroup Inc. and \n     American Express Co. GE Capital has nearly 15,000 employees \n     in India alone and plans to add 5,000 by year end, said \n     Stefan Spohr, one of the study's authors. A.T. Kearney itself \n     moved 50 jobs in creative-presentation service to India.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are going out of business, and the discussion here \nis between $350 billion and $550 billion in tax cuts, and all they want \nto know is who can do the most? I can go home next year and run for \nreelection and say: Look what I have done. I have given you a tax cut--\nwhen we do not have any taxes to cut. We are running a $600 billion \ndeficit in the Republican budget, when the Republicans are supposed to \nbe financially responsible.\n  We never heard of $600 billion deficits. You folks came to town and \nsaid, Look, we not only want a $600 billion\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\ndeficit, we want it each year, every year, for the next 10 years. It is \nthe budget on page 4. People don't see that.\n  I can see the Presiding Officer is going to call my time. He has been \nvery courteous. I will be glad to yield him time when he can take the \nfloor and answer these things because I have not been able to find a \ngood answer.\n  I am trying to sober them up. Let's put the Government on a pay-as-\nyou-go basis. Let's start getting competitive in industry and \nmanufacturing and create real jobs. Let's start rebuilding--not Bosnia, \nnot Afghanistan, not Iraq--but rebuilding the United States of America. \nThat is the need of the hour.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, are we in morning business at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct, until 12 noon.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5798-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5798-S5801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am here this morning to speak to the bill \nthat is now before us, S. 14, brought to the floor yesterday by Senator \nPete Domenici, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee of our Senate. It is a work product that a good many of us \nhave been involved in for well over 3 years, in looking at the issue \nprior to the Bush administration coming to town and certainly with the \ninitiative of the Bush administration to recognize the need for a \nnational energy policy and to produce for us an outline of their vision \nof a national policy and asking the Congress to work its will over the \nlast good number of years to produce that policy.\n  Of course, that came in the backdrop of brownouts and blackouts in \nCalifornia, of a jigsaw or certainly unprecedented ties or ups and \ndowns in the gas markets of our country and a real recognition that \nover the last good number of decades the Congress of the United States \nand our Government had not minded the energy store of our country very \nwell.\n  We were resting on the laurels of a relatively substantial surplus in \nelectrical energy--the ability to produce hydrocarbons here at home; be \nless dependent upon foreign oil; and, to watch all of that change with \nthe growth of our economy and some of the other government regulations \nthat denied or limited the ability to produce energy for our country.\n  We know during the decade of the 1990s we went into a mode of \nderegulating the electrical industry all in the name of spreading that \nsurplus out around the countryside but all based on the premise that \nyou could lower the cost to the consumer because, in fact, there was a \nsurplus.\n  Of course, during the decade of the 1990s we saw that surplus rapidly \ndisappear with the phenomenal growth we went through with the country \nand the fact we were not adding to the energy base of our country. I \nbelieve while consumers in the short term experienced some relief--and \nratepayers in the end--we saw price spikes, instability, brownouts, and \na greater concern about a constant, stable flow of energy--the high-\nquality kind that is critical to fuel an industry and making sure that \nit was available upon call and when necessary, something that in the \nlate 1990s and certainly at the turn of the decade was all in question.\n  That is one of the reasons we are here on the floor debating energy, \nand will be for the next several weeks in our effort to pass a \ncomprehensive energy policy that will promote the kind of production \nthat will advance conservation, and that will certainly promote the \nprotection of the environment and the production of clean energy. In \nall of that context, what is most significant is, in fact, the \nproduction area. We now know with our capabilities and our technologies \nthat we can produce it cleanly in a nonpolluting way, or certainly in a \nless impacting way to enhance the availability of supply.\n\n  One of the areas I have spent a good deal of time on over the last \nnumber of years is the issue of nuclear energy. Certainly during the \ndecades of the 1970s and the 1980s and into the 1990s there was a \nconcerted effort on the part of a variety of interests to argue that \nsomehow nuclear energy was not a safe form of energy; that it was one \nthat we ought to take out of our energy portfolio. What they failed to \nrecognize was that about 20 percent of our generating capacity is based \non nuclear energy. It really was a scare tactic to panic an uninformed \npublic, on the safety and the stability of nuclear energy, into a sense \nof urgency as related to eliminating nuclear energy. During that period \nof time as knowledge began to grow, another fact began to emerge out of \nall of these issues. That was that nuclear energy was rapidly becoming \na least cost part of our total energy package--that the cost of \nproduction was stable, that the reactors had operated very effectively, \nand that in retrofitting them, modernizing them, relicensing them, we \nwere extending their life and getting greater efficiency.\n  In the last spike in our electrical costs, the nuclear energy \nindustry--the electrical side of it--became the least cost producer of \nelectrical energy.\n  At the same time, we have not brought any new reactors on line. The \npublic and/or the interest groups have driven the costs by their \nconcern over the siting of them and the building of them. And the \nconstant demand of retrofitting them and building into them \ncomprehensive and redundant systems has driven the costs and the \nability to build one beyond the reach of the consumer and the \nratepayer, and, of course, therefore, the utilities.\n  Understanding that we continue to push forward not only to develop a \nwaste repository system to take the high-level waste out of the interim \nstorage facilities at these reactors, as we have promised the public we \nwould do, and move them to a permanent repository that is now sited and \nin the process of being licensed in Yucca Mountain in the deserts of \nNevada, but we also have opened up another geological repository at \nCarlsbad, NM, known as a waste isolation pilot plant that handles \ntransuranic waste--what I call ``garbage waste'', such as the tools and \nsmocks of nuclear workers. The WIPP facility takes waste from our \ndefense facilities, but the point is this facility has been operating \nfor a number of years and we have demonstrated that we can deal with \nthis type of waste safely.\n  This government has worked hard to keep good on its promise while \nthere are many who would deter it and try to deny those promises to the \nconsuming public, arguing that somehow we couldn't handle waste; \ntherefore, we shouldn't have new reactors, and, certainly, therefore, \nwe shouldn't build them if we couldn't manage the waste stream.\n  While all of that was going on, another issue began to emerge in the \ncontext of global concern. It was the issue of climate change. I will \nbe speaking to that in a few moments. But the issue of climate change \nbegan to be argued by many as a product of greenhouse gas emissions, \nand in part certainly produced by the emission of greenhouse gases from \nthe production of energy, and mostly electrical energy. While that \ngrew, it allowed many of us to argue that the ability to produce \nelectricity through a nuclear reactor was nonemitting, or an emission-\nfree system. That has clearly become recognized. I think many of our \nexperts now in the field of energy worldwide, as we see the need for \nenergy constantly growing, will admit that over the course of the \ndecades to come 20 percent of the electrical production, which is \nnuclear in this country, probably has to grow into 30 or maybe 40 \npercent of the total package to work to keep our air clean.\n\n  In France, I believe now nearly 80 percent of their electrical \ncapacity is nuclear. Many other countries are following that route. \nThey are managing their waste effectively and responsibly. It is also \ntrue in Japan. Here is a nation that not very long ago was most \nantinuclear for obvious reasons. But they came to recognize also that \nthe ability to produce electricity for a growing economy in their \ncountry could be produced safely by nuclear energy.\n  All of that realization and all of that work in part came together \nwith the\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\ncoming to town of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, \nand the selection of Spencer Abraham as our Secretary of Energy--all \nrecognizing that in the course of this we were going to have to get a \nnew reactor design and new concepts that would allow us to advance the \ncause of electrical generation through the nuclear industry.\n  As a result of that growing interest and as a result of all of the \nchanges that occurred in the world over the last several decades, and \nthe clear understanding that the energy we produce for today's market \nand future markets needs to be clean, there is a much better \nunderstanding of the role that can be played by the nuclear industry if \ncertain kinds of things are allowed to happen. I believe those certain \nkinds of things are new reactor designs--what we call new passive \ndesigns, those systems that are designed to shut themselves down \nautomatically if problems occur instead of to be activated manually by \nhuman operators. We believe--and the industry certainly believes--that \nall of that is highly possible today. There are models out there that \ndemonstrate that capability.\n  There are many in the scientific and engineering community who \nrecognize the validity of being able to do that. It is with that, and \nthe concept of new generations of reactor systems, that we began to \nlook at the potential of this country's building that kind of \nprototype--a generation IV, passive reactor system that is clean, that \nburns its fuel more efficiently, that is extremely robust in its \ncapabilities as it relates to safety and shutdown and, of course, in \nthe end, because of its efficiencies and fuel utilization, leaves less \nwaste compared to the old reactors.\n\n  Let me depart for a moment and tell you a story that I think most \nAmericans do not know about today. It occurred in my State of Idaho, at \na site now called the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory. At the beginning of Admiral Hyman Rickover's desire to \ncreate a nuclear Navy a good number of years ago, activities began to \nbe undertaken in the deserts of Idaho. Those activities related to the \ndevelopment of the prototype reactors to be put into the Nautilus \nsubmarine--a reactor that was small but efficient and powerful and safe \nfor operation and safe to live by, to live right beside.\n  Of course, we have seen the phenomenal growth of that capability over \nthe last good number of decades. We have become so good at building and \nengineering the reactors for our nuclear Navy today that a reactor that \nonce had to be fueled every few years now need not be fueled for the \ndesign life of the hull of the vessel itself. That is almost a hard \nconcept to imagine: that for a new nuclear Navy vessel today, when \nlaunched, and when its reactor is activated, that reactor will operate \nfor the life of the vessel--but that is what is going on today.\n  That engineering, that capability, that efficiency was developed in \nthe laboratories in Idaho. Of course, it is one of the great stories of \nenergy efficiency, of safety, and of the effective management of the \natom itself. It is that kind of technology that should be, and we hope \ncan be, applied to the commercial side of the atom today, that we can, \nin fact, build smaller, modular, flexible, passive reactors that, when \nfueled, continue to operate long term for the production of \nelectricity; and, of course, in doing that, to be immune from the price \nspikes in the marketplace that are based on the supply of fuel itself, \nbecause when that reactor is fueled and activated, it then continues to \noperate, at a flat cost, nearly for the lifetime of that fueling, which \ncould go on for a good number of years. That is a uniqueness that we \nthink we are now capable of producing in new reactor designs and new \nreactor concepts.\n  As all of this was developing, and this new interest was growing--and \ncertainly brought to the forefront by the Bush administration, as they \ncame to town and began to openly talk about the development of passive \nreactor concepts versus an administration that had just left town that \nworked actively trying to stop, to turn off, or to shut down the \nnuclear industry--other dynamics began to occur.\n  This is another unique dynamic that now fits into the whole concept \nof building a new nuclear reactor today: It is hydrogen, hydrogen fuel \ncells, and the ability to build clean hydrogen fuel cells that generate \nelectricity to operate our automobiles.\n  I have driven a hydrogen fuel cell automobile, as many of my \ncolleagues have, and they drive most effectively, except the prototype \nthat I was driving up in Dearborn, MI, costs about $6 million. Well, we \nknow that is out of the reach of the average citizen. However, we also \nunderstand that if this technology is applied to the transportation \nmarket as a whole, that there could come a day when my children and my \ngrandchildren will view it normal to go to the local car dealer and buy \na hydrogen fuel cell electric automobile at a competitive price in the \nmarket. That electric automobile will drive very efficiently, long \nterm, at low cost, and have zero emission.\n  This administration, once again, in pushing the envelope of energy \nand energy technology, has argued that this ought to be the \ntransportation fuel of the future, and we ought to begin to invest, \nincreasingly so, in this concept.\n  In S. 14, these concepts come full circle, and we begin to authorize \nthe investment substantially in the development of the hydrogen fuel \ncell--now, not just for the automobile, but the idea that there could \ncome a day when you could develop small, modular fuel cells for the \nindividual home, and they could run safely and easily and emission free \nfor long periods of time to generate electricity for a home site or a \nsmall business or a rural dwelling is very feasible with the \ndevelopment of that technology.\n  Here rests the problem: Most have said we will gain this hydrogen \nthrough natural gas, that natural gas can become the producer of \nhydrogen. The problem is, you are using one energy source to produce \nanother energy source. The efficiency of doing that makes it, in fact, \na very poor use of natural gas.\n  We have also seen the unwillingness of this Congress or some interest \ngroups to allow the exploration for natural gas and the expanded \ncapability of that production.\n  I spoke yesterday on the floor about the pumping back into the ground \nof billions of cubic feet of natural gas in Alaska. Why? Because there \nis no way of getting it to the lower 48 States without the development \nof a pipeline, a pipeline that is proposed and embodied in S. 14, for \nthe necessary purpose of supplying natural gas to the lower 48 states.\n  But the reality of the use of natural gas is that it ought not be \nused to produce hydrogen, and it ought not be used to fire gas turbines \nto generate electricity. Efficiency-wise, that is a poor use of natural \ngas. Natural gas ought to be used for the purposes of space heating. \nThat is where it is the most efficient, and in an industry where it can \nbe used for certain processing purposes. That is where natural gas \nfinds its highest efficiencies.\n  If we want to develop a hydrogen transportation fuel industry--and \nnatural gas is not necessarily the best source of hydrogen--how do we \nget it? How do we push that envelope to supply an abundant source of \nhydrogen to a marketplace that may well grow to fuel the fuel cells \nthat will generate the electricity that will propel the modern car 20 \nor 30 years or 40 years from now? You can do it through using \nelectricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen--a process known as \nelectrolysis. You can do it through the use of electricity in a much \nmore efficient way than you can with the use of natural gas.\n  What do you use in electrolysis? You use water. So not only do you \nhave an abundant resource that can be converted, but it can be \nconverted in a very clean way into a gas that, when utilized, produces \nno emissions into the atmosphere.\n  Is this a dream? No, not at all. It is a reality, and we know that. \nIt is a reality within the engineering capabilities of this country and \nthe industries embodied in the energy field. We know that is a \ncapability.\n  How do I jump from nuclear to hydrogen? I want to bring both of those \ntogether this morning because what we believe is that a generation IV \npassive reactor of the kind we are proposing be built as an \nexperimental prototype by our Government, and one that is proposed and \nauthorized in this S. 14 comprehensive energy policy for our country, \nalso has built in it a system to\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\nproduce hydrogen. The idea is that we can, in fact, get two for one, \nand we can design safe nuclear reactors today, or passive nuclear \nreactors today, that are capable of having within them a system that \nsplits water to produce hydrogen for the future transportation market \nof our country. This concept is something that is so exciting to me and \nought to be exciting for our country.\n  To think that we have the capability of moving ourselves that much \nfurther forward is an opportunity. I liken this uniqueness, this \napplication of science and engineering and technology, to something \nalmost as important as the space program was decades ago. It is what \nGovernment ought to be doing, ought to be using its resources for--to \npush the envelope of technology forward and to allow the kinds of \ndevelopments in technology that the private sector can then take and \neffectively use--because the private sector cannot afford to invest the \nhundreds of millions of dollars that it ultimately will require to \ndevelop this kind of technology. This long term technology development \ndoes not have the immediate payback return on it and so if we leave it \nall to industry it simply will not happen for a long period of time.\n  Embodied in S. 14 are the provisions that would authorize exactly \nwhat I am talking about today, a new reactor design for our country, a \ndesign that has within it the capability of the production of hydrogen \nthrough electrolysis, and to me that is a tremendously exciting \nconcept. That is why I believe S. 14 is important legislation. A press \nperson stopped me the other day and asked: How is President Bush doing \non his domestic agenda? One of this President's No. 1 items, or top two \nor three, in his domestic agenda is a national energy policy. A lot has \ntaken that issue off the headlines the last number of years--from the \nissue of 9/11 to terrorism to the war in Iraq. But underlying all of \nthat and always important for the productivity of an economy, for the \nfuture of a Nation, is an abundant energy supply.\n\n  Through all of that, we have found just how fragile our energy \nsupplies are. We are now nearly 60 percent dependent for our oil supply \non foreign countries. We have in our infrastructure of electrical \nproduction aging facilities and transmission that is not effectively \nbeing replaced to sustain the quality of electricity we have.\n  As soon as this country begins to get back into the 3, 4, 5 percent \ngrowth rates we hope to see in the near future, we will find once again \na lack of supply because we are not producing it or, if we are trying \nto produce it, we are trying to use gas through electrical turbines. \nThe pricing of that is yet to be determined because of our inability to \nproduce a more abundant supply of natural gas.\n  All of those issues fit together, and the American public, I hope, \nwill be allowed to focus on that with us as we debate these issues \nembodied within S. 14.\n  S. 14 is a bill that was written the right way. It was written by the \nauthorizing committee on Energy and Natural Resources, a combination of \nideas that have worked their way through the process, that came to that \ncommittee to be crafted into legislation in a bipartisan way. \nAmendments were offered. Some were voted up; some were voted down. Most \nimportantly, the process the American people respect and ask for was \nallowed to effectively work.\n  The energy bill we had on the floor a year and a half ago was not \nwritten by committee, but by a couple of individuals in the majority \nleader's office. The bill we have on the floor today was in fact \ncrafted by the responsible committee of the Senate. I hope we can \ndebate it thoroughly, amend it, if necessary, and ultimately get it \ninto a conference with the legislation the House has passed so we can \nput it on our President's desk for his signature as a national energy \npolicy for the country.\n  I have talked about a few provisions of the policy I believe are \ntremendously important. Let me speak to one other I believe is \nimportant as we work our way toward the development of a comprehensive \npolicy.\n  Many of us have been through what is known as the Kyoto debate, a \ndebate on climate change, an argument that the production of greenhouse \ngases is in fact creating a greenhouse effect that has created global \nwarming. There are some who believe that emphatically. Others say the \nscience simply does not bear that out today, that while our world may \nbe getting warmer, it is not necessarily believed it is the greenhouse \ngases or the emission of those that is causing it. The obvious reason \nfor that argument is clear. Historically, over the millions and \nmillions of years of our timetable for the world, we have seen this \nglobe get cold, get warm, and go through a variety of changes. There \nwill be some who argue the changes we are experiencing today are in \nfact a product of that magnitude of geological change. I am one who has \nargued on the side of science.\n\n  Others found this to be a rather nifty political idea and have \ngenerated the politics of it, arguing that, my goodness, the world was \ngoing to come to an end and the ice cap on the Antarctic was going to \nmelt and shorelines were going to move inland hundreds of feet, if all \nof this ice melted in the world today, and that could all be stopped if \nwe would simply stop emitting the greenhouse gases produced by the \nburning of fossil fuels.\n  If we were to do that, because that is what would be required, if we \nknew in fact our globe was warming and we knew it was warming because \nof the emission of greenhouse gases, that is something this country \nwould rush to do. However, it would also rush to convince the rest of \nthe world to do it with them and in a way that would find alternative \nsources of energy. We would want to do that based on the very best \nscience available, to use the modeling that could be produced by the \nsupercomputers to bring about those kinds of judgments. We really would \nbe talking about turning the light switches of our country off, unless \nwe were willing to shift dramatically to new sources of energy in a \nrelatively short time.\n  I am one who believes the science is not yet there to argue those \nkinds of changes. In fact, the Clean Air Act has produced a much \ncleaner environment, and we have on board current policies today that \nare continually reducing the amount of greenhouse gas produced per \ncapita individual in our country as compared with other countries. We \nare contributing in a major way today to the improvement of the world \nenvironment. But we are a big country. We are big in the sense of the \nuse of energy. We are the largest country in the world when it comes to \nthe use of energy, and it is because of our wealth and because of the \nsize of our economy. So when you examine the amount of greenhouse gas \nproduced per capita individual, we still remain high, at the top of the \nlist.\n  There are other countries today who have demonstrated little concern \nabout the emission of greenhouse gas in their building of an economy. \nChina, India, other countries, Third World emerging nations working \nhard to produce an economy to put their people to work. They have paid \nlittle regard to the environment. In fact, in the debate at the Kyoto \nclimate change conference, the interests driving the conference said: \nWe can just exclude developing countries because they can't comply. \nThey are not advanced enough, and we couldn't get them to comply, \nanyway. Yet they have become major producers of greenhouse gases.\n  If you believe that in fact emissions of greenhouse gases are \ncreating the kind of climate change some would argue is going on, then \ncertainly the developing countries ought to be included. Why should we \nshut ourselves down and allow other countries to increasingly become \npolluters, allow them to be extremely competitive in the economic \nmarketplace, when we have denied ourselves that kind of competitiveness \nbecause we have driven our cost of production up dramatically by new \nenergy sources?\n  That is all part of a fairly general summary of the debate that has \ngone on here in the Senate and across the country and the world for the \nlast number of years. I have attended a conference of the parties at \nThe Hague related to climate change. That was the attitude of the rest \nof the world, that the United States economy was the bad actor \nproducing all of the greenhouse gases, and we should just shut the \nUnited States' economy down or we should demand that the United States \nchange its ways dramatically.\n  What they were not saying was: We also will consider making a similar\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\nchange in our country, as long as our cost of production remains \nrelatively low.\n  The reason they will not say this is that they want their \ncompetitiveness in the world economy to rapidly increase compared to \nthat of the United States. That became part of all of that debate. I, \nalong with Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel, some years ago developed a \nresolution that got 95 votes in the Senate suggesting that this country \nought not go it alone when it came to climate change, and it certainly \nought not proceed without good science; and we ought to build the \nsystems that produce the science that allow those of us who shape \npublic policy to make decisions based on the best science--I am talking \nlab science, not political science.\n\n  The climate change debate has been a good deal about the politics of \nthe environment rather than the reality of the change itself, or what \nis producing the change and the science involved. This administration \nhas said: Let's err on the side of science. Let's make sure we have an \nambitious effort to get where we need to get, relating to climate \nchange. We are not going to ignore it. We are going to be sensitive to \nit, but we are going to make sure that what we do is done right.\n  It just so happens that the nuclear initiative I have just talked \nabout fits nicely into that equation of beginning to produce more and \nmore of our electrical power from a nonemitting fuel source. The \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicle concept that I am talking about is, again, \nanother clean technology. So while we are pushing the envelope of \ntechnology, we clearly ought to be building the scientific base to be \nable to make the decision as to how much further our economy and our \ncountry ought to go towards zero emissions into the environment in the \nname of climate change.\n  Those are awfully important issues, and they are some this country \ncannot deny or sidestep. But until we have the best science available, \nuntil we are using our own modeling, based on our own supercomputers, \nand we are not using the modeling with the Canadian bias, or a German \nbias, the kind of modeling that is producing the science that we are \nlooking at today because we don't have our own, then shame on us for \nnot developing it, for not using our own science and our own scientists \nto make sure that the science from which we base our decision is the \nright science. As I have said, the consequence is to produce an economy \nin which the American worker is no longer competitive or productive as \nit relates to other workers around the world. If that becomes the case, \nwe slowly put our economy and our country at a tremendous disadvantage.\n  The great advantage we have always had as a country is the \navailability of an abundant energy supply. It is from that energy \nsupply, which in most instances costs less than a comparable form \nanywhere else in the world, that we have built the greatest economy the \nworld has ever seen, that we have put more people to work, that we have \ngenerated more wealth, and we have created a standard of living that \nall of us are proud of, and that we have provided for ourselves and our \ncitizens truly the American dream.\n  Was it all based on energy? It all was based on the availability of \nenergy as a major component of that industrial base, that economic \nbase. It was certainly also based on the free market system and the \ncompetitive character of that and the innovation that occurred through \nthat. But along the way, Government effectively used itself and the \nresources of the American taxpayer to push the technology, lift the \nhorizons of experimentation that, in a way, ultimately brought that to \nthe ground for use by the consuming public and to be generated in the \nprivate sector.\n  That is what S. 14, in large part, is about. It is about the grand, \nnew designs of new concepts that deal with large production. It is \nabout the grand, new utilization of wind turbines and photovoltaics, \nand certainly the type of energy that is extremely clean and can \nprovide a portion of energy to our energy basket. It is about making \nour current forms of energy even cleaner by advancing the technologies \navailable, to give the tax incentives to effectively use the regulatory \ndevice to do so, and also not to deny ourselves the continued \nproduction of energy from our public lands and resources, and to do so \nin clean, environmentally sound ways that we now have the technology to \nutilize, because we pioneered it.\n\n  The world uses our technology today to produce clean energy. We are \ndenying ourselves the use of our own talent. This very comprehensive \nenergy bill will advance our cause as a country in the world, and in \nthe area of energy technology dramatically. That which we produce for \nourselves is also available to the rest of the world. It is not nor \nshould it ever be ignored that even in China today, as it works to \nbuild new energy technologies, it is using the technology that we \ndeveloped to produce energy for itself. Now we are wanting to push that \nenvelope of technology even further, in a more aggressive approach that \nis environmentally benign and clean and productive for our general \neconomy.\n  So a good deal of work has gone into the legislation. Now we will \nwork our will on the floor of the Senate with different amendments that \ncompete with some of the concepts I have talked about and, in some \ninstances, would like to deny them altogether. We will vote it, I hope, \nup or down within the next few weeks. I believe it will pass and we \nwill move it to a conference with the House and then ultimately to the \nPresident's desk. All of that happens when the President signs this \ninto law and public policy.\n  I think the Senate and the Congress of the 108th can be proud of the \nwork it has done on this energy bill. We can look forward into the \nfuture for generations of Americans and say we have redesigned the \nfoundation, reshaped the context of a national energy strategy for our \ncountry. As this policy is implemented, it will allow that continuation \nof an abundant supply of a variety of forms of energy that in the past, \ntoday, and in the future will feed an ever-growing economy that \ncontinues to grant the average American citizen access to the American \ndream. That is what we are about. That is what good public policy ought \nto be about.\n  I believe S. 14 embodies a great deal of that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are still in morning business. I note \nthat no other colleagues are yet on the floor. I will speak again in \nmorning business, but only briefly this time, as it relates to the \nissue before us and the protocol for the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization and the ascendency to that organization of Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n  As we began to expand NATO a good number of years ago, I had voted \nagainst some of the early expansions because I did not think we had yet \neffectively designed our role in a post-cold-war era and a post-Soviet \nUnion era and about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as it \nrelates to what it would be doing in the future. As we have seen that \nrole adjust and change over the last several years, certainly the \nactivity in the Balkans and the ability of NATO to participate there in \nbringing stability to that region has played an increasing role.\n  I have also been concerned that as NATO grew, we effectively changed \nour posture there and, in fact, even reduced some of our presence \nthere.\n  I had the opportunity during the Easter break to travel to Romania. \nRomania, in a few years, will be eligible for and will make application \nfor entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. With the growth \nand development of the European Union and, of course, NATO itself, it \nis important, I believe, that we continue to expand its role and \nreshape its presence on the European Continent.\n  We will have before us Executive Calendar No. 6, Treaty Document 108-\n04, bringing these countries in to NATO\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\nwhich is an important expression on the part of this country of support \nof these countries. They are struggling mightily as they emerge from \nbehind the Iron Curtain, as new democracies of Central and Eastern \nEurope shaping their own economies, to put their people to work, to \nassume their role in the European Community.\n  Many of these emerging countries, new democracies, were also very \nsupportive of the coalition of Great Britain, Spain, and the United \nStates in our recent effort in Iraq. They recognize the importance of \nstability. They also were the subject of a form of dictatorship in \ncommunism and control and their disappearance behind the Iron Curtain \nand within the Soviet Union for over 45 years. They appreciate the \nright of free people to shape their countries and their economies, \nprobably more so than any other country around the globe today because \nthey are newly freed nations.\n  I think it is important, in dealing with this effectively, as we \ndebate it this afternoon and tomorrow, to understand that it is a role \nwe play in cooperation with the European Community today and we will \ncontinue to have a strong role in NATO, but one that I think deserves \nto be redefined as the new emerging democracies of Europe become \nmembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  I am very excited about the opportunity for them. I was extremely \nexcited to see what they are doing in Romania today and the hard work \nthat is going on there to shape a new country, to build an economy, and \nto get their people back to work and out from under the old government \nbureaucracies of communism, and to recognize there really is a \nmarketplace and there really is representative government and that free \npeople can be phenomenally inventive, creative, and geniuses when they \nare free to the market, free to the profit incentive.\n  Romania clearly has that opportunity. I was over there on a different \nmission than to deal with NATO. I was there on a mission for children. \nI am the chairman of the Congressional Coalition on the Adoption \nInstitute. As Romania was emerging, we know there were a good number of \naccusations over the past years, following the dictatorship of \nCeausescu and when the world got a chance to see inside Romania, about \nhow they were handling their orphans and children who had no families.\n  I began to work through the Adoption Institute for the ratification \nof the Hague Treaty which developed an international protocol that all \nnations we hope will conform to as to how they deal with their children \nand how they deal with intercountry adoption within a process that \nmakes it transparent, legitimate, and legal so there is no trafficking \nof children.\n  Romania has been accused of such activity. As a result of that, the \nPresident of Romania and their parliament decided to put a moratorium \non intercountry adoption for a time. It caught a number of Americans \nwho were in the process of adopting Romanian children midstream in \nthose adoptions. They are working very hard at this moment, if you \nwill, to clean up their act. They have excellent people working now to \nreform the whole of child care in Romania. We saw great examples of \nthat.\n  They are also working to make sure they are in full compliance with \nthe protocol of the Hague Treaty and to build a transparency into the \nsystem and to effectively register the agencies that function in the \nareas of adoption.\n  In the course of all of that discussion, and in visiting with nearly \nall of the elected officials of Romania, certainly the president, the \nprime minister, defense ministers, and others, they recognize all of \nthese issues go hand in glove as they emerge into an environment where \nthey can become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and \nultimately a member of the European Union. Of course, for them and for \ntheir country, their economy, and their citizenry, this is an ever-\nimportant process, an important march and journey that the country of \nRomania is on.\n  That is certainly true in the broad sense of all of the countries I \njust mentioned that are now looking for acceptance into the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization. It is important we speak to that. A good \ndeal more will be said certainly by Senators Warner, Levin, Roberts and \nothers, along with Senator Dodd, as we deal with this issue and vote on \nthis particular Executive Calendar number.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5802-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5802-S5803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DOUBLE TAXATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, since we are still in morning business, I \nwill speak a few more moments until another of my colleagues asks for \ntime.\n  Because it is time sensitive, I thought I would talk for a few \nmoments about the issue of double taxation of dividends that is \ncurrently before our Finance Committee and certainly is a major \ncomponent of our President's stimulus package.\n  Some weeks ago, before the Special Committee on Aging that I chair, \nwe looked at this issue as it relates to older Americans. I found it \nfascinating that 71 percent of all taxable cash dividends are received \nby Americans age 55 and older. Dividend income benefits older workers \nand seniors who worked very hard throughout their working life, \nsacrificed, saved, and invested in stocks, and in their senior years \nwere most assuredly concerned that those stocks were dividend \nproducers.\n  Unfortunately, dividend income is taxed twice--we know that--once at \nthe company level and then again at the individual level. In effect, it \ncertainly punishes older Americans for taking personal responsibility \nin their lives to save and build a little nest egg as a part of their \ntotal retirement.\n  This pie chart demonstrates that very clearly. Dividend penalties are \nreceived by more than half of all of our seniors. This pie chart shows \nthat 52 percent of seniors receive taxable dividends. Nine million \nseniors are age 65 and older, many on fixed incomes, and rely on a \nlittle dividend income. The average dividend income for these seniors \nis over $4,000 a year, and that is very significant to a retired person \nliving on a fixed income.\n  That is one of the reasons our President put this idea forth. But it \nis only one reason. The economists who we had before the Special \nCommittee on Aging talked about a lot of other issues embodied in this \nconcept.\n  When our President first proposed it, there were a good many who \nsaid: Why this? How could this be stimulative to the economy? As those \ncritics began to examine what our President proposed and put it in a \ncomputer model to see what kind of stimulative effect it might have, \nthey began to recognize that it might have considerable effects.\n  Economists are now suggesting it would reduce the cost of business \ninvestment by 10 to 25 percent. In other words, the cost of capital \nthat businesses require to build plants and create jobs could be \nreduced by as much as 25 percent. And, in fact, they would be removed \nfrom basically a 71-percent net tax bracket in which dividends or \nprofits of corporations find themselves.\n  I find it interesting that we are the country of the free enterprise \nsystem, we are the country of big business, in which the rest of the \nworld wants to invest, generating and creating the jobs on which so \nmany of our workers depend--and at the same time we tax our profits \nfrom these businesses at nearly 71 percent. We tax them in combination \ntwice, once at the corporate level and once at the individual level.\n  We are now beginning to find increased business investment that would \nresult and have a tremendous stimulative effect on our economy and \nwould boost the technology side of spending in our country. That is one \nof the very areas that help is so directly needed.\n  Most technology companies depend on purchases made by the industries \nmost likely to pay dividends. It is the growth generating effect of the \ntwo in combination that is so important. These industries include \nmanufacturing, banking, insurance, transportation, communications, and \nother sectors. All of them currently are flat or growing very slowly.\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n  The strength of these industries depends on boosting their business \ninvestment. If these industries are strong and are buying the new \ntechnologies of the country, then our technology side also begins to \nstrengthen. Of course, increased use of technology by workers improves \nworker productivity.\n\n  You have to get the marketplace working and you have to get \ninvestment back into the market to increase productivity. Productivity \nis the ultimate source of economic prosperity.\n  While it will tremendously benefit seniors--and these are statistical \nfacts on which we all agree--what we are really talking about is jobs. \nWhat the American people are questioning and asking for right now is \njob creation, and we are playing politics with an awfully important \nissue that can have the effect of stimulating the economy, bringing \ninvestment into the economy, and creating those jobs that the American \npeople are extremely concerned about today. Technology, the application \nof investment into these fields, ratchets upwards and does exactly what \nwe want it to do, producing higher levels of productivity and driving \nwages higher for all of our citizens. It is an economic combination \nthat works well.\n  It is interesting that the economic critics are quiet because they \nhave done their modeling and they have seen the positive, job creating \neffect of ending the double taxation of dividends. It is now the \npolitical critics who step forward saying we cannot do this kind of \nthing. Of course, if one is a critic of the issue and their political \nadvantage requires that somebody ought to fail who has put this issue \nforward, then denying this economy the ability to grow is certainly in \nthe forefront of their concern.\n  The argument is deficits and spending, that government does not \ncreate jobs, it just spends a lot of money. Yes, ending the dividend \npenalty can have an effect, and I talked earlier this morning about the \neffect of technology and the application of technology once it is well \ndeveloped in areas where the public sector cannot go.\n  That ultimately will create jobs when it is applied in the private \nsector, but certainly the kind of spending we are talking about as it \nrelates to government is not what generates jobs. What will generate \njobs and what most of us have come to realize can generate jobs--is an \neffective economic stimulus package that does not double tax, that does \nnot penalize profit-seeking, and that does allow a reduction in the \ncost of capital by as much as 10 to 25 percent.\n  In my State of Idaho, employment decreased by 6,000 workers last \nyear, and we are not a big State. Earlier this year, Micron, one of my \nlarger employers, announced a plan to lay off 1,000 people. Zilog, a \nCalifornia company employing a number of people, closed its doors. The \ndividend taxation is, in part, something that can change this equation \neffectively and, I think, responsibly. I hope the Finance Committee can \nbring a stimulus package to the floor that has the elimination of \ndouble taxation as a centerpiece to the total package that we will be \nvoting on here in the next couple of weeks.\n\n  I see my colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nsenior Senator from Utah, is now on the floor. I will yield the floor \nso he has adequate time to speak. I thank my colleagues for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his excellent \nremarks. My colleague from Idaho has been a formidable force in the \nSenate for many years and he has done a terrific job, and these \nparticular remarks I agree with and associate myself with.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5803-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5803-S5805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE LOOMING SUPREME COURT BATTLE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments this morning \nto share with my colleagues an article that recently appeared in the \nWashington Times about what may happen if there is a Supreme Court \nvacancy this year. I hope this article is wrong because it will be a \nsad day for America if its predictions come true. But I am going to \ntalk about this article because I think its predictions might come true \nin this bitter, partisan Senate that exists today.\n  This article, written by James L. Swanson of the Cato Institute, is \nentitled, Forthcoming Clash for the Court. Let me take a moment to \nshare with my colleagues the dire forecast this article sets forth. It \nbegins:\n\n       At the Supreme Court of the United States, October Term \n     2002 is drawing to a close. The justices hear their last oral \n     arguments on April 30, and in late June they will take to the \n     bench for the last time to announce their final opinions of \n     the term. Court watchers await decisions in several important \n     cases, including free-speech and affirmative-action issues, \n     which may not come down until the last day of the term. But \n     that is not the only reason why court watchers have circled \n     the last week in June on the calendar. That is when \n     oddsmakers are betting on the retirement of at least one \n     member of the court.\n       For months, pundits have speculated that Chief Justice \n     William H. Rehnquist, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor or Justice \n     John Paul Stevens will step down this year. Why?\n       Because justices traditionally retire under the political \n     party that appointed them, and this is the last chance for \n     these three Republican appointees to retire during President \n     Bush's first term with the assurance that he can fill a \n     vacancy before the 2004 election.\n       Because, in the case of the chief justice, he has, in three \n     decades of service, gone from lone dissenter to leader of the \n     court's return to the first principles of limited government \n     and federalism, and will go down as one of the most important \n     chief justices in history.\n\n  I agree with that assessment. I agree the author is right on that. \nChief Justice Rehnquist has been a remarkable chief justice and the \nCourt has done some remarkable things under his leadership. But the \narticle goes on to say:\n\n       Because, in the case of Justice O'Connor, the press spread \n     rumors that she wanted to retire.\n       Because, in the case of Justice Stevens, he is 83 years \n     old.\n\n  Both are excellent people and excellent leaders. Let me go on:\n\n       It is impossible to know whether these or any other members \n     of the Supreme Court are planning to retire this year. Many \n     self-styled experts have embarrassed themselves by attempting \n     to predict a justice's vote in a single case, let alone a \n     retirement from the bench. Nor is this to suggest that any \n     of the nine justices should retire. The performance of the \n     oldest justice (John Paul Stevens), to the youngest \n     (Clarence Thomas), of the longest serving (William H. \n     Rehnquist) to the briefest (Stephen Breyer), reveals that \n     all remain able and engaged. Their written opinions \n     confirm that none has suffered an intellectual decline. \n     One may disagree with their views, but not their \n     competence to serve. If a retirement comes, it will occur \n     because the justice wants to step down, not because he or \n     she has to.\n       It might not happen until the end of June. But it could \n     also happen tomorrow. Justices Potter Stewart, Warren E. \n     Burger and Thurgood Marshall waited until the end of their \n     final terms and made June announcements. But Byron White and \n     Harry Blackmun announced their retirements early, on March 3, \n     1993, and April 6, 1994, respectively, to give President \n     Clinton ample time to nominate their successors, Ruth Bader \n     Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, and to win Senate confirmation \n     by, in both cases, the beginning of August.\n       Although it is impossible to know if or when a vacancy will \n     occur, one thing is easy to predict: how Democrats will \n     respond to Mr. Bush's first nomination of a Supreme Court \n     justice. Senate Democrats, in combination with a cabal of \n     special interest groups, intend to politicize the Supreme \n     Court and oppose any Bush nominee, regardless of who the \n     nominee is. History, both recent and reaching back to the \n     Reagan and first Bush presidencies, offers little \n     encouragement that the Senate will conduct itself \n     professionally and responsibly.\n       The pattern emerged over time: the Democrats' defeat of \n     Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the court in 1987; their \n     near-killing of Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination in 1991; \n     their rage against the Supreme Court for ``handing'' the \n     presidency to the Republicans in the 2000 election; the \n     notorious Washington Post op-ed by Abner Mikva (former \n     Clinton White House counsel and retired U.S. Court of Appeals \n     judge) calling on the Senate to block any Supreme Court \n     nominations by President Bush; their bottling up superbly \n     qualified appellate court nominees for nearly two years on \n     the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee; their \n     obsession with Roe vs. Wade and their imposition of \n     ideological litmus tests; their celebration of the American \n     Bar Association seal of approval as the ``gold standard''--\n     until the ABA began giving many of Mr. Bush's nominees the \n     highest possible rating; their filibustering of the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals in \n     Washington to prevent an up or down vote even after a \n     majority of senators announced that they will vote to confirm \n     him; their threatened filibuster against Texas Supreme Court \n     Justice Priscilla Owen for a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n       That history, and more, exposes what Democrats will do to \n     fight a Bush Supreme\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n     Court nomination. The attack will be waged on two fronts, one \n     substantive, the other procedural.\n       The substantive attack will have six parts.\n       Retirement day blitzkrieg. If the retiring justice is a \n     Republican, and gives the White House advance, confidential \n     notice of his or her intention to retire, as Chief \n     Justice Warren Burger did in 1986, the president will have \n     an opportunity to announce a retirement and a nomination \n     on the same day. Within one hour of that nomination, a \n     leading Democratic senator, probably Tom Daschle, Edward \n     Kennedy, Patrick Leahy or Charles Schumer, will attack the \n     nominee's character, integrity or competence. (Recall Mr. \n     Kennedy's outburst within 45 minutes of President Reagan's \n     nomination of Judge Bork: ``Robert Bork's America is a \n     land in which women would be forced into back-alley \n     abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, \n     rogue policemen could break down citizen's doors in \n     midnight raids, school children could not be taught about \n     evolution, writers and artists could be censured at the \n     whim of government.'') Sundry left wing ``public \n     interest'' (actually, special interest) groups will join \n     the chorus. The purpose of the first day blitzkrieg is to \n     set the president and the nominee reeling on their heels \n     and destroy the momentum of the nomination. The blitzkrieg \n     aims to spin that night's TV coverage and the next \n     morning's newspaper stories.\n       The paper blizzard. Within hours of the nomination, \n     senators and special interest groups will inundate the press \n     with letters, reports, memos and even small books that \n     purport to expose the unfitness of the nominee. In many \n     cases, those scripts have already been written. For more than \n     two years, Democrats have been doing ``opposition research,'' \n     as though preparing for a political campaign, to uncover \n     damaging information on the 10 to 15 people rumored to be on \n     the president's short list for the court. The purpose of the \n     paper blizzard is to turn public opinion against the nominee \n     long before the Senate Judiciary Committee even convenes a \n     hearing on the nomination.\n       The indictment. The paper blizzard will include some or all \n     of the following accusations: The nominee is not \n     ``sensitive'' to the rights of women, children, black \n     Americans and other racial minorities, the disabled, workers, \n     unions, farmers, native Americans and others. The nominee is \n     ``out of the mainstream'' of the American legal tradition; is \n     too ``right wing''; is even ``radical.'' (Democrats perfected \n     their use of those smear tactics against Judge Bork, stooping \n     so low as to suggest he might not believe in God. Apparently \n     a godless conservative is even more dangerous than a god-\n     fearing one.) With much hand-wringing, Democrats will cry \n     crocodile tears, sighing ``if only the president had \n     nominated a moderate conservative, we would be delighted to \n     confirm him or her.''\n\n  We have seen that lately in just regular nominations. You can imagine \nwhat is going to happen with the Supreme Court nomination.\n\n       If the nominee does not have an extensive body of scholarly \n     writings, Democrats will tar him as a ``stealth'' candidate, \n     who possesses hidden and alarming views. If, on the other \n     hand, the nominee has written extensively, those writings \n     will be denounced as ``out of the mainstream.''\n\n  Remember that phrase. We have seen a lot of it around here in recent \ntimes on current nominees, who have had unanimous well qualified \nratings from the gold standard of the Democrats, the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Mr. Swanson goes on to say:\n\n       If the nominee believes in a color-blind society and equal \n     treatment under the laws, and questions the constitutionality \n     of race-conscious policies called affirmative action by some, \n     then of course the nominee is a ``racist'' who will want to \n     ``turn back the clock'' on civil rights, overturn Brown vs. \n     Board of Education, repeal the 13th, 14th and 15th \n     Amendments, and reintroduce slavery.\n\n  Mr. Swanson is very colorful in some of his remarks, but we have \nactually seen this type of treatment of Republican nominees.\n  Mr. Swanson goes on to say:\n\n       Beyond attacking the nominee personally, the paper blizzard \n     will suggest that he or she represents a so-called \n     transformative appointment who will upset the alleged \n     delicate balance of the court. Some Democrats will seek cover \n     by claiming that they have nothing against the nominee, he or \n     she is just the wrong person at the wrong time for the best \n     interests of the court and the country.\n\n  We have actually seen that in the months since January, and on other \noccasions, with the same arguments being used against people with \nunanimous well qualified recommendations from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Mr. Swanson goes on to say:\n\n       Rancorous hearings. Mr. Bush's first nominee to the court \n     should not expect a cordial reception from Democrats on the \n     Judiciary Committee. They will attempt to grill the nominee \n     for three to six days. They will ask hundreds of questions. \n     Many hostile witnesses will be called. Special interest \n     groups will haunt the hearing room and loiter in the halls, \n     murmuring against the nominee and handing out attack \n     literature.\n       The partisan committee vote. For the Democrats, the \n     hearings are mainly for show and to posture before the \n     cameras for their constituencies and the left-wing special \n     interest groups. They will have already decided their vote \n     before the hearing begins or the nominee speaks one word. Of \n     course that vote is ``no.'' Because Republicans are a \n     majority on the committee, the nomination will be reported to \n     the Senate favorably by a party-line vote.\n       The Senate vote. Once the Judiciary Committee reports the \n     nomination to the full Senate, Democrats opposing the \n     nomination will continue to fight it on the floor by \n     insisting on a lengthy debate. Then they will try to persuade \n     their colleagues to vote against the nominee. Ultimately they \n     will lose. The president's nominee will be confirmed because \n     the Republican majority, plus a number of responsible \n     Democrats, will vote to confirm him. If there is a vote, that \n     is.\n       Along with their substantive attack on the nominee, \n     Democrats will mount a procedural attack. That plan has two \n     elements.\n       Delay the Judiciary Committee hearing. Upon making a \n     nomination, the president will ask Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Orrin Hatch to schedule hearings by early July, with \n     the goal of having a Senate floor vote by late July or early \n     August. Democrats on the committee will vigorously oppose \n     that goal and attempt to delay the hearing until September. \n     They will bleat that there must be no ``rush to judgment,'' \n     and claim that they require months to ``study'' the nominee. \n     Their ability to stall Judge Bork's hearings until September \n     contributed to the nomination's defeat. Democrats and the \n     special interest groups had all summer to mobilize their \n     onslaught against Judge Bork. The White House failed to \n     anticipate the viciousness of the assault and was taken off \n     guard. Because the Republicans now control the committee, the \n     Democrats will find it harder to stall the hearings.\n       The filibuster trump card. When all else fails to cow the \n     president's nominee into withdrawing, when the Democrats have \n     been unable to stall the Judiciary Committee hearing, when \n     they can't stop the committee from reporting the nomination \n     favorably to the full Senate, after they fail to turn \n     mainstream America against the nominee, when they count heads \n     and discover that a majority of senators, including many \n     Democrats, intend to vote to confirm the president's nominee, \n     look for the leaders of the opposition to play their \n     favorite, anti-democratic, Democratic trump card--the \n     filibuster. Democrats challenged the president on Miguel \n     Estrada, and they believe they have found the president \n     wanting. Although Mr. Bush has called Mr. Estrada one of his \n     most important appellate nominees, the White House has, for \n     the past two years, been unable to confirm him. The \n     Democrats' successful filibuster against Miguel Estrada, the \n     first ever against a nominee to a U.S. Court of Appeals, has \n     emboldened them to challenge Mr. Bush when he makes his first \n     nomination to the High Court. The Democrats have paid no \n     price for their Estrada filibuster. Look for them to test the \n     president again.\n       Yes, that is the worst-case scenario, and it may not \n     unfold. In any event, if there is a vacancy on the court, the \n     nominee must be treated civilly, fairly and allowed an up-or-\n     down vote by the full Senate, as the Constitution \n     contemplates. The president had better be prepared for a \n     fight. His opponents are certainly ready. If the president \n     prevents the politicization of nominations to the lower \n     Federal courts, and to the U.S. Supreme Court, he will win \n     the most important domestic battle of his first term. If he \n     loses that battle, he may not get a second chance.\n\n  Those are one observer's predictions about the fight that will ensue \nif there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court this year. As I said at the \noutset, I certainly hope that the predictions in this article do not \ncome true, because it will be a sad day for the Senate and for the \ncountry if they do. I have to admit that many of the tactics described \nin this article sound alarmingly familiar--we have seen them practiced \nwith great skill on President Bush's Circuit Court of Appeals nominees.\n  We have seen most of those types of techniques used in various \ndebates. I am hopeful that this type of bitter partisanship will not \ncontinue. I continue to try to be optimistic about the prospects for a \nSupreme Court vacancy, but it gets harder and harder every day, and \nabout fair treatment for whoever is appointed by this President. I have \nto say I have a great deal of concern about how the President's nominee \nor nominees to the Supreme Court will be treated. I hope my colleagues \nwill think about the impact of these tactics as described in this \narticle and the consequences of such a destructive campaign on both the \nSenate and the Nation.\n  Mr. Swanson has done us a favor by putting what have been tactics \nused in the past into an article--yes, an alarmist article, but \nunfortunately every one of those tactics he has described has been \nutilized in the past by friends on the other side.\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\n  We are right now in the middle of filibusters against two highly \nqualified, exceptional people, and the arguments used against them are \nalmost unreal. The only argument I keep hearing about Miguel Estrada is \nhe just hasn't answered all the questions. We have had very few circuit \ncourt nominees who have even come close to answering the number of \nquestions that have been asked of Mr. Estrada. We hear arguments \nagainst Priscilla Owen, about the only thing left that has not been \ntotally obliterated by the facts: that she joined in dissent--in a few \nof the better than 800 cases--of a young girl who asked for a judicial \nbypass so her parents would not have to be notified about her upcoming \nabortion.\n  Polls indicate that more than 70 percent of the American people \nsupport parental notification. It has nothing really to do with Roe v. \nWade. It has to do with whether parents have a right to assist or \nconsult with their young daughter who may be going through the most \nmomentous medical procedure in her lifetime. But the finder of fact in \nthese few cases found that these young women--these young girls--should \nconsult with their parents. That is being held against Priscilla Owen \nas though she is against Roe v. Wade, when she clearly and \nunequivocally said she will support the decision in Roe v. Wade as a \ncircuit court of appeals judge. You couldn't ask anything more of her, \nbut they are asking more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5805-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5805-S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         NATO EXPANSION TREATY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12 noon \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider Executive Calendar No. 6, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolution of Ratification to Accompany Treaty Document No. \n     108-4, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on \n     Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 4 hours of \ndebate on the treaty.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we now commence a very important debate on \nthe NATO treaty.\n  On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I am pleased to \nbring the protocols of accession to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 \nto the floor for the Senate's consideration and ratification. The \nprotocols extending membership to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia and Slovenia were signed on March 26, 2003, and were \ntransmitted by President Bush to the Senate on April 10, 2003. The \naccession of these countries to the NATO Alliance is a tremendous \naccomplishment. It deserves the full support of the Senate and the \ngovernments of the other 18 NATO members.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has held 10 hearings on NATO since \n1999. Five of these hearings were held during the last 2 months, as we \nprepared for this debate on the Senate floor. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee gave its unanimous approval to the resolution of \nratification.\n  I especially thank Senator Joseph Biden for his assistance in moving \nNATO expansion forward and for his insightful participation in the \nwider debate on NATO policy. The resolution of ratification before us \ntoday reflects our mutual efforts to construct a bipartisan resolution \nthat could be broadly supported by the Senate.\n  During the course of the committee's consideration of the Protocols \nof Accession for these seven nations to join NATO, we received \ntestimony from Secretary of State Colin Powell, Under Secretary of \nState Marc Grossman, Under Secretary of Defense Doug Feith, and United \nStates Ambassador to NATO Nick Burns. Each expressed strong support for \nNATO expansion. In addition to efforts undertaken in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senators Levin and Warner and the Committee on \nArmed Services conducted two hearings examining the military \nimplications of the treaty and shared an analysis of their findings \nwith us. This letter has been made a part of the Record and our \ncommittee report.\n  When NATO was founded in 1949, its purpose was to defend Western \ndemocracies against the Soviet Union. But the demise of the Soviet \nUnion diminished the significance of NATO's mission. We began to debate \nwhere NATO should go and what NATO should do. In early 1993, I \ndelivered a speech calling for NATO not only to enlarge, but also to \nprepare to go ``out of area.'' At that time, many people were skeptical \nabout enlarging NATO's size and mission. Those of us who believed in \nNATO enlargement prevailed in that debate. And I believe that events \nhave proven us right.\n  As we consider this new enlargement, it is clear that the last round \nhas been highly beneficial. Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic are \namong the most dynamic countries in Europe. They are deeply interested \nin alliance matters, and they have sought to maximize their \ncontribution to collective security. The prospect of NATO membership \ngave these countries the incentive to accelerate reforms, to settle \ndisputes, and cooperate with their neighbors. Their success, in turn, \nhas been a strong incentive for democratization and peace among \nEurope's other aspiring countries.\n  Many observers will point to the split over Iraq as a sign that NATO \nis failing or irrelevant. I disagree. Any alliance requires constant \nmaintenance and adjustment, and NATO is no exception. The United States \nhas more at stake and more in common with Europe than with any other \npart of the world. These common interests and shared values will \nsustain the alliance if governments realize the incredible resource \nthat NATO represents. As the leader of NATO, we have no intention of \nshirking our commitment to Europe.\n  But as we attempt to mend the alliance's political divisions over \nIraq, we must go one step further and ask, if NATO had been united on \nIraq, could it have provided an effective command structure for the \nmilitary operation that is underway now? And would allies, beyond those \ncurrently engaged in Iraq, have been willing and able to field forces \nthat would have been significant to the outcome of the war? In other \nwords, achieving political unity within the alliance, while important \nto international opinion, does not guarantee that NATO will be \nmeaningful as a fighting alliance in the war on terror.\n  In the coming years, NATO will have a decide if it wants to \nparticipate in the security challenge of our time. If we do not prevent \nmajor terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction, the \nalliance will have failed in the most fundamental sense of defending \nour nations and our way of life.\n  This reality demands that as we depend NATO, we also retool NATO, so \nthat it can be a mechanism of burden sharing and mutual security in the \nwar on terrorism. America is at war, and we feel more vulnerable than \nat any time since the end of the cold war and perhaps since World War \nII. We need allies to confront this threat effectively, and those \nalliances cannot be circumscribed by geographic boundaries.\n  In our committee hearings on NATO, we have heard encouraging \ntestimony that our allies are taking promised steps to strengthen their \ncapabilities in such areas as heavy airlift and sealift and precision-\nguided munitions. We also have heard that the seven candidates for \nmembership are developing niche military capabilities that would be \nuseful in meeting NATO's new military demands. But clearly, much work \nis left to be done to transform NATO into a bulwark against terrorism. \nAn early test will be NATO's contribution to peacekeeping and \nhumanitarian duties in the aftermath of combat in Iraq. A strong \ncommitment by NATO nations to this role would be an important step in \nhealing the alliance divisions and reaffirming its relevance for the \nlong run.\n\n  The Resolution of Ratification we are considering today includes nine \ndeclarations and three conditions. I will review each of these \nprovisions for the benefit of the Senate:\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\n  Declaration 1 reaffirms that membership in NATO remains a vital \nnational security interest of the United States.\n  Declaration 2 lays out the strategic rationale for NATO enlargement.\n  Declaration 3 emphasizes that upon completion of the accession \nprocess, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \nSlovenia will have all the rights, privileges, obligations, \nresponsibilities, and protections of full NATO members.\n  Declaration 4 emphasizes the importance of European integration.\n  Declaration 5 reiterates NATO's ``open door'' policy, and declares \nthat the seven new countries will not be the last invited to join the \nalliance.\n  Declaration 6 expresses the Senate's support for the Partnership for \nPeace.\n  Declaration 7 expresses support for the NATO-Russia Council \nestablished at the Prague Summit, but reinforces the Senate's view that \nRussia does not have a veto or vote on NATO policy.\n  Declaration 8 declares that the seven candidate countries have \nimplemented mechanisms for the compensation of victims of the Holocaust \nand of Communism.\n  Declaration 9 states that the committee has maintained the \nconstitutional role of the U.S. Senate in the treaty-making process.\n  Condition 1 requires the President to reaffirm understandings on the \ncosts, benefits, and military implications of NATO enlargement.\n  Condition 2 requires the President to submit a report to the \nCongressional Intelligence Committees on the progress of Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in meeting \nNATO security sector and security vetting standards.\n  Finally, Condition 3 requires the President to certify to Congress \nthat each of the governments of the seven candidate countries is fully \ncooperating with the U.S. efforts to obtain the fullest accounting of \ncaptured and missing U.S. personnel from previous conflicts and the \nCold War.\n  When President Bush made his first trip to Europe 2 years ago, he \nstrongly voiced the U.S. commitment to Europe generally and to NATO in \nparticular. Now at a moment when relations with some of our European \nallies are strained, a clear showing of bipartisan support for NATO \nenlargement takes on added importance. The affirming message of the \nfirst round of enlargement led to improved capabilities and \nstrengthened transatlantic ties. I am confident that this second round \nwill do the same. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this \nresolution of ratification.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will proceed with an opening statement \nrelative to the matter before us, and that is expansion of NATO.\n  Mr. President, today we begin consideration of an amendment to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty of 1949 to admit to NATO seven new members--\nBulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n  If we approve this legislation, as I hope we will, it will mark an \nimportant step in the strategic transformation of the Alliance to \nrespond to a new security environment.\n  I would like to discuss the history of this strategic transformation \nand then to examine the qualifications of each of the seven candidate \ncountries.\n  The process of transforming the Alliance actually began shortly after \nthe collapse of communism in Europe in 1989.\n  The first major change in the post-Cold War NATO was an absolutely \ncritical event that is all-but-forgotten today: the accession to NATO, \nwithout fanfare, of the former East Germany when it reunited with the \nFederal Republic of Germany on October 3, 1990.\n  We talk about the expansion of NATO and we never really mention that. \nAgain, the first significant thing that happened in transforming the \nalliance in the new security environment was that East Germany, a \nformer Warsaw Pact member, was accepted and subsumed into and became \npart of Germany again, but also became part of NATO as a consequence of \nthat.\n  The following year, in June 1991, the Warsaw Pact disbanded, and in \nDecember 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved.\n  At the Madrid Summit in July 1997, NATO invited three countries from \nthe former Warsaw Pact--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary--to \nenter into final accession negotiations with the Alliance.\n  I might say a word about the care with which this body scrutinized \nthat round of NATO enlargement.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations alone held a dozen detailed \nhearings and published a 550-page book containing hearing transcripts, \npolicy analyses, a detailed trip report, and other documents. Other \ncommittees also held hearings on enlargement.\n  Then, during March and April of 1998, came seven full days of intense \ndebate on ratification here on the floor. I had the privilege of being \nfloor manager for the ratification, which was approved by a 80-19 vote \non the evening of April 30, 1998.\n  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic formally joined NATO on March \n12, 1999. Less than 2 weeks later, the Allied air war was launched \nagainst Serbian aggression in Kosovo.\n  The events of the 1990s, and the increasing instability in the Middle \nEast and Central Asia, led my farsighted colleagues--Senator Lugar and \nformer Senator Nunn, to the memorable conclusion that the NATO Alliance \nhad to ``go out of area, or out of business.''\n  Still, most analysts remained skeptical. The terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, dispatched any remaining doubts about the nature of \nthe threats we now face. The unanimous decision on the following day by \nthe NATO Allies to invoke Article 5 for the first time in NATO's \nhistory confirmed the vitality of NATO's collective defense principle.\n  At the NATO Ministerial Meeting in Reykjavik in May 2002, the Allies \nagreed that in order to meet security threats, NATO needed forces that \ncould be deployed quickly to wherever they are needed and sustained \nover time to complete their mission. This agreement effectively \nsettled, at least conceptually, the ``out-of-area'' debate.\n  Meanwhile, in Brussels and among NATO members a discussion had begun \non the merits of a so-called ``Big Bang'' next round of enlargement to \ngive meaning and force to the new missions ahead.\n  Recognizing that potential members in Central and Eastern Europe \nwould individually require years to reach all of the military standards \nof NATO, members began to view their entrance as a regional grouping as \npolitically and geographically strategic.\n  Initially, I personally had some skepticism of this perspective and \nwas concerned about the abilities of these countries to contribute to \nthe alliance. But the determined response of these countries to the war \nagainst terrorism, their participation in SFOR and KFOR peacekeeping in \nthe Balkans, their participation in Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan, and the progress they have made on their NATO membership \naction plans, so-called MAPs, convinced me all seven of these countries \nwould serve us well as formal allies. I declared my support for all \nseven of these countries in an article I wrote for the Los Angeles \nTimes of September 1, 2002.\n  The critical turning point in defining new tasks for NATO occurred at \nPrague in November 2002, at NATO's so-called ``Transformation Summit.''\n  Prague crystallized the debate over NATO's new missions, new \ncapabilities, and new members, and it afforded members opportunity to \nset forth a strategic agenda for a revitalized NATO.\n  Among the accomplishments at Prague, the alliance agreed to the \nPrague Capabilities Commitment. NATO, because it is a military \norganization--I think it is beyond that and is a political organization \nas well--loves all these acronyms. It takes a while; I apologize for my \ncolleagues who do not follow this closely. The PCC, the Prague \nCapabilities Commitment, replaced the overly ambitious and broad \nDefense Capabilities Initiative of 1999 with a more concrete framework \nfor force modernization and adaptation, including acquisition of \nequipment and technology through consortia of members and the \ndevelopment by individual\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\ncountries of so-called niche capabilities, which I will describe later. \nThat is a new term that is formally being used.\n  NATO also adopted an American proposal to develop a NATO response \nforce, NRF, a high-readiness, mobile combat unit that would allow NATO \nto go out of area to meet threats where they arise.\n  Finally, the alliance invited the seven countries whose \nqualifications we are considering today to begin final negotiations \nwith the alliance on joining as full members.\n  NATO issued the invitation knowing that the militaries in most of the \nseven countries would not greatly enhance the war-fighting ability of \nthe alliance, at least in the short term. Taken together, however, they \nwill measurably increase NATO's potential.\n  The seven invited countries will add 220,000 active-duty troops to \nthe alliance immediately, or about 175,000 by the end of the decade, \nonce current reform and restructuring of forces are completed in \nBulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. This represents a 6 percent \noverall increase in NATO military forces.\n  This round of enlargement will also yield strategic infrastructure \nbenefits. The membership of the seven countries will increase the \nnumber of airfields with long runways available to the alliance by 6 \npercent and the number available in Europe by 13 percent.\n  Airfields and ports in these countries also factor in to the \nPentagon's initial plans to reshuffle its forces in Europe, including \nthe possibility of building U.S. bases and airfields in Bulgaria and \nthe nearby Black Sea port of Burgas, as well as at a Romania airbase \nand a Black Sea port of Constanta.\n  In addition, Romania has unmanned aerial vehicles and a C-130 lift \ncapability, while Slovakia has air-to-ground training ranges.\n  Moreover, the enlargement will add so-called niche capabilities to \nNATO's array of professional forces, several of which could be directly \napplicable to future out-of-area missions. These specialized \ncapabilities include Bulgarian and Slovak antinuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons teams; Slovenian demining units; Romanian elite force \nand mountain troops; Lithuanian special forces and medics; Estonian \nexplosive detection teams; Latvian explosive ordinance destruction \nspecialists, including underwater demolition teams; and a joint Baltic \nSea air surveillance network.\n\n  While their forces may be small in number, the seven invited \ncountries have shown no hesitancy in deploying their uniformed men and \nwomen in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and, in some cases, in the Middle \nEast, as coalition operations have required.\n  In February of this year, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined NATO candidates Albania, \nCroatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the so-called \nVilnius Ten in bravely standing with the United States and its \ncoalition partners.\n  They declared the importance of the transatlantic alliance and called \nfor action by the international community in response to the clear and \ngrowing danger posed by Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, a short excerpt from their declaration demonstrates \nthe vigorous spirit these nations I believe will bring to NATO:\n\n       Our countries understand the dangers posed by tyranny and \n     the special responsibility of democracies to defend our \n     shared values. The trans-Atlantic community, of which we are \n     a part, must stand together to face the threats posed by the \n     nexus of terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n\n  In word and in deed, these countries have already demonstrated their \nvalue as partners and de facto allies, and it is in the interest of the \nUnited States, in my view, to see this partnership be made formal by \ntheir acceptance into NATO.\n  The governments of the seven involved countries have also taken \ntremendous steps and, in some cases, faced considerable political risk \nto align their institutions and policies in accordance with NATO's \nstandards and values. Let me summarize their individual qualifications \nfor NATO membership.\n  Bulgaria: Bulgaria has committed to spend around 2.8 percent of GDP \non defense in 2003, a higher percentage than that of several of our \ncurrent allies, and to continue to downsize its armed forces by the \nthousands. On October 31, 2002, Bulgaria announced that it had \ndestroyed all of its FROG, SCUD and SS-23 missiles, remnants of the old \nSoviet arsenal.\n  To shut down any further proliferation of gray arms, Sofia has \nadopted a supplemental export control legislation, drafted a new border \nsecurity act, and adopted new regulations on border checkpoints.\n  Moreover, it took immediate and decisive action against those \ninvolved in the illegal shipment that occurred last year from the Terem \nmilitary complex.\n  Bulgaria, a rare country that protected its Jewish citizens during \nWorld War II, has generally been tolerant of all its religious, ethnic, \nand political minorities. An exception was the anti-Turkish campaign in \nthe late eighties, the dying spasms of a discredited Communist regime. \nToday a largely ethnic Turkish party is a member of the governing \ncoalition. Bulgaria is now moving to complete the process of property \nrestitution to its Jewish community with only one property still under \nlegal procedure.\n  Estonia: Estonia leads the Baltic region in free market reforms, \nincreased defense spending last year of 2 percent of GDP, and is \ndeveloping a light infantry brigade, the first battalion of which \nshould be equipped and trained by the end of this month. The \norganization, Transparency International, has rated Estonia the least \ncorrupt country in central and Eastern Europe.\n  Building on an already good record, last year, they adopted an action \nplan to improve the administration and judicial capacity in their \ncountry.\n  Estonia has amended minimum language requirements in its laws on \ncitizenship and employment to address needs particularly of its large \nRussian ethnic community. As a result, in the most recent national \nelections, the ethnic Russian parties failed to clear the 5 percent \nhurdle necessary to enter Parliament. In other words, the majority of \nEstonia's ethnic Russian citizens cast their vote for multinational \nparties on the basis of substantive issues, not ethnicity. I think that \nis remarkable.\n  In August 2002, overcoming a few voices of intolerance, the Estonian \nParliament voted to recognize January 27 as a day of remembrance for \nthe Holocaust.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a student of that era, as well as my \ncolleague from Indiana, the chairman.\n  That is also a fairly remarkable undertaking. People in this country \nthink it would be automatic, but that is a pretty big deal.\n  Latvia has enacted a law to require 2 percent of its GDP to be spent \non defense beginning this year. By the end of 2003, Latvia's first \nprofessional infantry battalion will be ready to participate in NATO-\nled operations, with three additional mobile reserve battalions ready \nin 2004.\n  Riga's economic reform efforts have been well funded and generally \nsuccessful, and Latvia is now assisting other post-Communist countries \nsuch as Georgia and Ukraine with their own reform efforts.\n  After a somewhat contentious start in the early 1990s, Latvia has had \nconsiderable success in integrating its large Russian-speaking minority \nby dismantling citizenship and bureaucratic restrictions to full social \nand political participation within Latvia.\n  Lithuania has increased its spending on defense to 2 percent of GDP \nin 2002. By the end of 2004, Lithuania will be able to deploy and \nsustain a mobile, professional infantry battalion, and by 2006 a rapid \nreaction brigade.\n  A small, elite unit of Lithuanian special operations forces is \ncurrently serving in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. \nRecently, this unit was involved in ground combat against al-Qaida \nforces during a strategic reconnaissance mission and together, with \nallied reinforcements, captured several of the enemy.\n  Lithuania signed a border treaty with Russia in 1997, which the \nRussian Duma is expected to ratify later this month, and has reached an \nagreement to permit Russian military traffic to transit Lithuania on \nits way to Kaliningrad.\n  In 2002, Vilnius launched a Program for Control and Prevention of \nTrafficking in Human Beings and Prostitution. The Government has \nestablished\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\na public center for the Roma in Vilnius, launched a program to \nintegrate Roma into Lithuanian society, and developed information \ncampaigns to promote this tolerance.\n  Conscripts in Lithuania's armed forces have a unit in their training \non the history of World War II and the Holocaust in Lithuania, and the \nGovernment is working with international nongovernment organizations to \nestablish legal procedures for Jewish communal property restitution.\n  Quite frankly, in a sense, as I go through this, if we did nothing \nother than accomplish these changes in the countries I have mentioned \nso far, unrelated to the military, in order to get them to move toward \nNATO--not to get them to make it clear what they had to accommodate to \nmove toward NATO--I would argue it would be a significant success, a \nsingular success, but the story goes on.\n  Romania, by far the largest of the seven candidate countries, spends \n$1 billion, or 2.38 percent of its GDP, on defense. Moreover, Romania \nis committed to being a net contributor to NATO and is upgrading its 21 \nMiG-29 fighter aircraft, its navy ships, and its missile launching \nsystems.\n  An elite Romanian infantry battalion, the Red Scorpions, served in \nAfghanistan--that is how they are referred to, the ``Red Scorpions''--\nand was replaced by the Carpathian Hawks that are currently there. I \nlove these names. It is sort of part of the history of Romania, which \nis another question.\n  I might add that Romania flew these units to Afghanistan on their own \nC-130s, a feat which many of our current NATO allies are unable to \nduplicate.\n  The Romanian economy has grown substantially over the past 3 years, \nby 4 percent in 2002, and inflation, although it remains high, has been \nbrought under the IMF target rate of 22 percent.\n  Romania opened a National Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office in \nSeptember 2002 and has begun a judicial reform effort that includes \nprosecuting judges for bribery and corruption, an act called \n``unprecedented in the region.'' Romania's relations with Hungary have \nimproved following the 2001 agreement on Hungarian ``status law'' for \nethnic Hungarians outside Hungary's border. I might add, one of the \nmajor changes that took place when Hungary wished to come in was \nHungary made similar reforms.\n  These changes are consequential. As a student of European history, \nsome of this is centuries in coming. The animosities and antagonisms \nhave been real. This is a big deal. The reason I bother to point that \nout is that it all has a ripple effect, in my view.\n  Hungary's admission to NATO began Hungary forming their policies that \nrelated to ethnicity. That, in turn, I believe, has made it easier for \nRomania--and necessary, by the way, to become part of NATO--to act in a \nsimilar way.\n  Slovakia has made great progress in democratic reforms and is the \nfirst country to reelect a center-right reform government in Central \nand Eastern Europe since the end of the cold war.\n  Under Prime Minister Dzurinda, Bratislava committed to raise its \ndefense spending and maintain it at 2 percent of GDP in 2003 and \nbeyond. A sweeping defense reform plan, known as the Slovak Republic \nForce 2010, will establish by 2010 a small, well-equipped interoperable \narmed force integrated into NATO military structures.\n  In February 2003, Slovakia opened a new department to fight \ncorruption, which is overseen by the Deputy Prime Minister and the \nMinister of Justice. Bratislava is preparing new laws to create an \nOffice of the Special Prosecutor and to prevent corruption in public \nadministration and the judiciary.\n  I remember, after the Prague Spring was crushed back several decades \nago, I went to Bratislava to meet the fellow who was responsible for \nthe Prague Spring.\n  To think that today this is all happening is, to me, amazing, just \nwithin the time that I have been in the Senate.\n  Alone among the seven candidates, Slovenia comes out of a tradition \nof nonalignment as a part of the former Yugoslavia. It is the \nexception. Also alone among the candidates, it won its independence by \nforce of arms in a short, successful war against the Federal Yugoslav \nforces in June of 1991.\n  I might add, I pushed very hard in the first round for Slovenia to be \nadded. I thought they were qualified then.\n  Moreover, Slovenia has won widespread acclaim for aspects of \npeacekeeping activities. Its International Trust for Demining and War \nVictims Assistance is currently responsible for two-thirds of all the \ndemining operations in southeastern Europe.\n  Although the wealthiest in per capita terms of the candidate \ncountries, Slovenia has lagged behind the other six in terms of defense \nspending as a percentage of GDP. Ljubljana has committed to reach 2 \npercent GDP by 2008. Slovenia has focused on creating two battalions of \nrapid reaction forces for combat and peacekeeping operations.\n  Freedom House gave Slovenia the highest rating of all the candidate \ncountries with respect to rule of law and preventing and combating \ncorruption. Slovenia is the only country among the seven candidates to \nhave held a referendum on NATO membership. On March 23 of this year, 66 \npercent of those participating voted in favor of membership, a \nconsiderable achievement during the first week of the highly televised \nmilitary operations in Iraq, which I need not tell my colleagues was \nnot particularly politic or popular among most European voters.\n  No society anywhere is perfect, and despite their outstanding record \nof accomplishment, significant challenges remain for each of the seven \ncandidate countries. They include: permanently curtailing all gray arms \nsales in Bulgaria; implementing strict control over classified \ninformation in Bulgaria and Latvia; eliminating discrimination against \nethnic minorities, especially Roma, in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia; \nabolishing the remaining restrictions on the freedom of the news media \nin Romania; completing the restitution of religious and communal \nproperties that had been seized by the Communists or by the Fascists \nduring the Holocaust in all of the seven countries; educating the \npublics of all of these countries about the Holocaust and the poison of \nanti-Semitism; and fully implementing legislation designed to eradicate \ncorruption in all seven countries.\n\n  Membership in NATO, however, in my view, will reinforce the process \nof democratic and economic reforms ongoing in these countries.\n  That is why I mentioned Hungary before. I think this is a process. I \nthink they have all met the minimum standards required, both in terms \nof their militaries, at this point, and in terms of reforms necessary.\n  I truly believe were we unwilling--and I don't believe we will be--to \nadmit them, we would turn this progress in the wrong direction. As a \nmember of NATO, what we have seen is that these countries will get \nbetter and better and better. At least that is my hope and expectation.\n  Each country has worked with NATO under the Membership Action Plan \nprocess and has developed a subsequent Timetable for the Completion of \nReforms to identify strategies to conclude and build on the steps \nnecessary to assume the full responsibilities and obligations of NATO \nmembership.\n  As Ambassador Nick Burns, the United States Permanent Representative \nto the North Atlantic Council, recently told the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, ``We have pushed these countries hard to be ready,'' and \n``they will be among our most committed allies when they walk through \nNATO's doors as full members.''\n  The Resolution of Ratification before the Senate today is similar to \nthe resolution approved during the last round of NATO enlargement. Let \nme briefly summarize it.\n  The text reflects bipartisan agreement, in accord with the view of \nthe administration, that U.S. membership in NATO remains a vital \nnational security interest of the United States.\n  The Resolution of Ratification makes clear that any threat to the \nstability of Europe would jeopardize vital U.S. interests.\n  It reaffirms that the security and prosperity of the United States is \nenhanced by NATO's collective defense against aggression that may \nthreaten the territory of NATO members.\n  It affirms that all seven countries have democratic governments, have \ndemonstrated a willingness to meet all\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\nrequirements of membership, and are in a position to further the \nprinciples of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the \nsecurity of the North Atlantic area.\n  The resolution underscores the importance of European integration, \nmentioning the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe--\nOSCE--and the European Union in that regard.\n  The resolution also contains positive declarations on the alliance's \n``Open Door'' policy toward potential future members, on the alliance's \nsuccessful Partnership for Peace program, on the NATO-Russia Council \ncreated last year, and on compensation for victims of the Holocaust and \nof communism.\n  The resolution contains three substantive and sensible conditions \nrelating to costs and burden-sharing, on intelligence matters, and on \nfull cooperation with efforts to obtain full accounting of captured and \nmissing U.S. personnel from past military conflicts or cold war \nincidents.\n  In summary, I believe the Resolution of Ratification accomplishes the \nobjective of providing the strategic rationale for the accession of \nthese seven new members and preserving U.S. interests with respect to \nfuture enlargement.\n  This round of enlargement isn't the end of the road. Rather, it is a \nhistoric milestone in a process that began with the end of the cold \nwar.\n  Thus, it is essential that the door to membership remain open for \ncandidates states Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, as well as down the road for potential candidates like \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, Ukraine, and perhaps \nother countries.\n  By endorsing NATO enlargement, we recognize the soundness and \nrelevance of the vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace.\n  We acknowledge that a larger, stronger transatlantic relationship \nanchored in NATO will better serve us in confronting the transnational \nterrorist threats of the twenty-first century.\n  We affirm that the United States will continue to play a leadership \nrole in the security of the North Atlantic area, which I think is \ncritical for us to reaffirm.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of the Resolution of \nRatification and endorse the accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO \nAlliance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. We are pleased to yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas, as much as he would require.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nadmitting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \nSlovenia into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As NATO's focus \nevolves to include transnational threats, it is important to have as \nmany like-minded nations abroad as possible.\n  At the same time Congress and the President must ensure NATO as a \nmilitary alliance can act efficiently and with precision in the post 9/\n11 world.\n  These days I hear some pundits talk about rebuilding the alliance as \nif it is in the same shape as post-war Iraq or post-war Afghanistan. \nNATO is in no such condition. The inability to achieve North Atlantic \nCouncil approval for assistance to Turkey was damaging but not \ncatastrophic. NATO is in good shape.\n  Nonetheless, it would be productive for NATO to consider improvements \nthat would streamline its decision-making process, increase operational \nplanning for contingencies, and more appropriately respond to a member \nnation who refuses to uphold basic alliance mandates such as Article \nIV.\n  Toward that end, I am pleased to join Chairman Warner and Senator \nLevin in offering an amendment to the Resolution of Ratification that \nadds a declaration concerning potential reforms to NATO internal \nprocesses.\n  Specifically, the declaration includes a Sense of the Senate that the \nPresident should place on the agenda for discussion at the North \nAtlantic Council the consensus rule as well as a process for suspending \na member nation that acts contrary to the provisions of the North \nAtlantic Treaty.\n  Further, the Warner-Levin-Roberts amendment requires a report from \nthe President regarding Alliance dialogue on these issues as well as \nmethods to provide more flexibility to NATO's military leadership for \noperational planning prior to formal alliance approval.\n  My primary focus is on the process of consensus and planning for new \ncontingencies.\n  The decision-making process of consensus within the NATO alliance \nserved the organization and is purpose well in the 20th Century. While \nthe bipolar security environment of the previous century shaped our \ncommand, and defined our mission, the 21st Century requires that we \ndepart from the clearly defined role of territorial defense.\n  NATO must recognize the need to change from the traditional terrain-\nbased military of a defensive alliance to an effects-based alliance in \norder to prepare for a new set of security challenges. Our adversaries \ndo not recognize international law, sovereignty or accepted norms of or \nbehavior.\n  As we recognize the growing need to conduct operations outside the \nalliance's boundaries as we do in Afghanistan in order to protect our \ninterests and enhance our security, we also need to acknowledge the \ninherent limitations of consensus voting by 26 nations.\n  Issues of security and the need to take military action will likely \nnot be perceived uniformly in an organization that spans a wide \ngeographic area, encompassing different interests. Recognizing this \nreality and the need to adopt a different modality for decision making \nwithin the alliance is imperative.\n  I would argue NATO needs to consider adopting--I emphasize needs to \nconsider--a decision-making model that doesn't require a consensus vote \nto act. Nations that choose not to take military action would not be \ncompelled to participate. However, they would not block the alliance \nand those nations that decide to act from carrying out military \noperations.\n  That brings me to contingency planning. Currently, NATO's military \nleadership is forbidden to even conduct prudent planning for \ncontingency operations until the matter is voted on in the North \nAtlantic Council.\n  The difficulty in crafting viable plans to often complex military \noperations amongst nineteen separate nations is a daunting task. The \nmeasure of difficulty to conduct planning will be exacerbated with the \naddition of seven new members.\n  Current planning processes may even prevent the full realization of \nthe NATO Response Force, something that could be stood up at the June \nprincipal meeting. This capability is central to NATO's appropriate \neffort to develop an agile and responsive force that will enable the \nalliance to respond to terrorism and instability.\n  To transform the military capability into a viable, very responsive \nforce without the means to rapidly employ it, is counterproductive. It \nis time for NATO to consider developing a methodology by which the \nmilitary leadership is permitted to conduct prudent planning for \ncontingency operations.\n  These are my concerns, as we vote--and I will vote--to approve \nfurther expansion of the alliance. I commend my colleagues, the chair \nand ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services, for sharing \nthese concerns and for crafting a worthy amendment.\n  I am a cosponsor, and I urge support for Warner-Levin-Roberts \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am so proud to stand on the floor of \nthe Senate today as we consider the candidacy of seven new European \ndemocracies--Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia \nand Slovenia--for membership in the NATO Alliance.\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\n  The question of NATO enlargement is one that has long been close to \nmy heart. As Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of the State of Ohio, I \nworked closely with constituents in my State with ties to countries \nthat were once subject to life behind the Iron Curtain.\n  It is amazing to me to see how far many of these countries have come \nin such a short time, rising to embrace democratic reforms after so \nmany years under communist rule. The fact that seven countries that \nwere once part of the former Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact or Tito's \nYugoslavia have been invited to join the NATO alliance is testament to \nhow much has been achieved since the collapse of the Soviet Empire more \nthan a decade ago.\n  We owe so much to Pope John Paul II, President Reagan, President \nGeorge H.W. Bush, and now President George W. Bush. As I said to the \nPresident in a letter prior to his trip to Poland in June 2001, when he \nclearly articulated his support for enlargement of the Alliance:\n\n       During my entire life I have supported the Captive Nations \n     and yearned that someday they would have freedom, but I \n     doubted that would happen during my lifetime. However, it did \n     happen because of your dad and President Reagan, who said \n     ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''\n\n  I also said:\n\n       You, Mr. President, have the opportunity to guarantee the \n     freedom and security of those once subjected to life under \n     Communist control by making it clear that you will support \n     the expansion of NATO to include former territories of the \n     Soviet Union, Tito's Yugoslavia and the Warsaw Pact \n     regardless of Russia's opposition.\n\n  And he did it.\n  President Bush outlined his vision for enlargement in a landmark \nspeech to the students and faculty at the University of Warsaw on June \n15, 2001, when he remarked that as we approach the NATO Summit in \nPrague:\n\n       We should not calculate how little we can get away with, \n     but how much we can do to advance the cause of freedom.\n\n  That speech was very strategic because at the time there were many \npeople who were wondering whether or not the President would move away \nfrom the expansion of NATO in consideration of compromising with at \nthat time President Putin in regard to the ABM Treaty--the ABM Treaty \nat the time looking like it would stand in the way of moving forward \nwith the President's National Missile Defense Initiative.\n  The President was true to his word, and it was extremely gratifying \nto see this vision begin to turn to reality when President Bush joined \nother NATO heads of state in Prague last November. I remain grateful to \nthe President for inviting me to join him as a member of the \nCongressional delegation to the NATO Summit, along with Senator Bill \nFrist, Congressman Tom Lantos, Congressman Elton Gallegly and \nCongressman Doug Bereuter. The thrill of being in the room when NATO \nSecretary General Lord Robertson announced the decision to invite the \nthree Baltic nations, as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and \nSlovenia, to join the Alliance, is something that I will always \nremember.\n  On that historic day, I listened as heads of state from our allied \nnations including the Czech Republic, France, Spain, Great Britain, \nPoland, Canada, Turkey, and many others praised the work done by the \nseven candidate countries and expressed their strong support for \nenlargement to include these new European democracies.\n  While there are disagreements within NATO that must be addressed, \nthere is general consensus among the current members of the Alliance on \nthe question of enlargement. It is acknowledged that in addition to \nshared values, the seven candidate countries bring defense capabilities \nthat will enhance the overall security and stability of the NATO \nAlliance. President Bush, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, and the highest-ranking member of the \nU.S. military, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard \nMyers, have all expressed this view. America's top leaders believe that \nin addition to niche military capabilities, these seven countries bring \nenergy, freshness and enthusiasm to the Alliance.\n  As Secretary Powell remarked in testimony before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee last week, enlargement of the NATO Alliance to \ninclude Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and \nSlovenia is in the national security interest of the United States. It \nwill, he said:\n\n       Help to strengthen NATO's partnerships to promote \n     democracy, the rule of law, free markets and peace throughout \n     Eurasia. Moreover, it will better equip the Alliance to \n     respond collectively to the new dangers we face.\n\n  NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson, after working with the NATO \naspirant countries on comprehensive domestic reforms in preparation for \nmembership in the Alliance, has also concluded that this round of \nenlargement will enhance the strength and vitality of NATO a view which \nhe expressed at the Prague Summit and reiterated earlier this week \nduring a meeting with members of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I share this view, and I believe it is appropriate and timely that we \nnow consider these candidates for membership in NATO. They have \nprovided crucial support in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks \nagainst our country on 9/11, and continue to make significant \ncontributions to the ongoing campaign against international terrorism. \nThey have shown their solidarity in our efforts to disarm Saddam \nHussein and liberate the Iraqi people, and have pledged to work with \nthe international community to promote security and reconstruction in \nIraq following the end of military action.\n  The candidate countries have also moved forward with democratic \nreforms to promote the rule of law and respect for human rights. I am \nstrongly concerned about the disturbing rise in anti-Semitic violence \nin Europe and other parts of the world. Several of the candidate \ncountries, including Latvia, Bulgaria, and Romania, have joined with \nthe United States, Poland and other countries to actively encourage the \nchair-in-office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope--OSCE--to mount a serious and credible OSCE conference on anti-\nSemitism. Due in part to their efforts, the OSCE has agreed to conduct \nsuch a conference, and it is scheduled to take place in June. This is \njust one example, but it is indicative of important action that is \ntaking place.\n\n  As was highlighted during a series of hearings on NATO enlargement \nconducted by the Foreign Relations Committee, the seven candidate \ncountries bring nearly 200,000 new troops to the alliance. They have \nalso pledged to commit significant resources to national defense, with \nBulgaria, Romania, Estonia, and Lithuania all at or above 2 percent of \nthe gross domestic product mark in 2002. Slovakia and Latvia were just \nunder 2 percent, and Slovenia at 1.6 percent in 2002, and they have \npledged and committed to reach the 2-percent mark by 2008.\n  The average defense spending among candidate countries was 2.1 \npercent for 2002, which is equal to the average spent by the current \nNATO members for the same period. It is interesting to note that 11 of \nthe 19 members of the alliance did not reach the 2-percent mark for \ndefense spending in 2002, which we should all be concerned about. \nClearly, there is room for improvement in this regard for current \nmembers of the alliance.\n  On March 27, 2003, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs \nMarc Grossman testified before the Armed Services Committee regarding \nthe future of NATO. When asked about the benefits of enlargement, he \nsaid:\n\n       I believe, Senators, that the accession of these countries \n     are about the future of NATO, and will be good and directly \n     benefit U.S. interests. Why? They're strong Atlanticists. \n     They're allies in the war on terror. They've already \n     contributed to Operation Enduring Freedom and the \n     International Security Assistance Force in Kabul.\n\n  The list goes on. I agree with Secretary Grossman's assessment. These \ncountries already make significant contributions that strengthen the \ntransatlantic relationship.\n  They have acted as de facto Allies. In fact, they have acted as \nbetter Allies than some of the members that are currently in NATO. And \nI believe they will make important contributions, as members, to the \nNATO alliance.\n  While much has been achieved, there is still work to be done as the \ncandidate countries continue to work on their membership action plans. \nAs was said in Prague, Prague should be viewed as the starting line, \nnot the finishing line. There is still a lot more that has to be done \non those maps.\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\n  Efforts have continued since the Prague summit. I was very pleased to \nlearn that the people of Slovenia--who have been engaged in a \ndiscussion about NATO membership for many years now--voted \noverwhelmingly in support of Slovenia's membership in NATO during a \nnational referendum on March 23, with roughly two-thirds of the voters \nfavoring accession to the alliance. This was a crucial step for the \ncountry that was the birthplace of my maternal grandparents. Hooray for \nSlovenia. I am glad they understood.\n  It is imperative that the candidates continue to address the \noutstanding issues that require attention, including military reform, \nrespect for human rights, and efforts to combat organized crime and \ncorruption. It is this last piece, perhaps, that concerns me the most. \nThese problems have the potential to undermine democratic reforms, \nrespect for the rule of law, and other core NATO values, and I believe \nthey could be very dangerous if left unchecked.\n  I was glad to hear from Secretary Powell, during his testimony before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee last week, that there are, in fact--\nthis is wonderful--significant steps that have taken place on behalf of \nthe NATO aspirants to combat corruption and organized crime. With \nregard to Bulgaria, for example, the Secretary of State remarked that \nthe Bulgarian Government recently created an interagency anticorruption \ncommission to be led by the Minister of Justice. The Bulgarian \nParliament also passed anticorruption legislation and antibribery \nlegislation.\n\n  Secretary Powell noted that the Romanian Government is now working on \nlegislation to reform its judiciary, civil service, and political party \nfinancing activities. I am also hopeful that Romania will move forward \nwith steps to ensure progress on outstanding property restitution \nissues, including those of significance to Hungarian and other minority \ngroups in Romania.\n  So while I still think there is work to be done, I am satisfied that \nthings are moving in the right direction.\n  After meeting with leaders from these seven countries and spending \ntime in each country that has been invited to join NATO--I have been in \nall of them and have met with all of their leaders--I am confident that \nreforms will continue. I sincerely believe reforms will be swifter and \nmore complete as these countries are brought into the alliance rather \nthan left out. History tells us this has been the case with other \ncountries that have been part of the alliance. NATO has a way of \nasserting pressure and, as General Lord Robertson said during our \nmeeting Monday, squeezing those who need to shape up.\n  As we consider enlargement today, it is clear that the world is a \ndifferent place than it was when Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic were brought into NATO. The world's democracies and \nmultilateral institutions, including the NATO alliance, face new \nthreats to freedom, marked not by Communist aggression but, instead, by \nthe dangerous nexus between weapons of mass destruction, rogue nations, \nand terrorists who have shown their willingness to use chemical, \nbiological, or nuclear weapons against those who value freedom and \ndemocracy, if given the chance.\n  NATO's decision to invoke article 5 in the aftermath of the tragic \nevents of September 11 signifies that an attack on one is an attack on \nall, and that sent a strong message of solidarity to the people of the \nUnited States and the world at large. I suspect that when the \nresolution was put together in regard to article 5, we were very \ncareful to make sure we did not get ourselves in entangling alliances. \nNever did we ever believe we would be calling on the other nations in \nNATO to come to our assistance as they did.\n  NATO's mission to transform to meet these growing threats does not \nmake the alliance irrelevant; rather, it means we need the shared \ncommitment to freedom, democracy, and security embodied by the NATO \nalliance now more than ever before. A NATO alliance enlarged to include \nseven new democracies that have embraced these values will enhance our \nability to meet new challenges for peace in the world.\n  At the Prague summit, NATO heads of state embarked upon a course to \nidentify the capabilities needed to confront new challenges to \ninternational security. They agreed that new challenges would require \nthe alliance to operate beyond Europe's borders. The Prague Declaration \nnoted:\n\n       In order to carry out the full range of its missions, NATO \n     must be able to field forces that can move quickly to \n     wherever they are needed, upon decision by the North Atlantic \n     Council, to sustain operations over distance and time, \n     including in an environment where they might be faced with \n     nuclear, biological and chemical threats, and to achieve \n     their objectives.\n\n  As Secretary General Lord Robertson has said, NATO must either go out \nof area, or go out of business.\n  This will become crucial as NATO prepares to assume new \nresponsibilities in Afghanistan this August, moving forward on the \nNorth Atlantic Council's decision on April 16 to provide enhanced \nsupport to the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul. NATO's \nnew ISAF role is perhaps indicative of the types of missions the \nalliance could take on in years to come. As Secretary Powell indicated \nlast week, this is the largest step to date that the alliance has taken \noutside its traditional area of responsibility. And, as you know, Mr. \nPresident, they are now talking about the possibility of NATO being \ninvolved in security forces in Iraq.\n  As the alliance prepares for its role in Afghanistan, it does so at a \ntime when current members of NATO and other countries in Europe have \nconsiderable experience working together, due to operations in Kosovo, \nBosnia, and Macedonia. As former Supreme Allied Commander Joe Ralston \nnoted in remarks before the Atlantic Council on Monday evening, this is \nin stark contrast to the past, when members of the alliance depended on \nannual training exercises.\n  I think that is really something we should emphasize, that these \nnations have been working militarily together since Bosnia. They are in \nKosovo today. They will be in Afghanistan. It is amazing how well the \nNATO command has worked in Kosovo. And I am confident it will work as \nwell in Afghanistan.\n  But new missions will demand that NATO step up efforts to improve its \nmilitary capabilities. This was a major theme at the Prague summit last \nNovember, where NATO heads of state approved the creation of a NATO \nresponse force, which is envisioned to consist of approximately 25,000 \ntroops who are ready and able to deploy anywhere in the world within 30 \ndays. The goal is to have the force operational by 2006. While work has \nbeen ongoing to flesh out the details of the NATO response force, this \nis still a paper concept, and we look forward to learning more about \nefforts to turn this into a viable force at the June ministerial \nmeeting in Madrid.\n  The NATO response force goes hand in glove with the Prague \nCapabilities Commitment, which replaces the Defense Capabilities \nInitiative, or DCI, that was initiated at the 1999 Washington summit. \nAs many of us know, very little progress was made on that 1999 Defense \nCapabilities Initiative.\n  The Prague Capabilities Commitment, though, calls on Allies to \nimprove and develop military capabilities, focusing on defense against \nweapons of mass destruction, intelligence, command, control and \ncommunications, and strategic air and sea lift, among other things.\n  This initiative focuses on pooling resources and identifying niche \ncapabilities that certain countries can bring to the table in order to \nstrengthen NATO's military reach. I have been pleased to hear from \nSecretary Powell, Lord Robertson, and General Ralston that the alliance \nhas begun to identify niche contributions that the seven candidates can \nmake to future operations.\n  They are willing and able. They have, in fact, already demonstrated \ntheir willingness to use them in NATO operations in the Balkans as well \nas military efforts to combat international terrorism.\n  For example, Bulgaria contributes troops to NATO operations in the \nBalkans, with military personnel in both Bosnia and Kosovo. Bulgaria \nhas also contributed to Operation Enduring Freedom, allowing for \ncoalition aircraft to refuel at Burgas, and sending a nuclear, \nbiological and chemical decontamination unit to Afghanistan. Bulgaria \nhas also deployed a NBC unit to the Iraqi theater of operations at the \nrequest of U.S. Central Command.\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\n  Estonia also supports NATO missions in southeast Europe, and has \napproved the deployment of troops to assist in the reconstruction of \nIraq.\n  Latvia has deployed medical teams to Afghanistan, and in April the \nLatvian Parliament approved the deployment of troops to Iraq for peace \nenforcement and humanitarian operations.\n  Lithuania has deployed a medical team and a Special Operations Unit \nto Afghanistan. Lithuania has also deployed troops to support Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  Romania sent a military police platoon to support the International \nSecurity Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Romania has also provided an \nNBC unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Slovakia has deployed an engineering unit to Afghanistan, and was the \nfirst NATO candidate country to deploy troops--an NBC unit--in support \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Slovenia provides troops and equipment to NATO operations in the \nBalkans, and has also provided crucial assistance in de-mining and mine \nvictims assistance, running the International Trust Fund for De-mining. \nAdditionally, Slovenia has provided humanitarian and de-mining \nassistance to Afghanistan.\n  They are all doing a job right now and will do more once they are \nbrought into NATO formally.\n  While there is still work to be done, these contributions are \nencouraging. If NATO is to meet future challenges, it is imperative \nthat the capabilities gap between the U.S. and our European allies be \naddressed. The Prague Capabilities Commitment highlights critical needs \nwithin the alliance. This is a good place to start, and I am hopeful \nthat it will succeed in producing tangible results. Without adequate \ncapabilities, NATO's ability to respond to future security challenges \nwill be seriously undermined.\n  As NATO looks to the future, there will be other challenges. Bringing \nin seven members will, I believe, strengthen the alliance; at the same \ntime, there will be adjustments as NATO adapts to membership at 26 \nrather than the current 19. I share the sentiments expressed by \nSecretary of State Colin Powell and NATO Secretary General Lord \nRobertson that the alliance will adapt, as it always have.\n  I disagree with some of my colleagues, who may argue that significant \nchanges should be made to the NATO decision-making process. The \nalliance has always been based on consensus, protecting the view of \neach member. As Secretary Powell remarked in testimony before the \nForeign Relations Committee last week, NATO is not a committee or a \ncouncil. It is an Alliance that has traditionally--and successfully--\nbeen based on the rule of consensus.\n  I was interested when Lord Robinson spoke to us on Monday. We were \ntalking about this issue. He said somehow we worked it out. We had the \nproblem with Turkey, and there was a question of how that would all be \nworked out. The alliance had the flexibility to move forward and take \ncare of that problem.\n  He specifically said that they need the flexibility, that somehow \nthey will work it out. If we come in with some specific way of how we \nwill do this, it will tie their hands and won't give them the \nflexibility to do what they have to do when the time comes. I am \nconfident they will do that.\n  It is my sincere belief that the European democracies of Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia will, as \nthey have already demonstrated, contribute to NATO's proud tradition \nand serve to strengthen the alliance. I strongly support enlargement of \nthe alliance to include these countries, and look forward to further \nexpansion in the future to those countries who have demonstrated the \nability to accept the responsibilities that come with membership in the \nNATO alliance. I never thought I would be here today on the Senate \nfloor able to recommend this to my colleagues. It is a wonderful day.\n  I rise today in strong support of the Resolution on Ratification \nbefore us today, which will extend U.S. support to make NATO membership \na reality for these new European democracies.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally \nto both sides during the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, since the end of the cold war, the mission \nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has changed from one of \nconfronting the Soviet Union to one of securing democracy and stability \nin one undivided, free Europe.\n  By passing the resolution of ratification of the Protocols to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, the Senate supports \na giant step toward realizing that goal.\n  I want to speak just for a moment about the recent disagreements \namong NATO countries regarding Iraq. After many years of supporting \nNATO enlargement, and my particular interest in Baltic membership in \nNATO--which I will speak about--I confess that I am concerned that now \nthat my dream is on the cusp of reality, NATO is divided and torn.\n  I was one who thought the United States should have taken a longer \ndiplomatic path before resorting to war with Iraq and I am particularly \nconcerned about the impression expressed by many of our allies that \nthere is no room for disagreement with US policy.\n  I believe that our relations with our NATO allies can and must be \nrepaired. But I also want to remind my colleagues that NATO is an \nalliance of democratic countries whose populations were overwhelmingly \nopposed to the US going to war with Iraq.\n  If our goal is to support an undivided, democratic, and free Europe, \nwe must accept and welcome debate within the NATO alliance and work \nharder to hear and accommodate the views of our allies. It would be the \nheight of irony if the organization originally formed to confront \ntotalitarian communism would disintegrate because of a lack of \ntolerance for disagreements with United States policy.\n  I want to focus my remarks today on this resolution on the Baltic \nstates, not because I oppose the membership of Bulgaria, Romania, \nSlovakia and Slovenia. On the contrary, I supported the policy of \nseeking the largest possible enlargement of NATO in this round. I \nalways confess my prejudice when I speak about the Baltic states. My \nmother was born in Lithuania. So when I speak of the Baltic countries, \nit is with particular personal feeling.\n  I could not have predicted a few years ago that we could not have to \nfight, and fight hard, to get Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into NATO.\n  Even as recently as three years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin \nclaimed the NATO membership for the Baltic States would be a ``reckless \nact'' that removed a key buffer zone and posed a major strategic \nchallenge to Moscow that could ``destabilize'' Europe.\n  Russian objections to Baltic membership in NATO had no credibility. \nRussia has nothing to fear from NATO and nothing to fear from Baltic \nmembership in NATO. The tiny Baltic States are no military challenge to \nRussia, and certainly a democratic Russia does not threaten Europe.\n  I give credit where it is due, and I believe President Bush's strong \nleadership in supporting NATO enlargement and his firm rejection of \nRussian objections to Baltic membership were key to securing broad \nsupport, both here and in Europe, for this round of NATO enlargement.\n  A quick review of history is called for to help appreciate just how \nremarkable it is that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are on the verge \nof membership.\n  In June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the Baltic countries of \nEstonia,\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\nLatvia, and Lithuania and forcibly incorporated them into the Union of \nSoviet Socialist Republics.\n  Throughout the occupation, the United States maintained that the \nacquisition of Baltic territory by force was not permissible under \ninternational law and was unjust. We refused to recognize Soviet \nsovereignty over these Baltic States.\n  On July 15, 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an Executive \norder freezing Baltic assets in the United States to prevent them from \nfalling into Soviet hands. On July 23, 1940, Secretary of State Sumner \nWelles issued the first public statement of such policy of \nnonrecognition of the Soviet takeover of the Baltic countries. The \nUnited States took steps to allow the diplomatic representatives of \nthose countries to continue to represent them in Washington despite the \nSoviet occupation.\n  In 1959, Congress designated the third week in July as ``Captive \nNations Week,'' and time after time, year after year, I would gather in \nDaley Plaza in Chicago with those from Baltic States and other occupied \ncountries to wonder and pray if there would ever be freedom in those \ncountries again.\n  The good news about Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia's membership in \nNATO is it did not come about by accident. The people of the Baltics \nnever let go of their dreams of freedom. They never let our Government \nforget that they were going to live by those dreams. The official U.S. \npolicy of nonrecognition of Soviet takeover of the Baltics gave them \nhope.\n  I went to Lithuania a few years ago with my late brother, Bill. We \nwent to the tiny town where my mother was born, Jurbarkas. When we were \nthere, we found we had relatives, cousins, that we never knew we had, \nfamily separated by the Iron Curtain.\n  I did not believe in my lifetime that I would see the changes come to \npass in the Baltic States. When I visited Lithuania the first time in \n1979, it was under Soviet domination. Freedom was at a premium, and the \npoor people of that country slogged by day after day wondering if they \nwould ever have another chance at self-governance.\n  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia asserted their independence from the \ndomination of the Soviet Union, but at a great cost. Soviet \nparatroopers stormed the Press House in Vilnius, injuring four people. \nBarricades were set up in front of the Lithuania Parliament, the \nSeimas. On January 13, 1991, Soviet forces attacked the television \nstation and tower in Vilnius, killing 14 Lithuanians. I was there \nshortly thereafter. Today, one can see how it is a standing memorial to \nthose who died in the latest fight for freedom in the Baltics.\n  Images of crowds of unarmed civilians facing down Soviet tanks in the \nBaltics to protect their parliaments were a powerful message of \nresistance. It created hope across the world.\n\n  The Baltic countries have nurtured their relations with the West, but \nthey have also worked to have a good relationship with Russia. Despite \nthe bitter experience of years of Soviet occupation, each Baltic \ncountry has tried to establish a good working relationship so that \ncitizenship and language laws conform to European standards, taking \ncare not to discriminate against ethnic Russians still living in their \nborders. As a result of these steps, and because of U.S. and NATO's \nefforts to engage Russia in a positive relationship, Russia's \nopposition to Baltic membership has disappeared.\n  The Baltic countries, I wish to add, have also taken an extraordinary \nand historic step to face up to the bitter legacy of the Holocaust, \nwhen hundreds of thousands of Lithuanian, Estonian, and Latvian Jews \nperished, by setting up a Holocaust museum, teaching about the history \nof the Holocaust in school, returning the Torah scrolls taken from \nsynagogues and destroyed during that sad period, and working to restore \nJewish property rights.\n  Some people question whether these tiny countries bring anything to \nNATO. NATO is not a country club; it is a military alliance. When the \nSoviet troops finally left the Baltic countries, they took almost \neverything, and these tiny countries started to rebuild their economy \nand rebuild their power to defend themselves.\n  The old Soviet ways disappeared, and new thinking, new leaders \nappeared. Western ways of thinking about military organization, whether \ncivilian control of the military, took their place. To be sure, these \nare small countries, but they have been helpful countries. They will \nmake a positive contribution to NATO. They already have in Bosnia, \nKosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n  When we ratified the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic, some in the Senate doubted their contributions and worried \nabout the cost burdens. I think they realize today that those worries \nhave not materialized into anything serious. Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic have been great allies of NATO.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. Today, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia \nhave worked hard to become market economies, to watch their democracies \nflourish. The fact they want so much to be part of NATO is an \naffirmation of great hope and great optimism for Europe. I am glad we \nstood by these countries during the dark hours of Soviet occupation.\n  I am sorry my mother did not live long enough to see this day, but \nshe did live long enough for two of her three sons to return to the \ntiny village of Lithuania that she never saw after leaving in 1911. Our \nreturn trip to Lithuania was part of closing a loop in our own family \nhistory, but it also established a bond, a uniting, a tie between the \nUnited States and a small Baltic nation.\n  By the action of the Senate today in expanding NATO for these new \ncountries, and particularly to expand them to include all of the Baltic \ncountries and my mother's home nation of Lithuania, I believe we are \ncompleting the job which was started in 1999: to expand NATO and cement \na stable democratic and free Europe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the resolution \nratifying the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nNATO, to include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, \nRomania, and Bulgaria.\n  NATO has been the bedrock of international security since its \nestablishment 54 years ago. Although the military dimension of the \nalliance was instrumental in containing the Soviet Union, NATO was \nalways about more than military security. America's relationship with \nour NATO allies has symbolized the common values, as well as the common \ninterests, of democracies united against those international actors who \nrepresent tyranny and aggression.\n  We live at a time of danger, unpredictability, and potential global \ninstability. But we also live in a time of historic opportunity. \nAlliances are not absolved from the forces of change in world affairs. \nThe ability to adapt to the challenges of this new era in world \naffairs--challenges from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction--\nspeak to the importance of NATO and other international institutions, \nincluding the United Nations, that have played such key roles in \npromoting and protecting our common interests since World War II.\n  NATO's decision in November 2002 to expand its current membership of \n19 by inviting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania, \nand Bulgaria to begin accession negotiations acknowledges the \nimperatives of change. I strongly endorse this action. Today, member \nand candidate countries are expected to do what they can to modernize \ntheir forces, including development of niche capabilities and the \nestablishment of a NATO response force. But we know that the \ncontributions of an enlarged NATO will not be defined solely by \nmilitary capabilities. Expanding NATO also encourages a process of \npolitical and economic reform in candidate states.\n  There is a deep security dimension to an expanded NATO. The threats \nfrom terrorism and weapons of mass destruction cannot be handled by the \nUnited States or any country alone. Defeating terrorism requires \nunprecedented international cooperation in the diplomatic, military, \nlaw enforcement, intelligence, and economic areas. If our purpose in an \nexpanded NATO is about defeating these threats to our common security, \nthan bringing these seven new members into NATO is critical to our \nnational security.\n  Although America's military power may be unprecedented in world \nhistory,\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\nNATO will continue to play a vital role in American and global \nsecurity. In Afghanistan, the German proposal for NATO to take charge \nof the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, represents a new \nand significant turn in NATO's mission. NATO may well play a role in \nmaintaining security in postwar Iraq. At some point, when there is an \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace agreement, NATO troops may be called upon to \nhelp guarantee that peace.\n  I believe NATO's next 50 years will be just as important for world \npeace as its first 50 years.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to urge the ratification of Treaty \nDocument 108-14, allowing for the accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, NATO.\n  I wish to commend the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, as well as the ranking minority member, \nSenator Biden, for the work their committee has done to prepare for \nthis historic vote. Since the first accession to the original \nmembership of NATO, when Greece and Turkey were admitted, the Senate \nhas preserved its role of advice and consent on amending this treaty. \nSenators Lugar and Biden, who have made the advancement of the Atlantic \nalliance a central concern in their respected careers as two of the \nSenate's most thoughtful members on foreign policy, have maintained the \nSenate's critical function, and have, through hearings and statements \nthrough the years, provided many opportunities to study the policies \nand the evolution of the U.S. national interest within the Atlantic \nalliance.\n  This is the second time we have voted to ratify the North Atlantic \ntreaty since the end of the cold war. President Clinton supported the \nfirst group of new entrants in 1998, and at that time I joined 79 of my \ncolleagues in support of membership for Poland, the Czech Republic and \nHungary. When I took to this floor to urge ratification, I said: ``I \nhope this is not the last enlargement, although I am confident that \nfuture enlargements, if they occur, will occur with the same detailed, \npainstaking consideration as we have conducted over the past 4 years.'' \nSenators Lugar and Biden have given this accession treaty that \nconsideration, and their committee has unanimously recommended passage. \nIn so doing, the committee has concluded its work to achieve a major \nplatform in President Bush's foreign policy: the admittance to this \nalliance of the latest group of nations willing and capable to advance \nthe mission of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  We will all note that the debate today will be shorter than it was in \n1998. And I predict that the vote for passage will be at least as \nstrong, although it is worthwhile noting that every vote this Senate \nhas had since 1955 on all of the new entrants to NATO has been with \nstrong majorities. The reason the debate will be shorter today reflects \nthe consensus that has formed on the subject we address today:\n  The enlargement of NATO, Mr. President, is good foreign policy for \nthe United States.\n  Of course it is also good for the candidate countries. Working \nthrough our detailed membership action plans, these nations have \ntransformed their militaries, improving interoperability and--this is \nequally important--developing complementarities of missions. They have \nhad to accept goals for defense expenditures, exceeding, in some cases, \nthe percentage of GNPs dedicated to defense by some of NATO's older \nmembers.\n  And the desire to join NATO has forced the applicant nations to \npromote and meet other conditions of open and democratic societies. \nThese nations have had to resolve all border issues, establish \npolitical norms for the protection of minorities, open their historical \narchives and accept the responsibilities of their captive or \ntotalitarian pasts, including the Holocaust era and the communist era, \ncombat corruption and set standards of transparency, and educate their \npublics on the nature of the commitment to NATO. Throughout these years \nof preparation, we have seen, in varying strong and distinct measures, \na host of nations enthusiastically embracing our values and earnestly \naccepting the responsibilities explicit in membership of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\n  The core of that responsibility lies in article V of the North \nAtlantic treaty. That article states: ``The Parties (that is, the \nmember states) agree that an armed attack against one or more of them \nshall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they \nagree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise \nof the right of individual and collective self-defense recognized by \nArticle 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party \nor Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert \nwith other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the \nuse of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North \nAtlantic area.''\n  This is the commitment at the core of the NATO alliance. It is that \ncommitment that served to deter a Soviet attack against Europe and \nNorth America for nearly 50 years. That was a deterrence that was \nbacked up by an explicit understanding that, if deterrence failed, \nNATO's goal would be to predominate in victory. The deterrence worked, \nthe peace was kept, and that is why NATO is rightly considered the most \neffective military alliance in modern history.\n\n  The end of the cold war brought on a reevaluation of the role of \nNATO, with a few suggesting that NATO was no longer necessary without a \nSoviet threat. That misguided view--that mistook the end of the Soviet \nthreat for an era of unprecedented peace and security--never took hold. \nMore sober minds recognized that security and stability were not to be \nassumed as the status quo, and that conflict would take new forms, be \nit ethnic war from the dissolution of Yugoslavia to transnational \nthreats emanating from other parts of the world and threatening the \nsecurity of Europe and North America.\n  As has already been mentioned in the debate, NATO has only invoked \narticle V once in its history, and it was not during the cold war when, \nas I mentioned, the deterrence of the alliance always held. Article V \nwas invoked after September 11, 2001, when the members of the alliance \ndetermined that the attacks by al-Qaida on the United States were to be \nconsidered an attack against the entire alliance. In the days after \nSeptember 11, 2001, NATO aircraft flew patrols over U.S. airspace as \nthe U.S. military prepared to deploy to Afghanistan in the first phase \nof our global war on terrorism.\n  Under U.S. leadership, NATO has accepted that it will face new \nmissions in the 21st century, and that many of those activities \ndefending the members of the alliance will be out-of-area missions. A \nquick review of the contributions of the nations seeking membership in \nthis latest treaty accession demonstrates, in my view, that they \nunderstand the new missions and are already contributing.\n  Bulgaria was a member of the President Bush's ``coalition of the \nwilling,'' and granted use of its airspace as well as an airbase for \nour Iraq operations, and has offered infantry forces for peacekeeping. \nWhile Iraq was not a NATO operation, our ability to rely on Bulgaria, \nas well as other existing NATO members for equipment and support, made \nour victory in Iraq more easily attainable.\n  Estonia has been contributing to NATO operations in the Balkans, \nproviding forces to SFOR and KFOR. It was also a member of the \n``coalition of the willing,'' and has also offered soldiers for post-\nconflict peacekeeping in Iraq. Similarly, Latvia has also contributed \nto SFOR and KFOR in the Balkans, supported U.S. policy in Iraq, and has \nsent medics to support our operations in Afghanistan. Lithuania has \ncontributed to U.S. operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan, and was \na vocal member of the ``coalition of the willing'' in Iraq.\n  Romania has made significant contributions to U.S. operations, \nproviding troops and transport aircraft to our mission in Afghanistan, \nand granting use of their territory during our operations in Iraq. One \nthousand American troops are currently stationed in Romania.\n  These are just highlights of ways that these countries have directly \ncontributed to the challenges we face\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\ntoday, and they do not include the specialties these various countries \nare developing to confront the challenges of tomorrow.\n  I raise these highlights because I believe that ratifying this treaty \nis good foreign policy, Mr. President, in that it strengthens America's \nposition in the world, and enhances our ability to achieve our goals \nwhen the defense of our national security requires us to go beyond our \nborders.\n  This second wave of nations joining NATO since the end of the cold \nwar brings political stability and expands security to most of Central \nand Eastern Europe, a geographic zone that brought us calamitous strife \nand bloodshed in the 20th century. We are referring to a region that \nSecretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, has felicitously termed the \n``New Europe.'' I have nothing against the Old Europe, and note that \nhistory shows a common bond with many of the nations of that ``Old'' \nEurope, a bond reaffirmed by our coalition partner, Great Britain, and \ncurrently and I hope temporarily denied by other members, such as \nFrance, Germany and Belgium.\n  Today we vote for New Europe. In recognizing their contributions, we \nshould not deny their enthusiastic embrace of America's role in the \nworld. They were, after all, the captive nations of the Soviet era, and \nwe were, after all, the leading light in the fight against communism. \nIn their enthusiastic embrace of our values and our missions, I think \nof the line of Cicero, that ``Gratitude is not only the greatest of \nvirtues, but the parent of all others.'' These nations have shown \nalready that they are willing to defend freedom, and their membership \nin the Atlantic alliance will advance that defense.\n  I will repeat again what I said in 1998, and say that I hope this is \nnot the last enlargement. Croatia and Ukraine have indicated that they \nwish to join some day, and I would welcome them. The mission of NATO is \nto defend, not exclude.\n  Today I urge my colleagues to join me in ratifying this latest round \nof accession to NATO, and in so doing, to add force and depth to an \norganization that has long served the security of this Nation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposed North \nAmerican Treaty Alliance expansion before the Senate today.\n  When the NATO countries met in Prague last November, they agreed to \ninvite seven new countries to join the Alliance as full members. These \nseven countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia and Slovenia have submitted their applications and proven \ntheir willingness and ability to respect the political and military \nobligations of NATO membership and to contribute to the Alliance's \ncommon-funded budgets and programs.\n  The NATO Alliance has been enormously successful over the last 50 \nyears and will continue to do so for many to come. Too often some only \nsee NATO as a coalition of nations organized for collective defense. It \nis so much more. NATO enhances the political and economic stability for \nall countries in the Euro-Atlantic area. By helping these new members \nas they strengthen good governance, rule of law, and human rights, NATO \nwill also facilitate a better long-term environment for American trade \nand investment as well as collective defense and security.\n  In our war against terrorism, NATO serves a vital role. Strengthening \nthe Alliance for this purpose is a positive development. From the \nconflicts in the Balkans, the war in Afghanistan or the most recent \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, the seven invitee nations have contributed, or \nhave committed to contribute, critical support in the form of \npersonnel, overflight or basing rights.\n  As a matter of fact, in this most recent war with Iraq, we received \ngreater support from these seven countries than some of our more \nhistorical European allies. The value of loyal allies committed to \ndemocracy and making the world free from tyranny, regardless of any \nbusiness dealings, cannot be understated.\n  These seven countries are committed to eliminating and addressing \npast wrongs. Whether it is the atrocities performed during the Second \nWorld War and the Holocaust to the proliferation of military weaponry \nknown as Grey Arms, each of these countries has recognized the issues \nand is committed to correcting the wrongs done.\n  Expansion of NATO is not a new or unusual event. Throughout its \ntenure, NATO has continually added new members. Turkey and Greece were \nthe first new members to join in 1952, followed soon after by Germany, \nin 1955. Spain entered in 1982 and the first former Warsaw Pact \ncountries, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined in 1999.\n  It is also likely there will be another round of expansion, inviting \nsuch countries as Albania, Croatia and Macedonia. President Bush has \nespoused an ``open door'' policy to NATO membership.\n  Today the door should not be held open for some and kept shut for \nothers. The defined membership criteria encourages all that satisfy \nthese requirements will be welcomed.\n  NATO expansion will serve U.S. interests by strengthening both NATO \nand our bilateral ties with these new allies, who have already done a \ngreat deal to support our vision for NATO and collective security.\n  I do have concerns regarding NATO and its future viability. We need \nto take a long look at the arbitrary and politically motivated, but \nindefensible use of the ``consensus rule'' NATO employs, and those \nnations who try to manipulate the path to peace for less than honorable \npurposes.\n  I understand my good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, and \nSenator Levin will offer an amendment related to the ``consensus \nrule.'' I think the amendment is a good idea and deserves the support \nof this body.\n  Finally, the path to peace is broad enough to allow all those who \nwish to traverse it in good company. We should welcome them with open \narms.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have enjoyed watching this debate \nwith my colleagues on the topic of expanding the North Atlantic \nAlliance. This new round of expansion is one of the most significant \nevents in the alliance's history and will have a profound impact on \nTrans-Atlantic relations for a long time. The message I bring and I \nthink my colleagues bring is that the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, NATO, is still vital to our security and expansion will \nmake it all the more stronger. Seven countries, Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, have made bids to join NATO.\n  This debate has evolved in such a way as to recognize the strengths \nand weaknesses of the alliance in a sober way. The hyperbolic debate \nover burden-sharing and the contributions of some our allies, whether \nmaterial or physical, has gone by the way-side with this new round of \nexpansion. The contributions of alliance members is no less important--\nin fact, it is a central tenet to the success of the alliance. Rather, \nby inviting these seven new members, we have focussed more attention on \nhow better to integrate, and give opportunity and prominence to those \nstates that wish to contribute more to the collective security of the \nalliance.\n  At a hearing the Foreign Relations Committee held on the first of \nApril, one of the witnesses, Bruce Jackson of the Project on \nTransitional Democracies made several excellent points about these new \ncandidates, one of which I should emphasize for the sake of my \ncolleagues who were not present.\n  I will revert to the question of contributions and military power. \nMany critics have focussed on the current capabilities and potential \ncontributions of these seven countries and questioned whether and what \nthey will bring to the alliance. Mr. Jackson pointed to the fact that \nwhen West Germany was invited to join NATO, it had neither an army nor \na defense budget.\n  By contrast, the Baltic states have taken it upon themselves to \norchestrate regional security agreements and contribute a rational \nportion of their budgets to national defense. The Balkan countries \njoining the alliance, Romania and Bulgaria, have militaries that can be \nimmediately utilized for NATO operations. In fact, all of the seven \ncountries, have themselves contributed to NATO missions in Europe, to \nOperation Enduring Freedom, OEF, in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, OIF.\n  Romania pulled together 100 of its personnel for SFOR in Bosnia, \ncontributed 200 to KFOR in Kosovo. Romania\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\ncommitted itself and contributed substantially to our efforts \nduring Operation Enduring freedom, OEF, and the International Security \nAssistance Force, ISAF. For OEF, they sent a 400-person battalion to \nserve in Kandahar. For ISAF, they sent a military police platoon to \nKabul to support securing the Afghan capital. In support for the \nsecurity and revitalization of a post-conflict Afghanistan, Romania \nairlifted arms and munitions to be used by a newly reconstituted Afghan \nNational Army. In Iraq, Romania has sent a WMD unit to assist in force \nprotection and have committed to providing peacekeepers and police to \nassist in the security of that country.\n\n  In 1997, during the debate to enlarge NATO for the Czech Republic, \nPoland and Hungary, the emphasis was and for President Bush especially, \nstill is a unified and free Europe. Our mission then was to stand \nbeside these democracies and direct them to a bright future of freedom, \ndemocracy and prosperity.\n  The assumption of all the states woven into the North Atlantic Treaty \nis a common set of values among its members. These values, democracy \nand free markets, are the values in which this collective security \nagreement is defending. Ensconced in the treaty signed on April 4, 1949 \nwere the shared values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of \nlaw, the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes, civilian control \nof the military, and central to the treaty's purpose, commitment to the \nstability and well-being of the countries party to the treaty.\n  I have in my hands a copy of the Atlantic Charter, a document that \nvery much predates the North Atlantic Alliance and was penned during \nthe dark days of World War II by British Prime Minister Winston \nChurchill and US President Franklin Roosevelt. This document espoused \nthe foundations on which NATO was born--liberty, self-determination, \nperpetuation of prosperity and collective security.\n  Though not the axiom which keeps the alliance glued together, it is \ndifficult to ignore that, as much as the territory, it is those \nprinciples that the alliance is fighting to protect.\n  Here in this building we should think proud of our institutions and \ntheir triumph on the world's stage. Not for the hubris at the moment of \nvictory, but for the better tomorrow which all our new European friends \nwill enjoy after the half-century of abandonment behind the Berlin \nWall.\n  Our commitment should never waiver and our continuing mission should \nremain clear in our minds. We should have enough charity in our hearts \nto realize the world around us that does not enjoy the freedom we do, \nand be willing to push the borders of liberty beyond the comfortable \nworld in which we occupy. Seven countries are now eagerly awaiting the \nadvice and consent of this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following document in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          The Atlantic Charter\n\n       The President of the United States of America and the Prime \n     Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty's \n     Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it \n     right to make known certain common principles in the national \n     policies of their respective countries on which they base \n     their hopes for a better future for the world.\n       First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial \n     or other;\n       Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do \n     not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples \n     concerned;\n       Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the \n     form of government under which they will live; and they wish \n     to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those \n     who have been forcibly deprived of them;\n       Fourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their \n     existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, \n     great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal \n     terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world \n     which are needed for their economic prosperity;\n       Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration \n     between all nations in the economic field with the object of \n     securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic \n     advancement and social security;\n       Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, \n     they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all \n     nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own \n     boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men \n     in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from \n     fear and want;\n       Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the \n     high seas and oceans without hindrance;\n       Eighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, \n     for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the \n     abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be \n     maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be \n     employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, \n     aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending \n     the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general \n     security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. \n     They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable \n     measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the \n     crushing burden of armaments.\n       Franklin D. Roosevelt\n       Winston S. Churchill\n       Source: Samuel Rosenman, ed., Public Papers and Addresses \n     of Franklin D. Roosevelt, vol. 10 (1938-1950), 314.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a \nletter dated May 7, 2003, be printed in the Record in regard to the \nNATO enlargement protocol.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist and Minority Leader Daschle: As the full \n     Senate prepares to take up consideration for modifications to \n     the North Atlantic Treaty in order to accommodate new members \n     in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Alliance, we \n     feel that it is fitting to make a number of observations \n     concerning this important step forward in trans-Atlantic \n     relations.\n       We wish to express our satisfaction with those portions of \n     the draft resolution of ratification now before the Senate \n     which preserve intelligence equities.\n       Draft Condition (3) has two parts. Subsection (A) would \n     require the President to submit a report, by January 1, 2004, \n     to the Congress intelligence committees on the progress of \n     the indicted accession countries in satisfying the security \n     sector and security vetting requirements for NATO membership. \n     We feel that this report is essential. Fitness for NATO \n     membership is a function not only of adequate general \n     security procedures, but also of the strength of national \n     structures ostensibly in place to ensure effective political \n     control over the activity of security services. We suggest \n     that the indicated report should cover the latter \n     consideration as well as the former.\n       Subsection (B) of draft Condition (3) would require the \n     President to report, by January 1, 2004, to the Congressional \n     intelligence committees on the protection of intelligence \n     sources and methods by accession countries. The report would \n     identify the latest procedures and requirements established \n     by accession countries to protect intelligence sources and \n     methods. The report would also include an assessment of how \n     these countries' overall procedures and requirements for the \n     protection of intelligence sources and methods compare with \n     the same procedures and requirements of other NATO members.\n       As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence observed \n     during the last round of NATO expansion (see, Exec. Rpt. 105-\n     14, 105th Congress, 2d Session, p. 56, 57, March 6, 1998), a \n     number of factors should be taken into account to assess the \n     reliability of accession countries to protect NATO sources \n     and methods, namely: The strength of democratic reforms, with \n     a focus on ministerial and legislative oversight of \n     intelligence services and activities; the degree to which \n     accession countries have succeeded in reforming their \n     civilian and military intelligence services, including the \n     ability of the services to hire and retain qualified Western-\n     oriented officers, and the evolution of political and public \n     support for these services; Russian intelligence objectives \n     directed against these countries, including any \n     disinformation campaigns designed to derail, retard, or taint \n     their integration with the West; counterintelligence and \n     other security activities being pursued by the accession \n     countries and the adequacy of resources devoted to these \n     efforts; and the work underway between the [accession \n     countries] and NATO to ensure that security standards will be \n     met by the time [they] join the Alliance.\n       The context for cooperation with NATO accession countries \n     has changed drastically since 1998, given Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and other events which \n     have underscored the willingness of several accession \n     countries to cooperate with their former adversaries in the \n     West to fight terrorism and other critical threats. It is \n     also apparent that democratic reforms among the NATO \n     accession countries have taken strong root and are \n     irreversible.\n       It is less clear that there has been similar progress in \n     other areas identified by the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence in 1998 as critical indicators of likely \n     performance, such as counter-intelligence and resistance to \n     Russian attempts to influence policy. In short, security-\n     related concerns about NATO expansion that concerned Senators \n     in 1998 remain valid, although the atmosphere for lasting and \n     positive change is vastly improved. We look forward to the \n     Administration's report on these indicators.\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\n       On the whole, we feel that U.S. intelligence equities can \n     be safeguarded with this new round of NATO enlargement. We \n     look forward to continuing our work with the Administration \n     during the accession process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pat Roberts,\n       Chairman.\n     John D. Rockefeller IV,\n       Vice Chairman.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this resolution \nof ratification for the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization.\n  The accession to NATO of these seven new democracies--Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia--is an \nhistoric event that will have far-reaching and, in my view, very \nbeneficial consequences.\n  Just a dozen or so years ago, these countries were under the boot of \nSoviet domination and communist dictatorship. Against their will, they \nwere arrayed against NATO as members of the now defunct Warsaw Pact. \nToday, they stand ready and willing to join forces with NATO, the \norganization that played such a major role in bringing freedom to their \npart of the world.\n  We are striking a blow for freedom here today. Millions of people in \neastern Europe live free today because of the commitment, patience and \nfirmness of America and her allies during the cold war. And through \ntheir accession to NATO, those millions will now be able to live in \ngreater security, as well as take part in the noble pursuit of \ndefending the liberty of others.\n  The expansion of NATO into eastern Europe will serve American \ninterests in several ways. For starters, these seven nations, I \nbelieve, will help reinvigorate NATO's sense of purpose; which is, \nfirst and foremost, the defense of liberty.\n  With memories of tyranny so fresh in their minds, the people of these \nnations no doubt have a deep appreciation for the freedom that is \nsometimes take for granted in the West. Thus, they are apt to have \nfewer reservations than some of our other allies about confronting the \naggression of those who are hostile to our way of life. This \nappreciation for freedom--and for those who helped them during the cold \nwar--was unquestionably a factor in the strong support that each of \nthese seven nations gave us in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Most of the prospective members have very limited military \ncapabilities, and we will certainly expect them to invest properly in \ntheir armed forces in the coming years. But many of these countries \nalready possess excellent specialized capabilities, such as the Polish \nspecial forces who fought in Iraq or the Slovak WMD defense unit now \nserving in the Gulf. Over time, I am confident that each of these \ncountries will find it own niche in NATO.\n  Expansion of the NATO alliance to these countries will also offer us \nthe opportunity to diversify and reorder our basing arrangements--the \nneed for which, I believe, has been demonstrated by 9/11 and the runup \nto the Iraq War. In the future, it is clear that U.S. forces will need \nmore flexibility--both geographic and political--than ever. It thus \nbehooves us to review our basing structure in Europe with an eye toward \nrelocating some--though certainly not all--of our forces.\n  NATO expansion serves that end. Many of the prospective members--\nRomania and Bulgaria in particular--are located closer to where U.S. \nforces are likely to see action in the future. Their governments are \nknown to be actively interested in hosting U.S. forces. Polls indicate \nstrong pro-American sentiment in these countries.\n  Mr. President, 65 years ago, Eastern Europe began a horrific descent \ninto darkness with the deal that was struck at Munich. Yalta then \nsolidified what was to be another 45 years of communist tyranny for \nthese nations. Those tragic mistakes are being rectified here today, \nand we should be proud.\n  But make no mistake, the expansion of NATO is more than just a \nrearward-looking act of humanity. It is also a forward-looking act of \nstatemanship that will serve U.S. interests well in the future.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my full support for \nthe Treaty on NATO Expansion. As chairman of the Senate Delegation to \nthe NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I cannot underscore strongly enough \nthe value of including these seven nations in the NATO Alliance. I \napplaud and support the administration's leadership on bringing NATO \nenlargement to the Senate.\n  These seven prospective member nations have made great strides in \ndeveloping responsible democratic governments, free-market economies, \ncivil society, and transparent and accountable armed forces. As their \nactive support for the Global War on Terrorism and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom demonstrates, these nations share our values and are willing--\nand able--to help promote democracy and freedom around the world.\n  I believe that it is significant that each invitee has provided \ndirect military support for the Global War on Terrorism, having \ncontributed overflight rights, transit and basing privileges, military \nand police forces, medical units, or transport support to U.S.-led \nefforts. They have provided noteworthy support to the International \nSecurity Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan and NATO efforts to \nstabilize the Balkans. And, as has been mentioned many times today, \nthese countries provided resounding support for U.S. policy on Iraq. I \nbelieve that these efforts merely herald the beginning of immense, \nenduring contributions to come from these nations.\n  As cochair of the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus, I would be remiss to \nnot express particularly ardent support for the accession of Estonia, \nLatvia and Lithuania to NATO. Through working with groups like the \nBaltic American Freedom League, the U.S.-Baltic Foundation and the \nJoint Baltic American National Committee, I have first-hand knowledge \nof the large grassroots public support across the U.S. for inclusion of \nthese noble nations in NATO. These organizations deserve recognition \nfor their decades of work to help liberate and secure the future of the \nBaltics.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as you know, I had originally intended to \noffer an amendment to the pending resolution adding an additional \ndeclaration to the nine that were added during the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's consideration of this matter. My amendment would have dealt \nwith a topic already covered by the Warner-Levin amendment, namely the \nrelevancy of the consensus rule by which the North Atlantic Council has \nhistorically carried out its decision making. Now that the Senate has \nadopted the Warner-Levin amendment by voice vote, I do not see any need \nto proceed with my amendment.\n  My amendment would not have answered the question of whether in fact \nthe consensus rule is relevant now that the world has profoundly \nchanged and the membership of the organization has greatly expanded. It \nwould however have appropriately called upon the President to review \nthis matter as we move forward to sign off on the accession of seven \nadditional members to this important organization.\n  We all know that the latest round of NATO expansion--Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia--will bring \nNATO membership up to 26 countries. And at least three more remain \npoised for admission in the coming years: Albania, Croatia, and \nMacedonia.\n  Let me be clear. I am all for offering NATO membership to any \ndemocracy that wants to join and can contribute to our common security. \nBut I am wondering how all this expansion will affect the decision-\nmaking capabilities of NATO as an organization.\n  For more than 50 years, NATO decisionmaking has been based on \nconsensus--every member state must agree on every important course of \naction. When 16 NATO countries all faced a common Soviet threat, \nachieving consensus on major issues was not much of a problem.\n  We may very soon--within a few years--have 29 members of NATO, from \nall across Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. That is almost \ndouble the number we had not too many years ago. The idea that the \nalliance's decisions will soon be dependent on the unanimous consent of \nso many diverse nations, seems to me, potentially a recipe for \nstalemate in NATO decision-making.\n  My personal view is that NATO should consider creating some form of \n``top-tier administrative council''--similar the U.N. Security \nCouncil--to prevent the diminution of NATO's power and effectiveness as \na military alliance.\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\n  At last year's NATO summit in Prague, President Bush pressed for \n``the most significant reforms in NATO since 1949.'' He was mainly \nreferring to the creation of a rapid reaction force to deal swiftly and \neffectively with new and emerging threats.\n  Last month, Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman reiterated this \nidea during his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nHe rightly pointed out that NATO needs to be ``equipped with new \ncapabilities and organized into highly ready land, air and sea forces \nable to carry out missions anywhere in the world.''\n  Mr. Grossman was referring to the need for the creation of a ``NATO \nResponse Force'' to handle serious global challenges, such as \nproliferation and terrorism. I agree with him that such a force would \nbe beneficial. But I also believe that is only half of the story. It \nseems to be stating the obvious that each addition to NATO will \nlogically affect in some way the organization, mission, and \neffectiveness of this proposed rapid response force.\n  Just as I agree that NATO needs to tailor itself to future global \nchallenges by standing up a NATO Response Force, I can foresee \nscenarios in which quick and decisive action will be needed in a very \nshort amount of time--perhaps days.\n  I think it is reasonable to ask whether it will always be necessary \nor desirable for all 26, or 29, members of NATO to be involved in every \naspect of the deployment of this force?\n  If the answer to that question is no, then shouldn't we at least ask \nthe U.S. administration to study the question of whether NATO should \nconsider a more streamlined decisionmaking structure for NATO to take \ninto account both NATO's new missions, and the alliance's ever-\nexpanding membership. The Levin-Warner amendment should allow a serious \nreview and discussion of that issue.\n  As I have stated earlier, I am a strong supporter of the pending \nProtocol approving the new members to NATO. We all want a strong and \nvibrant NATO. I believe that the resolution of ratification, with the \ndeclarations and conditions that have been appended by the Senate will \nhelp to make that possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 535\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that it is appropriate at this time to proceed to the \nWarner-Levin-Roberts-Sessions amendment. I send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Sessions, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 535.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To propose an additional declaration)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following new declaration:\n       (10) Consideration of certain issues with respect to nato \n     decision-making and membership.--\n       (A) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, not later than the date that is eighteen months after \n     the date of the adoption of this resolution, the President \n     should place on the agenda for discussion at the North \n     Atlantic Council--\n       (i) the NATO ``consensus rule''; and\n       (ii) the merits of establishing a process for suspending \n     the membership in NATO of a member country that no longer \n     complies with the NATO principles of democracy, individual \n     liberty, and the rule of law set forth in the preamble to the \n     North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (B) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the discussion at \n     the North Atlantic Council of each of the issues described in \n     clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the President shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     that describes--\n       (i) the steps the United States has taken to place these \n     issues on the agenda for discussion at the North Atlantic \n     Council;\n       (ii) the views of the United States on these issues as \n     communicated to the North Atlantic Council by the \n     representatives of the United States to the Council;\n       (iii) the discussions of these issues at the North Atlantic \n     Council, including any decision that has been reached with \n     respect to the issues;\n       (iv) methods to provide more flexibility to the Supreme \n     Allied Commander Europe to plan potential contingency \n     operations before the formal approval of such planning by the \n     North Atlantic Council; and\n       (v) methods to streamline the process by which NATO makes \n     decisions with respect to conducting military campaigns.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I, first, wish to thank the distinguished \nmanagers, my two colleagues and friends, with whom my friend and \npartner for 25 years, Senator Levin, and I have had the privilege of \nworking these many years, over a quarter of a century in the Senate. We \nhave, I think, reached a common understanding that I will proceed for \nseveral minutes, followed by my colleague from Michigan, and in such \ntime the two managers will address their perspective on this particular \namendment. I think they are generally in support; however, I shall let \nthe managers speak for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on \nAccession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia \nand Slovenia. The Protocols that we are considering today would allow \nthose seven nations to become full members of the NATO alliance.\n  My colleagues may recall that, in 1998, I did not vote in favor of \nthe expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic. My opposition at that time was not directed at those three \ncountries. Rather, I was concerned with the broader question of how the \nexpansion of NATO to include newly democratizing countries of Central \nand Eastern Europe would affect NATO's future missions and its \neffectiveness as a military alliance.\n  NATO's success in integrating the new members admitted in 1999, and \nNATO's commitment to enhancing its defense capabilities and those of \nits prospective new members, have helped persuade me to support the \nenlargement of NATO today. But I remain concerned that NATO's \nenlargement by seven additional nations--the largest enlargement in \nAlliance history--could have dramatic implications for NATO's ability \nto function as an effective military organization.\n  Today, the threats to NATO member nations come from within and \nwithout NATO's periphery. Because of NATO' success, there is no Soviet \nUnion or Warsaw Pact. The threats--such as terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction--are transnational in \nnature, and they emanate from regions outside of Europe. This was \nrecognized in the Strategic Concept NATO adopted 1999, which envisioned \nNATO ``out of area'' operations to address new threats. To remain a \nviable military alliance, NATO must have both the military capability \nand the political will to respond to the new threats. NATO's recent \ndecision to assume the lead of the International Security Assistance \nForce in Afghanistan, and its willingness to consider supporting a \nstabilization force in Iraq, are welcome examples of new NATO missions \nappropriate to today's threats.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has a long tradition of strong \nsupport for the NATO alliance, and has played an important role in the \nSenate's consideration of the North Atlantic Treaty and its subsequent \namendments. In March and April 2003, the committee conducted two \nhearings on the future of NATO and on NATO enlargement. The \nAdministration witnesses at these hearings unanimously supported \nratification of the NATO enlargement Protocols.\n  One of the issues the committee examined in its NATO hearings was \nwhether the prospective new members would enhance the military \neffectiveness of the alliance, and how their membership would affect \nthe capabilities gap that currently exists between the United States \nand many other members of NATO.\n\n  The witnesses who appeared before our committee testified that NATO \nwas taking concerted efforts to address the ongoing problem of a \ncapabilities and technology gap. They noted the decisions taken by \nNATO's leaders at the Prague Summit in November, 2002, to launch the \nPrague Capabilities Commitment and to create a NATO Response Force. \nThrough the Prague Capabilities Commitment, NATO members agreed to \nspend smarter, pool\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\ntheir resources and pursue ``niche'' specializations such as lift \ncapability, or precision-guided munitions. The NATO response force is \nenvisioned to be a highly ready, rapid reaction force of approximately \n25,000 troops with land, sea and air capability, deployable on short \nnotice and able to carry out missions anywhere in the world. The \nresponse force will reinforce the need for individual alliance members \nto develop and contribute unique capabilities to this new force.\n  Regarding the military capabilities of the prospective new members, I \nwas impressed that each of them is similarly being encouraged to focus \non specific ``niche'' capabilities where they can achieve a high level \nof expertise and procure high quality equipment to make a substantial \ncontribution to NATO's military capabilities overall. Some of the \ninvitees already possess specialized capabilities that have served the \nalliance in the Balkan operations and in the global war on terrorism, \nincluding: special forces, nuclear, biological, and chemical defense, \nmountain fighting, and demining.\n  Equally persuasive was the testimony of our witnesses regarding the \ncontributions of the nations admitted to NATO in 1989. Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic have proved to be steadfast allies and active \nforce contributors to NATO operations in the Balkans, and in the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  Mr. President, historically, I was among those who objected to the \nlast enlargement of NATO. At this time, I very carefully considered the \nproposal by our distinguished President, President Bush, and other \nworld leaders, that the time has come for new members to be brought in. \nI commend the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense for the \ncareful procedures that led up to the nominations of these new \ncountries to come into the membership of NATO.\n  I am privileged to be on the floor now and to cast my vote in favor \nof these protocols which will enable the seven countries to become \nmembers of NATO in due course.\n  I have to say, I still have some of the concerns I had last time \nbecause NATO is such a magnificent organization. Over half a century it \nhas proven its worth time and time again. The Warsaw Pact does not \nexist, the threats from the Soviet Union do not exist, largely because \nof the wisdom incorporated in this treaty, and the combination of the \nmilitary commitments and the political will of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Alliance members over the years to have that alliance stand \nthere as a deterrent. It has worked, and it has worked well.\n  We cannot foresee the future and, therefore, we must be flexible \nbecause worldwide threats have gone through such a major \ntransformation, from major nation-state-sponsored threats to worldwide \nterrorism, so much of it non-state sponsored. For that reason I want to \nsupport the admission of these new nations.\n  Further, while so many of these newly democratic nations do not bring \na large army, large navy, or a large air force, in due course their \n``niche'' military capabilities will add a very valuable dimension to \nNATO's ever expanding responsibilities.\n  NATO is participating actively in Afghanistan, and contemplating \nparticipating actively in Iraq in peacekeeping and support roles. I \nshall not discuss this in detail. Nevertheless, that is a tribute to \nLord Robertson and others who have recognized that the threat to NATO \nnations comes from beyond their periphery now, but could be brought \nwithin their periphery at any time by the threat of worldwide \nterrorism. Those are the reasons I support NATO's participation in \n``out of area'' operations in Afghanistan and post-conflict Iraq.\n  I remember the words of Ben Franklin as he emerged from the \nConstitutional Convention and a reporter stopped and asked him: Mr. \nFranklin: What have you wrought? And his reply was very simple: A \nrepublic, if you can keep it.\n  There is a challenge to these NATO nations, soon to be 26 in number. \nYou have the heritage of this great treaty of over half a century, and \nthe challenge is, can we keep it?\n  I think we can. I think we will. Within the current thinking on NATO, \nSenator Levin, I, and others have identified two issues that dominated \nour committee's hearings on NATO: the so-called ``consensus rule'' by \nwhich NATO operates and the question of whether NATO should have a \nprocess for suspending the membership of a nation that is no longer \ncommitted to upholding NATO's basic democratic principles.\n  With respect to the consensus rule, the recent divisive debate over \nplanning for the defense of Turkey in the event of war with Iraq \ndemonstrated that achieving consensus in NATO has become more \ndifficult. How difficult will it be with 26 nations? A different \nmanifestation of this problem occurred with respect to NATO operations \nin Kosovo when ``command by committee'' hampered NATO's leaders' \nability to wage the most effective, rapidly responsive military \ncampaign. Such difficulties in reaching consensus are occurring in part \nbecause respective NATO members have different views, as they should, \nabout today's threats and how best to respond to them. Achieving \nconsensus is likely to become even more complex as NATO enlarges its \nmembership. That is why I believe--and my colleagues join me on this--\nthe consensus rule, and NATO's operating procedures more generally, \nshould be periodically reexamined to ensure that NATO has procedures \nthat allow it to plan, reach decisions, and act in a timely fashion.\n  Regarding the issue of a suspension mechanism, some of our committee \nmembers have expressed concern about the lack of a mechanism for \nsuspending a NATO member if that nation no longer complies with the \nfundamental tenets of NATO--democracy, individual liberty, and the rule \nof law.\n  While it may well be true that NATO has ways other than suspension to \ndeal with such a situation, it is prudent for NATO to consider the \nmatter now, as a conceptual problem, and have some options in mind, \nrather than be confronted with a problem in the future, and be somewhat \nunprepared should it arise.\n  Given the tremendous interest of the Armed Services Committee in \nthese two subjects, I, along with Senators Levin, Roberts, and \nSessions, am offering an amendment to the resolution of ratification \nfor these protocols that would urge the President--I repeat, urge the \nPresident--of the United States to raise these subjects for discussion \nin the North Atlantic Council at NATO, and request that a report on \nthese subjects be provided to the relevant committees of the Congress.\n  I have consulted closely with administration officials, and \nnegotiated the language in this amendment with administration officials \nway into last night, in order to receive their support, and they have \nno objections today. I hope we can achieve that because we have--\nSenator Levin and I, speaking for our group--have made some concessions \nin order to have this matter treated in such a way that the whole \nSenate can be supportive.\n\n  I conclude by saying, based on the hearings conducted by the Armed \nServices Committee and subsequent analysis, I am persuaded that the \nNATO enlargement protocols we are considering today will advance the \nnational security interests of the United States and deserve the \nSenate's support.\n  Lastly, on the assumption that NATO, I think very wisely, will take a \nrole in Afghanistan, on the assumption again that NATO, again very \nwisely, will take a role in Iraq, which is a positive thing, I say this \nwith respect to the coalition of forces: We will achieve the end result \nthat is now unfolding in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is yet to be \ncompleted, but basically the desired result will have been achieved in \nAfghanistan and Iraq at some cost--with the bloodshed of Americans and \nother coalition partners, with enormous tax dollars. These are very \nsignificant contributions by the coalition of forces and this great \nUnited States of America.\n  I think it is a minimal suggestion that NATO consider changing its \nprocedures for deciding to undertake such operations in the future to \navoid the problems we have recently witnessed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to the resolution of \nratification I am proposing today, and to join me in giving our advice \nand consent to ratification of the protocols to the North Atlantic \nTreaty of 1949 on Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia,\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my good friend from \nVirginia for his great work on this resolution. We have worked together \nnot just in the Senate for all of these years but on this particular \nissue we have worked together for a long time. I also thank the \nmanagers of this bill, not just for working with us on this matter but \nalso for their work generally on a host of issues which they struggle \nwith to try to make our Nation a lot more secure. They work together \nmagnificently. They are both essential for this country's security and \nstrength and wisdom, which we surely need in these complicated days.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank him for \nthe reference to our long-term working relationship. The Senator has \nreally taken the lead for over 5 or 6 years. We have worked on this \nissue for a very long time. It is not something that has just suddenly \ncome to mind.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  First, I very much support the expansion of NATO to include these \nseven additional countries, just as I supported the expansion for the \nthree that we approved a few years ago. I believe this expansion, like \nthe last one, could lead to a safer, more united, more cohesive Europe \nand reduce the possibility that Europe would ever again be divided by \nwar. I very much support the expansion.\n  I have been troubled by one issue for many years--actually a number \nof issues relative to NATO--that as we expand NATO, there is a greater \nlikelihood, just statistically, that someday, some country is going to \nno longer live up to NATO's requirements that it be a democratic \ncountry with a free market. We hope that will never happen. We do not \nexpect it to happen. But what happens, after these nations are added \nhopefully, if one day, one of the now 26 nations departs from the \nalliance's fundamental principles?\n  As it now stands, there is no mechanism in the charter to suspend a \ncountry that no longer complies with NATO's fundamental principles. It \nis an unusual alliance in that regard that does not have a suspension \nmechanism, but it does not. We could actually, theoretically, see a \ncountry become a dictatorship and stop 25 democracies from acting in \ntheir own self-defense or in defense of a secure world. That is an \nunusual provision. It is one that was consciously adopted, but it is \none that as we add more countries to NATO we have to think about, it \nseems to me.\n  Our amendment is aimed at raising this issue. We do not direct that \nthere be a solution to the problem. We simply believe that NATO \ncountries, as NATO expands, should address the issue of a country in \nthe future possibly departing from the fundamental principles that \nguide NATO.\n  What happens, for instance, if one country becomes a dictatorship? \nThat dictatorship could veto a decision that all the other NATO member \nnations wanted to take, perhaps to come to the aid of a people who were \nbeing ethnically cleansed on a scale perhaps approaching what happened \nin the genocide that occurred in Kosovo, or worse. That issue, as well \nas the consensus issue Chairman Warner has raised, should be raised at \nNATO. They should discuss it. They should decide whether or not they \nwant to proceed on the current course.\n\n  Again, I emphasize that our amendment, while expressing the sense of \nthe Senate that the administration raised this issue at the North \nAtlantic Council, does not in any way indicate what the outcome of that \ndiscussion would be, nor, indeed, does it in any way suggest what the \nposition of the United States should be during those deliberations. We \nsimply want the issue of suspension and consensus and the other issues \nreferred to in our resolution discussed at the highest level at NATO--\njust discussed.\n  There is a question raised: Is this aimed at any particular country? \nIt is not. It is explicitly not aimed at any one of the 26 countries. \nWe made it clear we amended our language to make it clear this would \ntake effect 18 months after the resolution is adopted. We expect by \nthen all the new countries will have been in long enough so there will \nbe no sensitivity about that issue.\n  We also make it clear this is not a condition in any way on the \nratification of the NATO documents. It is drafted as a declaration of \nthe intent of the Senate rather than as a condition of any type. That \nis, in essence, what we do.\n  A final discussion item that is listed in the resolution would be \nmethods to streamline the process by which NATO makes decisions with \nrespect to conducting military campaigns. We believe this is essential \nbecause this refers to the actual conduct of military operations--not \nto the approval to conduct it but it seeks to address the problems that \nwere experienced in the conduct of NATO operations in Kosovo where it \nwas reported that General Wesley Clark, the then NATO commander, was \nrestricted in his actions by a number of NATO countries that wanted to \nreview each day's bombing targets. The planning should be allowed to \nproceed in advance in the event that the North Atlantic Council \napproves the operation. This simply would expedite and streamline the \nplanning of military operations.\n  Our amendment is not intended to interfere with the passage of our \nresolution of ratification. It would not cause any delay in the \nascension of the seven new members into the NATO alliance. Again, it \nmerely seeks to cause the alliance to consider some issues that could \npose problems in the future, if not addressed in a calm, careful, and \nmeasured way before a crisis occurs.\n  Discussion and report is what we are asking the administration to \nparticipate in and to initiate--again, not declaring what the position \nof this administration or any future administration will be and not in \nany way suggesting the outcome of those deliberations and discussions. \nIt is a matter of prudence that this issue, which would have such huge \nramifications down the road as to whether or not NATO can act, should \nbe discussed in advance, whatever the outcome of that discussion.\n  I thank Senators Lugar and Biden for working with us in a way so we \nnow believe this matter can be resolved and adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will respond briefly. Anyone who is a C-SPAN watcher \nwill be a bit confused. We have Senator Warner talking about his 25-\nyear relationship with Senator Levin and I am about to talk about my \n28-year relationship with my friend, Senator Lugar. This is proof there \nis bipartisanship in this operation. We have a Democrat and a \nRepublican opposing a Democrat and Republican on the principle here but \nnot on whether or not this should be included and considered.\n  This is basically a procedural judgment we are making. I have a few \npoints notwithstanding the very well intended effort on the part of \nSenator Levin who has, for a number of years, been concerned about this \nissue and is concerned that, as he said, who knows, maybe some day we \nwill end up with one of these member states no longer being a \ndemocracy. It is possible.\n  What do we do? Let me suggest what Secretary Powell said before our \ncommittee when there was consideration, not by Senator Levin or Senator \nWarner, but there was discussion about having a condition attached to \nthis treaty--which is not the case now. He said:\n\n       NATO is not a committee; it's not a council; it is not a \n     group. It is an alliance. When you call something an \n     alliance, I think it means that everybody has to be together \n     for the alliance to take action.\n\n  I am skipping ahead to make this short. Secretary-General Lord \nRobertson told the members of the Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       Even when times have been difficult, NATO has never failed \n     to get consensus or to find a way to work around the problem. \n     No country has ever used its national veto.\n\n  As Secretary General Lord Robertson also said, ``NATO is an \ninfinitely adaptable organization'' and has proven itself equal to all \norganizational challenges.\n  Let me be more precise. When France pulled out of NATO's integrated \ncommand in 1967, the alliance decided it had a problem. Ordinarily, \nthat would be enough to cripple NATO because it\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\nwould effectively veto everything. What did we do? Then NATO came up \nwith a Defense Planning Committee, the so-called DPC, which for years \nhas done the bulk of NATO's work. When France refused to go along on \nthe Turkey article 4 request last winter, saying the decision in the \nNAC would be counterproductive to diplomatic discussions of the United \nNations, what did we do? We went over to the DPC effortlessly. We did \nnot have a great crisis in NATO.\n  If that had not worked, Lord Robertson could have ordered the SACEUR \nto make the Patriots and AWACs available to Turkey, or he could have \ndone what former Secretary General Luns once did. He could have simply \ndeclared his own decision was final unless there was unanimous \nopposition.\n  I will not take more time, although there is much more to say. The \nreason I bring these things up, we have, in fact, dealt with very \ndifficult crises in NATO, including member states not meeting the \ncriteria of a democratic free market, respecting human rights, et \ncetera. We have had different countries who have been the odd man out \non different occasions. Every time, instead of having to go through the \nprocess of a period of expulsion, we were able to weather the storm by \ndealing with it through other mechanisms.\n\n  Here is the larger point I wish to make. I do not want to take too \nmuch time, but it is a very important point to make, in my view.\n  Especially troubling is the opinion of Lord Robertson that \nalternatives to the consensus principle would create more problems than \nthey are intended to solve.\n  Majority rule or a UN Security Council-type system would send members \nscurrying for votes in support of their positions, merely delaying \naction and reinforcing divisions among allies.\n  The consensus rule is a fundamental part of NATO, an essential second \nelement in the article 5 defense clause of NATO, requiring that any \nNATO action taken as a result of an attack on a NATO member be decided \nby consensus.\n  My colleagues should note that this Article was crafted back in 1949, \non American insistence, to prevent the U.S. from being pulled into wars \nby European countries.\n  As Lord Robertson asked us, ``does the U.S. now really want to open \nthe door to the possibility of being dragged into a war it does not \nwant to participate in?''\n  I might quote from a thoughtful letter to Senator Lugar and myself \nwritten by Bruce Jackson, president of the U.S. Committee on NATO:\n\n       At present, the United States is the only country that can \n     consistently produce unanimous outcomes at the level of the \n     North Atlantic Council or, failing in that, at the Defense \n     Planning Committee. The process of achieving unanimity is \n     uniquely and, perhaps intentionally, to the advantage of the \n     United States.\n       The countries whose ratification is before the Senate are \n     aghast that the Senate might consider weakening U.S. \n     leadership in NATO, which is the aspect of NATO they most \n     admire, just as their democracies reach the threshold of \n     membership. We share their concern.\n\n  Five years ago when this was brought up in the last expansion, I \nsaid, ``Why would we indulge in unilateral disarmament and give up our \nveto over a NATO decision?''\n  People wondered later, and asked me: What are you talking about? How \nis this giving up any veto?\n  With regard to the mechanism to suspend a member that strays from \nNATO's principles, that too is unnecessary. Here are two examples: \nDuring the authoritarian rule of the Greek colonels from 1967 to 1973, \nGreece was frozen out of the key NATO decisions. When it appeared \nPortugal might go Communist in the summer of 1975, it, too, was frozen \nout.\n  There would also be the temptation to play domestic politics with a \nsuspension mechanism.\n  We would not want NATO to be torn apart the way the European Union \nwas three years ago when other countries isolated Austria because Mr. \nHaider's distasteful party had joined the governing coalition after a \nfree election.\n  For example one might envision a future scenario in which Turkey were \nthreatened with military attack and some members would argue that \nAnkara's imperfect human rights record obviated the obligation of the \nNATO allies to honor their Article 5 commitments.\n  This isn't far-fetched. In January 1991, Mr. Lambsdorff, then the \nleader of the Free Democrats in Germany's Bundestag, voiced similar \nsentiments.\n  The reality is that once a suspension clause was introduced into the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty no country could fully rely upon Article 5.\n  Lord Robertson's summary judgment on creating a suspension mechanism \nspeaks volumes:\n\n       The worst possible thing would be to legislate in advance \n     for all possible occasions and then be locked in.\n\n  Our debate will be watched closely in the seven invited countries and \nthroughout the rest of Europe. Attaching this declaration to the \nSenate's ratification would send an unsettling message through the \nAlliance.\n  Lord Robertson gave us his bottom-line on Monday:\n\n       Putting these issues on the agenda of the NAC would be \n     ``deeply unhelpful'' to him and would ``open a can of \n     worms.''\n\n  The bottom line here, Madam President, is that I really think we \nshould understand what is intended. The objective here to get NATO \nitself to adopt such a rule would be the single most serious thing we \ncould do to U.S. leadership and U.S. de facto control of NATO.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote down this amendment, which is both \nunnecessary and potentially disruptive to NATO as it is about to \nwelcome seven new members.\n  I thank my friend from Michigan and my friend from Virginia for being \nwilling not to go with the original resolution they had, and seek this \nreport from NATO within 18 months after the request being submitted by \nthe Secretary of State. I think that is a more prudent way to proceed. \nBut I hope when that is done, the NATO membership will uniformly reject \nany change in the process. But again I thank my colleagues and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I agree with the analysis of history \ngiven by my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, with \nregard to the basic exclusion--or rather consensus and exclusion \nargument we are having today. He states correctly this arose the last \ntime we discussed NATO accession. It is an important argument that has \nbeen propounded by the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, and others. I simply rise to say \nthe substance of the issue is different from the procedure. In this \namendment offered by the distinguished Senators, we are discussing an \namendment that says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, not later than the date \n     that is eighteen months after the date of the adoption of \n     this resolution, the President should place on the agenda for \n     discussion at the North Atlantic Council--\n       (i) the NATO ``consensus rule''; and\n       (ii) the merits of establishing a process for suspending \n     the membership in NATO of a member country that no longer \n     complies with NATO's principles of democracy, individual \n     liberty, and the rule of law set forth in the preamble to the \n     North Atlantic Treaty.\n\n  The amendment also calls for reports on the points of view raised by \nour Government and, likewise, its fulfillment, with the gist of this \namendment.\n  At the time we had Secretary Powell before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in one of the five hearings the committee has conducted on \nNATO, we requested his view on the subject of consensus and expulsion. \nIn fact, I requested a letter from Secretary Powell, which he sent to \nme, and made clear as a matter of principle NATO's decisionmaking \nprocess in his judgment works well and serves the United States \ninterests.\n  The Secretary affirmed that for 50 years, from the cold war to Kosovo \nand now Afghanistan, NATO has been able to reach consensus on critical \ndecisions. NATO is an alliance, and no NATO member, including the \nUnited States, would agree to allow alliance decisions to be made on \ndefense commitments without its agreement.\n  Regarding the suspension mechanism, the Secretary said NATO has been \nable to deal successfully with the rare cases in the past of problem \ncountries, and NATO has dealt effectively with Allies that have \nexperienced regimes that did not support NATO's democratic principles \nby isolating them or excluding them from sensitive discussions--just as \nthe Senator from Delaware has illustrated.\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\n  I would add that when, at Senator Levin's request, these issues were \nraised by Ambassador Burns in an informal discussion within the \nalliance, there was no support from other members for creating a \nsuspension mechanism or for changing the consensus rule.\n  Essentially, the administration preference, when we asked them with \nregard to this idea, is that these issues not be addressed in the \nresolution of ratification and certainly that they not be termed as a \ncondition. The authors of the amendment today have not done so. This is \nnot a condition. Therefore, there is not an argument with the \nadministration.\n  The Secretary believes the questions are worthy of further study, and \nso do I. My own view, having listened to the testimony by Secretary \nPowell and then as Senator Biden suggested more recently, a visit in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee with Secretary General Robertson of \nNATO and with our Ambassador, Nick Burns, is that essentially, as the \nSecretary's letter has pointed out, the decisionmaking process has \nworked well, has served the United States interests. As Senator Biden \npointed out, as you look into the fine print, it might not serve our \ninterests so well if in fact our effective veto was terminated.\n  Having said all of that, none of us has wisdom that is all \nencompassing on these issues. Times change. Senator Levin in his \ncomments has cited some reasons and these are important to consider.\n  Therefore, I come out in this discussion on the side of thought that \nwithin 18 months the United States ought to think through these \narguments, ought to put them on the agenda of the North Atlantic Treaty \nCouncil for discussion. In 18 months the world may have changed a lot. \nEven if a discussion of them in recent months led to apparently \nuniversally negative views of our NATO allies, plus apparently a \nnegative viewpoint of our own Secretary of State, it is conceivable \nthat on further study, intensive study in this area, there may be some \nother constructive results.\n  I say this because I respect very deeply the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. They, too, held \nhearings, as I cited in my opening statement, on the NATO accession \nissue. They are intensely interested, as we are in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and as all Members of this body are, in what is in \nthe best interests of our country, in our military alliances, in the \nprosecution of peace, in those horrible instances, and in the \nprosecution of war.\n  These are serious issues, and this is perhaps an appropriate time as \nthe body is focused on NATO to, once again, say these are discussions \nthat have to take place from time to time. We in the United States \nought to suggest that our Secretary of State take that initiative.\n  For these reasons, I am going to support the amendment. I hope that, \nas a matter of fact, it will receive a unanimous verdict of support \ntoday on the procedural issues and issues that are out there, even if \nall of us have fairly strong views on the substance--and that would \ninclude the administration as well as colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Warner/Levin/\nRoberts amendment to the resolution of ratification on NATO \nEnlargement.\n  Before I talk about our amendment, I want to take a few moments to \nexpress my strong support for the enlargement of the NATO Alliance to \ninclude Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \nSlovenia.\n  A significant aspect of any enlargement of the Alliance to the United \nStates, of course, is that it would represent a commitment by the \nUnited States to treat an armed attack on any of these seven nations as \nan armed attack on the United States. In 1998, when the Senate was \nconsidering the enlargement of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic, the attitude of Russia to the inclusion of former \nmembers of the Warsaw Pact was a factor which was part of the debate. \nSuch enlargement was not intended to be threatening and, appropriately, \nit was not perceived as a threat by Russia, which wanted to establish a \nconstructive relationship with the United States and the other members \nof NATO. As a matter of fact, Russia's decision on that matter was so \nclear that its position relative to NATO membership for former Soviet \nRepublics Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia is not even an issue today.\n  One issue that I have wrestled with in 1998 and before was my belief \nthat NATO should have a mechanism to suspend the membership of a NATO \nmember, if that member no longer complies with the Alliance's \nfundamental principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of \nlaw. In the Armed Services Committee hearings that preceded the 1998 \nSenate floor action, I put the issue to former Secretary of State Henry \nKissinger who said in part that ``I think in situations in which a \ngovernment emerges incompatible with the common purpose of the \nAlliance, there ought to be some method, maybe along the lines you put \nforward.'' I also raised the issue with former Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Perry who said in part that ``What you are describing is a \nproblem--in fact, I would call it a flaw--in the original NATO \nstructure, the NATO agreements. And, in my judgment, this is a problem \nwhich should be addressed.''\n  I had a colloquy with the then Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden, who said in part that ``I agree with the \nSenator from Michigan that this is an important matter that raises \nfundamental issues for the United States and our allies. I believe that \nthis is a matter that merits careful consideration within NATO \ncouncils. It would certainly be preferable for NATO to discuss this in \na careful and measured way now, rather than be faced with the issue at \nsome future time when an emergency situation exists.''\n  That careful and measured consideration, however, has not been \nundertaken within NATO councils in the interviewing years.\n  Just as I supported enlargement of the Alliance to a total of \nnineteen nations in 1998, so I support enlargement of the Alliance \ntoday to a total of 26. But I am mindful that the sheer number of \nnations that will soon make up the alliance increases the chance that \none of them may some day depart from the alliance's fundamental \nprinciples. Having said that, I want to be perfectly clear--our \namendment is not aimed at any of the seven nations whose accession is \nbefore us today--it is not aimed at the three most recent NATO member \nnations--it is not aimed at any of the long-term NATO member nations--\nand it is not aimed at any potential future NATO member nation--it is \nnot aimed at any nation.\n\n  It is aimed at the possibility that a NATO member nation that, for \nexample, was no longer democratic and was ruled by a dictator, would be \nin a position to veto a decision that all of the other NATO member \nnations wanted to take--perhaps to come to the aid of a people who were \nbeing ``ethnically cleansed'' on a scale that was approaching genocide \nsuch as happened in Kosovo. I believe that the United States should put \nthe issue of whether a process should be established to suspend--\nsuspend, not expel--such a member nation so that it would not endanger \nNATO's decision making when all but an undemocratic member nation wants \nto act.\n  The growth in the number of NATO member nations to 26 also increases, \nunder the laws of mathematics, the potential that one NATO member \nnation, even a nation that conforms to the alliance's fundamental \nprinciples, could prevent the alliance from making a decision where all \nother countries want to act. The recent experience, wherein France \nprevented the North Atlantic Council from authorizing planning for the \ndefense of Turkey to proceed and the Alliance had to go to the Defense \nPlanning Council for that authorization, is a real-world example that \ndemonstrates the need for the alliance to reconsider whether the \nconsensus rule for NATO decisions should be changed.\n  I want to emphasize very strongly at this point that our amendment \ndoesn't mandate a particular outcome to the discussion of these issues \nby the North Atlantic Council. It doesn't prejudge the result of the \ndiscussion and it doesn't require the U.S. representative\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nto take a particular position in the discussion. It merely seeks to \nhave the issues placed on the North Atlantic Council's agenda, \ndiscussed in the council, and the results of that discussion be \nreported back to the U.S. Senate.\n  Our amendment would require the President's report to discuss two \nother matters. The first would be methods to provide more flexibility \nto NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, who is presently U.S. \nGeneral Jim Jones, to plan potential contingency operations before the \nformal approval of such operations by the North Atlantic Council. In \nthe instance that I mentioned, wherein France blocked the planning for \nTurkey's defense, it would have been very useful if NATO's military \nplanning staff could have been preparing contingency plans so that they \nwould have been immediately available once the civilian decision-makers \nhad approved the defense of Turkey.\n  A final discussion item would be methods to streamline the process by \nwhich NATO makes decisions with respect to conducting military \ncampaigns. This refers to the actual conduct of the operation--not to \nthe approval to conduct it--and seeks to address the problems that were \nexperienced in the conduct of the NATO operations in Kosovo where it is \nreported that General Wes Clark, the then-NATO Commander, was \nrestricted in his actions as a number of NATO capitals insisted on \nreviewing and approving each day's bombing targets.\n  This amendment does not interfere with the passage of the resolution \nof ratification. It does not cause any delay in the accession of the \nseven new members into the NATO Alliance. It merely seeks to cause the \nAlliance to consider some issues that could pose serious problems in \nthe future if not addressed in a calm, careful and measured way before \na crisis occurs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the discussion between myself and former \nSecretary of Defense Perry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate\n\n\n  hearing to receive testimony on issues related to nato enlargement--\n                thursday, March 19, 1998, Washington, DC\n\n       We went into Bosnia, I understand, for legitimate reasons, \n     I think. But, still, it is not what NATO was invented for, \n     which was to reassure the Western Europeans that they would \n     not be attacked by the Russians. And if they were attacked by \n     the Russians, the United States would come to their defense.\n       And I do not think the operation in Bosnia qualifies to \n     that standard. Which does not mean I am against it, but, \n     still, I do not think you can square it with the original \n     Treaty.\n       Chairman Thurmond. My time is up.\n       Senator Levin.\n       Senator Levin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       Ms. Eisenhower, your sensitivity to the impact of this on \n     our relationship with Russia, it seems to me, is correct, in \n     terms of being aware of it. We should worry about it. We \n     should consider it.\n       I reach a different conclusion than you do, but it is not \n     politically incorrect to factor into the deliberation what \n     the impact on that relationship is. I reach a different \n     conclusion than you do for a number of reasons. And, by the \n     way, I, too, have talked to dozens of parliamentarians in \n     Russia, both here and in Moscow, as well as their leadership, \n     their minister of Defense, their Foreign Minister, and so \n     forth.\n       And I have heard their words. I have also seen their \n     actions, including the following actions: They entered into a \n     Founding Act with NATO after the decision to expand NATO was \n     made. And they have remained a member of that relationship. \n     And that Founding Act says--and this is between NATO, after \n     the announced expansion, and Russia--that Founding Act \n     reaffirms the determination of the parties, NATO and Russia, \n     to give concrete substance to our shared commitment to a \n     stable, peaceful and undivided Europe.\n       So one of the actions which they have taken is to both join \n     a Founding Act with NATO after the announced expansion, and \n     to remain a member of that Founding Act. Secondly, recently \n     the Partnership for Peace was expanded. A more active \n     participation was recently agreed to by Russia with NATO. So \n     we have a more active participation in NATO's Partnership for \n     Peace recently, after the actual decision to have three \n     additional countries join NATO.\n       Next, recently, their Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, \n     publicly pledged, after meeting with our Vice President, that \n     the Russian Government will push hard for the Duma's \n     ratification of START II. This came within the last few \n     weeks.\n       We have heard--and I have heard from parliamentarians--that \n     the expansion of NATO will hurt the chances for ratification. \n     We understand that. But, nonetheless, the action taken by the \n     Prime Minister is that he is going to push hard for that \n     ratification. And that is despite his clear awareness that \n     NATO is, with great likelihood, going to be expanded and that \n     this Senate will ratify that expansion. So we have that \n     action taken on the part of Mr. Chernomyrdin.\n       We also have a recent--interestingly enough, we talked \n     about public opinion polls in here--we have a recent public \n     opinion poll by the Gallup people in Moscow, released last \n     Saturday, revealing that 57 percent of the people in Moscow \n     support the Czech Republic's bit to joint NATO; 54 percent \n     support Hungary's admission; 53 percent said Poland should \n     allowed to join NATO. And a quarter of those polled had no \n     views on the subject.\n       Now, I do not know what their sample was and so forth, but, \n     nonetheless, I am not so sure public opinion in Russia is so \n     wholly as one-sided as you indicate. And, again, I have also \n     had similar meetings, as you have had, with their \n     parliamentarians.\n       On the other hand, it is a very important factor to \n     consider. And I think we should all weigh that. We should not \n     give Russia a veto. That would be a very bad mistake, but we \n     surely should consider the impact of any expansion on our \n     relationship with Russia, and on the effort to bring Russia \n     into the democratic world and to keep them there, and to \n     keep them into the free market world. It is a very \n     important issue.\n       You have raised another issue, however, which I find--and I \n     join with you in finding troubling. And that is the inability \n     of NATO to suspend a member, to remove a member who no longer \n     comports with NATO's principles of democracy and free market \n     orientation, and a dedication to freedom. This could happen \n     in the future. It could happen. And there is no mechanism \n     inside of NATO to suspend a member. Every member has a veto. \n     And that could create a problem with your strategic vision. I \n     think all of us hopefully view the world somewhat \n     strategically. That could create a problem down the road.\n       And so I want to ask, Secretary Perry, about this issue. It \n     is something which has troubled me. I do not want to try to \n     condition the accession of these three new members on a \n     suspension agreement, because that would raise a false \n     implication that it has something to do with them--which it \n     does not. It is a general issue that I think we have to face \n     in NATO at some point, not related to these three particular \n     countries, or any other particular country.\n       But what happens in the future if a member of NATO no \n     longer comports to the principles of NATO in terms of \n     commitment to democracy, freedom and free markets, and then \n     has a veto on NATO operations? And my question, Mr. Perry, is \n     this: Should we at some point raise within NATO, and satisfy \n     ourselves, on the question of the suspension of a member at \n     some point in the future and a mechanism to accomplish that \n     end? That is my question.\n       Dr. Perry. That is a very good question, Senator Levin. \n     What you are describing is a problem--in fact, I would call \n     it a few--in the original NATO structure, the NATO \n     agreements. And, in my judgment, that is a problem which \n     should be addressed. It has been a problem for many, many \n     years. And therefore it is important, in addressing that \n     problem, to separate it from the issue of NATO accession. I \n     would not in any way want to tie that issue to the NATO \n     accession issue.\n       We could have predicted several decades ago that that would \n     cause a problem, that there would be some major issue come up \n     on which we could not reach consensus, and that would bring \n     NATO to a halt, or that some member would depart from the \n     NATO values. Happily, that has not happened. But it is a \n     potential problem, and I think we ought to address it.\n       Senator Levin. My time is up. I would appreciate, however, \n     for the record, if you or any other member here--my time is \n     up and the chairman here, I think, has got to stick to his 5-\n     minute rule--but if you or any other panelist here would \n     submit for the record your ideas on that subject, it would be \n     very helpful to us.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friends, the managers of this resolution, for \ntheir tremendous work on NATO expansion and other issues.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, since the original North Atlantic \nTreaty was signed in Washington in April 1949, the organization has \nexpanded far beyond its original 12 members. The amendment to this \ntreaty that I was proud to co-sponsor with my distinguished colleagues \nSenators Warner, Levin, and Roberts acknowledges that we have had \nrecent difficulty with the consensus decision making methodology \ncurrently in force within NATO.\n  Four more European nations later acceded to the Treaty between 1952 \nand 1982. In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were welcomed \nand possibly tomorrow we will add Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia, Slovenia bringing the number to 26 members.\n  The following description of this consensus requirement is taken from \nthe NATO web site, and it says:\n\n       In making their joint decision-making process dependent on \n     consensus and common\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n     consent, the members of the Alliance safeguard the role of \n     each country's individual experience and outlook while at the \n     same time availing themselves of the machinery and procedures \n     which allow them jointly to act rapidly and decisively if \n     circumstances require them to do so.\n\n  It stands to reason that with the addition of more members, that \nconsensus will be increasingly difficult to achieve.\n  Our amendment simply asks that the President do two things: to \nexamine the consensus requirement so that we ensure that we preserve \nour sovereign right to act in our own national interest; and, examine a \nprocedure by which we can take action against a member who fails to \ncomply with the shared values upon which NATO was founded.\n  Not everyone agrees with this request to have NATO address these two \nissues. I disagree.\n  The strength of the NATO Alliance is based upon adaptiveness. Our \nrecent experience with the UN, NATO and other formations clearly shows \nwe must address the changes we perceive in alliances.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I know I speak for all members of the \nForeign Relations Committee in commending the Armed Services Committee \nfor this discussion of these issues, and, most importantly, the comity \nbetween the committee members and leadership. I think that is \ndemonstrated in our debate today on a serious issue but to one which we \nhave come to a good conclusion.\n  I know of no further debate. It would be a privilege if the Chair \nwould put the issue to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded?\n  Mr. LUGAR. All on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 535) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield as much time to the Senator from Texas as she may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I was interested in the previous \ndiscussion because I think they were talking about going back to NATO \nto discuss some contingencies that might occur and how they would be \naddressed. That is the subject of my view on this issue.\n  I support the entrance of these new countries, but I think we need to \ntake a step back and make sure NATO is going to remain the greatest \ndefense alliance that the world has ever known.\n  In 1999, when the Senate voted to ratify the addition of Poland, the \nCzech Republic, and Hungary, I said at the time that we needed to \nreassess the mutual threat to NATO nations to assure the strength of \nour alliance in that agreement.\n  Four years later, as we prepared for what became Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, we were disappointed, to say the least, to watch three NATO \ncountries refuse to support the defense of our ally, Turkey. That was \nan initial signal that we have reached the point of stretching the \nalliance.\n  That Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \nSlovenia are candidates for NATO is both a miracle and a testament to \nthe effectiveness of NATO itself. They survived brutal totalitarian \nregimes during the cold war. Now they are free to fully join the world \ncommunity as valued members of NATO.\n  But what is the state of the alliance they seek to join? The world \nhas seen three NATO members refuse to support disarming Iraq. In the \nview of the United States, this was the same as the failure to come to \nthe aid of a member country that has been attacked, a renunciation of \nour mutual agreement.\n  Now is the time to ask: What is the mission of NATO today? Is NATO \ngoing to protect the future or defend the past?\n  For NATO to remain relevant, we must agree on its fundamental \nmission. Our alliance should recognize that the concern threats of \nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have \nreplaced the common threat of Soviet imperialism. After the most recent \nbreak in our bonds, it is essential to establish a new mission to \ncounter a new threat. NATO has always been unified around a common \npurpose, but if it becomes nothing more than a patchwork quilt, we will \nbe wasting our money and endangering our own national security by \ncontinuing to pay its bills and diverting our attention.\n  Fifty-four years ago this month, the United States pledged to protect \nEurope from the Warsaw Pact. We were steadfast in our commitment. We \nbased 300,000 troops in Europe continuously throughout the cold war and \nkeep 119,000 troops there now. We have paid a quarter of NATO's costs, \neven though we are only one of 19 nations belonging to the alliance. \nClearly, our commitment played a vital role in NATO's victory in the \ncold war.\n  After the cold war ended, we turned our attention to areas of the \nworld that cried out for stability. We went to Somalia, Haiti and the \nBalkans, with varying degrees of success. We became central to peace \nnegotiations in the Middle East. We focused more on our commitments \nabroad and less on our own national defense closer to home. All that \nchanged on September 11, 2001, when terrorists and the countries \nsupporting them tried to destroy the icons of democracy, capitalism and \nAmerican power. Those attacks on our homeland marked the end of our \npolicy of containment.\n  The global war we are fighting against terrorism and our forceful \ndisarming of Iraq has forged new alliances unthinkable before September \n11. Our relationship with Pakistan in the war on terrorism and \nOperation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan is one example of this \ndynamic shift. But the war on terrorism has strained other \nlongstanding, traditional alliances.\n  Many of our friends in Europe do not comprehend the impact September \n11 had on America. They viewed what happened within our borders from \narm's length, not acknowledging it as an attack on our country that \nrequired a firm response. This disconnect has caused a rift among NATO \nallies that would have been unthinkable before September 11. That split \nwas manifested in the refusal to help disarm Iraq.\n  As we prepared for Operation Iraqi Freedom, our long-time allies, \nFrance, Germany and Belgium, countries we have been committed to defend \nfrom attack for over half a century, opposed us at every turn. Even \ntoday, they are thwarting the rebuilding of Iraq by refusing to lift \nthe U.N.-imposed sanctions that would allow oil to be sold to pay for \nnew infrastructure in that country.\n  A strong alliance cannot maintain its strength under such strain. It \nis imperative that NATO establishes a new, common mission or risk \nwithering into irrelevance. If our purpose is a common defense, then we \nmust form a consensus in defining our common threats. And those who \nagree should reconstitute a strong NATO.\n  During Operation Iraqi Freedom, we created a valuable template for \nhow the world community can bond in this era of reckoning. We now \nshould lead the effort to reconfirm a coalition of the willing to stand \ntogether against the common threat of terrorism to our democracies.\n  The seven invited countries have all demonstrated they are prepared \nto contribute if they join NATO. Every one of them supported the U.S.-\nled coalition to disarm Iraq. As the United States develops plans for \nthe reconstruction and administration of postwar Iraq, we are \nconsulting with all seven of these nations to determine how best to \nproceed in this process and how they can contribute. All have indicated \na willingness to consider the requests of the United States or other \ninternational organizations to help restore Iraq.\n  Just this week, Bulgaria pledged to provide combat troops under \ninternational command. By doing so, Bulgaria has stepped forward--among \nthe first of the world's nations--to internationalize the U.S.-led \noccupation. These seven countries are showing they are ready to do what \nit takes within their means to make the world more secure.\n  Madam President, I am certainly going to vote to support this round \nof NATO expansion because I do believe all of these prospective members \nhave\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\na clear understanding that NATO has new threats and new missions, and \nthey will make a positive contribution to this alliance.\n  But I do hope we will take the lead in bringing to NATO a clear \nfocus, a clear focus on the common threats that we all face, and the \nmethods for defending against those threats. That is what it will take \nto assure that this great alliance will be a great alliance in the \nfuture and not just something we talk about in the past with great \nregard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia as much time as he might require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, for his outstanding \nleadership on this issue. I also very much agree with the remarks made \nby Senator Hutchison of Texas.\n  As far as an enlarged NATO, we have had hearings on the mending of \nfences and the moving forward that we will need to have as a country \nwith our Allies with a new sense of realism insofar as NATO and certain \nalliances--who we can always count on and who we sometimes may not be \nable to count on in the future.\n  I rise today to specifically address the issue of the enlargement of \nNATO. I offer my very strong support for the enlargement of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization alliance. The NATO alliance, over the \ndecades, has had a positive impact on the world.\n  Since the days I was Governor of Virginia, I have been a long-time \nadvocate of enlarging NATO, with new countries to contribute to \nsecurity and also to advance individual liberty.\n  I was an advocate of admitting Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary, and they have been good participatory members. You can see how \nthe advancement of liberty has allowed the people of those countries to \nhave greater freedoms and greater prosperity.\n  I believe that enlarging the alliance will bring even greater peace \nand security to the world, as well as confirm the value of economic \nreforms that will offer all people greater individual freedoms and \nprotection of their rights.\n  The reforms and progress that have been made by Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania have transformed \nonce communist, oppressive states into vibrant democracies that \nappreciate the newly reborn freedom to control their own destinies.\n  These nations are ascending into NATO at a serious time for the NATO \nalliance. As these countries have made a positive transformation, so \nmust NATO transform from the cold war deterrent it has so successfully \nbeen over the last 50 years into an alliance that is able to adapt to \nmeet the new challenges facing the world and the partner nations of \nNATO.\n  NATO and its members must now develop the ability to meet the threat \nof global terrorism wherever it may arise. This will no doubt be \nchallenging, as the structure and strategy of the NATO alliance for \ndecades has been to prepare for traditional conflict against the Soviet \nUnion.\n  To meet the defense needs of today, all NATO nations will need to \nmake a commitment to the forces and the resources that are necessary to \nroot out and defeat state-sponsored and itinerant terrorism beyond the \nshores of the United States and Europe.\n  The seven nations that are poised to join NATO will be asked to take \nan immediate role in implementing this new mission. While it is \nunrealistic to ask these countries to meet the defense spending levels \nof the United States, the alliance should urge these new members to \nestablish an expertise and an unmatched capability in a particular area \nof combating terrorism. NATO does not particularly need large, \ntraditional forces or armaments. The alliance, rather, needs skilled \nunits that can neutralize the devastating impacts of chemical or \nbiological weapons, as well as seasoned intelligence organizations to \nensure that NATO and its members are always able to thwart terrorist \nconspiracies or attacks before they are executed.\n\n  The seven aspirant countries have had to overcome significant \npolitical and economic difficulties to reach the precipice of NATO \nmembership. Transforming a socialist-focused economy to one that is \nmarket based requires tremendous perseverance and visionary leadership \nand also an appreciation of liberty on the part of the people of these \ncountries.\n  Indeed, the people of these nations have made their decisions and \ntheir choices. And now the economies of the aspirant countries are \ngrowing markets with potential for prosperous growth. These experiences \nwill help these nations as they adjust to the burden of collective \ndefense and make the responsible decisions that come with NATO \nmembership.\n  I am confident that these countries--whether they are in the Baltics \nor Central Europe or Southeastern Europe--will continue to meet their \nresponsibilities. You may ask, why are you so confident? Look at what \nthese aspirant countries are already doing, and have been doing, in the \ncurrent year and recent years. One must look only at the peacekeeping \nmissions currently, and those that have been going on for several years \nin the Balkans.\n  You can look at the war in Afghanistan, and also the conflict in Iraq \nto conclude that not only will these nations be prepared to take the \nmantle of NATO membership--but are already contributing to the safety \nand security of all members. Their contributions and support have been \nsubstantive and significant in these current times of need.\n  NATO will certainly become a stronger alliance, with the capabilities \nand the vitality these prospective new members bring to the \npartnership.\n  I see these seven new members actually revitalizing NATO. There are \nconcerns that have been expressed about the adherence and the unity of \nNATO. These seven countries will bring a revitalization, an \nappreciation for the importance of NATO and the freedoms and values we \nstand for.\n  When you discuss the expansion of NATO, the benefits of membership \nare often the focus. However, it is important to understand the \ntremendous value the alliance, and especially the United States, gains \nwhen these seven countries are offered membership.\n  We have seen the impact of these nations in the positions and actions \ntaken during the recent military conflict in disarming Iraq. When the \nalliance first addressed the Iraq issue, it was these countries that \nimmediately voiced their support for offering protection to an ally. \nOnce the conflict began, these countries offered staging support as \nwell as troops and chemical weapons teams which ensured Allied Forces \nwere prepared to confront all possible battlefield scenarios. In \nparticular, Bulgaria and Romania were helpful with their bases.\n  The alliance experienced a disconcerting event earlier this year when \na member nation, Turkey, requested defense assistance. Critics again \nquestioned the value and importance of NATO. However, those trying days \nhighlighted the importance of this alliance to the United States. And \nwhile there was a small number of members who disagreed with the United \nStates, the vast majority were in agreement with our policy and were \nextremely helpful in moving the alliance to assist Turkey in their \ndefense needs.\n  Beyond the military conflict in Iraq, expanding the membership in \nNATO continues to be in the interest of this country. As the United \nStates continues to confront terrorism on all fronts, we will need the \ncontinued support and intelligence assistance to make our efforts \nsuccessful. Again, I feel confident these nations will take the lead in \ndeveloping specialized programs that are needed within NATO.\n  Again, the aspirant countries are being asked to put together quick \nresponse forces to deal with chemical or biological attacks, should one \noccur. These are the invaluable programs that NATO will need as it \nchanges its focus to fighting terrorism.\n  The United States will always need allies with which to partner to \npromote democratic values and our principles. By offering NATO \nmembership to these seven countries, our country is gaining valuable \nallies that are intimately familiar with the value of individual \nfreedom and also the concept of representative government. They \nappreciate what a blessing that is for the people.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n  The tremendous reforms and the progress that have been made by these \naspirant nations is a testament to their commitment to the core values \nthat have made NATO the strongest military alliance in history.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote favorably on this resolution of \nratification and welcome Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \nSlovakia, and Slovenia to our alliance of shared security but, more \nimportantly, to our alliance of shared values, principles, and \naspirations for free people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is a privilege to yield as much time as \nhe requires to the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum for \n1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for that purpose?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for his work \non this very important legislation, for his leadership and continued \nvoice of maturity and reason that is often needed in our discussions \nand debates over issues of national security.\n  The Senate's ratification of the NATO enlargement protocol before us \nrepresents the ultimate victory of freedom over the fear and terror \nthat ruled Central and Eastern Europe from 1945 to 1989. The Berlin \nWall came down in 1989. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. NATO \nexpanded eastwards in 1999 and will do so again with the Senate's \nconsent in 2003. History will judge NATO's historic move eastwards as a \nfinal chapter in a long struggle not simply to roll back oppression but \nto consolidate a Europe whole and free.\n  The democracies of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, \nSlovakia, and Slovenia add a moral and strategic dimension to the \nalliance. The Baltics were captive nations during the cold war. \nRomania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia were subsumed into the Soviet empire, \nand Slovenia was a constituent part of Tito's Yugoslavia.\n  These nations suffered over four decades of effective foreign control \nand occupation. In 1989 and 1991, we celebrated their independence. \nToday we celebrate their secure freedom, enshrined in our great Western \nalliance in defense of our common values.\n  The Vilnius seven nations, as NATO's newest members are known, lent \ntheir moral voice to our campaign to liberate Iraq and end Saddam \nHussein's tyranny. A February 5 letter from the V-7 nations, plus \nAlbania, Macedonia, and Croatia, stated:\n\n       The trans-Atlantic community, of which we are a part, must \n     stand together to face the threat posed by the nexus of \n     terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass destruction. . . \n     . The clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's \n     regime requires a united response from the community of \n     democracies.\n\n  These nations share our values because they understand oppression all \ntoo well. Their voices carry special weight.\n  We received significant political and logistical support from the V-7 \nnations during the war in Iraq. NATO's new democracies provided their \nairspace, airfields, ports, and military personnel in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Several of these nations deployed troops to \nthe Iraq theater. Many of NATO's newest members more resolutely and \nmore concretely supported the military campaign in Iraq than did some \nof NATO's founding members. These seven democracies have also served as \nde facto Allies in NATO operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.\n  NATO's enlargement serves American leadership in Europe, anchoring \nour commitment to security and freedom there. It welcomes into the \nalliance a large group of nations that resolutely support American \nleadership and the principles that guide it in Europe and across the \nworld.\n  As we saw during the Iraq debate, a majority of Europe's leaders, \nincluding NATO's new members, supported America's determination to \ndisarm Iraq. NATO's new members will be solid allies that will expand \nNATO's reach, amplify its voice, and enhance its moral authority to \ndefend freedom, including against the threat of global terrorism.\n  I have had the pleasure of traveling to each of the seven new member \nstates to review their preparations to join NATO. Like my colleagues, I \nhave been struck by these democracies' determination to rank among our \nclosest allies, and to see NATO membership not only as a way to \nguarantee their security, but to contribute to the larger struggle for \nfreedom the West once waged on their behalf.\n  The success of the Prague Summit demonstrated the new NATO's shared \nhistory, shared values, shared sense of threat, and an agreed way \nforward in meeting those threats. This new NATO will provide a firmer \nfoundation for peace and a more resolute defense of our values. Prague \nlent considerable momentum to the construction of an integrated and \npeaceful Europe and taught us much about our alliance.\n  The decisions at Prague to invite seven new members to join the \nalliance, create a NATO rapid reaction force, enhance military \nmodernization and interoperability, and streamline NATO's \ninfrastructure were tangible accomplishments that should make the \nalliance more capable and flexible. Rather than debating out-of-area \noperations, NATO forces and assets are supporting the peacekeeping \nmission in Afghanistan. The NATO-Russia Council provides a forum for \nsecurity cooperation with Moscow. NATO's peacekeeping missions in the \nBalkans have been a success. The United States is considering a new \nmilitary basing concept on the territory of new NATO Allies in \nsoutheastern Europe. NATO remains central to American interests in \nEurope and beyond.\n  This is not to suggest in any way that everything is going swimmingly \nwithin the alliance. NATO has been put at grave risk by hostile French \nobstructionism that is as dangerous as it is cynical.\n  Let me be clear: I believe the French government is pursuing a \nsystematic campaign to undermine American leadership in Europe and the \nworld. I believe France would ultimately like to see America's \nwithdrawal from Europe and the replacement of an American-led NATO with \nan all-European army. France's active opposition to the United States \nwithin the North Atlantic Council over a period of many years, and in \nthe daily workings of the NATO bureaucracy, make clear the French \nagenda to weaken NATO's foundations and make the alliance less capable \nof effectively meeting challenges to international security.\n  Officials at many levels of the French government, including \nPresident Chirac, boldly assert France's ambition to serve as a \n``counterweight'' to the United States. By definition, a country can be \neither a counterweight or an ally, but it cannot be both. Official \npronouncements by the French government, and the daily actions of \nFrance within NATO and at the Security Council, make clear that France \nis not an ally of the United States.\n  France's decision in February to block a routine request for Turkey's \ndefense--I emphasize ``defense''--in the event of war with Iraq created \nthe most serious internal crisis the alliance has known in a \ngeneration. France's open rejection of its commitment to a fellow NATO \nally required the decision on Turkey's reinforcement to be taken in the \nDefense Planning Committee, which excludes France.\n  The Defense Planning Committee is the logical and appropriate venue \nfor\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\ndecisions relating to the defense of NATO members to be made. France \ndoes not contribute militarily to an alliance premised on the military \ndefense of member democracies. France has a political voice but not a \nmilitary stake in NATO decision-making. Decisions relating to the \nmilitary interests and defense of member states--the core of NATO's \nmission, and the bulk of its agenda--fall under the authority of the \nDefense Planning Committee. The French dilute their own influence in \nNATO by not participating in its military arm, and the alliance should \nrecognize that condition of French membership by making defense \ndecisions in a forum that reflects France's absence from NATO's \nmilitary mission.\n  NATO did ultimately achieve a consensus in the DPC that met Turkey's \ndefense requirements. Achieving consensus in an institutionalized forum \nthat excludes France seems to me to have produced a better result than \na divisive majority vote in the North Atlantic Council, had we shelved \nthe consensus principle in favor of some other weighted voting \nmechanism, as some in the Senate have proposed.\n  While I did not oppose the agreement reached today in the Senate \ncreating a reporting requirement on the issues of consensus and \nsuspension within NATO, I do not support overturning the consensus \nprinciple and creating a suspension clause because I believe it could \nweaken American leadership and interests in NATO while actually \nimproving the position of France within the alliance. Replacing the \nconsensus rule with a majority voting scheme would lead to factionalism \nand could result in scenarios in which the United States was outvoted, \nceding our traditional leadership to others. Adopting a suspension \nclause would gut the heart of the alliance, the commitment to mutual \ndefense, by introducing a reservation into the Alliance's commitment to \ndefend an embattled democracy.\n  Putting the issue of the consensus rule on the agenda of the North \nAtlantic Council would be seen by some of our best allies as divisive. \nIt would create a debate within the Council not about the French fifth \ncolumn, but about an American proposal that would dilute the influence \nof other NATO partners by weakening or negating their influence in a \nmajority voting scheme. Replacing the consensus rule with some form of \nmajority vote could threaten the supreme national interests of any NATO \nmember, including the United States, that might at some point find \nitself dissenting from a majority of NATO members on a matter vital to \nthat country's national security. The United States would never give up \nits effective veto over NATO military operations, and no country that \ncontributes militarily to the alliance could be expected to do the same \nby endorsing a majority voting process.\n  Under consensus, no vote counts more than any other, which is not \ntrue in a weighted majority voting system like that of the Security \nCouncil. Consensus helps pull allies together and gives each an equal \nstake in their outcomes. It prevents factionalism and the development \nof voting blocs that would only divide allies, not draw us together. \nConsensus prevents France from leading its own voting bloc in \nopposition to the United States. Historically, the United States has \nbeen the only NATO member whose initiatives regularly achieve \nconsensus. Why throw away such an effective tool for U.S. leadership?\n  Nor would I support conditioning NATO enlargement on developing a \nmechanism to suspend any NATO member that fails to uphold alliance \nprinciples. Advocating a kick-out clause suggests a lack of confidence \nin the democratic character and commitment of our new allies. It sends \nexactly the wrong message to these new members: that we fear they may \nregress from the democratic values we have certified that they share by \ninviting them to join NATO, values which NATO itself protects and \nstrengthens. Conditioning their membership with the suggestion that we \ndo not have confidence in the longevity of their democracies seems a \nstrange way to welcome them into our alliance.\n  A clause threatening any individual NATO member with expulsion would \nweaken the heart of the Washington Treaty by casting doubt on the \ncommitment of the NATO Allies to come to the defense of any threatened \nmember state. A suspension clause would effectively condition the \nmutual defense commitment that is at the heart of the alliance in a way \nthat would breed insecurity and mistrust, not security and confidence, \namong member states. In the words of Bruce Jackson of the Project on \nTransitional Democracies:\n\n       A provision to expel [NATO members] would introduce a \n     corrosive mental reservation into the commitment to defend an \n     embattled democracy and would, therefore, debilitate the most \n     powerful military alliance ever assembled.\n\n  NATO works so well for many of the reasons the U.N. Security Council \ndoes not: it is a true community of values in which all members are \ndemocracies; consensus requires unanimity that gives all members a \nstake in decision-making and outcomes; the absence of majority voting \nor weighted voting like the Security Council does not create different \nclasses of membership or hostile factions; and unlike the Security \nCouncil, NATO has proven time and again that it is able to effectively \nresist aggression and use its military and political power to expand \nfreedom. The reason the seven new members of NATO are so keen to join \nthe alliance underscores their clear belief it will protect their \nsecurity and advance their interests. Can anyone hold the Security \nCouncil to the same standard?\n  NATO's value to American interests and the progress of freedom \nendures. NATO enlargement serves American interests by delivering seven \ncommitted treaty allies who share our perspective on the world. \nEnlargement serves our common values by adding to our community of \nallied democracies the voices and the people of countries that were \nlong denied their free destiny. NATO's expansion moves us decisively in \nthe direction of a Europe whole and free, one that has exorcized the \nghosts of a violent past and stands with us in its commitment to human \nfreedom.\n  As the leaders of Britain, Spain, Italy, Poland, Hungary, the Czech \nRepublic, Denmark, and Portugal have written, ``The real bond between \nthe United States and Europe is the values we share. . . . These values \ncrossed the Atlantic with those who sailed from Europe to help create \nthe United States of America. Today they are under greater threat than \never. . . . Today more than ever, the transatlantic bond is a guarantee \nof our freedom.'' Let that continue to be our creed in the uncertain \nyears ahead, confident that we are stronger together than apart, that \nour values ennoble our common defense of them, and that we can, \ntogether, make this a safer, freer, better world. It's worth fighting \nfor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I know of no Senators who wish to debate. I \nhave consulted with the distinguished ranking member, Senator Biden. He \nknows of no Members on the Democratic side seeking time to debate and I \nknow of no Republicans who seek further time in debate. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent all time be yielded back on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my understanding, and I ask for guidance \nfrom the Chair, is that a vote on final passage of the NATO treaty will \noccur at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I advise all Senators that the next action on the treaty \nwill, in fact, be the final vote at 9:30 tomorrow. I also add as an \nannouncement that the foreign ministers of the countries seeking \nascension will be brought to the floor following the vote for \npresentation to Senators. That will be a prelude for a number of \nrecognition ceremonies involving the President, the White House, and \nothers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply commend chairman Lugar and Senator Biden, \nranking minority member, for their very effective leadership with \nrespect to this NATO enlargement issue. I am pleased to join with them \nin supporting this very important step forward.\n  I underscore how quickly the chairman moved with respect to this \nmatter and how carefully it was done in the\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\ncommittee. Very extended consideration was given to this issue, which \nof course, comports with its importance. This is a major step we all \nneed to recognize and the fact that it will happen without controversy, \nat least of any consequence, ought not to make us lose sight of the \nfact of the historic nature of what is being accomplished here--\ntomorrow, presumably.\n  I thank the Senator for his skilled leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for his \nleadership in our committee throughout the years and, likewise, \nspecifically, on the issue of NATO that has been before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5828-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue of \nfairness and responsibility in our political life that demands our \nattention.\n  Let me premise my remarks by saying it is an honor to be a Senator \nand serve the people of New Jersey. I love my job. I love politics and \nthe debate of ideas it makes possible. But I must say that I am \ndownright disgusted when that debate of ideas degenerates into the \npolitics of personal destruction and moves toward character \nassassination, especially when it may run afoul of the laws passed by \nthis body, and more especially when the target of a campaign of \npersonal destruction is a good and decent man--Tom Daschle, who has \nspent his entire adult life in service to our Nation.\n  A little over 1 year ago, the Congress passed--and the President \nsigned--the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.\n  Even as the courts ponder a challenge and an appeal to this landmark \nlegislation, there are those involved in the political process that \nhave demonstrated their intent to disregard it no matter what the court \ndecides for the sole purpose of destroying a political opponent.\n  In that regard, there are very disturbing reports in the media this \nweek about an amorphous front group being formed in South Dakota for \nthe purpose, in the words of its organizers, of ending Tom Daschle's \npublic career in 2004.\n  I don't question anyone's right to free speech nor their right to \nmount a campaign against any candidate for Federal Office, but this \neffort would apparently violate both Federal tax and election laws.\n  According to press reports, associates of the presumptive Republican \nnominee for Senate in South Dakota have begun raising special interest \nmoney in Washington for an advertising campaign in South Dakota against \nSenator Daschle, a campaign only marginally distanced from Senator \nDaschle's potential competitor or the opposing political party.\n  The problem with this effort, leaving aside the elements of personal \ndestruction, is that the organization leading it--the Rushmore Policy \nCouncil--is organized as a tax-exempt 501(c)(4) non-profit \norganization.\n  According to the IRS, 501(c)(4) organizations ``must be operated \nexclusively for the promotion of social welfare.'' The IRS also \nstipulates that, ``the promotion of social welfare does not include \ndirect or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns \non behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.''\n  One might say a lot of things about Tom Daschle, but his election or \ndefeat is hardly social welfare. It is clear from their own statements \nthat the purpose of the Rushmore Policy Council is to defeat Senator \nDaschle. In short, this is likely a violation of the letter of the law \nand clearly a violation of its spirit.\n  The Congress attempted to address these types of advertisements in \nthe campaign finance reform law passed last year. But one of the \norganizers of the effort against Senator Daschle stated simply that, \n``We're going to operate as if it's not'' on the books.\n  In additional to the personal attacks and legal questions are the \nimplications of a smear campaign that constructs front groups to \ninfiltrate a Senator's home State with reckless disregard for the \nspirit of the campaign finance laws that this body passed just last \nyear with bipartisan support.\n  At the very least, this is a mockery of Congress's efforts to clean \nup electoral politics.\n  Let me quote from the memo distributed around Washington by the \norganizers of the Rushmore Council's so-called Daschle Accountability \nProject: ``We propose to destroy Daschle's credibility'' and \n``ultimately end his political career . . .''\n  Unbelievably, the group funding this covert operation intends to \nemploy South Dakotans who have almost nothing to do with the campaign, \nbut who help to convey the false impression that the campaign is, and I \nquote, ``putatively based in South Dakota--to avoid the dismissive \n`outsider' label routinely attached to such efforts in the past.''\n  In other words, the group exists to put a phony local veneer on the \nGOP's efforts to ruin its number one target--Tom Daschle. Or as this \nparticular group puts it, ``. . . maybe be rid of [Tom Daschle] once \nand for all.''\n  This is the work of the Rushmore Policy Council, an organization so \nsmall it has no website or local telephone listing. Its offshoot ``The \nDaschle Accountability Project'' is a proudly self-described coalition \nof right wing organizations whose stated purpose, according to its own \nmission statement, is not to engage in policy debate, but rather to end \nDaschle's career by running an $800,000 advertising campaign in South \nDakota designed to ``destroy Daschle's credibility within his home \nstate through humor''--as if a laugh track makes them any less \nunseemly.\n  The Rapid City Journal recently cited leaders of campaign finance \nwatchdog groups who have already pointed out that the Rushmore Policy \nCouncil is endangering its tax-exempt status by targeting Daschle for \ndefeat in 2004. ``It's not clear to me how they will remain a 501c4--an \norganization that must operate exclusively for the promotion of social \nwelfare--as they are going to do what is being reported.\n  And, Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance reform group \nDemocracy 21 agrees with this assessment. He tells the Journal ``The \ngroup's activities need to be carefully watched in the coming months to \nsee if, in fact, they are breaking tax laws and campaign-finance laws. \nIt is clear they want to defeat Senator Daschle . . . there doesn't \nseem to be any question they want to use this for this goal and that \npurpose . . . and that--is not what this group--is supposed to engage \nin.''\n  Most disturbingly is that this type of attack is hardly new. About a \nyear and a half ago, the White House asked its political allies to turn \nup the heat on Senator Daschle. Most of us know the routine--the \norchestrated campaign to tar Tom with the label ``obstructionist.'' \nEven while under his leadership the Senate approved 100 judicial \nappointments and rejected only two--some obstructionist.\n  Where I come from, 100 is hardly obstructionist.\n  After the White House's directive, the outrageous attacks began. \nSince then, political opponents have compared Senator Daschle to \neveryone from Saddam Hussein to the devil himself on talk radio.\n  The problem this ``Burn Down Daschle'' effort faces is two fold: No. \n1, lack of credibility; and, No. 2, lack of legal authority.\n  On the former, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader accurately points out \nthat the Daschle Accountability project and its efforts to destroy \nDaschle's character through an ad campaign with a ridiculing tone \nembedded in humor have the potential to backfire in a small State where \nretail politics holds great sway.\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\n  Senator Daschle, I realize, doesn't need me to defend himself to the \npeople of South Dakota. They are smart enough to see through this \ndespicable outsider campaign. They know he stands with South Dakota and \nher farmers. They know he stands with South Dakota and its small \nbusinesses. They know he stands with South Dakota on health care, \neducation and responsible economic policy. He has given a lifetime of \nservice to his community.\n  I only wish the Daschle-bashers would remember that the President \npromised to change the tone in Washington. Unfortunately, he has. It \nhas gone from bad to worse.\n  It is worth noting that a number of the people involved in this \ncampaign have their own problems with previous campaigns and finance \nreform, and by some of the people with whom they have associated. I \nthink this latest effort is no less distasteful.\n  I thank the Chair for taking into consideration what I hope will be \nan attempt to turn to the real political debate on real issues and \nleave the character and some of the efforts we have seen to undermine \nthe true nature of how people try to compete in the political arena.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about recent \nremarks made by the Director of the CMS, Mr. Tom Scully. Last month, \nspeaking to an audience of health care providers in Lancaster, PA, Mr. \nScully made the following comments on the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. Scully has the agency that oversees the Medicare Program, so this \nis particularly disconcerting given the way he described the Medicare \nProgram. He used the phrase ``an unbelievable disaster.'' The person \nwho is the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices said: Medicare is an unbelievable disaster. We think it is a \ndumb system.\n  I could not disagree more. While I disagree with his views, at least \nI admire his candor because when it comes to Medicare, a lot of people \nare pretending to strengthen it and improve it when in fact they agree \nwith Mr. Scully.\n  Medicare, along with Social Security, is a great American success \nstory. Medicare has been in place since 1965. It is the only part of \nour health care system that is a universal system, meaning that once a \nperson is age 65, they have access to health care. Regardless of who \nthey are in this country or if they are disabled, they have access to \nhealth care. This is the only part of our system, the only group of \npeople, who know that there is a guarantee of health care for them; \nthat is, those who are under Medicare.\n  We have almost 40 million people now under Medicare, and because of \nSocial Security and Medicare, we have brought millions of seniors and \nthe disabled out of poverty into a better quality of life. I call that \na great American success story. I do not call it a ``dumb system.''\n  It is important to talk about what is happening right now in the \ndebate about Medicare and where we are. The day after the State of the \nUnion Address this year, President Bush went to Grand Rapids, MI. We \nalways welcome a President of the United States to my home State. He \ncame to promote his Medicare reform plan. However, he barely mentioned \nit during his speech. When he did mention it, he indicated that only \nthose who choose to go into private Medicare plans--not Medicare as we \nknow it but private sector plans--would be allowed to get prescription \ndrug coverage. Those who could not get into a private plan or who \nwanted to stay in traditional Medicare to see their own doctor, would \nbe, unfortunately, out of luck under this plan.\n  So we have a system that has been in place and has worked for seniors \nand the disabled since 1965, providing health care. Now we are hearing \nabout proposals which say that if someone wants to get help for \nprescription drugs, they have to go back to the system the way it was \nbefore, they have to go back to private insurance plans.\n  When the President said that, Republicans, Democrats, and health care \nproviders roundly criticized this particular plan. Many pointed to the \nfact that private sector Medicare plans are currently not a viable \noption in most of the country. They are just not there, let alone in \nrural areas.\n  In fact, the President, ironically, went to Grand Rapids, MI, to talk \nabout the virtue of private Medicare plans when even in the area where \nhe was, in western Michigan, there are no private sector plans. So \neveryone listening to him would not have access to help pay for their \nprescription drugs under the proposal that was made because the \nproposal that was made was based on something called Medicare+Choice, \nwhich has been a failure in Michigan as well as across the country.\n  The overall experience of the private sector plan, in fact, is that \nit has not worked. I will share the numbers. Nationwide, 2.5 million \nseniors have been dropped from private sector HMOs under \nMedicare+Choice plans. In fact, I have to say my mother was one of them \nin an HMO. She was having a good experience in a Medicare HMO, and they \ndropped Medicare. Out of the blue, she had to go look for another \ninsurance plan and other doctors because they pulled out.\n\n  In Michigan, 35,000 seniors have been dropped from these private \nplans, including, as I said, my own mother. Currently, only four \nMedicare+Choice plans operate in my State. They are available to only 2 \npercent of the population of my State, and they are all in the eastern \npart of the State none in the central part of the State, in Lansing \nwhere I live, none in west Michigan, in Grand Rapids, none in upstate \nMichigan or the Upper Peninsula only in one geographic area.\n  Given this fact and the fact that Democrats, Republicans, and many \nother people stood up and said, wait a minute, this is a plan that does \nnot make any sense, after a great deal of discussion the Bush \nadministration did release a new set of principles for adding \nprescription drugs to Medicare. This time, their plan allows those who \nremain in traditional Medicare to get only a minimal catastrophic \ncoverage and possibly a discount card.\n  We understand from analysis it would be an average of a little over \n$3 that would come off a prescription based on a discount card. \nHowever, if the senior citizen wanted real prescription drug help, \nreally wanted to be able to pick between food and their medicine, they \nwould have to, again, abandon traditional Medicare and possibly give up \nseeing their own doctor in order to go into a private plan.\n  In all sincerity, I believe this drive to privatize Medicare is \nsimply wrong. Since its inception in 1965, the Medicare system has \nworked well for seniors. In fact, back then 29 percent of the seniors \nof our country lived in poverty and now it is 11 percent. I call that a \nsuccess, although we still need to be worried about the 11 percent.\n  I agree that Medicare should be updated. I agree it should be \nmodernized to cover prescription drugs and also focus more on \nprevention. We heard Secretary Thompson who came before the Budget \nCommittee to talk about prevention. I agree with him. We need to change \nthe system to be more focused on prevention. We need to update Medicare \nto cover prescription drugs. But seniors should not be forced into \nprivate sector HMOs or other plans to obtain this kind of coverage.\n  Mr. Scully was honest about his beliefs. He spoke his mind. He \nexpressed the belief of many that Medicare is dumb and is a disaster. \nThese quotes are similar to those that were spoken by then-House \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich when he said he wanted to let Medicare wither on \nthe vine. These comments have been made before. It is very clear to me \nthat Mr. Scully, Mr. Gingrich, and many others want to replace Medicare \nwith a private sector system. I urge my colleagues to stand up against \nthis assault.\n  I am particularly concerned about what is happening and how it \nrelates to\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nthe tax plans that are in front of us, and what is happening now in the \neconomy. As a member of the Budget Committee, when many of us bring up \nconcerns about falling further into deficit through the tax plans that \nwere passed last year giving tax cuts to the elite, another round that \nis being proposed this year, and we see that we have 450 economists \nacross the country, including 10 Nobel laureates who say this will not \ncreate jobs, it will just add to weakening in the economy and, in fact, \nbe devastating because of the red ink it will create--when we see that, \nwhen we ask, how can you possibly support this when the first big round \nof baby boomers are coming very soon, in the next 6 to 8 years, how do \nwe do both?\n  How in the world can we afford to place ourselves in such jeopardy, \ntrillions of dollars in debt, the result of a policy that says tax cuts \nshould be given to the elite, while building up national debt. How can \nwe afford that?\n  I am told by colleagues, you assume Medicare and Social Security will \nbe there as you know it now. I do assume Medicare and Social Security \nwill be there as we know it now. When I look at the numbers, I am \ndeeply concerned. The Center of Budget and Policy Priorities released a \nreport recently that basically said if we just took the tax cuts for \nthe elite passed in 2001 and made those permanent and carried that out, \nit would cost about $10 trillion--if we carried that out the way we \nusually estimate Social Security and Medicare; over 75 years, $10 \ntrillion in costs for that tax policy.\n  What is the combined Medicare and Social Security deficit projected \nduring the same time? The $10 trillion that we are putting into place \nif that passes in the House and the Senate and is signed by the \nPresident. We will voluntarily be setting ourselves on a course to $10 \ntrillion in debt right when we know Medicare and Social Security will \nneed $10 trillion.\n  If you add to that the current debates about adding to that with the \nnew policies that have been proposed, we end up between $12 trillion \nand $14 trillion in costs exactly at the same time we have a need for \n$10 trillion in Medicare and Social Security.\n  This is a conscious choice. For those who vote for the plan proposed \nby the President, you are putting in place great jeopardy to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It is a conscious choice. I have to assume it \ncomes based on what Mr. Skully was talking about, that people believe \nMedicare is a dumb system, an unbelievable disaster.\n  Medicare and Social Security are great American success stories. We \nneed a short-term plan for jobs, opportunity, and prosperity, and that \nis what we are proposing. That really creates jobs. We can give tax \ncuts responsibly for taxpayers and small businesses and help States \nwithout jeopardizing Medicare and Social Security.\n  I am deeply concerned about this and urge colleagues to take another \nlook at what is proposed in the Senate and work together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5830-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5830-S5831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the energy \nbill and need for a comprehensive energy policy.\n  Although we were unable to pass an energy bill in the 107th Congress, \nI am hopeful that in this Congress we will be able to get a good bill \nthrough the Senate, out of conference, and onto the President's desk.\n  We have had a department of energy for over 20 years. But we've never \nhad a sound national energy policy.\n  Now is the time for Congress to get serious about addressing our \nenergy supply and needs.\n  In order to make progress on the energy bill we need to figure out \nhow to increase production while also doing more to encourage \nconservation.\n  In the past I think Congress has failed to make progress on energy \npolicy because we have tried to make a choice between the two.\n  I hope most of us understand that a sensible energy policy must \nstrike a balanced approach that includes a boost in domestic energy \nproduction as well as a promotion of conservation and smarter energy \nuse.\n  The energy bill before us, under Chairman Domenici's leadership takes \ngood steps towards striking this balance.\n  I look forward to the tax provisions coming from the finance \ncommittee that will further promote conservation and energy efficiency \nby encouraging the use of cleaner burning fuels.\n  As a member of both the energy committee and finance committee, I am \npleased to have had the opportunity to help craft the bill before the \nSenate.\n  In the wake of September 11 and ongoing problems in the middle east, \nit is more and more obvious a sound energy policy is a crucial part of \nour national security.\n  We must have reliable sources of energy and we must cut our reliance \non foreign oil.\n  Increasing our domestic production is critical in reducing our \nforeign dependence.\n  Right now we depend upon foreign nations--including the middle east--\nfor nearly 60 percent of our Nation's oil supply.\n  Americans have experienced some difficult times recently when oil and \ngas prices shot up. They are starting to edge back down now. But during \nthe winter and early spring consumers saw prices go up and up.\n  We all saw the rise in gas prices this winter and the crimp it put on \nthe economy.\n  We are struggling to get out of a recession now, and while passing an \nenergy bill might not help us in the short term, it could make a \ndifference the next time we hit an economic downturn or things flare up \nin the middle east.\n  The need to increase our own production of energy has never been more \nimportant than now.\n  While we appear to be moving away from combat in Iraq, there is still \na lot of uncertainty in the middle east.\n  It is too important and there is too much instability in the world. \nWe need to pass an energy policy now.\n  Mr. President, Congress has been playing political football with the \nissue for the past few years. I think it's time to end the game.\n  Our Nation and our National security continue to be at stake.\n  We must strengthen our energy independence to protect ourselves from \nany dangerous and unpredictable events in the middle east.\n  We don't want the United States beholden to other countries just to \nkeep our engines running and lights turned on.\n  While I am disappointed that ANWR is not in the bill before us, the \nbill does provide a good starting point to help our Nation increase \ndomestic production of energy and reduce our reliance on foreign \nsources.\n  It also provides important conservation provisions which will help \nprotect the environment.\n  I am also glad that the Senate's energy bill contains the clean coal \nprovisions I wrote to help increase domestic production while also \nimproving environmental protection.\n  For my home State, this means more jobs and a cleaner place to live.\n  Clean coal technologies will result in a significant reduction of \nemissions and a sharp increase in efficiency of turning coal into \nelectricity.\n  I'm proud to come from a coal state. For generations Kentuckians from \nPike county in the east to Crittenden county in the west have made \ntheir living in the coal fields and coal mines.\n  For the last decade coal in Kentucky was on the downturn because of \nlegislative and regulatory policies from the Federal Government.\n  Now I am glad to see that we have turned that around and are taking \nsteps to make sure that coal continues to play a vital role in meeting \nour future energy needs.\n  This focus on clean coal is good for the environment. And it is \ncertainly good for the economy and for putting folks back on the job.\n  The energy bill encourages research and development of clean coal \ntechnology by authorizing nearly $2.6 billion in appropriations for the \nD.O.E. to conduct programs to advance new technology.\n  Almost $2 billion will be used for the clean coal power initiative \nwhere D.O.E. will work with industry to advance efficiency, \nenvironmental performance, and cost competitiveness of new clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  The proposed energy tax package includes nearly $2 billion in tax \ncredits\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\nfor companies to implement clean coal technology.\n  Coal plays in important role in our economy. The 21st century economy \nis going to require increased amounts of reliable, clean, and \naffordable electricity to keep our Nation running.\n  Today, more than half of our Nation's electricity is generated from \nabundant low cost domestic coal.\n  We have over 275 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. This is \nnearly 30 percent of the world's coal supply.\n  That is enough coal to supply us with energy for more than 250 years.\n  With research advances, we have the know-how to better balance \nconservation with the need for increased production. We should use our \nknow-how to come up with a good energy bill.\n  I hope we can move it quickly and pass a bill to make our \nenvironment, economy, and National security stronger.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, I want to talk today about Justice \nPriscilla Owen. On Friday, it will be the 2-year anniversary of the \nnomination of Justice Priscilla Owen for the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and also for Miguel Estrada to the District of Columbia Court \nof Appeals.\n  These are two qualified nominees in every respect who are being \nfilibustered to keep them from taking their seats. They have both \nreceived a majority vote of the Senate, but neither of them is \nconfirmed because we are now being asked to have a 60-vote threshold \nfor these qualified nominees. It is not right, and I think it goes \nagainst the Constitution and affects the balance of powers.\n  The balance of powers was very clearly and purposefully set out by \nour Founders so that each branch would be separate and equal. In the \nConstitution, it says the President will nominate Federal judges and \nthe Senate will give its advice and consent. Historically, advice and \nconsent under the Constitution has meant a majority vote for judicial \nnominees. It does not mean a 60-vote threshold. And it does not mean \nthat the Senate can dictate to the President whom the President can \nnominate.\n  We should give the President's nominees an up-or-down vote when they \nget out of the committee. The committee is there to have hearings, to \nquestion these nominees. If a person gets out of committee, that person \ndeserves a vote on the floor.\n  When the Founding Fathers did think that a supermajority should be \nrequired, they clearly provided for it. For example, article II, \nsection 2, gives the President the power to nominate ``by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds \nof the Senators present concur.'' Immediately following this provision, \nthe Constitution gives the President the power to make judicial \nnominations ``by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,'' \nperiod.\n  By clear omission, the Constitution does not require a supermajority \nfor judicial nominees as it does for treaties. Congress has no right--\nit has no power, as outlined by the Constitution--to assume a different \nrole in the nomination and confirmation of judges. A filibuster \nrequiring 60 votes on a judicial nominee is beyond the intent of the \nConstitution.\n  Furthermore, the 25th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, approved by \nthe Senate in 1965, demonstrates, I think, the intent of the Founding \nFathers in confirming a nominee. In this case, the Vice President \n``shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses \nof Congress.'' If we are required to approve the Vice President of the \nUnited States by a majority vote, how could we possibly require a 60-\nvote threshold for a Federal judge?\n  I understand that cloture votes are needed sometimes for procedural \nreasons, such as a time-management device, but with the nomination of \nMiguel Estrada this has not been the case; with the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen this has not been the case.\n  This kind of filibuster is unprecedented in Senate history. So I hope \nwe can do one of three things: We can start talking about changing the \nSenate rules so that, in the case particularly of judicial nominations, \nwe will not ever have a 60-vote threshold, which is not contemplated by \nthe Constitution; or we can require a vote, ask for a vote, get a vote \nfor these qualified nominees; or we can file a lawsuit, asking the \ncourts to decide if the balance of powers in the Constitution is being \nviolated by this 60-vote threshold.\n  I do hope we will get an up-or-down vote on these nominations. The \nfact that they have received over 51 votes--both of them--shows that \nthey would be confirmed if they had their right to an up-or-down vote \nin the Senate.\n  Priscilla Owen, of course, is from Texas, so I know her and I know \nher reputation. She has the strongest bipartisan support you could \npossibly ask for. She is a person who graduated cum laude from Baylor \nLaw School, made the highest grade on the State bar exam when she \ngraduated. She has been elected to the supreme court by over 80 percent \nof the people in Texas. She is universally well regarded.\n  She is not a judicial activist. In fact, it is her strict adherence \nto the letter of the law and Supreme Court rulings that has been one of \nthe problems with this nomination because she didn't make law. She \ndidn't try to put words in the mouth of a legislator. She just followed \nwhat the legislature said in the parental consent laws in the State of \nTexas, the law of the State. She followed the letter of the law and the \nSupreme Court rulings and tried not to be a judicial activist. For that \nshe is being accused of being a judicial activist.\n  She was grilled twice by members of the Judiciary Committee. She had \nvery tough hearings. I don't think I have ever seen a nominee do \nbetter. She knew every answer to every question asked, even the minutia \nof cases that had been heard by her court years ago. She knew what she \nhad done and the reasoning for it. Her hearings alone would be enough \nto show her academic prowess and her qualifications for this bench.\n  Further than that, the hearings also showed her judicial temperament. \nShe handled herself so well, and she has gone through 2 years of a \ngrueling experience--not something she is used to. Judges are not \nusually in the political arena. Even when they are elected, they don't \nusually have strong opposition. They don't have these spirited races \nsuch as we see in legislatures and the Congress. It wasn't that she was \nattuned to the slings and arrows of politics. She has handled herself \nso beautifully, I don't think you could ever argue that she does not \nhave the judicial temperament. When you put that together with her \nclear academic excellence, she is the kind of person we want on the \nbench.\n  I wonder if we turn down nominees like Miguel Estrada, who came to \nthis country from South America when he was about 18 years old, didn't \nspeak English, worked his way through Columbia, was Phi Beta Kappa, \nwent to Harvard Law School and graduated magna cum laude, then had an \noutstanding record in the Solicitor General's Office, winning very \ncomplicated Supreme Court cases, and is known as one of the outstanding \nappellate lawyers in America--if people like Priscilla Owen and Miguel \nEstrada are not the kind of people we are going to put on the court, we \nare going to start having mediocre people on the court.\n  We will have people who never have said anything, people who don't \nhave the stellar reputations. These scholars, Miguel Estrada and \nPriscilla Owen, are people who are willing to take pay cuts in order to \nserve, because they like the intellectual challenge. They like what \nthey are doing. They like public service. They are willing to take huge \npay cuts for serving, and they are willing to do it. And they are \nquality people. What are we doing? What are we doing holding up quality \nqualified people like this?\n  These nominations should not be controversial. They obviously are \nbecause they are not being passed, but\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\nthese are not controversial people. They are mild-mannered, brilliant, \nfair, evenhanded, temperamentally sound people. We are putting them \nthrough the political meat grinder.\n  I have to ask: Who are we going to get, as we go down the road and \ngood people watch what has happened to Priscilla Owen and Miguel \nEstrada? Who is going to submit themselves to be a Federal judge, if \nthey have to go through this kind of political process?\n  I hope the Senate can amicably resolve the issue of nominations, \nespecially judicial nominations where the Constitution and the balance \nof power are at stake. I hope we will allow these votes for these two \npeople who deserve an up-or-down vote and deserve to be on the bench. \nThey will both make excellent judges.\n  May 9 is Friday. We are going to have cloture votes tomorrow, May 8, \nthe day before the 2-year anniversary of these qualified nominations. I \nhope those who are filibustering them will see their way clear to let \nthe majority rule. Both of these nominees have now gotten 52 and 54 \nvotes respectively. They have the majority. In any other case they \nwould be on their way to sitting on the circuit courts of appeals. That \nis where they ought to be. That is where they deserve to be.\n  I hope my colleagues will allow Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen to \ntake their rightful place on the bench. They have earned the majority \nvote. They have received a majority vote, which is what is required by \nthe Constitution. They should be allowed to be confirmed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few more words about \nour broken judicial confirmation process. This week the Senate marks a \ndismal political anniversary: 2 years of partisan obstruction of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees, culminating in two unprecedented \nfilibusters, and more are threatened.\n  The current list includes Justice Priscilla Owen, with whom I served \non the Texas Supreme Court, whose nomination is now subject to a \nfilibuster before the Senate. This 2-year anniversary indicates the \ntrue breadth of the failure of the judicial confirmation process, an \nincreasingly bitter and destructive process, a process that does a \ndisservice to the President, to the Senate, to the nominees, and \nultimately to the American people.\n  Today a partisan minority of Senators are forcing a supermajority \nrequirement of 60 votes on the judicial confirmation process. They are \nusing the filibuster not simply to provide for adequate debate--a \nreasonable and laudable goal--but to prevent many of our Nation's most \ntalented legal minds, in this case at least two of them, from filling \nour Nation's judicial vacancies. These obstructionist activities \ncontinue to undermine the constitutional principles of judicial \nindependence and majority rule.\n  My colleagues should not think the American people do not know what \nis going on here. They see when a nominee's well-recognized abilities \nare ignored in favor of scare tactics and revisionist history, and they \nsee when some Senators eschew the interests of the States from which \nthey were elected, and, indeed, our Nation, and instead kowtow to \nspecial interest groups.\n  I am confident that Members of the Senate are wise enough to reject, \nI guess, what can only be called an inhuman caricature that has been \ndrawn of Justice Priscilla Owen by special interest groups intent on \nvilifying, demonizing, and marginalizing an admirable nominee.\n  If we were allowed to hold a vote today, a bipartisan majority of \nthis body stands ready to confirm Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  I would like to take a few moments to talk about my own observations \nwhile serving with Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court for a period \nof 3 years during which our terms overlapped, from the time she joined \nthe court in January 1995 until the time I left the court after serving \n7 years in October of 1997.\n  During those 3 years, I had the privilege of working closely with \nJustice Owen. I had the opportunity to observe on a daily basis exactly \nhow she approached the task of judging, how she thinks about the law \nand, indeed, her responsibilities, and how she thinks judges should \nperform once given the awesome responsibility that confers.\n  I spoke with and debated with Justice Owen in conference on countless \noccasions about how to faithfully read and follow statutes passed by \nthe legislature and how to interpret precedents; that is, cases that \nhad been previously decided that are binding on courts in terms of \ntheir guidance on deciding the same issues in the future.\n  I saw how hard she worked to faithfully interpret and apply what the \nlegislature had written. I saw her take notes. I saw her tireless \nattention to detail, her zeal for studying the law, her dedication and \nher diligence. Not once did I see her attempting to pursue a political \nor personal agenda at the expense of what the law said or what the law \nrequired.\n  Indeed, some of my colleagues have taken her to task for disagreeing, \nand the fact that appellate judges, particularly at the highest court \nin my State, would actually disagree with one another, and suggesting \nthat somehow there is something wrong with that.\n  Well, to the contrary. That is exactly what the job of a judge is. If \nwe did not have judges occasionally disagree with each other, that \nwould mean somebody was not doing their job, because by the time cases \nget to the top echelons of our judicial system, they are the hardest \ncases. They are the cases that cannot be solved by lower levels of the \njudiciary or indeed by settlement between the parties. These are \nimportant issues and must be decided. Indeed, a judge, unlike a member \nof this body, cannot choose to simply walk away. They must decide the \ncase in the posture as presented by the litigants.\n  From experience and from observation, Justice Owen believes strongly \nthat judges are called upon not to act as another legislative branch, \nnot to act as a politician trying to read the polls or trying to assess \nwhat public opinion may say about this question or another. A judge's \njob is to faithfully read the statutes on the books and then apply them \nto the case before him or her or to interpret the precedents by earlier \ncourts and to faithfully apply those, not in a lawmaking fashion but in \na law interpretation and law enforcement fashion.\n  Indeed, that is the difference between what judges do and what \nmembers of the executive or legislative branches do. Judges are not \nsupposed to make law. They are supposed to interpret and enforce the \nlaw written by the legislature.\n  I can testify from my personal experience as her former colleague \nthat Priscilla Owen is an exceptional judge and one who understands and \ninternalizes her duty to follow the law and enforce the will of the \nlegislature. That is why the American Bar Association gave her a \nunanimous rating of well qualified. That is why she has strong \nbipartisan backing, including Democrats in the State of Texas and \nDemocrat practitioners who have seen her in action. That is why she had \nenthusiastic support from her fellow Texans in her last election to the \ncourt. Some 84 percent of the voters voted to return her to office when \nshe ran for that election.\n  Simply put, she is a brilliant legal scholar and a warm and engaging \nperson. Knowing the individual, the human being, as I do, it causes me \ngreat pain to see her treated the way I believe she has been treated, \nunfairly, during the judicial confirmation process, and to hear \nSenators describe her in a way that nobody who knows her would \nrecognize.\n  Not many in this body have had the privilege of knowing her \npersonally and so that is why I think it is important\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nfor me to say the picture that has been painted of this highly \nqualified and highly talented human being and great judge in our State \nof Texas is more than just a little disappointing. It is beneath the \ndignity of this institution and disserves not only this institution but \nthe constitutional requirement of judicial confirmation and, indeed, \nultimately the American people.\n  The beltway special interest groups are not interested in trying to \nunderstand or evaluate Justice Owen by her real record, because if they \nwere, they would see it as a sterling record of intelligence, \naccomplishment, and bipartisan support. The special interest groups are \nnot interested in the confirmation of nominees who merely interpret the \nlaw and render judgment responsibly. They are only interested in \nconfirming people who they believe are advocates of their interests, \nsomething that is totally at odds and conflicts with the role a judge \nis supposed to perform.\n\n  Sadly, it is clear that these same special interest groups are \ninterested in obstructing as many of President Bush's judicial nominees \nas they possibly can. Those who oppose Justice Owen's confirmation \nappear to have really no stomach for debate and talking about the \nfacts. They choose instead to filibuster and engage in the worst kind \nof mean-spirited and destructive political attacks.\n  Let there be no doubt left in the matter. Allow me to quote one of \nthe leaders of the special interest groups opposed to Justice Owen's \nnomination quoted in the Los Angeles Times last week, when they said: \nIt is sad that not all of these nominees can be filibustered.\n  So it is clear who is playing the tune and who is giving the \ninstructions. Unfortunately, too many are heeding those instructions to \nfilibuster the President's nominees, to prevent a bipartisan majority \nof this body from voting to confirm those nominees as they would today \nin the case of Priscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada.\n  I can only hope that at some point my colleagues will understand what \nis going on and reject this special interest influence on the judicial \nconfirmation process. I can only hope that ultimately what we will all \nstrive for is a process that is fair and consistent with our \nconstitutional duty. Yet by blocking a vote on Priscilla Owen, they \nmake themselves allies to these groups, groups that rejoice at the \nprospect of a Senate in constant gridlock when it comes to the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  These shrill attacks are inaccurate, dishonest and unfair. It is not \nthe first time. These are the same people and the same groups that \nclaimed during the nomination of Supreme Court Justice John Paul \nStevens that he ``expressly opposed women's interests.'' They found \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ``a deeply disturbing \ncandidate.'' They testified that Justice Lewis Powell's confirmation \nwould mean that ``justice for women will be ignored.'' And they \ndescribed Supreme Court Justice David Souter as ``almost neanderthal.''\n  Those attacks and the current attacks of these same special interest \ngroups are neither accurate nor, after they have long been exposed as \nuntrue, should they be deemed credible. Lending credence to these \ntactics should be beneath this body. They have no standing for their \narguments to be considered legitimate by this body. Like the little boy \nwho cried wolf one too many times, they should be ignored by this body.\n  It is hard to recognize the caricatures that opponents of these \nnominees have drawn. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who \nhas voted on a number of President Bush's nominees for the Federal \nbench, I have seen the politics of personal destruction are fast \nbecoming a commonplace activity for our judicial nominees. Indeed, I \nbegan to wonder whether there are enough good and honorable people with \ndistinguished records left in the legal profession or in the judiciary \nwho will volunteer to submit their names to this destructive process \nwho, knowing the facts, regardless of the truth, they will be painted \nas some horrible caricature of their principal beliefs. Nominees who \nare so well recognized for their ability should not be required to \nserve an indefinite period of time in the stocks as targets for these \nspecial interest groups that attack them on a regular basis.\n  It pains me to see what can only be called the politics of personal \ndestruction played out in the course of the judicial confirmation \nprocess.\n  This Friday the clock will run on into a third year of gridlock and \nobstruction. The special interest groups must be very proud.\n  These obstructionist tactics abuse the power of the filibuster. It \nnot only violates the bedrock principle of democracy and majority rule \nitself but arguably offends the Constitution, as well. Indeed, \nprominent Democrats such as former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler \nand, indeed, colleagues in the Senate currently serving, such as Tom \nDaschle, Joe Lieberman, and Tom Harkin, have condemned filibuster \nmisuse as unconstitutional. An abuse of filibusters against judicial \nnominations uniquely threatens both the Presidential power of \nappointment and the principle of judicial independence.\n  Whether unconstitutional or merely obstructive of our political \nsystem, the current confirmation crisis calls out for reform. As all 10 \nfreshmen Senators, myself included--including the distinguished Senator \nnow presiding--stated last week in a letter to the leadership: We are \nunited in our concern that the judicial confirmation process is broken \nand needs to be fixed. We believe the Senate must find an end to the \ndownward spiral of accusations, obstruction, and delay.\n  In the face of this consensus that the process is broken, I stand \nbefore this body today and say, once again, it is time for a fresh \nstart. In that spirit, the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution \nyesterday held a hearing to consider proposals that have been offered \nto try to restore both the integrity of the confirmation process and \nthe strength of our most cherished constitutional values. We explored \nand debated a variety of reform proposals at yesterday's hearing, \nincluding one from Senator Zell Miller from Georgia, who suggests what \nSenator Harkin and Senator Lieberman and 17 other Democrats did in \n1995; that the 60-vote rule for any debate be reduced incrementally \nwith each succeeding vote until the rule reaches 51 votes. There would \nbe 2-day intervals between each cloture vote so that the whole process \nwould last less than 2 weeks while ensuring adequate time for delay and \ndebate, if necessary, but in the end allowing the majority to do what \nthey are entitled to do in this body and elsewhere in a democracy, and \nthat is to have their will reflected in the law and, in this case, in \nthe confirmation of highly qualified nominees.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Lieberman back in 1995 originally argued \nthat this would preserve the traditions of this body while still giving \nthe minority plenty of time to plead its case without blocking the \nmajority forever.\n  Now Senator Miller has proposed this same rule be put into place. \nThis strikes me, personally, as the most intriguing option that has \nbeen presented. Senator Schumer advocates an overhaul of the judicial \nconfirmation process entirely by eliminating the President's \nappointment power and instead giving President Bush and the minority \nleader ``equal votes in picking the judge pickers.'' I really think \nthis is binding arbitration and foisting off on others what should be \nour responsibility and what we ought to be big enough and responsible \nenough to solve for ourselves. But I do give Senator Schumer credit for \noffering a reform proposal. I believe it reflects his opinion, as he \nhas stated, both in writing and orally, that the process is broken and \nneeds reform.\n  Essentially, Senator Schumer proposes that the President and the \nSenate minority leader select equal numbers of members of Senate \njudicial nominating positions in each State and circuit who would then \nselect one nominee for each judicial vacancy. The President would be \nrequired to nominate, and the Senate required to confirm the \nindividuals selected by the commission absent any evidence that the \ncandidate is ``unfit'' for judicial service.\n\n  While I appreciate the spirit of reform and trying to find our way \nout of this gridlock that I believe Senator Schumer's proposal \nrepresents, there are several concerns. I have stated some of them.\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\n  White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales has called the plan \n``inconsistent with the Constitution, with the history and traditions \nof the Nation's Federal judicial appointment process and with the \nsoundest approach for appointment of highly qualified Federal judges.''\n  Let me be clear. While I think there are problems with the proposal, \nI do appreciate Senator Schumer's acknowledgment of the problem.\n  Finally, Senator Arlen Specter and, indeed, Senator Leahy, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, have urged the imposition of \nstrict time deadlines for the Senate to hold hearings and votes on \njudicial nominees. Indeed, the President has proposed the same sort of \nprocedure. Chief Justice Rehnquist, speaking on behalf of the Federal \njudiciary, has also asked the Senate to ensure prompt up-or-down votes \non nominees. Senator Specter has fleshed out his proposal and did so \nyesterday, again, which would call for preset time periods for a \nnominee to be debated in the committee and on the floor and then \nfinally to reach an up-or-down vote.\n  I hope there will be more proposals. We had a panel of constitutional \nscholars, some of the most preeminent legal thinkers in the Nation, and \nI am sure there will be others. I hope there are others paying \nattention to this debate and who will offer proposals because I think \nit will take the best legal thinking. It will take a spirit of \nbipartisanship. It will take putting the recriminations and the finger-\npointing behind us and looking forward and not backward in trying to \nrelive some of those battles of the past for us to be able to get to \nclosure on some reform.\n  What is important in the short term is that each of these intelligent \nand responsible Members of the Senate have acknowledged a crisis exists \nand urge reform of the confirmation process.\n  We insist that judges be fair and impartial in deciding cases and \nthat they shall neither fear nor favor. But clearly the requirement of \nfairness does not end in the judicial branch of Government. It also \napplies to Congress and to this Senate in performing our \nresponsibilities. It is self-evident that this standard should apply in \nconfirming judicial nominees. Our current state of affairs is neither \nfair nor representative of the bipartisan majority of this body. For \ndemocracy to work and for the fundamental democratic principle of \nmajority rule to prevail, all this debate must eventually end, and we \nmust bring matters to a vote.\n  As Senator Henry Cabot Lodge once said about filibusters: To vote \nwithout debating is perilous, but to debate and never vote is imbecile.\n  I can tell you from personal experience as a former supreme court \njustice in my home State that when you put your left hand on the Bible \nand you raise your right hand and you take the oath of office as a \njudge, you change. If you were formerly an advocate, someone who did \nbattle in our courts of law, representing the position of a client, you \nno longer are an advocate. If you were formally a legislator, someone \nwho would argue in a body such as this for what public policy demands \nin terms of representing the best interests of the people you \nrepresent, once you become a judge, you are no longer a legislator; you \nchange.\n\n  You are, instead, entrusted with a solemn duty, and that is to \ninterpret the law to the best of your ability in accordance with the \nintent of the people who wrote that law. You must interpret the law as \nwritten and not as judges or lawyers or legislators or advocates or \nspecial interest groups might like that law to be written. You must \ninterpret the law as it has been written, consistent with the \nlegislative intent.\n  My hope is that this body will ultimately abide by the constitutional \nrequirement that majorities govern in the case of these two nominees \nwho are being filibustered. We must not, consistent with that same \nConstitution, impose a supermajority requirement where the Constitution \nrequires none and where the Supreme Court and Senate traditions and the \nfundamental principle of majority rule dictate that a majority vote, \nnot a 60-vote supermajority, will prevail.\n  We, of course, must consider the interests of our respective States \nand the Nation, and I think those interests should be considered above \nthe interests and desires of the special interest groups that seem to \nhave grabbed hold of the confirmation process and will not let it go.\n  We must act, and I believe we must act soon, to reform this broken \nconfirmation process. Of course, this task falls not on others far \naway, not even on the President, not on the judiciary, but this \nresponsibility falls on us as citizens, as Senators, as Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague and many other colleagues in \nrecent weeks have spoken on the floor on the subject of judicial \nappointments, Federal judgeships. I want to offer a few comments on the \nsubject, not because I think I am an expert--I don't even serve on the \nJudiciary Committee--but the comments that have been made on the floor \nof the Senate suggest to the American people that somehow one side of \nthe Senate is blocking judicial nominations, the system is broken, it \nis not working, and somehow it has to be fixed. Let me see if I can at \nleast provide some clarity.\n  In the summer of 1991, we had 110 vacancies in the Federal courts. \nThat has now been reduced to 47 vacancies. Why is that the case? \nBecause we have been processing nominations from the White House for \nFederal judgeships and approving new Federal judges for lifetime \nappointments. We have voted. We have had votes on 123 of President \nBush's Federal judges who have been confirmed. I have voted for 120 of \nthe 123.\n  Incidentally, of those 123, 2 of them were North Dakota Federal \njudges. I recognized that the openings in the Fargo and the Bismarck \ndistrict would be filled by President Bush, would be filled by \nRepublicans. The process worked the way it should work and the way I \nbelieve it should always work in that circumstance; that is, the White \nHouse and Senator Conrad and I worked together to find candidates, a \nlist of qualified candidates in North Dakota from which the President \nwould select. He then selected a candidate, a Republican, to send to \nthe Congress to say: Here is who I believe should be the new Federal \njudge for a lifetime in the Fargo district. Here is who I believe \nshould be the Federal judge for a lifetime in the Bismarck district.\n  He nominated both. I am proud to say I supported both. Both are \nwonderful lawyers. Both are going to be great judges. They both now sit \non the bench. They do so with my vote, and I was proud to do it. That \nis exactly the way this ought to work.\n  Let me describe a bit about what the Constitution does say about \njudgeships. It says the President:\n\n     . . . shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent \n     of the Senate shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme Court \n     and all other officers of the United States. . . .\n\n  What that means is the President shall nominate and the Senate in its \nprocess shall make a judgment about whether it advises and consents to \nthat nomination. So the President has no inherent right under the \nConstitution to send us a name and say: Oh, by the way, this is who I \naspire to appoint to the Federal bench, district court, or circuit \ncourt, and you must accept this nominee. That is not what the \nConstitution says.\n  The Constitution says there is a two-part process: The President \nproposes and we dispose. The President nominates and we give our advice \nand consent. A President not of my political party has the right to \nnominate members of his political party to sit on the Federal bench. \nWhen it worked as it worked in the circumstance with North Dakota, I \nwas proud to be someone who said: Count me in. I vote for these \nnominees because I think they will be great Federal judges.\n  When it doesn't work is a circumstance where the White House says: We \ndon't care what you think down in the Senate. Here is a name, and we \nare going to shove it down that pipe, and if you don't like it, tough; \nwe are going to fight like the dickens to get it.\n  You have the right to fight, I would say to the White House. You have \na\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\nright to fight for your nominees. But if you don't have a process where \nthere is some agreement and understanding of working together on \nlifetime appointments, sometimes nominees are going to get snared and \ncaught in a web down here.\n  We have approved 123 of the nominees sent to us by President Bush. As \nI indicated, I have voted for 120 of them. This so-called breakdown or \ncollapse in the process is over two nominations at this point.\n  This is not new. We have two nominations that are caught in the web, \nand I will explain why in a moment. The fact is this web has been a \nmuch tighter web for a long period of time in which we have reduced far \nmore than half of the vacancies in the Federal bench. Why? Because we \nare in the business of approving the President's nominees. In a \ncircumstance where we have approved 123 of them, it can hardly be said \nthat this process is broken.\n  But it has been broken. There were times when this process was \nbroken. One of the judgeships, the nominations that were sent here that \nis caught, is in the Fifth Circuit. Let me describe what happened in \nthe Fifth Circuit just so we have some history.\n  In the Fifth Circuit, from 1995 on we had three nominations by the \nprevious administration--three nominations--Judge Rangel, Enrique \nMoreno, and Alston Johnson. They never got a hearing--not one hearing, \nnot a day, not a minute. They were dead when they got here. There were \ngoing to be no hearings because there wasn't going to be a judge on the \nFifth Circuit Court appointed by that administration, by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  What happened? The administration changed. So did the control of the \nSenate for a while. Judge Clement was confirmed in 6 months; Judge \nPickering had two hearings, had a negative vote in the committee. \nPerhaps--I guess it was a negative vote. I was thinking perhaps he \npulled his nomination from consideration. But in any event, there was \naction in the committee for Judge Pickering.\n  Judge Priscilla Owen: two hearings, a vote in the committee.\n  Judge Edward Prado: a hearing, a vote.\n  Do you see the difference? Under the previous administration, the \nRepublican Senate would not even allow a hearing--not 1 minute of \nhearing, let alone bring a candidate to the hearing room and have a \ndiscussion and have a vote and bring it to the floor--not even a \nhearing, not 1 day. That was when the system was really broken.\n  Now we have a circumstance where we are told that because we have two \nnominations on the floor of the Senate that have not moved--and I will \nexplain why--that the system has somehow completely collapsed and we \nshould change the rules of the Senate.\n  Let us take a look at the DC Circuit Court. There was not any \nintention to add a judge to the District of Columbia Circuit Court \nunder the previous administration. We had the nomination of Allen \nSnyder. He was never given a vote. Elena Kagen was never given a vote \nbecause they said the District of Columbia Circuit doesn't have enough \nwork. We shouldn't add a judge to the DC Circuit. Now, all of a sudden, \nthe administration changes, and there is room for more. We need more, \nand we need to add someone to the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  You go up and down over the recent years, and you see, in the circuit \ncourt especially, candidate after candidate who was never given a vote \nand was never given a hearing. That is when the process was broken and \nhad collapsed.\n  It can hardly be said that the process doesn't work at this point \nwhen we have reduced the vacancies on the Federal bench by confirming \n123 of the President's nominees. And I have voted for almost all of \nthem. That is not a process that has collapsed.\n  Let me talk about the two that are at odds that Members have come to \nthe floor of the Senate and talked about how the system has collapsed.\n  The first is Mr. Estrada. Mr. Estrada was nominated by the President \nto the second highest court in the land. Mr. Estrada had been asked for \ncertain information: No. 1, to answer the questions posed to him by the \nJudiciary Committee when he appeared; and, No. 2, to have the \ninformation released--that is, information about his work when he was \nwith the Solicitor General's Office.\n  The fact is, until and unless Mr. Estrada releases that information \nand provides that information, in my judgment he will never get a vote \nin the Senate. He just won't. One might not like that. Fine, you do not \nhave to like that. But if we are talking about putting people on the \nFederal bench for a lifetime, we had better discharge our \nresponsibility in a serious way and be serious when we seek information \nfrom a candidate. That candidate has an obligation to provide the \ninformation. If it is not forthcoming, there is no entitlement and no \ninherent right under our Constitution to proceed to a vote on a nominee \nsent to us by the President.\n  It is interesting that Mr. Estrada testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee the same day Judge Hovland from North Dakota \ntestified before the committee. I referenced him before--a Republican \nwho now sits on the bench in Bismark, ND. He is someone for whom I was \nproud to have voted. The same questions that were asked of Mr. Estrada \nwere asked of Mr. Hovland that day. Mr. Hovland answered them. Mr. \nEstrada did not. That is why Mr. Estrada's nomination is caught in a \nnet here in the Senate. It is why he has not had a final vote. He has \nnot released the information from the Solicitor General's Office. He \ndid not respond to the questions.\n  As soon as all of that is available to the Senate, as I have said \nrepeatedly on this floor, I think he ought to be given a final vote, up \nor down. Until that time, no Senator ought to aspire to give a final \nvote to a candidate, to a lifetime appointment of judgeship, or on the \ncircuit or district court who says ``I am not going to provide the \ninformation you requested.'' No Senator should insist on proceeding to \nfinal vote in that circumstance.\n  That is not discharging the obligations of the Senate.\n  Let me talk for a moment about an article that I read in the San \nAntonio Express News which I thought really described exactly the same \ncircumstance we face here in the Senate, ``A Tale of Two Texas \nJudges.'' It happens to deal with the nomination of Judge Priscilla \nOwen and Judge Prado. I am going to read this because I think it is \nimportant.\n\n       In the nomination of U.S. District Judge Edward Prado for \n     the Louisiana-based 5th Circuit Court of Criminal Appeals, \n     President Bush has found a fail-proof strategy for selecting \n     federal judges. Prado faced no opposition from the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee--or anyone else for that matter--because, \n     unlike some of the President's other recent nominees, Prado \n     is well-qualified with a long record of fairness and \n     moderation.\n       Unfortunately, the full Senate will be consumed this week \n     with bitter debate over another White House judicial \n     nominee--Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who has \n     a different kind of record. Instead of moderation, Owen is \n     known for her conservative activism.\n       Opposition to Owen was so strong that her nomination was \n     rejected last year. This year's Republican-led Judiciary \n     Committee resuscitated it, giving Owen a slim 10-9 party-line \n     vote.\n       It is not as though Democrats are opposed to all White \n     House nominees. After all, the same committee voted 19-0 in \n     favor of Prado. Now Democrats in the Senate appear likely to \n     filibuster Owen's nomination. Once again, the battle over the \n     White House's judicial nominees is gridlocked.\n       To avoid this kind of partisan strife, the Bush \n     administration should employ the Prado strategy for future \n     judicial nominees.\n       That strategy is to choose moderate nominees with long \n     experience who understand that the role of the judge is not \n     to legislate from the bench.\n\n  There is a solution to all of this. It has nothing to do with \nchanging the rules. In fact, I submit that when we have confirmed 123 \njudges submitted by President Bush--and I voted for 120 of them--this \nprocess is hardly broken. But the solution to this is for the President \nand Mr. Gonzales to engage with the Senate and work with the Senate \nwith respect to the kind of nominee that we will put on the circuit \ncourt. There is no inherent right in the Constitution that says the \nPresident shall nominate and somehow the Senate must consider \nexpeditiously every nomination.\n  In fact, the Republicans for years and years since I have been in the \nSenate refused to hold hearings--not even one hearing for nominee after \nnominee after nominee.\n  We did not hear the discussion on the floor of the Senate so much \nabout changing the rules and the system\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nbeing broken with Mr. Enrique Moreno, who, I believe, is from Texas. I \nhave met him. He would have been a terrific judge. Unfortunately, he \nwasn't given the time of day by the Senate. We have not done that. This \nside has not done that. The fact is that even the two nominees who are \nin dispute at this point had their hearings. They had their day before \nthe committee. They had their vote before the committee. But Mr. Moreno \nis an example of so many others who never got any consideration at all.\n  Let me be quick to say that despite the miserable failure of dealing \nwith these judgeships back in the 1990s in the previous administration, \nI don't think this is at all payback. I don't think this is what this \nis. Payback would mean we would not have approved 123 of the \nnominations sent to us by President Bush. We have done that because we \nthink the selection of judges is a process that requires the \nopportunity for both of us to work our will. The President can send a \nnomination to us and we can consider that and the options that we have \nto deal with that nomination.\n\n  The way to avoid the pitfalls and the problems that exist with the \ntwo nominations that are causing such angst and people coming to the \nfloor saying the sky is falling and the system has collapsed is for the \nPresident to work with the Members on the nominees they send to the \nSenate. There are some--not many--who are simply not going to be \nconfirmed. It is almost automatic that this President's nominees are \ngoing to sit on the Federal bench--not quite automatic but almost--\nevidenced by the fact that 123 we have approved with the votes of \nalmost all Democratic Senators.\n  There is a way to solve this problem. If you don't believe me, then \nbelieve this editorial which is exactly on the mark.\n  If they say our strategy is simple, we are going to pack the circuit \ncourts with philosophical extremists, and they send us names that \nreflect the desire to pack the circuit courts with extremists, I am \nsorry; this process isn't going to work. This process is going to slow \ndown and perhaps stop because, in my judgment, this Senate is not going \nto allow that to happen. We insist if someone is going to sit for a \nlifetime on the Federal bench that they be qualified and not be \njudicial activists who bring an aggressive agenda to the bench.\n  With respect to the Owen nomination, I was not on the Judiciary \nCommittee and was not part of the hearings, but I have read the record. \nI have certainly heard from a lot of people who know and who have \nworked with Judge Owen. I have read the statement of Mr. Gonzales \nhimself from the White House exercising his great angst at her judicial \nactivism on the bench in Texas. But the fact is, she had her day in the \nSenate last year, and she was turned down by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Now that nomination comes back to us. The fact is, she is \none of those few who clearly is a very aggressive judicial activist.\n  The Gonzales quote is very telling to me. It is not just Judge \nGonzales. That same quote about the disposition of Judge Owen and what \nshe does on the bench in the State supreme court is not just from Mr. \nGonzales, it is from a range of sources, which I think persuades many \nin the Senate not to want to proceed with this nominee.\n  But do not--do not--take the two instances of Mr. Estrada, who has \nrefused to provide the information that is requested by the Senate, and \nJudge Owen, who was turned down last year by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, to say somehow the sky is falling and the structure is \nbroken and we ought to change the rules of the Senate, and how awful \nthis is. Nonsense, total nonsense.\n  Mr. President, 123 judges sitting on the Federal bench are testimony \nto the fact that we are approving President Bush's judges. It is just \nthat there are two who stick in the craw of people because they say we \nhave a responsibility, somehow, to rubberstamp all these nominations. I \nam not going to rubberstamp anybody who is going to serve for a \nlifetime, especially on a circuit court. If they are not going to \nprovide the information, then they ought not sit on the Federal bench--\nsimple, just open and shut. It has nothing to do with politics, nothing \nto do with Republicans, nothing to do with Democrats. If you don't \nprovide the information, you are not going to sit on the Federal bench.\n  Maybe those of us who think that way are in the minority. If so, \neventually, I guess, those people will get to the Federal bench. They \nwill say to Congress: I'm sorry, I have a Presidential nomination, and \nI have no obligation to give you additional information. If there are \nenough Senators who believe that is discharging our responsibilities, \nby saying, yes, sir, absolutely, well then maybe these nominations will \nhappen, but they won't happen with my vote, not with a Republican or \nwith a Democrat.\n  This is what Judge Gonzales said. In Jane Doe, Judge Alberto \nGonzales--incidentally, a then-supreme court justice, who is clearing \nthese nominees through the White House--stated that to interpret the \nlaw, as Justice Owens did in this case ``would be an unconscionable act \nof judicial activism.''\n  I will tell you what. It is not just this phrase. If we had time and \nI had the interest, I would show you other examples of exactly this \nsort of activism which persuades me this is not the kind of judge I \nwant to put on a circuit court.\n  Let me make the point, once again, that the Constitution provides two \nthings: The President shall nominate, and the Senate shall advise and \nconsent. If a President, any President, decides he is going to try to \nstack a circuit court with people of extremist views, then this \nSenate--I guarantee you, this Senate--whether it is Republicans against \na Democratic President or Democrats stopping a Republican President--\nthis Senate is going to say: I am sorry, it is not going to happen.\n  Perhaps we should get a long list out here, perhaps a list of 123 \nnames. We could start with North Dakota with Justice Erickson or we \ncould start with any one of a number of the others on that list of 123 \nwho are now Federal judges because President Bush said, ``I want \nthem,'' and because the Senate said, ``You bet. We have taken a look at \nthese judges and they deserve to be on the Federal bench.''\n  Perhaps going through 123 of them, reducing the number of vacancies \nby well more than half, we would define that as success rather than a \ncalamity. But if we do not want to take a look at the success, then \nlet's take a look at the two who exist that are causing these problems \nand these difficulties.\n  I will tell you, we have, in my judgment, every right to say to the \nPresident, in these circumstances: Work with us to send us nominees who \nwe can put on the DC Circuit, who we can put on the Fifth Circuit. Work \nwith us to do that, just as you worked with us with 123 other Federal \njudges who now are on the Federal bench.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. During the years when President Clinton was sending \nnominees down here, there was a period of time when the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate. Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. If that were the case, every person he sent down would have \nbeen approved, is that right, using the logic used by the majority now?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Right.\n  Mr. REID. The fact is, a relatively small percentage of the people he \nsent down were approved because the Republicans did not like the people \nhe sent down; is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Now, I personally disagreed with what the Republicans were \ndoing at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his allotted time in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what is the allotted time under morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The allotted time is 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under my time, I will ask the Senator a \nquestion and would appreciate him responding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. He yielded the floor. Of course I have the floor. Who else \nhas it? He yielded the floor. I asked permission to be recognized.\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is out of time.\n  Mr. REID. I know. And I asked----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REID. What do you mean: ``The Senator from Texas''? I asked to be \nrecognized, and I was recognized. What do you mean: ``The Senator from \nTexas''? What are you talking about?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I recognize the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I ask a parliamentary inquiry for \nthe moment? I now understand we were under a period of morning \nbusiness. When I came, the Senator from Texas was speaking, I assume, \nperhaps, under morning business as well. I don't know whether I \nconsumed more time than he did or whether it was about even. Could you \ntell me how much time the Senator from Texas used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas asked to speak for 20 \nminutes and did speak for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time did I consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Now, if the Senator from Texas wishes to go someplace or something, I \nwould be happy to yield the floor to the Senator. I don't have much to \nsay, but I have a few things to say.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Certainly. I would like the opportunity to respond to \nsome of the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID. Fine. I will not be long at all. I appreciate that.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, the point I was making, when \nthe Chair indicated time was up, was that there were procedures by the \nmajority that stopped President Clinton's nominees from going forward. \nDoes the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, including filibusters, of course.\n  Mr. REID. I recall, very clearly, there were hearings not held in the \nJudiciary Committee; is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, many of the nominees never got a hearing--ever--\nunder any circumstance.\n  Mr. REID. And we, the minority at the time, did not like it, and we \nhad a Democratic President; is that not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask the Senator this question: During the time you \nhave been in the Senate and I have been in the Senate, we have seen \nchanges of the majority--whether it was Democrats or Republicans--it \nswitches back and forth; is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The Senator is correct, yes.\n  Mr. REID. Now, I say to my friend from North Dakota, in the form of a \nquestion I ask you to respond to, we did not like what happened, but \nthe Senate went on just fine; the country survived; did it not?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Absolutely. I remember Mr. Paez, who is now a Federal \njudge, his nomination was here 1,500 days. I remember the number of \ntimes people came to the floor of the Senate expressing great angst \nabout that. It took forever.\n  But unlike Mr. Paez, many nominees never got a hearing, let alone a \nvote, never got called to Washington, being told: All right, your \nnomination is before the Senate. This is the date of your hearing. Many \nnominees never ever got a hearing.\n  But I say to the Senator from Nevada, this ought not be, and should \nnever be, payback for ``this side did this, that side did that, so for \nthe last 20 years, let's get even.'' That ought not be what the case \nis. And I demonstrate and I assert it is not the case because we have \napproved 123 of President Bush's nominations. I said: I am proud to do \nthat. I was proud to support the two Republican nominees from North \nDakota because I think they are terrific judges.\n  I think we have had great success here. I admit that there is a \nhangup with two of the judgeships.\n  I say to my colleague from Texas, who spoke before I did, I do not \nmean to be pejorative about this. I do not mean to question anyone's \nmotives. I only say that when one asserts that the sky is falling, the \nsystem is broken, and nothing is working, there is another view. I was \ntrying to express another view, respectfully.\n  I respect the opinion of the Senator from Texas, but I have a very \ndifferent view about our responsibilities, our obligations, and our \naccomplishments with respect to these nominations.\n  If I might make one additional comment, I say to the Senator from \nNevada, I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I do not pretend to be an \nexpert in these circumstances with these issues. I have studied enough \nand learned enough to know that many of the nominations that are sent \nhere have been excellent. I have been proud to support them.\n  But I also understand there are circumstances where we have an \nobligation and a right to assert our rights. That is exactly what is \nhappening in two circumstances that I think have caused great angst \namong some and caused them to say the sky is falling. But the sky is \nnot falling at all.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I simply wanted to acknowledge the \nstatements of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from North Dakota. \nI am trying to make a point that things change around here: Democrats \nare in control; Republicans are in control. The Democrats will be back \nin control of the Senate sometime. It may not be in the next election \ncycle; it may not be in the next election cycle, but it will happen. We \nwill be in control sometime, and we will have a Democratic President \nsometime. I think we have to look into the future, that we don't jam \nthe system.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from North Dakota indicating this \nis not payback time. When we took control of the Senate, we said at \nthat time, this is not payback time. We have proven that. There have \nbeen hearings held. If there is somebody who has been held up, that \nshould be brought to the attention of the body. Senator Daschle and I \nhave stated on many occasions that this is not payback time. If it \nwere, things would be in desperate shape.\n  We have approved a lot of judges that don't meet what many people \nover here feel is in the best interests of the country, but we have \nfelt that the President has to have great leeway in the people he has \nchosen. That is indicated by the 123 we have approved.\n  I understand the power of concern of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Hatch. His feelings about Miguel Estrada have been \nmade very clear. I know Senator Hatch. I know how strongly he feels \nabout this matter. But I would hope that those on the other side will \nunderstand that Miguel Estrada's problem could be solved so easily. Let \nus see the documents from the Solicitor's Office, and I think it could \nbe solved very quickly.\n  With Justice Owen, it is a different problem. But remember, we are \ntalking about 123 to 2. I don't think it is fair to try to tell the \nAmerican public that the system is broken. I really don't think it is.\n  I want also to apologize publicly for raising my voice to the Chair. \nI rarely do that. I did and I apologize to the Chair for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to respond to \nsome of the comments made by the Senator from North Dakota and the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  First, I certainly respect their right to have an opinion and to \nexpress an opinion that this system of judicial confirmation is not \nbroken. I disagree with them. Reasonable observers, outside of the \nbubble in this Chamber and perhaps inside the beltway, looking at this \nsystem will say: The system is broken and disagree with them. Indeed, \nto date, over 134 editorials in 94 newspapers have called for the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen and have called for \nan end to the filibuster. Indeed, the preponderance of the views is in \nfavor of those who believe that the system is broken and sorely in need \nof reform.\n  I pointed out the bipartisan letter of the 10 freshmen. I pointed out \neven Senator Schumer and others who have been here for quite a while \nbelieve the system is broken. So I think we need a fresh start.\n  In many ways, the Senator from North Dakota makes my case for me.\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nWhen he goes back through all of the grievances of the past in the \njudicial confirmation process, real or perceived, he says the system \nwas broken back then but it is not now.\n  He also says that because Democrats have voted or allowed a vote--\nthey haven't necessarily voted for them, but they have allowed a vote--\non 123 of the President's judicial nominees and disallowed votes on \nonly 2, that it somehow makes it all right.\n  There is an important point that needs to be made. When 123 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees have been confirmed and 2 have been \nblocked by unprecedented filibusters--and please understand there has \nnever been a filibuster before, a true filibuster of judicial nominees \nbefore in the history of the Senate before Miguel Estrada and Priscilla \nOwen--how can some of these same people stand on the floor of the \nSenate or in the Judiciary Committee or in front of TV cameras and say \nPresident Bush is nominating only ideologues. Back in my State, some of \nthe names I have heard these nominees called would be fighting words. \nIf somebody called you some of the names I have heard these nominees \ncalled, indeed the President for nominating some of these same people, \nthose would be simply fighting words.\n\n  We are not fighting here today. I am simply trying to make the point \nthat the sort of harsh, shrill, unreasonable, emotional allegations \nbeing made by some of these special interest groups that are being \nrepeated by some Members of this body when it comes to these nominees \nsimply don't stand up to any test of reason.\n  Two years for a judicial nomination is not a sign of a healthy \njudicial confirmation process. It is a sign that the system is broken \nand needs to be repaired.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Texas, if he will yield the \nfloor and let me get the floor, we will do this very quickly.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am happy to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I notice the Senator from Alabama is here, \nand I believe he wants to speak on the Owen nomination. I will turn the \nfloor over to him in a few minutes.\n  There are a couple of things I want to finish responding to regarding \nwhat the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada have \nsaid, and the way they characterize Justice Owen--as an activist, as \nsomebody who is out of the mainstream, and in terms of judicial \nqualifications.\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\n  I just point out that the picture they paint is totally at odds and \ninconsistent with the fact that Justice Owen has broad, bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, and it is only a narrow minority of the Senate \nthat is blocking the bipartisan majority from actually voting. To me, \nthat is not evidence of an extreme position or somebody who is out of \nthe mainstream.\n  I point out and remind my colleagues that former Texas Supreme Court \njustices, Republicans and Democrats, a long list of former Presidents \nin the State bar of Texas, Republicans and Democrats, have endorsed her \nconfirmation. That is hardly evidence consistent with the portrait that \nher detractors are attempting to paint and that was painted by the \nSenator from North Dakota just a few moments ago. In her last election, \n84 percent of the voters in Texas voted for her reelection--hardly \nconsistent with the picture of an extreme, out-of-the-mainstream person \nand nominee.\n  I will tell you that in 2000 virtually every major newspaper in Texas \nendorsed her reelection. Here again, that is not consistent with the \nportrait being painted today by her opponents.\n  Let me finally address the issue on which Justice Owen has been \ncriticized, and that is the Texas parental notification statute. I \npoint out to my colleagues that Justice Owen had no choice but to \ninterpret the Texas parental notification statute as adopted by the \nTexas Legislature. She had no choice. She did her best. I think it is a \nrecord of which she and the Senate can be proud.\n  But I think some of the arguments against this nominee are really \nwolves in sheep clothing. In other words, I think some of the special \ninterest groups that are opposing Justice Owen's nomination really \nobject to the Texas parental notification statute--a statute which I \nstrongly support because I believe it protects parental rights, in \norder to at least be involved in one of the most serious and profound \ndecisions that a young girl may have to make in her young life, when \nunder Texas law, if she wanted to get her ears pierced at a doctor's \noffice, she could not do so without parental consent.\n  This law does not require consent; it requires notice to at least one \nparent before a minor child decides to get an abortion. As I say, I \nthink a lot of the arguments being made against Justice Owen and this \nnomination are really masked by an underlying objection by some of \nthese special interest groups to the fact that Texas has--like the vast \nmajority of States--a parental notification law. Eighty-four percent of \nthe American public supports parental rights and laws requiring that a \nminor child give notice at least to a parent before getting an \nabortion.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the validity of those laws as not \nimpeding access to an abortion, but merely involving a parent and \nletting a parent know. Of course, if for some reason, within the letter \nof that law, a parent cannot be notified, or should not be in the eyes \nof a judge, there is a judicial bypass provision, and that was exactly \nthe law that Justice Owen was duty-bound to interpret as a member of \nthe Texas Supreme Court in dealing with that Texas parental \nnotification statute.\n  Justice Owen, in a vast majority of those cases, voted with a \nmajority of the court and dissented from the majority less often than \ntwo other justices on that same court.\n  I would point out that the author of the Texas parental notification \nlaw, Senator Florence Shapiro, supports Justice Owen's confirmation.\n  One other point. I hope we can finally put this issue to bed because \nit seems as if it gets trotted out every couple of days when it comes \nto the Owen nomination, and that is the allegation that Alberto \nGonzales, White House counsel, formerly a member of the Texas Supreme \nCourt who served with Priscilla Owen, accused her of judicial activism. \nThat is just not true. That is not the fact, and anyone who cared \nenough about the issue would certainly read the opinions that are \nreferred to by those who are making that fallacious claim.\n  What happened in that case is some members of the court accused Judge \nGonzales of misreading the statute. He stated it would be judicial \nactivism for someone to change the law to suit their own personal \nbeliefs. He did not say Judge Owen had done that.\n  To me, that settles the issue completely. Here again, you find the \nfacts more divorced from what is happening, what is being said as you \nsee a person, a fine, decent person, a highly qualified candidate for \nthis judicial office, being attacked unfairly. As you see the facts \ntwisted and this caricature again being painted, it bears no \nrelationship to the facts.\n  I remember Senator Arlen Specter the other day, I think it was in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, saying it is clear the Rules of Evidence \nthat apply in court that somebody speak from personal knowledge, that \nit be trustworthy, it be credible, do not apply to statements made on \nthe floor of the Senate or in the Senate Judiciary Committee. People \nrepeat facts other people say that may be completely wrong or by people \nwho have a motive to bend the truth.\n  Justice Owen, has been a victim of people who have bent the truth or \nwho care nothing for the truth and who care only for defeating this \nvery fine nominee by our President for this judicial office.\n  Mr. President, we are not going to give up the fight to have a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate vote on either Judge Owen's \nconfirmation or on the confirmation of Miguel Estrada. As we heard \nyesterday before the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nconstitutional scholars said there are serious constitutional problems \nwith the argument that somehow the cloture rule, which requires 60 \nvotes to cut off debate, can trump the Constitution, which requires \nonly a majority vote.\n  Senator Specter yesterday alluded to something called the nuclear \noption. He said he was not going to talk about it. All I wish to say is \nwe are not going to give up, and I will not give up when I see a good \nperson, an honest, a decent person who has worked hard, who has risen \nto the top of the legal profession, who has become a judge and excelled \nin her job as a judge, who has been faithful to the oath she has taken \nto interpret the law and not to be a superlegislator or be a legislator \nwearing a black robe, I am not going to stop as long as it is possible \nto do anything within my power to see her confirmed and to see that \njustice and fairness be provided to this good and decent person.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. He knows \nPriscilla Owen. He served on the Texas Supreme Court. He served as the \nattorney general of Texas. He knows the legislators who passed the laws \nin Texas. He knows Justice Owen's history and the respect she has in \nthe community. One can sense his feelings of how bizarre it is to have \nthis wonderful woman, who is popular throughout the State, with 84 \npercent of the vote, unanimously well-qualified rating by the American \nBar Association, attacked and have people come to this body and say she \nis some sort of extremist. It is really a sad day.\n  My colleagues on the other side say: We are only objecting to two \nnominees. Why would they pick Priscilla Owen to be one of the two? \nJustice Owen is so marvelous. They say she was turned down last year. \nThat was when we had an interlude in which the Democrats had the \nmajority in the Senate and they had a majority in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. That committee, on a straight party-line vote, voted down \nthis wonderful candidate, Priscilla Owen, for the Federal court, on a \nstraight party-line vote.\n  That was not done in the 8 years President Clinton was in office when \nRepublicans had a majority. Republicans never voted down one of his \ncandidates on a straight party-line vote. We ought to think about that.\n  Senator Cornyn is a tremendous addition to the Senate. The Priscilla \nOwen matter was raised in his race. It was a matter he discussed, and \nthe voters voted for Senator Cornyn to be their Senator, and he was on \nrecord as supporting her nomination.\n  Now that he is here and helped give us a majority, we moved her out \nof the committee. She really was not voted down in committee. She was \nblocked in committee. They tried to keep her nomination from reaching \nthe floor of the Senate, where it could be voted up or down and \nsucceed, until the majority changed.\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\n  It is frustrating to me to hear the Democratic Members of this body \nsay: Miguel Estrada can be confirmed or we can move him up for a vote \nas soon as he turns over all of his records, all the memoranda he wrote \nwhile he was at the Department of Justice.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, is a skilled \nattorney. He knows these issues. When a lawyer works for a client, the \nrecords are the client's records; they are not the lawyer's records. A \nlawyer cannot pass out his memoranda to his client without the client's \npermission.\n  In this case, Miguel Estrada had a client. His client was the United \nStates of America, and his duty and responsibility was to give his \nsupervisors in the Department of Justice--4 of his 5 years he was in \nthe Department of Justice were during the time President Clinton was \nPresident of the United States. So his memoranda went to Clinton \nappointees and their people. They said just turn them over.\n  This is a big deal. I served almost 15 years in the Department of \nJustice. It was a great honor for me to hold that position. I think it \nis the greatest, most honorable law firm in the world. It was great to \nbe there. They are good lawyers. They follow the law.\n  The Department of Justice should never give over their internal \nmemoranda on a fishing expedition like this just to try to buy votes in \nthe Senate to get somebody confirmed. They should stand firm, and the \nheat needs to be on those who ask for these records to be turned over.\n  It was said that some of those records have been turned over in the \npast. I remember one Senator waving around the documents saying it had \nbeen done before. I got them out of the Record. I determined that it \nwas the Robert Bork nomination.\n  Most Americans who have been around a few years remember the Bork \ndeal. He was the Solicitor General of the United States and was moved \nup to Attorney General.\n  He fired Elliott Richardson, the midnight massacre, and the Senate \nhad a specific inquiry.\n  When Bork was in the Department of Justice, they wanted to know about \nthe memoranda he had written involving Watergate, which raised \nquestions of ethics and impropriety and misconduct.\n  It is quite a different thing if a Member of this Senate says, or \nthis group of Senators say, we want certain records, and those records \nare records that may give light on a specific wrongdoing that has been \nalleged to have occurred; there is some sort of concern over an act of \nwrongdoing which has occurred, but they did not suggest Miguel Estrada \nwas involved in a single act of wrongdoing. They just said: We want to \nsee every memorandum he wrote to the Department of Justice, memoranda \nowned by the Department of Justice, part of the Department of Justice's \nwork product, part of their decision-making process.\n  They should not turn it over. These Senators, some of whom are \nlawyers on the other side, know that, and they ought not to be asking \nfor that. I do not believe they would accept it if Republicans were \nasking for it in the same circumstance. We have to have a certain \namount of collegiality, we have to have a certain degree of fairness \nand respect for proper procedures, and it is disrespectful of the whole \ngovernmental process to insist that the work product of the Department \nof Justice, in a blanket fishing expedition, needs to be turned over to \nSenators in exchange for getting an up-or-down vote for a highly \nqualified nominee.\n  I am not pleased with what is going on. We all remember well when \nPresident Bush was elected and the Democrats had a Senate retreat, and \none of the things they discussed was what to do about nominations. They \nhad three well-known liberal professors known throughout the country, \nLaurence Tribe, Marsha Greenberger, and another lawyer lecture them. \nThese liberal professors told Senate Democrats that they ought to \nchange the ground rules, that they do not need to do like we have done \nfor 200 years since America's founding. It is clear to me that as a \nresult of that conference, somewhere along the line a majority of the \nDemocratic Members of this body agreed, and they have changed the \nground rules of confirmations in a way that has never been done before.\n  In committee, they voted down two nominees on a straight party line \nvote. They said we ought to change the burden of proof and put it on \nthe nominee. They made a number of other allegations and changes in the \nprocess that they said ought to occur. They asked to strengthen the \nblue slip policy that gives an objecting home State Senator power to \nblock a nomination. When President Bush was elected, they had a meeting \nand demanded that they have more power.\n  At the same time, they complain in this body about nominees who did \nnot move because of the traditional exercise of the blue slip. They \nwanted to have even more power to block nominees of President Bush than \nexisted to block President Clinton's nominees. So it is a frustrating \nthing.\n  The most dramatic and historical change of the ground rules occurs \nwhen this body engages in filibusters. I noticed they said Mr. Paez was \nheld up 1,000 days. Well, Priscilla Owen and several others are at \nabout that number right now.\n  How did the Paez matter come to a vote? In my strong view, Paez \nshould never have been confirmed as a Federal judge based on the record \nwe had. I opposed his nomination. But how was it brought up? How do you \ndeal with a hold? You move for cloture. It is a process. No filibuster \nwas ongoing. It just was not being brought up for a vote.\n\n  The majority leader of the Republican Party, Trent Lott, moved for \ncloture. I voted for cloture even though I opposed the Paez nomination. \nCloture was voted overwhelmingly. Why? Because we did not believe that \nfilibuster was an appropriate remedy for dissatisfaction over a judge. \nThe Republicans believed that a judge should not be filibustered. It \nhas not been done for a circuit or a district judge since the founding \nof this country, until our colleagues on the Democratic side have now \nopenly filibustered Priscilla Owen and Miguel Estrada.\n  If they were to say, this is an extremist judge who lacks \nqualifications, and those sorts of things, maybe we ought to be able to \nuse that power. But that is not the case with these two judges.\n  These two judges were rated by the American Bar Association. The \nAmerican Bar Association is an institution that on legal and social \nissues is, I think, consistently to the left of the American people and \nthe Senate. For example, they oppose any laws restricting abortion and \nthey take a number of very liberal positions on social issues. But the \nAmerican Bar Association is an entity that understands what the legal \npractice is about.\n  They can go out in the community pretty quickly and determine if \nsomeone is irresponsible or an extremist. They will rate them \naccordingly. Well, the American Bar Association has done in-depth \nbackground checks on Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen. As I recall, \nthey have one person who does a lot of the work. They talk to all of \nthe judges before whom the lawyer practices. They talk to the opposing \ncounsel, co-counsel. They talk to the leaders of the bar in the \ncommunity. They talk to just about anyone who would have an opinion on \nthem.\n  They talk to civil rights leaders. They always talk to minority \nrepresentatives to make sure they have broad-based feedback. Then there \nare 15 or so of them who meet and evaluate this nominee, and they issue \na rating.\n  With regard to Priscilla Owen, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, \nelected with 84 percent of the vote last time, they unanimously rated \nher the highest rating they give: Well qualified.\n  Miguel Estrada, editor of the Harvard Law Review, clerked for the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals, clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States, something very few lawyers ever \nget to do in their life--it is one of the highest honors one could \nhave--they interviewed all the lawyers and all the people, including, I \nam sure, people in the Clinton Department of Justice where he worked, \nand they rated him unanimously well qualified, as both of them should \nhave been.\n  So this talk that they are somehow extremist is just not right. When \nwe see a woman of such good demeanor as Priscilla Owen displayed during \nher confirmation process--she took all of those questions, many of them \nbased on false premises, with great skill and\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\naplomb, I thought, and handled herself well, as did Miguel Estrada--\nthis is a very unsatisfactory time in this Senate, when now for the \nfirst time in the history of America we have filibusters of circuit \njudges. This is not about a judge who some lawyers think has an \nintegrity problem. Nobody has suggested that. They are not nominees who \npeople think are somehow unqualified intellectually, or they have lack \nof experience or lack of ability to do the work. These are the best of \nAmerica.\n  Many of us have asked, why would they pick these two nominees? It \nseems one reason we keep coming back to--and it is so bizarre, I hate \nto repeat it almost--is that both of these nominees are clearly worthy \nof serious consideration for the Supreme Court of the United States. \nThey are so fine and have such a marvelous breadth of experience and \nrecord of accomplishment in their lives that both of them ought to be \non any shortlist for the Supreme Court of the United States. So is that \nwhy we are having an objection? They are too good, too qualified, too \ncapable, too intelligent? I do not know, but something is awry when the \nfilibuster is used against people of this quality. I feel very strongly \nabout that.\n  I agree with Senator Cornyn, and I am glad he is having hearings \nabout it. I am glad he is inquiring into this because he has the \njudicial experience, integrity, and capability to maybe help us work \nour way through this maze. Maybe we can figure out a way to get around \nthis. We certainly know the Constitution of the United States, clearly, \nin the case of advise and consent, will be by majority vote. It is very \ndifficult to interpret it any other way.\n\n  Let me say a little bit more about the sterling qualities of \nPriscilla Owen. She finished at the top of her class at Baylor Law \nSchool and aced the Texas bar exam. She made the highest possible score \non the Texas bar exam. What better proof of legal ability objectively \nanalyzed than by the tests you take for a bar exam. She passed that \nwith flying colors, with the highest possible score. She was a partner \nat one of Texas's finest firms, Andrews and Kurth, when she ran for the \nSupreme Court in 1994. She practiced and litigated for 17 years and was \nrecognized as one of Texas's finest lawyers; not some office clerk who \nnever went to court, but a litigator who was out in the courtrooms in \nthe Federal court and the State court trying cases and developing a \nreputation of excellence.\n  She is a member of the American Law Institute, the American \nAdjudicatory Society, the American Bar Association, a Fellow of the \nAmerican and Houston Bar Foundations. She was reelected to the Supreme \nCourt in 2000, garnering 84 percent of the vote. She spent so little \nmoney in her campaign, despite her big win, that when it was over, she \nhad a good bit of money left. She did something I have never heard of a \npolitician doing: She went back and checked her contribution list and \nsent back everybody the money they gave to her. There is certainly no \nSenator who has done that. We like to keep our campaign account, \nthinking we may need it again some time. That was a voluntary action on \nher part that demonstrates her high character and high standards.\n  She serves as the liaison to the Supreme Court of Texas court and \nmediation task force and the statewide committees on providing legal \nservices to the poor and pro bono services. This mediation task force, \nI know, causes grief to some of our aggressive litigators, but \nmediation is a growing method of settling disputes, short of full-\nfledged and highly expensive litigation. She has been at the forefront \nof that. I have not heard anyone complain about that.\n  I ask myself, What is it people would complain about? Is it because \nshe is looking for ways to reduce the costs of protracted litigation?\n  She was part of a committee that successfully encouraged the Texas \nlegislature to enact legislation that has resulted in millions of \ndollars a year in additional funds for providing legal services to the \npoor. She does not just sit there in the office and write opinions. She \ncares about justice. She wants to make sure everyone has a good day in \ncourt. She participated in a committee that raised millions of dollars \nto help the poor have better legal counsel. That is important. This is \nsome extremist we are talking about?\n  She serves as a member of the A.A. White Dispute Resolution \nInstitute. She was instrumental in organizing a group known as Family \nLaw 2000 which seeks to find ways to educate parents about the effect \nof a dissolution of a marriage, the effect on their children, and to \nlessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings when a marriage is \ndissolved. That is important. A lot of parents get so caught up in the \nanger at their spouse. They have to realize that children are \ncompletely baffled by this. They are watching this fight going on with \nthe parents, both of whom they love, and they want to be together, and \nit is a painful experience. The legal system and the court system of \nAmerica needs to do a better job of thinking about the impact of these \nhostile, aggressive divorce proceedings on children. She took a lead in \nthat. This is an extremist?\n\n  Among other community activities, she serves on the Board of Texas \nHearing and Service Dogs for the blind. She is a member of the St. \nBarnabas Episcopal Mission in Austin, TX, where she teaches Sunday \nschool and is the head of the altar guild. Is this an extremist \nEpiscopalian? That is a contradiction in terms.\n  She earned her BA from Baylor and graduated cum laude from Baylor, \nand was a member of the Baylor Law Review. She was honored as the \nBaylor Young Lawyer of the Year and as a Baylor University outstanding \nyoung alumni.\n  That led up to her sterling career and practice, her election to the \nSupreme Court of Texas, her nomination by the President of the United \nStates, who is from Texas and knows her and knows her record. He \nnominated her for consideration by this body which led to her eventual \nrating by the Bar Association of America, unanimously well qualified. I \nam proud of her in that respect.\n  They complain about these parental notification cases. In Texas, the \nlaw of Texas is a modest law. It says before a child can have an \nabortion, before they can be taken off someplace by some older \nboyfriend to have an abortion--and too often that is what the cases \nare--they at least ought to tell one parent. If they choose not to do \nthat, they can go to court. If they have a good reason why they should \nnot tell either parent, the court will allow them not to do so. It is \ncalled parental notification law. I think it makes sense. Virtually \noverwhelmingly, the American people support that; 80 something percent \nof the people support that. In Texas, you cannot get your ears pierced \nor a tattoo without parental consent--not just notification. So for \nHeaven's sake, it should not be considered extreme to require \nnotification prior to an abortion. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates has upheld these laws.\n  Let me give the hard facts on these cases. The way it works in Texas, \na child goes to a court and says: I don't want to tell my parents; they \nmight get mad. The judge has a hearing. If the judge disagrees and \nsays: No, you need to tell one of your parents; we believe you can tell \nyour mother, you should tell your mother before you undergo this \nprocedure, if you want to go forward, you can, but you should tell her. \nThen, if the young person is not happy with that, they can appeal. They \ntake the appeal to the court of appeals in Texas, a three-judge court, \nand that three-judge court reviews the opinion of the trial judge. If \nthe trial judge said the young person did not have to tell the parents, \nthere is no appeal. It is over. The case will never even get to the \ncourt of appeals unless the trial court says no, you must tell your \nparents. If the court of appeals overrules the trial court, the case \nends there.\n\n  If the appellate judges after reviewing the record of the trial court \nconclude the trial court was correct and affirms that decision, then \nthe young person can appeal again. In this case it would go to the \nTexas Supreme Court where Justice Owen sits.\n  By the time it has gotten to the court, a trial judge has ruled \nnotification is appropriate, and a three-judge intermediate appellate \ncourt of Texas has ruled it ought to be done.\n  These are the numbers. Justice Owen agreed with the lower court \nopinion and voted to require parental notification in 10 of the 14 \ncases. She voted to\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nreverse the lower court and grant the exception outright two times. She \nvoted twice to just flat reverse the lower court and say the young \nperson is entitled to an exception--on 2 of those 14 cases. And on 2 \ncases she did not believe the lower court had done it correctly, had \nnot heard the case fairly, and sent it back down for further hearings \non the facts.\n  In my experience as a litigator who has been involved in trying a lot \nof cases, that is about the percentage you would expect. You would \nexpect that by the time a case has gone through two levels that the \nlower courts are probably right most of the time.\n  So I just don't think that is an extreme record at all. I cannot \nbelieve they continue to persist in arguing she is somehow a judicial \nactivist. As Senator Cornyn has pointed out, that was a reference to \nanother judge's dissent; not her opinion even. It was unfair to say \nJudge Gonzales has said she was an activist. It is not so.\n  As a matter of fact, I would add this: They say this lady is an \nextremist. She is not fit for the Federal court because she has not \nvoted right on these parental notification cases. It is almost humorous \nto think about it. But she voted with the majority of the Texas Supreme \nCourt in 11 of the 14 cases before that court. The full court voted to \nrequire parental notice in 7 cases and to grant the exception outright \nin 3 cases and to remand 4 cases.\n  These are just excuses, for some reason, that are out there that have \nbeen used to block her. They do not withstand rigorous analysis.\n  One more thing. Let's say she made a mistake. I don't know how many \nhundreds of cases she has heard on the supreme court. But the American \nBar Association and the legal community in Texas, they know her. After \na while you form an opinion of a judge and a lawyer. You have an \nopinion as to whether or not they have good judgment, whether they are \ncapable, whether they work hard, whether they have integrity. Even if \nthey make a mistake somewhere along the line in a case, that is not \ndisqualifying. Any judge who ruled on thousands of cases is not going \nto be mistake free.\n  I would say she has done extraordinarily well. We ought to listen to \nthe opinions of those who know her, like Senator--Judge--Cornyn, her \nformer colleague on the court; like all the major newspapers of Texas; \nlike the American Bar Association; like her colleagues on the bench; \nand like President Bush, who knew her in Texas. She is qualified to an \nextraordinary degree and would make a magnificent circuit court judge \nand should be confirmed. We ought not to be in the midst of a historic \nfilibuster on any nominee, really, but particularly this one.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5842-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NATO EXPANSION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are waiting for wrap-up. I would like \nto make a few brief remarks in support of the provision offered by \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin and others that deal with the \nexpansion of NATO, and in particular, the rule of consensus in NATO.\n  NATO is now 26 countries. It is a group that has provided a bulwark \nfor freedom and liberty against the totalitarian Communists of the \nSoviet Union and their footstools they dominated in Eastern Europe. \nThey stood firm for a half century, and we have lived to see the \ncollapse of the wall, collapse of the Soviet Union, and freedom spread \nacross Eastern Europe. It is one of the great events in all of history, \nmaybe the highlight of the 20th century.\n  The NATO alliance has a rule called the consensus rule. It says:\n\n       In making their joint decisionmaking process dependent on \n     consensus and common consent, the members of the alliance \n     safeguard the role of each country's individual experience \n     and outlook while at the same time availing themselves of the \n     machinery and procedures which allow them jointly to act \n     rapidly and decisively if circumstances require them to do \n     so.\n\n  That is the rule. We have gone up in numbers. We are going to add \nmore members now. We are probably going to go over 30 members. As a \nresult, we have to ask ourselves what is this unanimous group? What \nhappens if a country goes bad? What if the Communists take back over \none of their former footstools they ran over in Eastern Europe? What if \na Milosevic takes over a country and rejects the ideals of NATO? What \nif some radical religious party takes over a country and leads it on \nthe wrong road? What if a Saddam Hussein, a fascist-type government, \ntakes over one of these countries? We are not able to act anymore? We \nhave to sit here and stop all of NATO's legitimate actions?\n  What this amendment would do is ask the NATO alliance to talk openly \nand honestly about this problem. It does not require anything. What it \nrequires and asks is the NATO ministers meet and discuss this rule and \nsee if they want to keep this rule.\n  It focuses on a couple of questions. One is should you always have to \nhave a unanimous vote? I remember very distinctly in the Armed Services \nCommittee after the Kosovo effort, which was mainly driven by our air \npower, the commander of the American Air Force who directed our air \ncampaign against Kosovo, answered some questions I asked him.\n  I asked him if the unanimous rule and consent requirement hinder his \nselection of targets.\n  He said: Yes.\n  I said: Did that hindrance delay the successful outcome of the war? \nDid it cost more lives of Kosovo citizens and Serbian citizens? And did \nit endanger American lives?\n  Yes.\n  Why did this happen? The NATO group approved even the targets our Air \nForce were selecting before they committed their flights over Kosovo. \nThis is not healthy. This is not a good way to run a war. Now we are \ngoing to have 30-plus nations, some of which may have ethnic or \npolitical or weird ideas, and they may object to targets. They may \nobject to tactics.\n  We had an incredible 11 days to figure out a way to get NATO to vote \nto support Turkey, in case Saddam Hussein attacked Turkey. Some have \nsaid that was a good record. Eventually they did get the agreement, but \nthey had to move outside the political NATO to the military NATO. That \nmeans France is not in it. You know France is not even a part of the \nmilitary NATO compact. So they got out of the political NATO and \nfinally got our people all to agree to defend a NATO member against \nSaddam Hussein. It took 11 days to do so.\n  I would say to my friends in the NATO alliance, we are so proud of \nthis alliance and what it has achieved. We are proud of the commitment \nand high ideals that NATO has set for that region and throughout the \nwhole world. But we are a little nervous. We think it is about time to \nthink through this consensus rule.\n  I don't want to stir up anything. I don't want to say that we don't \nrespect any one nation's vote in NATO nor give it great respect. But I \ndo think that a mutual respect to the United States' overwhelming \nmajority of NATO would be to ask questions: Wait a minute. What kind of \nmechanism could we do that would protect small nations, and that would \nprotect the minority of nations but allow NATO to act legitimately even \nwithout an absolute unanimous vote?\n  I think Senator Warner, Senator Levin, Senator Roberts, and others \nwho have offered this are on the right track. I have asked about it for \nsome time. In fact, when the matter came up several years ago to expand \nNATO, I asked a number of the witnesses from President Bush's \nadministration some tough questions about it. They were forward. I \nasked about the rule of consensus. They defended it. They said, Well, \nwe think it is going to be OK. Senator Levin, likewise, took the same \nposition. When we had the recent hearing on the further expansion, we \ndealt with this same issue.\n  I quoted some of Senator Levin's remarks previously. I think this is \na good time for us to move forward to bring this to a head. Let us talk \nabout it openly. I don't think a discussion without any requirement to \nact could upset anybody. Let us talk about it and maybe we can make \nsome progress.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5843-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n                        RECOMMENDED APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, section 421 of H. Con. Res. 95, the 2004 \nBudget Resolution, requires the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto make appropriate adjustments in the appropriate allocations and \naggregates to reflect the difference between Public Law 108-11--the \nEmergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003--and the \ncorresponding levels assumed in the resolution.\n  As enacted, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of \n2003 contains changes in new budget authority, outlays and revenues \nthat differ from those assumed in the budget resolution. For fiscal \nyear 2003, the supplemental provides $4.432 billion in budget \nauthority, $3.745 billion in outlays, and $2 million in revenues above \nthe amounts assumed in H. Con. Res. 95. The supplemental also provides \n$215 million in additional new budget authority and $332 million in \nadditional outlays for fiscal year 2004; over the period of fiscal \nyears 2004 through 2013, it provides an additional $888 million in \nbudget authority and $1.406 billion in outlays over the amounts assumed \nin the resolution.\n  I am therefore inserting a set of tables into the Record which show \nthe revised allocations and aggregates, reflecting the adjustments I am \nmaking pursuant to section 421. These revised allocations and \naggregates are the appropriate levels to be used for enforcement of the \n2004 Budget Resolution.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to denounce, in \nthe strongest terms, the recent deplorable actions by the regime of \nPresident Fidel Castro.\n  While the world focuses on the aftermath of the war in Iraq and the \nenormity of Saddam Hussein's atrocities are revealed, we must not \nignore egregious violations of human rights taking place much closer to \nhome.\n  I have long believed that the way to encourage democratic reform and \nrespect for human rights in Cuba is not through isolation of this tiny \nisland nation, but through the normalization of our relationship. I \ntotally oppose the restrictions on the right of Americans to travel to \nCuba.\n  But the recent crackdown against pro-democracy dissidents in Cuba is \nnot only a reprehensible affront to human decency, it has threatened \nalready strained relations between Cuba and the United States and \nbetween Cuba and the rest of the world.\n  My visit to Cuba in March 1999 reinforced my belief in the folly of \nour antiquated policy. I met with President Castro and a number of \npolitical activists. I saw firsthand the need for ending not only the \nembargo--which simply compounds the misery of Cuba's people and \nprovides President Castro with a convenient excuse, but the repression \nand pervasive climate of fear perpetrated by that government.\n  On March 18, the Cuban government suddenly launched an attack against \nits political opponents. After storming their houses, seizing their \ncomputers, typewriters, fax machines and books, the government arrested \n79 people, accusing them of subverting Cuba's government by conspiring \nwith James Cason, the head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. \nThey were charged with the vague crime of ``collaborating with a \nforeign power against their homeland.''\n\n  Less than 3 weeks later, the Cuban courts had tried, convicted and \nsentenced at least 75 of these people in a whirlwind process of closed-\ndoor trials lasting less than one day in improvised courts where \nundercover security agents who had infiltrated dissident groups \nsurfaced as witnesses.\n  The punishments for conduct, that in most countries would not even be \ncriminal, ranged from 6 to 28 years in prison.\n  Those arrested in this crackdown include leaders of independent labor \nunions and opposition political parties, independent journalists, \nlibrarians, and pro-democracy activists. More than half of the arrests \nwere local organizers of the Varela Project reform effort.\n  The Varela Project collected more signatures than the \nconstitutionally required 10,000 for a national referendum calling for \nelectoral reforms, freedom of association, and amnesty for nonviolent \npolitical prisoners.\n  The Cuban government responded with a counter petition, decreeing the \nCuban socialist system to be untouchable. While local organizers \nreceived some of the heavier sentences, Osvaldo Paya, head of the \nVarela Project, was not arrested. Mr. Paya said that the crackdown is \n``an attempt to kill the chances of peaceful change in Cuba, but \n[dissidents] will continue seeking peaceful reforms.''\n  At a meeting this month of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in \nGeneva, the Swedish foreign minister warned that the crackdown in Cuba \ncould harm its prospects for cooperation with the European Union.\n  On March 10, the European Commission opened its first diplomatic \noffice in Havana. Cuba is applying for membership in the Cotonou \nAgreement--the economic assistance pact between the EU and African, \nCaribbean, and Pacific nations. Cubans would benefit significantly from \nthe Cotonou Agreement, but Cuba's entry is now in jeopardy.\n  The U.N. Commission on Human Rights also adopted a resolution to send \na U.N. envoy to Cuba to investigate human rights abuses, but Cuban \nofficials have apparently rejected this.\n  The Bush administration is reportedly considering punitive measures \nto restrict the flow of American dollars to Cuba by further limiting \nthe number of Americans who may travel to Cuba on charter flights, and \nby reducing the monetary remittances that Cubans in the United States \nsend back to their families in Cuba. Unfortunately, such measures would \nonly hurt the wrong people.\n  If this were not bad enough, earlier this month, Cuban authorities \ndetained three men who had hijacked a ferry crossing the Florida \nStraits on its way to the United States. Less than 24 hours later, \nthese men were summarily executed by a firing squad. No one supports \nthe act of hijacking, and people of good conscience disagree about the \ndeath penalty. But such an outrageous denial of due process should be \nuniversally condemned.\n  As one who strongly opposes the policy of the Bush administration and \nprevious U.S. administrations of isolating Cuba, a policy which for \nmore than 40 years has failed to achieve any of its goals. I want to \nadd my voice to those who have denounced these recent events.\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\n  Human rights are universal. They are every much the rights of the \nCuban people as they are the rights of people everywhere. When they are \ndenied, we are all diminished. The United States cannot prevent the \nwholesale violation of human rights by the Cuban government or any \ngovernment. But we can speak up.\n\n  We can say to them that this is unacceptable.\n  We can say do not trouble us with your farcial explanations and \nexcuses.\n  And we can say, with confidence, that those whose rights are so \nblatantly denied today will one day show their oppressors the real \nmeaning of ``revolution''--one that is based on the rights of man, not \nthe brutality of one man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5848-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 3, \n2001 in Los Angeles, CA. An Afghani-American woman was physically \nassaulted and harassed by her two male neighbors as she walked from her \ncar to her house. When the police arrived to take a report, the two men \ntold the officers that the woman had been making terrorist threats.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5848-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO DR. BETSY ROGERS OF LEEDS, AL, AS NATIONAL TEACHER OF THE \n                                  YEAR\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Dr. Betsy \n(Dawson) Rogers, a teacher from Leeds, AL. On April 30, 2003, in the \nRose Garden at the White House, President George W. Bush presented Dr. \nRogers with the esteemed National Teacher of the Year award. Dr. Rogers \nwas selected for this honor from among the best teachers in the Nation \nbased on her compassion for the children she teaches.\n  Dr. Rogers, a teacher of first and second grade students at Leeds \nElementary School, began teaching in 1985. She was compelled by the \nneeds of many of her students, some from less fortunate families just \nneeding someone to encourage them to strive to their greatest \npotential. Dr. Rogers invests her time and energy in everyone of her \nstudents. Day in and day out, she goes above and beyond the call of \nduty, because for her students to achieve their greatest potential, \nsome may need individual attention starting from long before the school \nday begins and lasting until hours after the last bell rings.\n  Dr. Rogers has had many opportunities to teach at most any school of \nher choice. Yet, she has humbly chosen to stay at Leeds Elementary \nSchool, knowing that her compassion is best put to use by these \nchildren who need it the most.\n  She loves everything about teaching, because Dr. Rogers is shaping \nthe future for each child who comes into her classroom. She doesn't \ntake this responsibility lightly, and for that she is to be commended. \nI am grateful to Dr. Rogers and teachers all over Alabama and the \nNation just like her, who understand the immense responsibility they \nhave as educators.\n  Dr. Rogers is blessed with an incredibly supportive family. Her \nparents, Elenor and Dick Dawson, are friends of mine from Birmingham, \nand I know they are very proud of their daughter's fine accomplishment. \nHer two sons, Rick and Alan, have benefitted tremendously from her \ngifted ability to teach. And her brothers, Richard and Eric, are close \nto her and celebrate with her on this important award.\n  Alabama is honored to be home to Dr. Rogers, and I hope that when my \ngrandchildren enter elementary school they will have the fortunate \nexperience to have a teacher just like her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5848-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5848-S5849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WEST VIRGINIA MILITARY SERVICE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor all West \nVirginians who have served our country in the military, especially \nthose currently overseas. Former Senator Daniel Webster once said, \n``God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always ready to \ndefend it.'' West Virginians are known for their dedication to military \nservice and patriotism, and to this day West Virginians continue their \nproud tradition of military service. Our soldiers are committed to our \nNation's principles, and they are tireless in their efforts to preserve \nliberty. I rise today to honor these intrepid men and women whose \nmilitary service and commitment is unmatched--they make me extremely \nproud to be a West Virginian.\n  Only 3 States had a higher service rate than West Virginia during \nWorld War II. Thirty-six percent of West Virginia's male population--\nmore than one out of every three men--served during that war. Nearly \n4,700 West Virginians died fighting for our freedom in that war.\n  West Virginia had the highest service rate during the Korean War, \nwith 16.2 percent of our men participating. During that war, tragically \nWest Virginia also suffered the highest death rate, with about 40 war-\nrelated deaths for every 100,000 citizens, a total of over 800 deaths.\n  West Virginia had the second-highest service in the Vietnam War, with \n20.3 percent of our men serving. During that war, again West Virginia \nhad the highest casualty rate in the Nation. More than 700 citizens \nfrom our State died in battle.\n  Now we are engaged in a war on terror--a war that our troops are \nfighting heroically. Thousands of West Virginia military personnel are \ntaking part in the war effort, from active duty troops, to brave \ncitizens in the National Guard, to Reservists. Not long ago, the world \nsaw a symbolic climax of this war as the imposing symbol of Saddam \nHussein's dictatorship was toppled. This moment could not have happened \nwithout the bravery and sacrifice of American forces and these forces \nwould not be complete without the long-standing dedication of West \nVirginians.\n  We must not forget those men and women who protected our freedom. In \n1940, pilot V.A. Rosewarne remarked, ``The universe is so vast and so \nageless that the life of one [person] can only be justified by the \nmeasure of his [or her] sacrifice.'' West Virginia has lost proud \nsoldiers in Afghanistan and also in the recent war in Iraq. In any war, \nthere are those who make the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives, \nand we must honor them. Let me take this opportunity to mention the \nsense of honor that runs so deep in a representative sample of these \nWest Virginians.\n  Second Lieutenant Therrel ``Shane'' Childers was born into a proud \nmilitary family near West Hamlin, WV, and he always dreamed of a \nmilitary career. On March 21, at 30 years of age, he became the first \nU.S. soldier killed in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom. His devout \ndetermination led a childhood friend of his to say, ``I can feel deep \nin my heart that he was doing what he was meant to do,'' and his mother \nto say, ``He died doing what he loved best, and that was being a \nMarine.''\n  There are countless examples of such heroes. Kenny Shadrick, from the \nmining town of Skin Fork, WV, was the first recorded American death in \nthe Korean War. On July 5, 1950, he gave his life in the fight against \ntyranny. While it was July 5 in Korea, it was still Independence Day in \nthe United States, and I am sure Kenny understood what he was fighting \nfor as he bravely shot bazooka rounds at the approaching enemy tanks \nuntil his life was tragically cut short. President Truman articulated \nKenny's sacrifice well when he wrote: ``He stands in the unbroken line \nof patriots who dared to die that freedom might live.'' West Virginia \nwill never forget the service of people like Kenny.\n  More recently, the world has heard the heroic story of Private \nJessica Lynch, the teenager from Palestine, WV, whose rescue as a \nprisoner of war from Iraq was universally celebrated. As a matter of \nfact, approximately 400 West Virginians are surviving former\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\nprisoners of war, a further testament to the courage and patriotism \npresent in West Virginia. Still today, Jessica is being treated for an \ninjury to her spine and fractures to her right arm, both legs, and her \nright foot and ankle. She has endured so much pain, and yet her family \ntells me she has remained cheerful since her rescue. So much courage in \nsuch a young soldier as Jessica inspires us all, and underscores how \nproud I am to represent my fellow West Virginians.\n  We all owe these soldiers and so many more from all over West \nVirginia and across the country, past and present, an enormous debt of \ngratitude. For the dead: we celebrate and remember their lives, mourn \ntheir deaths, and thank God that such people served.\n  For the living, we must fight for them, who have fought so bravely \nfor us. We cannot forget to honor our veterans. I will continue to \nfight for them as well--for the nearly 25,000 West Virginia veterans of \nthe Persian Gulf, for the 65,000 surviving West Virginia veterans from \nthe Vietnam era, for the more than 30,000 surviving West Virginia \nveterans of the Korean War, for the 36,000 aging veterans of World War \nII, and for the next generation of veterans coming home from the Middle \nEast. So today, with my sincerest gratitude and pride for the services \nof these men and women, I pledge to always honor their sacrifices, \nbecause all West Virginians understand the sacrifices they have made \nand the respect they have earned.\n  West Virginians have always felt a sense of duty toward America, and \nwe have always answered the call for military service. West Virginians \nunderstand the importance of living in a free society, and we also \nunderstand the patriotic duty and sacrifice required to do so. West \nVirginia soldiers have always reminded me of General MacArthur's \ndescription of the American soldier: ``Possessed of enduring fortitude, \npatriotic self-denial, invincible determination . . . giving his youth \nand strength, love and loyalty . . . one of the world's noblest \nfigures.'' I am honored to say that the good people of West Virginia, \nin particular, exemplify noble military service and proud patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5849-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5849-S5850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF COALITION BOMBING ATTACKS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the innocent \nvictims of coalition bombing raids in Afghanistan, and to submit for \nthe record, an article regarding this situation from the Washington \nPost. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. After many years of armed conflict and internal unrest, \nAfghans are currently in the process of rebuilding their nation. And, \nnow that the majority of military action in that country is complete, \nit is clear that many innocent Afghans lost their lives, homes, or \nfamily members as a result of coalition attacks. Certainly, I have no \ndoubt that throughout our military actions in Afghanistan, our troops \nacted with the highest possible level of precision and professionalism \nin order to avoid civilian injuries or deaths. I applaud their valiant \nefforts and their excellent performance. We all do. However, in all \narmed conflicts there are mistakes made, and in this conflict, several \nhundred Afghans died as a result.\n  The village of Madoo is a chilling example of this loss of life. An \nestimated 150 people were killed in this village, which was bombed by \ncoalition forces, along with other villages located near Osama bin \nLaden's former lair in the mountains at Tora Bora. And, the magnitude \nof this loss of life is highlighted exponentially when one considers \nthat Madoo was home to only 300 people. In these raids, not only was \nMadoo reduced to ruins, but half of its population died; half of all \nits inhabitants lost their lives. These were innocent people, and the \nones who remain--like so many others in Afghanistan--are destitute. \nThey did not only lose their friends and family; they lost their homes, \npossessions, and their livelihoods.\n  Sadly, it has now been over a year since much of this damage was \ninflicted, and while some have begun to receive this aid, those injured \nby coalition bomb attacks are still in desperate need of assistance. \nWith each passing day, there is growing doubt amongst many of the \nvictims as to whether or not American aid will ever arrive. This is a \ntroubling situation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in calling \non the administration to ensure that these funds quickly reach all of \nthose in need.\n  Indeed, Congress has already appropriated funds to assist \nhumanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, \nthe disbursement of these funds to victims of coalition attacks has \nbeen hindered for a number of reasons. Ongoing military skirmishes in \nSoutheastern Afghanistan have in many cases prevented aid workers from \nsafely reaching the most war-torn villages. In addition, widespread \ndestruction caused by decades of conflict has spurred some Afghans to \nfalsely attribute their suffering with coalition attacks. Moreover, \nlocal rivalries between clans and villages require the United States \nand the international community to distribute aid equitably, so that no \nparticular group will feel a sense of inequity in the distribution of \nAmerican aid, which would only serve to heighten tensions.\n  I also understand the concerns expressed by some members of the \nadministration regarding the complicated policy implications that \nproviding monetary compensation for victims of coalition bombing raids \ncould create. Certainly, the security interests of the United States \nare in the forefront of the minds of every member of this chamber. \nHowever, with our vast resources, as well as American ingenuity and \ncreativity, we should work to develop innovative approaches that will \nensure American aid reaches all of those in need, while also protecting \nregional and global American interests.\n  I am heartened by recent developments that will allow the United \nStates Agency for International Development, USAID, to begin \ndistributing aid to war-affected communities in Afghanistan. The $1.25 \nmillion obligation for this effort is a good start. However, while \nthere are many reasons for the slow distribution of American aid, the \nreality is that the victims of these attacks are still in great need of \nassistance.\n  It is absolutely imperative that the administration now acts with the \nsame swiftness and clarity witnessed in the fight against the Taliban \nto aid these innocent men, women, and children. We must remind them \nthat our quarrel was not with the Afghan people, but rather the \nTaliban. Now that we have freed them from the oppressive hand of that \nbrutal regime, we must not leave them alone.\n  The needs of the Afghan people are immediate. They cannot wait. \nIndeed, they have already waited too long. If we continue to sit idly \nby; if we do not help alleviate the suffering that was unintentionally \ninflicted upon them, then we will be creating an incubator for the same \ntype of anti-American sentiment on which the Taliban and Osama bin \nLaden thrived. We will be laying the foundations for the very mentality \nthat we are trying to uproot. We will be serving to destroy all that we \nhave worked to achieve.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 28, 2003]\n\n  After the Airstrikes, Just Silence; No Compensation, Little Aid for \n                      Afghan Victims of U.S. Raids\n\n                            (By April Witt)\n\n       Madoo, Afghanistan.--There are more graves than houses in \n     Madoo.\n       The mosque and many of the roughly 35 homes that once made \n     up this hamlet in the White Mountains of eastern Afghanistan \n     lie in rubble. At least 55 men, women and children--or pieces \n     of them--are buried here, their graves marked by flags that \n     are whipped by the wind.\n       Seventeen months after U.S. warplanes bombed this village \n     and others in the vicinity of Osama bin Laden's cave complex \n     at Toro Bora, Madoo's survivors say they can tell civilian \n     victims of U.S. bombing in Iraq what to expect in the way of \n     help from Washington: nothing.\n       ``Our houses were destroyed,'' said Niaz Mohammad Khan, 30. \n     ``We want to rebuild, but we don't have the money. . . . We \n     need water for our land. We need everything. People come and \n     ask us questions, then go away. No one has helped.''\n       Madoo is one of several enclaves in the region that the \n     U.S. military bombed over several days in December 2001, \n     killing an estimated 150 civilians. Once home to 300 people,\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n     Madoo has lost roughly half its population, villagers say. In \n     addition to the dozens killed by U.S. airstrikes, many others \n     lost their homes and moved away. The people who remain are \n     destitute. They live crowded in the few stone and timber \n     homes they've managed to rebuild on their own. They subsist \n     on bread and the vegetables they grow. Several children looks \n     slight and frail.\n       Half of world away in Washington, finding ways to help \n     people in such desperate need became an immediate priority \n     for some policymakers and a dangerous precedent to others.\n       Congress directed that an unspecified amount of money be \n     spent to assist innocent victims of U.S. bombing in \n     Afghanistan, just as it recently called on the Bush \n     administration to identify and provide ``appropriate \n     assistance'' to civilian victims in Iraq. But the money \n     has not yet reached any of the intended recipients, U.S. \n     officials acknowledged.\n       ``The money is there,'' said Tim Rieser, an aide to Sen. \n     Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). ``Mistakes were made. Mistakes are \n     made in wars. We all know that. But we have yet to see the \n     administration take action to carry out the law in \n     Afghanistan.''\n       The U.S. Agency for International Development, for example, \n     had $1.25 million in last year's budget to help Afghan \n     civilians who suffered losses as a result of U.S. military \n     action, according to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. But the \n     agency has not spent any of that money helping Afghans who \n     had their relatives killed, their children maimed, their \n     homes leveled or their livestock and livelihoods destroyed by \n     American bombing, several U.S. officials in Afghanistan \n     conceded this week.\n       The biggest obstacle to delivery of the aid, officials say, \n     has been a prolonged debate over how to assist bombing \n     victims without compensating them. To policymakers, the \n     distinction between easing the plight of suffering innocents \n     and compensating the victims of war is more than semantic. \n     Both the U.S. military and the State Department are leery of \n     setting legal precedents for compensation and have declined \n     to establish programs that either systematically document \n     civilian losses or give Afghans any opportunity to apply for \n     reparations.\n       Short of that, military civil-affairs units in Afghanistan \n     have, in isolated instances, provided general humanitarian \n     assistance to communities that happen to have suffered as a \n     result of U.S. bombing. They are, for example, helping \n     rebuild Bamian University--but only, officials insist, \n     because Bamian needs a new university, not because U.S. bombs \n     destroyed the old one.\n       ``Claims have never been processed for combat losses,'' \n     said Col. Roger King, U.S. military spokesman at Bagram air \n     base near Kabul, the Afghan capital.\n       The policy debate has gone on too long, Rieser said. ``It's \n     tricky,'' he said. ``We don't imagine going around handing \n     out dollar bills to people. We are sensitive to the issues. \n     If we were to announce some kind of a claims program, every \n     single person in Afghanistan would sign up. It's just not \n     feasible.\n       ``But we do know about a lot of these bombing incidents. We \n     know there is a real need there. Why not start doing \n     something about it in the context of our overall aid program? \n     All Congress is saying is, don't leave out the people who \n     suffered serious losses on account of our mistakes. It should \n     have happened already.''\n       There are no official estimates of how many Afghan \n     civilians have been killed by U.S. bombs. A survey published \n     last year by the human rights group Global Exchange estimated \n     the number at more than 800.\n       A year and a half after the U.S.-led coalition ousted the \n     Taliban and al Qaeda, bombs are still falling on Afghan \n     civilians as U.S. forces combat a resurgence of terrorism \n     aimed at destabilizing the government of President Hamid \n     Karzai. In eastern Afghanistan this month, a U.S. warplane \n     mistakenly killed 11 members of one family when a 1,000-pound \n     laser-guided bomb missed its intended target and landed on a \n     house.\n       And Madoo still lies in ruins.\n       The village, 25 miles south of Jalalabad, is not accessible \n     by road. It is a short but arduous hike through mountain \n     gorges from the Pakistan border. On the horizon jut the black \n     peaks of Tora Bora, home of the cave complex where an \n     estimated 1,000 of bin Laden's fighters are believed to have \n     gathered after the defeat of the Taliban last fall.\n       It was late afternoon on Dec. 1, 2001, when U.S. warplanes \n     appeared over Madoo. The people of Madoo were observing \n     Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.\n       ``It was the time of breaking fast, and we were just \n     sitting together to have dinner,'' Munir, 12, recalled. ``We \n     heard the voice of the planes, and we went out to see what \n     was happening. A bomb landed on our home. There weren't any \n     Taliban or Arabs with us. For nothing they dropped bombs \n     here.''\n       After the first bombers left, Munir's mother and 8-year-old \n     sister were dead. His infant brother, Abdul Haq, was buried \n     alive. Relatives spied the boy's foot sticking out of a mound \n     of dirt and dug him out.\n       The bombers returned three times, villagers said. In all, \n     the people of Madoo say they buried at least 55 loved ones.\n       Many bodies were too damaged to identify. Some of the \n     dozens of mounds in Madoo's hillside burial ground are marked \n     with two and three pieces of wood, signifying that the \n     remains of more than one person are interred there.\n       The people of Madoo remain puzzled by Americans. A retired \n     Ohio lawyer, who read about one Madoo boy injured in the \n     bombings, was so moved that he visited and gave each survivor \n     about $300. People bought tents and clothes and wheat seeds \n     to plant. But Madoo's losses outstripped one man's largess.\n       Munir's youngest brother, now a toddler, coughs frequently \n     and swipes at his runny nose. His family, whose home and \n     meager possessions were destroyed in the bombing, lives with \n     relatives.\n       ``Before, it was good here,'' Munir said. ``The people and \n     my father worked on the land. Life was better than it is now. \n     We have lost everything.''\n       Munir's father, Shingul, 55, who is raising his four \n     surviving children alone, tried to talk about his late wife \n     and daughter but could only turn away and weep.\n       ``If we were doing something wrong, I could understand \n     this,'' he said when he regained his voice. ``But it was \n     Ramadan and we were breaking the fast. The main problem we \n     have now is that we have nothing. We would really appreciate \n     it if someone could help.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5850-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5850-S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SCHOOL VOUCHERS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe all of our colleagues in the \nSenate will be interested in an article from today's New York Times \nentitled ``What Some Much-Noted Data Really Showed About Vouchers'' by \nMichael Winerip, pointing out the shocking flaws in a widely cited \nstudy released in 2000 by Paul E. Peterson on the benefits of private \nschool voucher programs.\n  It is clear that no research on vouchers has conclusively shown that \nprivate school students outperform public school students. Private \nschool vouchers are not proven to work and should not be supported by \nCongress. Public funds should be used for public schools, not on \ndubious experiments to pay for a small number of students to attend \nprivate schools.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act--passed last year with the strong \nsupport of President Bush and strong bipartisan support in Congress--is \nthe best hope for improving elementary and secondary education. Its \nreforms ask more of schools, teachers, and students in communities \nacross the country. Schools need as much funding and support as \npossible to ensure that no child is left behind. Every dollar in public \nfunds that goes to private schools is a dollar less for public schools.\n  Congress should support public schools, not abandon them. Proven \neffective reforms should be made--not just in a few schools, but in all \nschools; not just for a few students, but for all students. I urge my \ncolleagues in Congress to reject voucher proposals and grant increased \nfunds for public schools, and I ask unanimous consent that the New York \nTimes article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The New York Times, May 7, 2003]\n\n         What Some Much-Noted Data Really Showed About Vouchers\n\n                          (By Michael Winerip)\n\n       In August of 2000, in the midst of the Bush-Gore \n     presidential race, a Harvard professor, Paul E. Peterson, \n     released a study saying that school vouchers significantly \n     improved test scores of black children. Professor Peterson \n     had conducted the most ambitious randomized experiment on \n     vouchers to date, and his results--showing that blacks using \n     vouchers to attend private schools had scored six percentile \n     points higher than a control group of blacks in public \n     schools--became big news.\n       The Harvard professor appeared on CNN and ``The NewsHour \n     With Jim Lehrer.'' Conservative editorial writers and \n     columnists, including William Safire of The Times, cited the \n     Peterson study as proof that vouchers were the answer for \n     poor blacks, that Al Gore (a voucher opponent) was out of \n     touch with his black Democratic constituency and that George \n     W. Bush had it right.\n       ``The facts are clear and persuasive: school vouchers \n     work,'' The Boston Herald editorialized on Aug. 30, 2000. \n     ``If candidates looked at facts, this one would be a no-\n     brainer for Gore.''\n       Then, three weeks later, professor Peterson's partner in \n     the study, Mathematica, a Princeton-based research firm, \n     issued a sharp dissent. Mathematica's report emphasized that \n     all the gains in Professor Peterson's experiment, conducted \n     in New York City, had come in just one of the five grades \n     studied, the sixth, and that the rest of the black pupils, as \n     well as Latinos and whites of all grades who used vouchers, \n     had shown no gains. Since there was no logical explanation \n     for this, Mathematica noted the chance of a statistical \n     fluke. ``Because gains are so concentrated in this single \n     group, one needs to be very cautious,'' it said.\n       Several newspapers wrote about Mathematica's report, but, \n     coming three\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\n     weeks after the first round of articles, these did not have \n     the same impact.\n       And Professor Peterson, a big voucher supporter, continued, \n     undaunted. His 2002 book, ``The Education Gap,'' largely \n     ignored Mathematica's concerns and ballyhooed voucher gains \n     for blacks. ``The switch to a private school had \n     significantly positive impacts on the test scores of African-\n     American students,'' he wrote.\n       While he still couldn't explain why only blacks had gained, \n     he offered theories. Perhaps heavily black public schools \n     were even worse than urban Latino or white schools. Or, since \n     most vouchers in New York were used in Catholic schools, \n     perhaps a religious ``missionary commitment is required to \n     create a positive educational environment'' for blacks.\n       David Myers, the lead researcher for Mathematica, is \n     hesitant to criticize Professor Peterson. (``I'm going to be \n     purposely vague on that,'' he said in an interview.) But he \n     did something much more decent and important. After many \n     requests from skeptical academics, he agreed to make the \n     entire database for the New York voucher study available to \n     independent researchers.\n       A Princeton economist, Alan B. Krueger, took the offer, and \n     after two years recently concluded that Professor Peterson \n     had it all wrong--that no even black students using vouchers \n     had made any test gains. And Mr. Myers, Professor Peterson's \n     former research partner, agrees, calling Professor Krueger's \n     work ``a fine interpretation of the results.''\n       What makes this a cautionary tale for political leaders \n     seeking to draft public policy from supposedly scientific \n     research is the mundane nature of the apparent \n     miscalculations. Professor Krueger concluded that the \n     original study had failed to count 292 black students whose \n     test scores should have been included. And once they are \n     added--making the sample larger and statistically more \n     reliable--vouchers appear to have made no difference for any \n     group.\n       Some background. In 1997, 20,000 New York City students \n     each applied for a $1,400 voucher to private school through a \n     project financed by several foundations. A total of 1,300 \n     were selected by lottery to get a voucher, and 1,300 others--\n     the controls, who had wanted a voucher but were not \n     selected--were tracked in public schools. When the first test \n     results came back, the vouchers made no difference in test \n     scores for the 2,600 students as a whole. So the original \n     researchers tried breaking the group down by ethnicity and \n     race, and that's when they noted the sixth-grade test gains \n     for the black voucher group.\n       But there was a problem. The original researchers had never \n     planned to break out students by race. As a result, their \n     definition of race was not well thought out: it depended \n     solely on the mother. In their data, a child with a black \n     mother and a white father was counted as black; a child with \n     a white mother and a black father was counted as white.\n       When the father's race is considered, 78 more blacks are \n     added to the sample. Professor Krueger also found that 214 \n     blacks had been unnecessarily eliminated from the results \n     because of incomplete background data. These corrections by \n     Professor Krueger expanded the total number of blacks in the \n     sample by 292, to 811 from 519.\n       In recent weeks, Mr. Myers, of Mathematica, has reviewed \n     Professor Krueger's critique and found it impressive. Mr. \n     Myers has now concluded that Professor Krueger's adjustments \n     mean that ``the impact of a voucher offer is not \n     statistically significant.''\n       It is scary how many prominent thinkers in this nation of \n     290 million were ready to make new policy from a single study \n     that appears to have gone from meaningful to meaningless \n     based on whether 292 children's test scores are discounted or \n     included. ``It's not a study I'd want to use to make public \n     policy,'' Mr. Myers said. ``I see this and go `whoa.' ''\n       Professor Krueger of Princeton (who also writes a monthly \n     business column in The Times) said, ``This appeared to be \n     high-quality work, but it teaches you not to believe anything \n     until the data are made available.''\n       As for Professor Peterson of Harvard, the star of \n     newspapers and TV news in 2000 remains curiously mum these \n     days. In a brief interview, he decline to comment on \n     Professor Krueger's or Mathematica's criticisms. He said he \n     stood by his conclusion that vouchers lifted black scores, \n     and would ``eventually'' respond in a ``technical paper.'' \n     But he said he would not discuss these matters with a \n     reporter.\n       ``It's not appropriate,'' he said, ``to talk about complex, \n     methodologies in the news media.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5851-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT C. ATKINS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to pay tribute \nto a great person, a long-time friend and a true pioneer, Dr. Robert C. \nAtkins. Dr. Atkins, cardiologist, physician, and author, among many \nother endeavors, passed away tragically on April 17 from injuries \nsuffered in a fall in New York City.\n  A leader in both natural medicine and nutritional pharmacology, Dr. \nAtkins majored in pre-med at the University of Michigan and then went \non to receive his medical degree from the Cornell University Medical \nSchool in 1955. He was the founder of The Atkins Center for \nComplementary Medicine, Atkins Nutritionals, Inc, and cofounder and \npast president of the Foundation for the Advancement of Innovative \nMedicine. But as accomplished as he was a physician and researcher, Dr. \nAtkins was best known for his controlled carbohydrate approach to \nweight management known as the ``Atkins Diet.''\n  In addition to researching and developing what has become one of the \nleading weight control methods, Dr. Atkins also wrote 13 books, \nincluding ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution'' and ``Atkins for Life,'' \nboth of which have been and remain on The New York Times bestseller \nlist. His commitment to revolutionizing medicine and nutrition and \ndetermination to stand by his research led People magazine to name him \none of the ``25 Most Intriguing People,'' and Time magazine to add him \nto their list of ``People Who Matter''.\n  Dr. Atkins invested millions of his own money in the Dr. Robert C. \nAtkins Foundation, endowing institutions with the necessary funding for \nresearch and education.\n  I knew Bob Atkins for many years. He was a good friend and we saw eye \nto eye on many important issues including dietary supplements, \nalternative medicine, and medical research. As the lead proponent in \nthe formation the National Center for Complementary and Alternative \nMedicine, I was always grateful with Dr. Atkins tireless effort to \neducate law and policymakers. Dr. Atkins helped to bring national \nattention and credibility to complementary medicine as a serious and \neffective medical approach.\n  Dr. Atkins will always be remembered for having the courage and \nforesight to challenge conventional wisdom on nutrition. His tireless \nefforts to point out ways to lose weight and prevent and manage \ndiabetes and heart disease in ways conventional medicine had ignored or \nwere unaware are irreplaceable and have forever changed how Americans, \nand the world, view nutrition, weight loss and diet. During his life he \ntreated thousands of patients, including Members of Congress and their \nfamilies.\n  My condolences go out to his wife Veronica and mother Norma, and all \nthe people who had the pleasure to work for and with him. His legacy \nand lifetime achievements will continue to guide policy makers and \ndoctors around the world. Bob Atkins not only left a legacy of \nnutrition and health, but set an example for everyone to believe in \nthemselves and to question establishment policies.\n  Bob, we thank you and we miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5851-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5851-S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                THE 2003 UNITED NATIONS POPULATION AWARD\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to call the attention \nof my colleagues to the fact that an American activist has been chosen \nas the recipient of the 2003 United Nations Population Award for only \nthe second time in the history of the honor. This year's beneficiary, \nWerner Fornos, president of the Washington, DC-based Population \nInstitute, is a well-known figure on Capitol Hill and a long-time \nadvocate for international access to voluntary methods of family \nplanning.\n  I ask that the following press release honoring Mr. Fornos' receipt \nof this prestigious award be printed in the Record.\n  The press release follows.\n\n        Werner Fornos Wins 2003 United Nations Population Award\n\n       Werner Fornos, a longtime Washington, D.C. resident and \n     special advisor to former U.S. House of Representatives \n     Speaker John W. McCormack, has been named the winner of the \n     2003 United Nations Population Award in the individual \n     category.\n       ``The selection is in recognition of your outstanding \n     contribution to the awareness of population growth,'' Thoraya \n     Ahmed Obaid, secretary of the award committee and executive \n     director of the U.N. Population Fund, wrote to Fornos \n     informing him of his selection.\n       The Family Planning Association of Kenya will receive the \n     award in the institutional category. Founded in 1962 as a \n     volunteer-based nongovernmental organization, it has \n     pioneered the family planning movement in Kenya, promoting \n     the provision of sexual and reproductive health services \n     within the\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\n     context of reproductive rights and the empowerment of young \n     people.\n       Under the chairmanship of Jean-Claude Alexandre, Haiti's \n     Ambassador to the United Nations, the award committee also \n     consists of representatives of Burundi, Cape Verde, the \n     Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, the Republic of Moldova, and the \n     Netherlands, together with a representative of the U.N. \n     Secretary-General and Mrs. Obaid.\n       The citation is the only regular United Nations award of \n     its kind and consists of a medal, a diploma and a monetary \n     prize of $12,500 to each of the winners. The committee \n     selected the Family Planning Association of Kenya as the 2003 \n     laureate in the institutional category.\n       The award ceremony and reception is tentatively scheduled \n     for June 18 at United Nations Headquarters in New York.\n       Born in Leipzig, Germany, in November 1933, Fornos was \n     separated from his family when the apartment building in \n     which they were living was destroyed in an allied bombing \n     raid.\n       He later became the ``mascot'' of the 29th Infantry \n     Division of the United States Army, and stowed away four \n     times on troop ships and airplanes in efforts to emigrate to \n     the United States before he was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Jaime \n     Fornos of Newton, Massachusetts.\n       A 1965 graduate of the University of Maryland University \n     College, which recently named him Alumnus of the Year, with a \n     degree in government and politics, Fornos has served in the \n     Maryland state legislature and as the state's Assistant \n     Secretary of Human Resources and Manpower Administrator. He \n     also served as a special assistant to U.S. Assistant \n     Secretary of Labor for labor-management relations and Deputy \n     Assistant Manpower Administrator.\n       Prior to being named as president of the Population \n     Institute, Fornos was executive director of the Population \n     Action Council; executive director of Planned Parenthood of \n     Washington, D.C.; and assistant professor at George \n     Washington University, where he headed its Population \n     Information Program.\n       Fornos has been a management consultant in family planning \n     implementation and effectiveness to the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development, the American Public Health \n     Association, and Westinghouse Health Services. He has worked \n     on population and family planning projects for Tunisia, \n     Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, Mexico, the Philippines, China, \n     Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Kenya.\n       He has addressed plenary sessions of virtually every major \n     international population meeting since the 1974 World \n     Population Conference in Bucharest, Romania, including the \n     1984 International Population Conference in Mexico City, and \n     the 1994 International Conference on Population and \n     Development in Cairo, Egypt.

Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of one of South Dakota's heroic firefighters, Daniel Lee \nSilvernail.\n  After a lengthy battle with diabetes, Dan passed away on May 4, 2003. \nBorn in Sturgis, SD, October 9, 1982, to Dennis and Sherry Silvernail, \nDan attended Lead-Deadwood Schools and was a volunteer counselor at the \nDiabetes Incorporated Camp for kids. Responding to the call to serve \nhis State early, Dan was a team leader for the Junior Lead-Deadwood \nFire Department before becoming an active member of the Lead-Deadwood \nFire Department.\n  Dan Silvernail was a highly respected firefighter and his help in \nlast year's Colorado's wild fires, countless hours on the Grizzly Gulch \nFire in South Dakota, and most recently in Texas to help with the \ncleanup from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster will serve as a \nreminder of his profound desire to serve his State and Nation. He was \ngreatly admired by his peers for his dedication to his community and \nlocal concerns and his love for helping others is what set him apart \nfrom other outstanding South Dakotans.\n  A native of South Dakota, Dan is survived by his father, Dennis \nSilvernail; stepmother, Kelly Silvernail; mother, Sherry Silvernail; \nsister, LeAnn Silvernail; brother, Casey Kendall; grandparents, Art and \nGeorge Ann Silvernail, and Jim and Marlys Eggleston; step-grandparents, \nKeith and Marilyn Harrison; friends LeRoy and Roy; aunts, uncles, \ncousins and fellow firefighters.\n  Through his outstanding community involvement and activism, the lives \nof countless South Dakotans were enormously enhanced. His work will \ncontinue to be an inspiration to his fellow members of the Lead Fire \nDepartment, and also to all those who knew him. Our Nation and South \nDakota are far better places because of his life, and while we miss him \nvery much, the best way to honor his life is to emulate his commitment \nto public service and to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5852-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOS ANGELES REVLON RUN/WALK\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of the Los Angeles Revlon Run/Walk, which will occur on May \n10, 2003. For the past decade, the Revlon Run/Walk has been taking \nplace in New York and Los Angeles, raising millions of dollars to fight \nwomen's cancers.\n  I am told that the Revlon Run/Walk was launched when a group of \npeople came together with a common vision. The vision was to \n``accelerate the research process and honor the courageous spirits that \ncontinue to fight this extraordinary fight.'' Now, a decade later, the \nRun/Walk has raised more than $27 million. This vision has truly become \na reality.\n  Proceeds from the Revlon Run/Walks have helped fund cutting-edge \nresearch and assisted organizations in providing education, advocacy \nand outreach services to those affected by cancer. The organizations \nbenefitting from the Run/Walk include the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer \nResearch Program, National Women's Cancer Research Alliance, the \nWellness Community, WIN Against Breast Cancer, the Los Angeles Breast \nCancer Alliance, the Women of Color Breast Cancer Survivors Support \nProject, and the Gilda Radner Ovarian and Breast Cancer Detection \nProgram at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.\n  Each year, the Run/Walk draws thousands of people motivated to \nparticipate in support of this cause. The participants include adults \nand children. These people personify the gracious, generous spirit of \nthe American people--a diverse group united in support of one \nworthwhile cause.\n  The Entertainment Industry Foundation, the founders of the Run/Walk, \nand all those who make this event possible every year deserve to be \nrecognized and commended. They have been extremely successful in the \npast, and I am confident that with their dedication, leadership, and \nability to pull the community together, they will continue to succeed \nin turning their vision into reality.\n  I congratulate them on their 10th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5852-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5852-S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MARTHA WRIGHT GRIFFITHS\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nlife and mourn the passing of a friend, a mentor, and a personal hero: \nMartha Wright Griffiths, who dedicated more than 40 years of her life \nin public service to her State and her Nation.\n  But her death last month at 91 does not mean the loss of a flame. \nRather it is the passing of a torch, for her causes continue.\n  Isaac Newton was once asked to explain the inspiration behind his \nmany scientific discoveries that advanced our understanding of the \nworld. He said: ``If I have been able to see further, it is because I \nstood on the shoulders of giants.''\n  As I stand here today and speak as a proud member of the United \nStates Senate, I understand Newton's humility. I know I stand on the \nshoulders of giants who advanced our understanding of what our world \ncan be.\n  Martha Wright Griffiths--Michigan's first woman Lieutenant Governor--\nis one of those giants in the cause of equal rights and social justice \nin our Nation.\n  Consider her remarkable career. When Martha was born in 1912, women \ndidn't even have the right to vote, let alone have the chance to serve \ntheir country as legislators, judges or elected executive officials.\n  A generation of women fought to change that and women like Martha \nstepped up and accepted the new leadership responsibilities that came \nwith their new duties.\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\n  Martha's public service career began in 1948 with two terms in the \nMichigan Legislature. From there she went on to become the first woman \njudge in Detroit's old criminal court system.\n  In 1954, she became the second woman elected to the United States \nHouse of Representatives from Michigan, and began a distinguished 20-\nyear career as a legislator.\n  In the House, Martha became an advocate for reviving our cities, \nincreasing aid to education, promoting tax relief for struggling \nfamilies and making sure that every man, woman and child in America had \naccess to health care.\n  But Martha was best known for her work in civil rights and the rights \nof women. She was not only an early and avid supporter of the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act, but she got Congress to approve an amendment she \nauthored to include women in the bill by shaming the men in the House \nChambers into voting for it.\n  ``A vote against this amendment today by a man is a vote against his \nwife or his widow or his daughter or his sister,'' she told them.\n  In 1970, Martha gathered the 218 signatures needed for a rare \ndischarge petition that forced the Equal Rights Amendment to the floor \nof the House after it had languished in committee for nearly 50 years.\n  Martha left the House in 1974, and joined several corporate boards \nincluding the former Chrysler Corporation and Consumers Power Company--\ncompanies that had never had women on their boards before.\n  In 1982, Martha began her final tour of public service when she was \nsworn in as Michigan's first woman Lieutenant Governor. I had the \npleasure of working with her as a member of the Michigan House of \nRepresentatives through much of her tenure.\n  And the day she was sworn in as lieutenant governor, Martha also \nbecame the first woman in Michigan's history to serve in all three \nbranches of government.\n  Giants such as Martha Wright Griffiths moved us closer to realizing \nour Nation's promise of equal justice and opportunity for each and \nevery citizen.\n  Her passing reminds us that it is now our turn to square our \nshoulders and stand tall for the generations of Americans to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5853-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BERT SANDBERG\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing two tributes honoring the life of the late Bert Sandberg--\nsteadfast businessman, World War II veteran, and long-time friend of \nthe city of St. Paul--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Apr. 29, 2003]\n\n                        Tribute to Bert Sandberg\n\n                           (By Tony Kennedy)\n\n       He claimed to have eaten the first steak served at \n     Mancini's Char House and in 1977 he received and award for \n     ridding St. Paul streets of Dutch Elm diseases.\n       A building contractor with major credits in downtown St. \n     Paul, Bert Sandberg also was known for his labor on the \n     basketball court, playing tenaciously at the St. Paul \n     Athletic Club and other gyms until he was 75 years old.\n       The decorated World War II veteran and acclaimed prep \n     athlete from Mechanic Arts High School died Sunday of liver \n     cancer. He was 77. Although he was not in the public \n     spotlight, Sandberg was politically well-connected and kept a \n     running friendship with the city's mayors, occasionally \n     offering them advice on how to improve the Capital City.\n       ``There's no such thing as having just a moment with \n     Bert,'' St. Paul Deputy Mayor Dennis Flaherty said last week. \n     ``He loves to tell stories.\n       Flaherty said Sandberg never asked the city for anything, \n     but often was ``below the radar'' helping private citizens \n     and supporting various city initiatives. Among other things, \n     he was a supporter of the St. Paul Winter Carnival.\n       Sandberg's Swedish immigrant parents raised him in a house \n     on the corner of 9th and Wacouta Sts. in an area of downtown \n     St. Paul now known as Lowertown. He married Carol Ziniel of \n     St. Paul in 1952 and moved to Mendota Heights, where they \n     raised one boy and two girls. But Sandberg never sold the lot \n     where he grew up.\n       ``He's a guy who sincerely loves St. Paul,'' Flaherty said.\n       Sandberg's daughter, Leslie a press secretary for state \n     Attorney General Mike Hatch, said her dad was appropriately \n     featured in a history of Minnesota members of the so-called \n     Greatest Generation that came of age during the 1930s and \n     '40s, survived the Great Depression and World War II and \n     build the foundation for modern-day America.\n       After graduating from Mechanic Arts High School in 1943, he \n     enlisted in the Navy and served three years in the South \n     Pacific during World War II. Sandberg worked on a Landing \n     Ship Tank, or LST boat, that was used to deploy troops and \n     equipment on foreign shores. He was awarded a Silver Star and \n     five Bronze Stars, his daughter said.\n       Sandberg had finished near the bottom of his class at \n     Mechanic Arts, but when he returned from war he wiggled his \n     way in to Augsburg College. He not only graduated, but he \n     later returned to serve on the school's Board of Regents from \n     1968-1980.\n       ``His focus was to encourage the college to take a chance \n     on students who otherwise might not make it in,'' Leslie \n     Sandberg said.\n       Her father was drafted after college to play football for \n     the Philadelphia Eagles, but he waived the opportunity and \n     instead joined his father's business, St. Paul-based N.H. \n     Sandberg Erection Co. Sandberg started at the firm as an \n     ironworker, but he eventually took over the company and \n     expanded it to include worldwide crane and heavy equipment \n     rentals.\n       ``My dad traveled all over the world and he'd say, `St. \n     Paul is the best city. Why would you want to live anywhere \n     else?' '' Leslie Sandberg said.\n       The firm's downtown St. Paul building credits include the \n     federal courthouse, the St. Paul Hilton Hotel (now the \n     Radisson Riverfront), the Osborn Building, the Northwestern \n     Bell Telephone Building and many skyways.\n       When George Latimer was mayor, Sandberg was given an award \n     for quickly and efficiently removing diseased elm trees from \n     all over the city. And in 1999, when the St. Paul City \n     Conference celebrated its centennial as a high school \n     athletic conference, Sandberg was chosen as the best athlete \n     from 1943. At Mechanic Arts he was a baseball player, a \n     speedster in track and a standout in basketball and football.\n       Leslie Sandberg said her father's list of achievements \n     wouldn't be complete without a mention of his part as an \n     extra in the movie ``Might Ducks III.'' He is pictured in the \n     movie as a counter patron at Mickey's Diner.\n       ``He just loved that,'' his daughter Leslie said. ``He \n     never cashed his paycheck.''\n       Sandberg, who was born in St. Paul on July 28, 1925, is \n     survived by his wife, Carol; daughters Leslie of Mendota \n     Heights and Susan of Los Angeles; and son Nels of \n     Philadelphia. Services are pending.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Pioneer Press, Apr. 30, 2003]\n\n       Bert Sandberg, who helped build much of the modern skyline \n     of St. Paul and was one of the city's biggest boosters, died \n     Sunday of liver cancer at his home in Mendota Heights. He was \n     77.\n       Sandberg was owner of Sandberg Erection Co., which built \n     the steel foundation for the federal courts building, the \n     Marshall Field's store, the St. Paul Radisson Riverfront \n     Hotel, the Ecolab Building, a Qwest Building, the First \n     National Bank Building, the former West Publishing Building \n     and most of the city's skyways.\n       ``He and his company were involved in probably all of the \n     major buildings in downtown St. Paul,'' said Dennis Flaherty, \n     deputy mayor. ``He was full of energy and excitement for St. \n     Paul. Every time he'd see me, he'd offer a new suggestion.''\n       One of Sandberg's daughters, Leslie, said her father loved \n     to take the family on a drive when the children were young. \n     He would point at various buildings and say, ``You know what? \n     We built that.''\n       Sandberg was a friend of many St. Paul mayors over the \n     years, including George Latimer, Norm Coleman and Randy \n     Kelly.\n       ``My father was a character,'' Leslie Sandberg said. ``He \n     knew everybody.''\n       Sandberg got a role as an extra in the ``Mighty Ducks III'' \n     movie when the director, Steven Brill, spotted Sandberg \n     golfing at the Town and Country Club and the two men began a \n     conversation. Brill recognized a good character and told \n     Sandberg not to shave, and Sandberg portrayed a local at a \n     scene in Mickey's Diner.\n       In 1990, Gov. Rudy Perpich appointed Sandberg as a \n     representative of the city of St. Paul to meet with Mikhail \n     Gorbachev, then president of the Soviet Union, who was \n     visiting Minnesota.\n       Sandberg was a member of the Board of Regents at Augsburg \n     College in Minneapolis from 1968 to 1980 and was a longtime \n     member of the St. Paul Athletic Club.\n       An outstanding athlete, he once had an offer to play \n     professional football but decided he was too small. He played \n     basketball twice a week until he was 75.\n       ``He had a great set shot,'' Leslie Sandberg said.\n       He used cranes and chain saws to remove dying elm trees on \n     Summit Avenue, and Mayor Latimer presented him with an award \n     in 1977 for helping battle the scourge of Dutch elm disease.\n       He served with the Navy in the South Pacific during World \n     War II.\n       In addition to daughter Leslie, Sandberg is survived by his \n     wife, Carol, Mendota Heights; daughter Susan, Los Angeles, \n     and son Nels, Philadelphia.\n       Visitation is from 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday at O'Halloran and \n     Murphy Funeral Home in St. Paul.

Mr. President, on May 4, 2003, Rachel Petersen \nand Elizabeth Volzke were honored for their outstanding volunteer \nservice at the Eighth Annual Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. The \ntwo State honorees for South Dakota received a $1,000 award in addition \nto an engraved silver medallion and an all-expense-paid trip with a \nparent or guardian to Washington, DC.\n  Petersen, 18, of Rapid City, is a senior at Stevens High School. In \naddition to being named a State honoree, Petersen was named South \nDakota's top high school youth volunteer and Rapid City's Citizen of \nthe Month. Petersen earned this prestigious honor by initiating and \nleading a group of teen volunteers who prepare and serve hot lunches \nevery Sunday to homeless and disadvantaged people in her community. \nWhen Rachel learned that hungry people were turned away from the \ncommunity's food program for breaking program rules or other reasons, \nshe decided to help. ``It still seemed like a terrible tragedy that \ngood people with a few problems had nowhere to eat,'' she said. Rachel \nfirst arranged for a steady source of donated food, then began \nrecruiting reliable student volunteers to help. Each week, Rachel picks \nup the donated ingredients, and then prepares her menu--usually a 5-\ngallon pot of soup, with bread, a side dish, and a drink. Volunteers \nhelp set up a feeding station in a city park, where they stay each \nSunday for 2 or 3 hours, serving 40 to 50 hungry people. Rachel is \ntraining other teen volunteers to take over when she leaves for college \nnext year. ``The eradication of world hunger will happen one meal at a \ntime,'' Rachel said.\n  Elizabeth Volzke, 11, a member of the Girl Scouts of Nyoda Council in \nHuron and a fifth-grader at Eureka Public School, received this award \nas recognition of her work at a local assisted living center, daycare \ncenter, and church services, among other events. Elizabeth began her \nvolunteerism by vowing to perform 100 hours of community service to \ncommemorate the 100th anniversary of the 4-H program. Beginning with \nvisits to residents of the assisted living center where her mother \nworks and playing games with them, Elizabeth and her sister also made \ncookies, door and table decorations, party favors, and tray liners for \nholiday celebrations, paying for supplies with money earned from \nrecycling aluminum. Elizabeth was soon visiting and playing piano at \nother nursing homes, as well. She then expanded her volunteering to a \nchildren's daycare center because, as Elizabeth said, ``I love babies \nand young children.'' She plans to continue her volunteer efforts, \nadding, ``What a wonderful feeling it is to help others.''\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards recognizes students in \nmiddle and high school grades who have demonstrated exemplary community \nservice. For their commendable and inspiring efforts to aid those \nafflicted by illness, poverty, and other difficult circumstances, 10 \nstudents are chosen as America's top volunteers, in addition to 104 \nindividual State honorees. State honorees, such as Rachel and \nElizabeth, are chosen by their outstanding dedication to community from \na pool of more than 24,000 applications. Carried out in a joint venture \nwith the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards were originally created to \nencourage and reward youth volunteerism and young role models.\n  People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual \ncitizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and \nvitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Rachel \nand Elizabeth are examples to all of us. These two South Dakotans are \nextraordinary individuals who richly deserve this distinguished \nrecognition. I strongly commend their hard work and dedication, and I \nam very pleased that their efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated. It is with great honor that I share their impressive \naccomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5854-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM BIVIN FORENSIC SOCIETY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

VOLLMER, JR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the death of United States \nDistrict Judge Judge Richard W. Vollmer, Jr. was a great loss to our \ncountry, the American legal system, his friends, and especially his \nwonderful family. Judge Vollmer was born March 7, 1926, in St. Louis, \nMO, and moved to Mobile, AL, in 1941 where he attended McGill \nInstitute. After graduation he enrolled in the U.S. Navy and served \nuntil 1946 in the South Pacific. He returned to Mobile where he \ngraduated from Springhill College in 1949. He began attending the \nUniversity of Alabama\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nSchool of Law from 1950-52 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Saipan. He \nreturned to the University of Alabama School of Law where he served as \na member of the Board of Editors of the Alabama Law Review and \ngraduated in 1953.\n  He married Marilyn Jean Stikes in 1949 and they have five children \nand nine grandchildren. Two of his sons, Rick and Jim, are following in \ntheir father's footsteps as practicing lawyers in the Mobile area.\n  After law school, Judge Vollmer worked several years for State Farm \nInsurance Company prior to joining the law firm of Pillans, Reams, \nTappan, Wood and Roberts in 1956. He engaged in an active practice in \nState and Federal courts where he won the respect of his fellow lawyers \nand jurists before whom he appeared.\n  He was a charter member of the American Board of Trial Advocates, \nserving as president of the Alabama Chapter in 1984-85, and was serving \nas president of the Mobile Bar Association at the time of his \nappointment to the Federal bench.\n  In 1990, President George H.W. Bush nominated him to the district \nbench for the Southern District of Alabama, where he began his career \non June 18, 1990, taking senior status on December 31, 2000. He had a \nstrong work ethic and he demanded the same of the lawyers who appeared \nbefore him. He never failed to offer his assistance with a congested \ncourt docket during times when the Southern District of Alabama did not \nhave its full complement of active judges. Even upon taking senior \nstatus, and with failing health, he was always available if the \nworkload demanded it.\n  Judge Vollmer was not just somebody who worked in the courthouse. \nAlthough he loved the law, he knew the love of family came before work, \nand was deeply concerned about the personal well-being of all the \ncourthouse family with whom he worked, often going out of his way to \ninquire into their well-being. As U.S. District Judge William Steele \nhas noted, he had a bright and warm presence with a quick smile and \nlaugh. His positive spirit has made the U.S. Courthouse in Mobile a \nwonderful place to work.\n  Widely esteemed as a jurist, respected by all who appeared before \nhim, he brought to the bench a sincere quality of humility, love of the \nlaw, patience, personal integrity and genuine faith. As was said in the \nopening prayer at his investiture ceremony, ``Justice and justice alone \nshall be your aim.'' It can now be said with certitude that Judge \nVollmer spent his career dispensing justice fairly and impartially. I \nhad the honor of practicing before Judge Vollmer and to get a direct \nview of his noble character and humanity. He cared deeply for the \nunfortunate, was pained to see young people be sentenced to long jail \nterms though he did his duty. In addition, he was a generous affirmer \nand true mentor for many. I vividly remember him calling me into his \noffice and encouraging me to consider a race for attorney general of \nAlabama. I knew his judgment and insight was good and that he had a \nvaluable perspective. That advice meant a great deal to me. I respected \nhis judgment and knew his comments were given with my interests in \nmind. Such human touches have meant much to many others.\n  Judge Vollmer served in an exceptional court. The U.S. District Court \nfor the Southern District of Alabama has a great record of integrity, \nindustry, legal skill and collegiality. He received an illustrious \ntradition and passed it on even brighter.\n  Judge Vollmer died at his home in Mobile on March 20, 2003. He leaves \na legacy of always seeking to do what is just and fair and \nright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5855-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5855-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/07/senate-section/article/S5855-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT THAT TERMINATES THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DESCRIBED AND DECLARED IN \n   EXECUTIVE ORDER 12865 OF SEPTEMBER 26, 1993, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE NATIONAL UNION FOR TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF \n    ANGOLA (UNITA) AND REVOKES THAT ORDER, EXECUTIVE ORDER 13069 OF \n DECEMBER 12, 1997, AND EXECUTIVE ORDER 13098 OF AUGUST 18, 1998--PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 202 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622, I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``Order''), that terminates the national emergency \ndescribed and declared in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993, \nwith respect to the actions and policies of the National Union for the \nTotal Independence of Angola (UNITA) and revokes that order, Executive \nOrder 13069 of December 12, 1997, and Executive Order 13098 of August \n18, 1998.\n  The Order will have the effect of lifting the sanctions imposed on \nUNITA in Executive Orders 12865, 13069, and 13098. These trade and \nfinancial sanctions were imposed to support international efforts to \nforce UNITA to abandon armed conflict and return to the peace process \noutlined in the Lusaka Protocol, as reflected in United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), and 1173 (1998).\n  The death of UNITA leaders Jonas Savimbi in February 2002 enabled the \nAngolan government and UNITA to sign the Luena Memorandum of \nUnderstanding on April 4, 2002. This agreement established an immediate \ncease-fire and called for UNITA's return to the peace process laid out \nin the 1994 Lusaka Protocol. In accordance therewith, UNITA quartered \nall its military personnel in established reception areas and handed \nits remaining arms over to the Angolan government. In September 2002, \nthe Angolan government and UNITA reestablished the Lusaka Protocol's \nJoint Commission to resolve outstanding political issues. On November \n21, 2002, the Angolan government and UNITA declared the provisions of \nthe Lusaka Protocol fully implemented and called for the lifting of \nsanctions on UNITA imposed by the United Nations Security Council.\n  With the successful implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and the \ndemilitarization of UNITA, the circumstances that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on September 26, 1993, have been \nresolved. The actions and policies of UNITA no longer pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1448 (2002) lifted the \nmeasures imposed pursuant to prior U.N. Security Council resolutions \nrelated to UNITA. The continuation of sanctions imposed by Executive \nOrders 12865, 13069, and 13098 would have a prejudicial effect on the \ndevelopment of UNITA as an opposition political party, and therefore, \non democratization in Angola. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to terminate the national emergency with respect to \nUNITA and to lift the sanctions that have been used to apply economic \npressure on UNITA.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. This \nOrder is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 7, 2003.\n                                                      George W.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to the funding of special \n     education and ending unfunded mandates; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has found that \n     all children deserve a quality education, including children \n     with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \n     20 United States Code, Section 1400, et seq., provides that \n     the Federal Government and state and local governments are to \n     share in the expense of education for children with \n     disabilities and commits the Federal Government to provide \n     funds to assist with the excess of expenses of education for \n     children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has committed to \n     contribute up to 40% of the average per-pupil expenditure of \n     educating children with disabilities and the Federal \n     Government has failed to meet this commitment to assist the \n     states; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has never contributed more \n     than 13% to 20% of the national average per-pupil expenditure \n     to assist with the excess expenses of educating children with \n     disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act; and\n       Whereas, this failure of the Federal Government to meet its \n     commitment to assist with the excess expenses of educating a \n     child with a disability contradicts the goal of ensuring that \n     children with disabilities receive a quality education; and\n       Whereas, the imposition of unfunded mandates by the Federal \n     Government on state governments interferes with the \n     separation of powers between the 2 levels of government and \n     the ability of each state to determine the issues and \n     concerns of the State and what resources should be directed \n     to address these issues and concerns; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government recognized the inequalities \n     of unfunded mandates on state governments 8 years ago when it \n     passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995; and\n       Whereas, since the passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act of 1995, however, the Federal Government continues to \n     impose unfunded mandates on state governments, including in \n     areas such as special education requirements: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States either provide 40% of the \n     national average per pupil expenditure to assist states and \n     local education agencies with the excess costs of educating \n     children with disabilities or amend the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act to allow the states more \n     flexibility in implementing its mandates; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the Congress of the United States revisit and \n     reconfirm the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 and put the \n     intent and purpose of the Act into practice by ending the \n     imposition of unfunded federal mandates on state governments; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W.

A resolution from the House of the legislature of \n     the State of Kansas relative to funding for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 6019\n\n       Whereas, as a result of having served in Operation Desert \n     Storm in the Arabian Peninsula 11 years ago, 16% of the \n     700,000 troops who were stationed there have been awarded \n     disability benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs--\n     and these injuries resulted from hostilities that lasted only \n     100 hours; and\n       Whereas, the state of Kansas recently released the results \n     of a health study of over 2,000 Kansas veterans who served \n     during the first Gulf War. The study identified clear links \n     between Gulf veterans' health problems and the time and \n     places in which they served. Overall, 34% of Kansas veterans \n     who served in Desert Shield or Desert Storm had symptoms of \n     Gulf War illness; and\n       Whereas, subsequently, the Congress enacted Public Law 105-\n     85 which requires the development and implementation of a \n     medical tracking system for service members deployed \n     overseas. Such requirements include an assessment of mental \n     health and the drawing of blood to accurately record any \n     changes in their medical condition during the course of their \n     deployment; and\n       Whereas, as reported in an article by David Goldstein in \n     the Kansas City Star on March 5, 2003, many of our troops \n     currently in the Middle East have not received the testing \n     required under Public Law 105-85; and\n       Whereas, the House of Representatives is concerned with the \n     possibility that Kansas military personnel involved with \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom could return home with similar \n     illnesses as those of Desert Storm: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas: That the House urges the United States government to \n     begin preparing now to address the health needs of veterans \n     of Operation Iraqi Freedom, including the administration of \n     tests required under Public Law 105-85; and be it further\n       Resolved: That we believe it is the obligation of our \n     national government to provide all necessary medical care and \n     support for those injured or inflicted with illnesses in the \n     defense of our nation and, anticipating additional costs \n     associated with Operation Iraqi Freedom, urge the Congress of \n     the United States to provide adequate funding for the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs; and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be directed to provide an enrolled copy of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the United States Congress, to each member \n     of the Kansas Congressional Delegation and to the Kansas \n     Commission on Veterans Affairs, Kansas Disabled Veterans, \n     Kansas Veterans of Foreign Wars and Kansas American Legion.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-86. A resolution from the House of the Representative \n     of the State of Michigan relative to expressing support for \n     U.S. Troops; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 31\n\n       Whereas, as the United States military faces several \n     difficult situations around the globe, Michigan is joining \n     this effort to protect our liberties from a wide range of \n     threats. Numerous National Guard units in Michigan have been \n     called to active duty. Many of these personnel are going to \n     replace other units that have been on duty throughout the \n     country, and several are active in the work of providing \n     homeland security; and\n       Whereas, while preserving our liberties in a troubled world \n     always demands great vigilance and the sacrifice of our men \n     and women in uniform, the current situation is demonstrating \n     the debt we owe to our fellow citizens in the military. Even \n     though the threats facing us are in many ways different than \n     those that have challenged previous generations, the role of \n     courage and commitment in securing our freedoms remains as \n     clear as ever; and\n       Whereas, success in dealing with the crisis in Iraq and the \n     continuing demands of the war on terrorism in countless \n     locales requires not only the commitment of our troops, but \n     also great sacrifices by the families of these brave \n     Americans. These men, women, and children face difficulties \n     in many ways, and the uncertain duration of the separation \n     for many of them makes the situation even worse. Support for \n     our troops is incomplete without support for them as well; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the weeks and months that lie before us, there \n     is no telling what will be asked of our country. We can, \n     however, promise that the people of Michigan stand ready to \n     express our support for our troops with public policy \n     decisions that will advance the Nation's efforts in the work \n     before us: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we express \n     support for our troops and pledge our commitment to public \n     policies that will advance the Nation's efforts against \n     terrorism and threats to liberty; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, the \n     United States Department of Defense, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation, the Office of the President of the \n     United States, and appropriate local military service \n     organizations throughout Michigan.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87.

A bill to provide for the establishment of summer health \ncareer introductory programs for middle and high school students; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation aimed \nat addressing the long term shortage of workers in our health care \nsystem.\n  In recent months, America's health care workforce shortage has made \nheadline news. While most of the stories have focused on the lack of \nnurses, the shortage of health care professionals also includes \nradiology technicians, respiratory therapists, clinical laboratory \nscientists, imaging technologists, rehabilitation professionals, \npharmacists and others.\n  This shortage is different than the one hospitals have experienced in \nthe past because it is only the prelude to a long-term shortage of \ncrisis proportions. The demand for health care is increasing as \nAmericans are living longer than previous generations, and advances in \nmedicine have let more people live with chronic and age-related \ndiseases. With the demand for hospital services increasing because of a \ngrowing and aging population, the workforce shortages present our \nNation with a potential health care crisis. I believe we must do \nsomething to change this disturbing trend.\n  In my State of Colorado, a task force made up of community colleges, \nuniversities, corporations, hospitals, social services and interested \ncommunity activists has been convened to actively find solutions for \nthe workforce shortages. One of the proposals would be to hold a health \ncareer summer youth camp under the title, Gee Whiz Jobs, where young \npeople would be introduced to a full range of career possibilities in \nthe health care field. I believe this idea and their program can become \na model for other such programs throughout the country.\n  The legislation I am introducing today attempts to build on the \ncareer camp idea. It authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to make demonstration grants to accredited universities and/or \ncommunity colleges to establish summer health career introductory \nprograms for middle school and high school students.\n  Many students are not prepared in the necessary levels of math, \nscience and reading to enter health education programs directly out of \nhigh school. Many others have never been exposed to health careers and \ndo not even consider them as a possibility. And, a significant number \nhave little knowledge of the range of career possibilities or what the \nworking environments may be like. Summer school exposure to health \ncareers which allows young people to visit hospitals, doctors' offices, \nemergency rooms, and community health clinics and witness professionals \nat work in providing health care services may be just what they need to \nguide them into a health career.\n  I believe that we must broaden the base of health care workers by \ndesigning strategies that attract and retain a diverse workforce. We \nmust collaborate with others--hospitals, health care and professional \nassociations, educational institutions, corporations, philanthropic \norganizations, and government to attract new entrants to the health \nprofessions. And, we must begin these efforts early in the lives of our \nyoung people.\n  It is going to take all of us--educators, government and community \nofficials, hospital leaders, health care workers, and the public--\nworking together to meet the challenge facing our health care system \ntoday. That is why I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this \nlegislation. Let's begin to aggressively address the health care worker \nshortage in a way that will carry us into the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance and further research into paralysis and to \nimprove rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with \nparalysis and other physical disabilities; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nSpecter and Kennedy today in re-introducing legislation that will give \nnew hope to Americans with paralysis.\n  Recent news reports about the medical miracle Christopher Reeve has \nexperienced over the two past years is an inspiration for every \nAmerican living with paralysis as a result of a spinal cord injury. \nWhen it was announced that, for the first time since his accident in \n1995, Chris regained sensation and movement in parts of his body, \nproviding inspiration for some of the two million Americans with \nparalysis. Most recently, Chris has started weaning himself from a \nventilator, breathing on his own for the first time since his accident.\n  Today, through the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act of 2003, we seek \nto achieve two primary goals. First, to further advance the science \nneeded to promote spinal regeneration. And second, to build quality of \nlife programs throughout the country that will further advance full \nparticipation, independent living, self-sufficiency and equality of \nopportunity for individuals with paralysis and other physical \ndisabilities.\n  Chris' recovery and recent scientific evidence show that progress is \npossible. At research centers in the United States, Europe and Japan, \ntechniques of rigorous exercise have helped numerous persons with \nparaplegia with limited sensations in their lower bodies walk for short \ndistances, unassisted or using walkers.\n  While the results of these new methods are quite promising, the \nlimits of what physical exercise can do for patients remains grossly \nunderstudied. While each person and each injury is unique, and some \npeople recover spontaneously, an estimated 250,000 Americans are living \nwith spinal cord injuries that have not improved. Which therapy or \ncombination of therapies will work for each person is unknown. Today \ntwo million Americans are living with paralysis, including spinal cord \ninjury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ALS and spina \nbifida. We need research to see how these new interventions work on the \nentire population of individuals with paralysis.\n  What we do know is the ordinary repetitive motions used in most \nrehabilitation centers, like squeezing a ball, are almost certainly not \nenough to appropriately address neurological injuries.\n  Patients are usually told that after one year, two at the most, they \nwill never make further progress in their abilities to move or feel \nsensation. Yet eight years after his accident, through a rigorous \nexercise plan, Chris is finally seeing results.\n  Due to efforts led by the National Institutes of Health and the \nChristopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, our Nation stands on the brink \nof amazing\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\nbreakthroughs in science for those with paralysis. However, the biotech \nand pharmaceutical industries have not invested in paralysis research \nbecause they believe the market does not support the private \ninvestment. There is an urgent need for the Federal Government to \nfurther step up its commitment in this area. The Christopher Reeve \nParalysis Act would do just that.\n  By establishing Paralysis Research Consortia at the National \nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, we can substantially \nincrease our ability to capitalize on research advances in paralysis. \nThese consortia would be formed to explore unique scientific expertise \nand focus across the existing research centers at NINDS in an effort to \nfurther advance treatments, therapies and developments on one or more \nforms of paralysis that result from central nervous system trauma and \nstroke.\n\n  Additional breakthroughs are underway in rehabilitation research on \nparalysis. Federal funding for rehabilitation research at the National \nCenter for Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH is showing real \npotential to improve functional mobility; prevent secondary \ncomplications like bladder and urinary tract infections and ulcers; and \nto develop improved assistive technology. These rehabilitation \ninterventions have the potential to greatly reduce pain and other \ncomplications for people with neurological disorders and stroke and, at \nthe same time, save millions in health care costs.\n  Over the past 20 years, overall days in the hospital and \nrehabilitation center for those with paralysis have been cut in half. \nThose with paralysis face astronomical medical costs, and our best \nestimates tell us that only one-third of those individuals remain \nemployed after paralysis. At least one-third of those with paralysis \nhave incomes of $15,000 or less.\n  To date, there are no State-based programs at CDC that address \nparalysis and other physical disability with the goal of improving \nhealth outcomes and prevent secondary complications. This bill will, \nfor the first time, ensure that individuals with paralysis get the \ninformation they need; have access to public health programs; and \nsupport in their communities to navigate services. Ultimately these \nprograms will help remove the barriers to community participation and \nhelp improve quality of life. The bill also establishes hospital-based \nregistries on paralysis to collect needed data on the true numbers of \nindividuals with these conditions, and it invests in population-based \nresearch to see how various therapies impact different people.\n  We are on the brink of major breakthroughs for individuals with \nneurological disorders and stroke that result in paralysis. This bill \nwill ensure that the federal government does its part to help more than \n2 million Americans.\n  When Christopher Reeve was injured, he put a face on an issue that \nhas been neglected for too long. Since then, his tireless efforts to \nwalk again, coupled with his passion and commitment to improve quality \nof life for others with paralysis, make him an inspiration to all \nAmericans.\n  It is a pleasure and an honor to lead a bipartisan group of Senators, \nalong with the support of a number of disability groups, including the \nAmerican Stroke Association, the American Heart Association, the \nChristopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the National Family Caregivers \nAssociation, the National Spinal Cord Injury Association, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America and Easter Paralyzed Veterans, in introducing this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1012. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide fiscal relief and program simplification to States, to improve \ncoverage and services to medicaid beneficiaries, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our Nation's States and health safety \nnet are simultaneously facing a crisis. According to State budget \nofficers, the states are facing a nearly $30 billion budget shortfall \nthis year and an $80 billion gap in fiscal year 2004 due to the \neconomic recession. At the same time, it is estimated that the number \nof uninsured increased from 41 to 45 million this past year. And, due \nto the State budget shortfalls, the numbers of uninsured may increase \neven further.\n  In fact, the lead paragraph in the New York Times in an article \nentitled ``Cutbacks Imperil Health Coverage for States' Poor'' on April \n28, 2003, reads, ``Millions of low-income Americans face the loss of \nhealth insurance or sharp cuts in benefits, like coverage for \nprescription drugs and dental care, under proposals now moving through \nstate legislatures around the country.''\n  The article continues, ``State officials and health policy experts \nsay the cuts will increase the number of uninsured, threaten recent \nprogress in covering children and impose severe strains on hospitals, \ndoctors and nursing homes.''\n  As a result, I believe the Federal Government should take immediate \nsteps to fundamentally reassert and reassert its role in helping the \nStates with this fiscal crisis and rising Medicaid costs, lowering the \nnumber of uninsured, and finally, confronting infant and maternal \nmortality and morbidity statistics that are unworthy of our great \nNation.\n  To address these issues, today and tomorrow, I will be introducing \nthree relevant bills. The first addresses the fiscal crisis confronting \nStates and the Medicaid program entitled ``Strengthening Our States,'' \nor the ``SOS Act.''\n  The second addresses our Nation's long-standing and growing crisis of \nthe uninsured that is entitled the ``Health Coverage, Affordability, \nResponsibility, and Equity Act'' or the ``Health CARE Act.''\n  The final bill takes on our Nation's high infant and mortality rates \nand is called the ``Start Healthy, Stay Health Act.''\n  First things first. In any campaign--whether in sports, business, or \npolitics--you have to have both offensive and defensive strategies. In \ntrying to reduce the number of uninsured in our country, we must first, \nas an emergency room doctor would, stop the bleeding. Therefore, our \nfirst priority should be to support and strengthen the Medicaid \nprogram.\n  Unfortunately, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated \nin March that as many as 1.7 million Americans could lose coverage \naltogether under proposals advanced by governors or adopted by State \nlegislative committees this year.\n  Therefore, I am introducing today with Senators Corzine, Clinton, \nKerry, Lautenberg, Dayton, and Johnson legislation entitled the \n``Strengthening Our States Act of 2003.'' This bill is a companion bill \nto that being introduced by Representative Dingell, Brown of Ohio, \nWaxman, and others and is aimed at improving Medicaid and providing \nsupport to States to enhance their ability to provide coverage to their \nuninsured residents in these difficult times.\n  The SOS Act uses a combination of approaches which: first, provide \nadditional Federal fiscal relief to States; second, provide additional \nflexibility to States in administering and improving the Medicaid \nprogram; and third, provide incentives and assistance to stave off cuts \nto existing coverage, and facilitate coverage expansions in the future.\n  The legislation will simplify Medicaid and enable States to \nstrengthen the program and stands in sharp contrast to the President's \nproposal to convert Medicaid into a block grant that would erode health \ninsurance coverage.\n  In fact, the Administration's prescription is the wrong medicine for \nthe wrong ailment. The Federal Government should be stepping up its \ncommitment to seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income \nchildren rather than stepping away and leaving States holding the bag.\n  First and foremost, our legislation acknowledges and reflects on the \nimportant role that Medicaid plays in our entire health care system. As \nDiane Rowland and Jim Tallon of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and \nthe Uninsured have noted: ``. . . it is hard to envision our health \nsystem and society without a program like Medicaid. Medicaid is the \nglue that helps hold our health system together and takes on the \nhighest-risk, sickest, and most expensive populations from private \ninsurance and Medicare. For low-income Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid \npicks\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nup Medicare premiums and some cost sharing as well as filling the gaps \nin coverage for long-term care services, prescription drugs, and vision \nand dental care.''\n  Medicaid addresses the failure of the marketplace to deliver \naffordable health coverage to our Nation's most fragile and vulnerable \ncitizens. However, there is no reason why it should also have to play \nthe role of picking up the slack of the Medicare program. A central \ntenet of our SOS proposal is for the Federal Government to begin taking \nthe steps to assume 100 percent of the costs associated with care and \nservices in Medicaid for Medicare beneficiaries, also known as dual \neligibles.\n  This, I would add, is in keeping with long-standing policy of the \nNational Governors' Association, or NGA, and is in sharp contrast to \nthe Administration's proposal to maintain the current Medicaid \nfinancing system for mandatory populations and services while block \ngranting care of optional populations and services to States. Who are \nthese optional populations? They are largely the elderly and people \nwith disabilities, many of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n\n  According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 83 \npercent of all Medicaid spending on the elderly is for either optional \npopulations or services, such as prescription drugs and long-term care. \nIn fact, according to Cindy Mann of Georgetown University and a former \nMedicaid director under the Clinton Administration, an estimated 35 \npercent of all State Medicaid costs are for so-called ``dual \neligibles.''\n  Therefore, rather than stepping up to the plate, the Administration \nis instead stepping away from its commitment to the elderly and \ndisabled, which should be our responsibility at the Federal level, by \nmoving these groups and their health care services into a block grant. \nGroups representing the elderly and disabled communities have already \nspoken out against this.\n  As AARP Executive Director and CEO Bill Novelli says, ``This \n[Administration's block grant] proposal handcuffs states because it \nleaves people more vulnerable in future years as States struggle to \nmeet increased needs with decreased dollars.''\n  The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities adds, ``The Bush \nAdministration proposal fails people with disabilities and dishonors \nthe Nation's commitment to its residents--it is not in the national \ninterest. . . . What the Medicaid program calls `optional' services \nare, in reality, mandatory disability services for the children and \nadults who need them. These services often are not only life-saving, \nbut also the key to a positive quality of life--something everyone in \nour nation deserves.''\n  Again, the Federal Government should be stepping up its commitment to \nseniors and people with disabilities rather than stepping away, as the \nPresident's proposal does.\n  With respect to the fiscal crisis facing states, the Administration \nhas long opposed fiscal relief to States as part of its economic \nstimulus package. Instead, the Administration points out that its \nMedicaid block grant proposal provides more funding up front to States, \nin the amount of $3.5 billion over one year and $12.7 billion over the \nfirst seven years to help States. But the proposal has strong elements \nof a typical bait and switch by yanking every dime of that money away \nstarting in 2011. Secretary Thompson noted at the press conference that \nhe would not be around at the time of the $12.7 billion in reductions \neight years from now and the plan clearly counts on the fact that most \nof this crop of governors would not be either.\n  However, that is exactly when our Nation's baby boomers hit \nretirement age in rapidly increasing numbers and the long term care \ncosts within Medicaid will significantly increase.\n  In sharp contrast, the SOS Act includes a temporary increase in the \nFederal matching assistance percentage, or FMAP, to state Medicaid \nprograms in the amount of $15 billion and another $15 billion in \nadditional aid to States--far more than the temporary $3 billion \noffered by the Administration.\n  Also, unlike a block grant, the current Medicaid matching rate is \nresponsive to States in times of recessions by providing Federal \nmatching funds to States for each additional person who becomes \neligible for Medicaid. Moreover, our SOS Act recognizes the formula can \nbe even more responsive by preserving coverage during difficult times \nand includes a General Accounting Office study of ways to make the \nformula more responsive to fiscal distress during either a national or \nState recession.\n  In addition, the Strengthening Our States Act would increase Federal \npayments for certain services critical for special populations or \nfederally-imposed services. It would provide enhanced Federal funding \nfor urban Indian health services, translation services, outstationed \nworkers, and reimbursement to health providers for emergency services \ndelivered undocumented individuals who are otherwise eligible for \nMedicaid. Again, the Administration's proposal simply block grants \nfunding for these services and steps away from its Federal \nresponsibility.\n  For example, services delivered to Native Americans by Indian Health \nService providers and health organizations are reimbursed at 100 \npercent federal match currently in recognition of the Federal \nresponsibility and role in delivering services to Native Americans \napart from States. Under a block grant, the Federal match is eliminated \nand the Federal role in providing care to Native Americans is \nabandoned. This is contrary to longstanding Federal policy and its \nrelationship with tribes and tribal organizations and to policy by the \nNational Governors' Association.\n  And finally, with respect to giving States flexibility and assistance \nto expand upon existing coverage options, the Strengthening Our States \nAct is far better and responsive to states than a block grant. Block \ngrants do not adjust for population changes, recessions, or efforts to \nexpand coverage by States. At its unveiling, Secretary Thompson spoke \nabout the added options the block grants offer States to expand \ncoverage. However, it does so with no new funding. This offer of \nflexibility is, therefore, illusory.\n  In fact, because Federal funding is capped for optional opulations by \nthe Administration's block grant, states cannot draw down additional \nFederal support when it chooses to expand coverage. Under current law \nand the SOS Act, they can. Some of the more ground-breaking efforts by \nstates such as those by Vermont, Washington, Minnesota, Rhode Island, \nHawaii, and even Wisconsin, would have likely never come to pass \nwithout that added Federal support.\n  Therefore, the SOS Act continues and expands upon that Federal \nsupport by giving States additional coverage options, such as to set \nuniform eligibility levels for families rather than covering parents \nand children separately. The SOS Act also would make States eligible \nfor enhanced matching funds to cover low-income working parents under \nMedicaid.\n  States should also beware of the Administration's promise of 9 \npercent growth rates for the next 10 years. Earlier this year, the \nHouse of Representatives passed a budget that would have reduced \nMedicaid spending by $92 billion over 10 years. While that was rejected \nin conference, such efforts become much easier under the rubric of a \nblock grant. Again, recent history contains many such promises and \nexamples.\n  For example, as the NGA policy on the Social Service Block Grant \nnotes, during passage of TANF, ``Congress and the Administration made a \ncommitment to Governors to fund SSBG at $2.38 billion each year through \nfiscal year 2002, with the funding increasing to $2.8 billion in fiscal \n2003 and each year thereafter.'' The reality is that funding has been \nreduced to $1.7 billion in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, 65 percent below \nthe promised funding levels.\n  There is an old saying, which goes, ``Fool me once, shame on you. \nFool me twice, shame on me.'' When members of Congress and future \nAdministrations see 9 percent growth rates in these Medicaid block \ngrants and have a particular tax cut, Medicare change, transportation \nprogram, or whatever they wish to fund, you can already hear them \nsaying, ``What if we just reduce the growth rates to 8 percent or 7 \npercent or 6 percent or 5 percent. . . .'' Well, we all can see where \nthis rapidly heads and we have all been fooled once before.\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\n  Some governors, including Secretary Thompson, seem to have a short \nmemory on these matters. On April 14, 1997, 41 Governors, including \nSecretary Thompson, Bush Administration Cabinet Members Tom Ridge, and \nChristine Todd Whitman, wrote President Clinton, and said: ``We \nadamantly oppose a cap on federal Medicaid spending in any form. \nUnilateral caps in federal Medicaid spending will result in cost shifts \nto states, enabling the federal government to balance its budget at the \nexpense of the states.''\n  What was true then remains true 6 years later.\n  Moreover, on behalf of the NGA, Governors Bob Miller of Nevada and \nMike Leavitt testified before the Senate Finance Committee and made the \nfollowing statement: ``. . . caps could result in states becoming \nsolely responsible for unexpected program costs, such as a loss in a \nlawsuit on reimbursement rates or the development of expensive new \ntherapies that drive up treatment costs beyond the federal allowable \nrate.\n  They added: ``. . . the cost shift resulting from a unilateral cap \nwould present states with a number of bad alternatives. States \nessentially would have to choose between cutting back on payment rates \nto providers, eliminating optional benefits provided to recipients, \nending coverage for optional beneficiaries, or coming up with \nadditional state funds to absorb 100 percent of the cost of services.''\n  I do not see why this needs to be an all-or-nothing proposition. Why \ndo we have to throw out the entire Medicaid financing structure, which \nbenefits States, beneficiaries, and providers, in order to grant States \nadditional flexibility to their programs?\n  In 1997, we rejected the all-or-nothing proposal and worked with the \nStates and gave them a package of added flexibility, including the \nability to enroll much of their Medicaid population in managed care \nwithout the need for a waiver.\n  Secretary Thompson talks a great deal about the flexibility the block \ngrant offers and cites the need to allow States the ability to move \npeople out of institutional settings into more appropriate home- and \ncommunity-based settings and is right. Under the block grant, States \nare only granted additional flexibility to do so if they accept a block \ngrant. In contrast, the SOS Act provides States an enhanced Federal \nmatching rate to provide home- and community-based services.\n  However, rather than saying to States that they can only do so \nthrough the acceptance of a block grant, why can't we provide them this \noption without the imposition of a Federal limit on funding? Both \nstates and beneficiary groups are asking for it and we can and should \nact.\n  It is on this point that I must add that the Medicaid program was not \ncreated for Federal officials or governors. We all clearly need to be \nreminded that there are other stakeholders in the Medicaid program, \nincluding the 43 million people served by the program.\n  As Alan Weil of the Urban institute and the former Medicaid director \nof the State of Colorado wrote in a recent article published in Health \nAffairs: ``If money is at the heart of debates over Medicaid, the \nmillions of indigent people whose varied and complex medical needs are \nmet by the program are its sole. The amount of human suffering the \nprogram alleviates is immense.''\n  As the Administration attempts to proceed on negotiations with the \ngovernors on a deal on block grants, let's not forget the children, \nmothers, seniors, and people with disabilities served by Medicaid. The \nSOS Act provides a far better alternative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1012\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nBingaman, Corzine, Lautenberg, Clinton, Kerry and Dayton, to introduce \nthe ``Strengthening Our States Act of 2003.'' I thank my colleagues for \njoining me in introducing this legislation that marks a first step in \nhelping States being to deal with the fiscal crisis many are now \nfacing.\n  These challenging economic times have forced many States to make \ntough decisions. Among areas affected, some States have had to start \ncutting benefits in their Medicaid programs in order to make ends meet. \nThe result is less access to care and poorer health for our most \nvulnerable populations including: low-income, minorities and the \nelderly. Many States are also struggling to meet the needs of a growing \nuninsured population which continues to worsen as more people lose \ntheir jobs.\n  So far, my home State of South Dakota has been one of the lucky ones. \nWe have not had to cut Medicaid program benefits to date and our fiscal \nhealth overall looks fairly good. I do not however have unrealistic \nexpectations that South Dakota is protected from the current economic \ndownturn and recognize that it is only a matter of time before my State \nexperiences the burden of our neighbors.\n  The Strengthening Our States Act or SOS Act provides several \nstrategies to address these issues by increasing coverage to the \nuninsured, providing flexibility in existing State Medicaid program and \nproviding States with assistance to avoid cuts to existing Medicaid \ncoverage. Our proposal will improve the Medicaid program without \nshifting costs to States as does the Bush Medicaid proposal which block \ngrants the program. I find it particularly troubling that in times when \nState governments across the country are being forced to reduce or \neliminate Medicaid services in order to save money, the Administration \nwould propose to limit the Federal Government's long-term \nresponsibility for the only kind of health program many Americans can \nafford.\n  This bill will provide temporary fiscal relief to States through a \n$30 billion increase in the Federal share of Medicaid payments or FMAP. \nUnlike the block grant program the Administration has proposed, our \nbill is responsive to the immediate State needs for financial support \nand will keep these important programs going. Other important bill \nprovisions include assistance with the costs of care of the elderly and \npeople with disabilities through 100 percent Federal financing of \nMedicare premiums and cost-sharing for low-income groups. The bill \nprovides States with new flexibility in administering Medicaid and will \nincrease access to care for many uninsured groups. It will also close \nseveral loopholes in existing law that prevent the disabled from \naccessing health care services while waiting to qualify for Medicare \ncoverage. Finally, it will provide increased access to home and \ncommunity based services for people with disabilities through mandatory \nwaivers for this type of care.\n  States are at their wits end trying to juggle new health care \npriorities. Between smallpox vaccination requirements, Severe Acute \nRespiratory Syndrome surveillance and increased numbers of uninsured \nindividuals, States are in great need of every bit of help we can \nprovide. Senator Daschle and other colleagues in the Senate just rolled \nout a tax cut proposal that recognizes the current fiscal situation \nexperienced in our States and this will provide important relief during \nthese challenging times.\n  The Strengthening Our States Act is a first step in supporting our \nstates and I hope additional steps will follow. By providing immediate \nMedicaid relief, we can ease some of the burden currently faced by many \nState governments and will hopefully prevent crises from erupting in \nothers that are working hard to just keep afloat. I urge the Senate to \nsupport this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1013. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \npermanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf in the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic planning \nareas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lautenberg, I \nam introducing legislation, the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism, COAST, \nAnti-Drilling Act, to ban oil and gas drilling off the Mid-Atlantic and \nNorthern Atlantic coast.\n  The people of New Jersey, and other residents of States along the \nAtlantic Coast, do not want oil or gas rigs anywhere near their \ntreasured beaches and fishing grounds. Such drilling poses serious \nthreats not to our environment, but to our economy, which depends \nheavily on tourism along our shore.\n  Until the Bush Administration came into office, there was no reason \nto suspect that drilling was even a remote\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\npossibility. Since 1982, a statutory moratorium on leasing activities \nin most Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, areas has been included annually \nin Interior Appropriations acts. In addition, President George H.W. \nBush declared a leasing moratorium on many OCS areas on June 26, 1990 \nunder section 12 of the OCS Lands Act. On June 12, 1998, President \nClinton used the same authority to issue a memorandum to the Secretary \nof the Interior that extended the moratorium through 2012 and included \nadditional OCS areas.\n  Given the long-standing consensus against drilling in these areas, I \nwas deeply disturbed to discover that on May 31, 2001, the Minerals \nManagement Service released a request for proposals, RFP, to conduct a \nstudy of the environmental impacts of drilling in the Mid- and North-\nAtlantic. The RFP noted that ``there are areas with some reservoir \npotential, for example off the coast of New Jersey.'' In addition, the \nRFP explained that the study would be conducted ``in anticipation of \nmanaging the exploitation of potential and proven reserves.'' I believe \nthat the RFP was not only inappropriate, but probably illegal, and I \nwas pleased when at my urging, the Administration rescinded.\n  But the Administration is at it again in the energy bill now before \nthe Senate. The bill contains provisions that direct the Department of \nInterior to inventory all potential oil and natural gas resources in \nthe entire Outer Continental Shelf, including areas off of the New \nJersey coast. The bill would allow the use of seismic surveys, dart \ncore sampling, and other exploration technologies, which could \nnegatively impact coastal and marine areas.\n  These provisions run directly counter to language that Congress has \nincluded annually in appropriations bills to prevent leasing, pre-\nleasing, and related activities in most areas of the Outer Continental \nShelf, including areas off the New Jersey coast.\n  In my view, it is time for Congress to act to resolve this question \nonce and for all. That is why I am introducing the COAST Anti-Drilling \nAct. This bill would permanently ban drilling for oil, gas and other \nminerals in the Mid- and North-Atlantic.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \nlegislation. Doing so would ensure the people of New Jersey and \nneighboring States that they need not fear the specter of oil rigs off \ntheir beaches. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS LEASING IN CERTAIN AREAS \n                   OF THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Prohibition of Oil and Gas Leasing in Certain Areas \n     of the Outer Continental Shelf.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section or any other law, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall not issue a lease for the exploration, \n     development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other \n     mineral in--\n       ``(1) the Mid-Atlantic planning area; or\n       ``(2) the North Atlantic planning area.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1014. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs in the management of health care services \nfor veterans to place certain low-income veterans in a higher health-\ncare priority category; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hillary \nRodham Clinton to change the way the Veterans' Administration defines \nlow-income veterans by taking into account variations in the cost of \nliving in different parts of the country. The Corzine-Clinton \nlegislation would make the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation just \nthat: Equitable.\n  More specifically, this bill would replace the national income \nthreshold for consideration in Priority Group 5--currently $24,000 for \nall parts of the country--with regional thresholds defined by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. This simple but far-\nreaching proposal would help low-income veterans across the country \nafford quality health care and ensure that Veterans Integrated Service \nNetworks or VISNs receive adequate funding to care for their distinct \nveteran populations.\n  Our Nation's veterans have made great sacrifics in defense of \nAmerican freedom and values, and we owe them a tremendous debt of \ngratitude. The United States Congress must ensure that all American \nveterans--veterans who have sweated in the trenches to defend liberty--\nhave access to quality health care.\n  In 1997, Congress implemented the Veterans Equitable Resource \nAllocation system, or VERA, to distribute medical care funding provided \nby the VA. The funding formula was established to better take into \naccount the costs associated with various veteran populations. \nUnfortunately, the VERA formula that was created fails to take into \naccount regional differences in the cost of living, a significant \nmetric in determining veteran healthcare costs. This oversight in the \nVERA formula dangerously shortchanges veterans living in regions with \nhigh costs of living and elevated healthcare expenses.\n  To allocate money to the Veterans Integrated Service Networks, VISNs, \nVERA divides veterans into eight priority groups. Veterans who have no \nservice-connected disability and whose incomes fall below $24,000 are \nconsidered low income and placed in Priority Group 5, while veterans \nwhose incomes exceed this national threshold and qualify for no other \nspecial priorities are placed in either Priority Group 7c or Priority \nGroup 8. VERA only reimburses the treating Medical Care facility for \nthe care that they provided to veterans in priority groups 1-5 and does \nnot provide any Federal reimbursement for the care provided to priority \ngroup 7 and 8 veterans.\n  Using a national threshold for determining eligibility as a low-\nincome veteran puts veterans living in high cost areas at a decided \ndisadvantage. In New Jersey, HUD's fiscal year 2002 standards for \nclassification as ``low-income'' exceed $24,000 per year in every \nsingle county. And some areas exceed the VA baseline by more than 50 \npercent. Similarly, HUD's ``low-income'' classification for New York \nCity is set at $35,150, and for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, at \n$40,150.\n  As a result, regions that have a high cost of living, like VISN 3, \nwhich encompasses substantial portions of New Jersey and New York, tend \nto have a reduced population of Priority Group 5 veterans and an \ninflated population of Priority Group 7c and 8 veterans.\n  The fundamental inequity of the VERA formula is apparent when you \nconsider the VERA allocations do not take into account the number of \nveterans classified in Priority Groups 7c and 8. Because of the costs \nassociated with these Priority Groups 7c and 8 veterans are not \nconsidered as part of the VERA allocation, and because high cost of \nliving areas have large populations of Priority Group 7c and 8 \nveterans, high cost regions must provide care to thousands of veterans \nwithout adequate funding.\n  This additional financial burden on VISNs with large populations of \nnon-reimbursable veterans in Priority Group 7c and 8 has had a \ntremendous impact on VISN 3. Since FY 1996, VISN 3 has experienced a \ndecline in revenue of 10 percent. As a result of the tremendous \nshortfall in the VISN 3 budget, the VA cannot move forward with plans \nto open clinics in various locations, including prospective clinics in \nMonmouth and Passaic Counties. Consequently, veterans in VISN 3 are \nforced to wait for unreasonably long periods to receive medical care \nand travel long distances to existing clinics, and those veterans who \nare able to access care are being treated in facilities operating under \ntremendous financial difficulty.\n  Furthermore, miscategorizing which vets quality as Priority Group 5 \nunjustifiably reduces access to medical care for thousands of veterans. \nUnder existing rules, veterans placed in Priority and Groups 7c and 8 \nmust provide a copayment to receive medical care at a VA medical \nfacility; Veterans placed in Priority Group 5 receive medical care free \nof charge. Under the existing\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nframework, low-income vets in high cost areas are often inappropriately \nplaced in Priority Groups 7c and 8, and are forced to provide a \ncopayment.\n  Recent studies by both the RAND Institute and the General Accounting \nOffice identify this flaw in the VERA formula and recommend a \ngeographic means test like the one provided in our legislation to \nimprove the allocation of resources under VERA. Such a test would \nensure that the VERA formula allocation better reflects the true costs \nof VA healthcare in the various VISNs in the United States.\n  Our legislation would make a simple adjustment to the VERA formula to \naccount for variations in the cost of living in different regions. The \nbill would help veterans in high cost areas afford VA health care and \nguarantee that VISNs across the country receive adequate compensation \nfor the care they provide.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Clinton and me in supporting \nthis important bill, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1014\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide \nentitlement to health care for reserve officers of the Armed Forces \npending orders to initial active duty following commissioning; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation \nentitled the ``Jesse Spiri Military Medical Coverage Act of 2003.'' The \npurpose of this legislation is to close a gap in medical coverage that \nleaves a certain group of military officers without health care \nbenefits. Named in honor of a young New Mexican who fell victim to this \ngap, this bill would extend coverage to commissioned officers who are \nawaiting active duty status.\n  Jesse Spiri grew up in the heart of southwestern New Mexico where his \nfamily instilled in him both a sense of patriotism and an appreciation \nfor higher education. Following his graduation from high school, he \nenrolled at Western New Mexico University where he served in the United \nStates Marine Corps Reserves. His dedication to each of these endeavors \nculminated on May 11, 2001 when he received both his bachelors degree \nand his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant. Clearly, Jesse had laid a solid \nfoundation for success in his life and, naturally, his family was \nextremely proud. Unfortunately, the pride and all the hopes that \naccompany such a crowning moment were short-lived, because one day \nafter his graduation Jesse was diagnosed with brain cancer.\n  Under any circumstances, such a prognosis is demoralizing, but \nJesse's situation was even more grave because receiving his commission \nhad the effect of triggering his military status to that of ``inactive \nreservist.'' Jesse was not scheduled to gain ``active duty'' status \nuntil he began basic officer training in November, and since TRICARE \ndoes not fully cover reservists, his family was left with the burden of \nenormous medical bills--a burden they simply could not meet.\n  Despite the heroic efforts of the Spiri family, inquiries by my staff \nand others in the New Mexico congressional delegation, as well as \nefforts by Marine Corps lawyers to find a legal solution to the \nproblem, Jesse Spiri, an officer of the United States Marine Corps, \nwent without health care coverage and, hence, without proper treatment. \nHe lost his battle with cancer in July of 2001.\n  It is inconceivable to me, as I am sure it is for all Americans, that \nbecause of a legislative quirk, an officer of the United States armed \nforces could be left completely exposed to a dread disease without even \nthe hope of receiving available treatments. But Jesse's battle is proof \nthat if we do not, through legislative enactment, extend full medical \ncoverage to commissioned reservists, another promising life may be lost \nin similar fashion.\n  I know that Jim Spiri, Jesse's dad, has vowed to dedicate his life to \nensuring that no family has to face what his experienced. This goal, \nhowever, should not take a lifetime to achieve. By passing the ``Jesse \nSpiri Military Medical Coverage Act of 2003,'' we can help give Jim and \nthe entire Spiri family peace in knowing that others will have hope \nwhere Jesse did not.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 10 and 18, United States Code, to \nprotect unborn victims of violence; read the first time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the recent nationwide publicity \nsurrounding the murder of 27-year-old Laci Peterson and her unborn son, \nConner, has renewed public concern about violence against the unborn--\nand rightfully so.\n  Not long ago, the bodies of Laci--who was eight months pregnant at \nthe time she disappeared--and Conner were discovered on a rocky \nshoreline of the San Francisco Bay. Baby Conner was found near his \nmother with his umbilical cord still attached.\n  Under California State law, intentionally killing a fetus is murder, \nand California prosecutors are seeking to bring separate murder charges \nin the deaths of Laci Peterson and her unborn son. But, I want make it \nvery clear to my colleagues here in the Senate that the murder charge \nthat California prosecutors will bring for the death of Laci's son \nwould not be permitted if that crime were being prosecuted under \ncurrent Federal law. And that--that is why we need to pass and get \nsigned into law the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. Let me explain.\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\n  In about half the States today, 26, if you commit a crime of violence \nagainst a pregnant woman and her unborn baby dies, you can be punished \nfor the violence against both the mother and the unborn child. But, \ntragically, if you commit a Federal crime of violence against a \npregnant woman and her baby dies, the death of the unborn child could \nessentially go unpunished. Examples of such Federal crimes of violence \nwould include kidnapping across State lines, drug-related drive-by \nshootings, or assaults on Federal property.\n  This gap in the law leads to glaring injustices. It is time that we \nclose this gap once and for all and let justice wrap its arms around \nour society's most vulnerable members.\n  That is why, it is imperative that we pass the Unborn Victims of \nViolence Act--once and for all. Today, along with several of my \ndistinguished colleagues--Senators Graham of South Carolina, Hatch, \nBrownback, Santorum, Kyl, Voinovich, McCain, Ensign, Enzi, Inhofe, \nNickles, Bunning, Coleman, Chambliss, Grassley, Fitzgerald, Shelby, and \nTalent--we are re-introducing our legislation. This is the fourth time \nthat I have introduced this bill--in fact, it was the first piece of \nlegislation that I introduced at the start of the 108th Congress. This \nbill is strongly supported by President Bush, and a companion measure \npassed the House of Representatives in two previous Congresses. I \nintend to take procedural steps that would make this bill eligible to \nbe taken up directly by the Senate, without further Committee action.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this effort, and would \nlike to recognize especially Senator Graham of South Carolina, who \nchampioned this issue on the House side before joining us in the \nSenate. He has worked tirelessly to see to it that the most vulnerable \nare protected. I also would like to thank our lead House sponsors--\nCongresswoman Melissa Hart from Pennsylvania and my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Congressman Steve Chabot. They, too, are working \ntirelessly to get this bill passed by the other Chamber and signed into \nlaw.\n  Our bill would establish new criminal penalties for anyone injuring \nor killing a fetus while committing certain Federal offenses. \nSpecifically, this bill would make any murder or injury of an unborn \nchild during the commission of certain existing Federal crimes a \nseparate crime under Federal law and the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice. Twenty-six, 26, States already have criminalized the killing \nor injuring of unborn victims during a crime.\n  We live in a violent world. And sadly, sometimes--perhaps more often \nthan we realize--even unborn babies are the targets, intended or \notherwise, of violent acts. We have to protect these innocent victims. \nI'd like to share some disturbing examples with my colleagues of \nsituations where the deaths of unborn children would have gone \nunpunished but for the existence of State criminal laws. If these same \ncrimes would have occurred in the 24 States today that don't have such \nState laws, justice would not have been served, because there is simply \nno Federal law in place to try these crimes.\n  First, let me talk about the example of Airman Gregory Robbins. In \n1996, Airman Robbins and his family were stationed in my home State of \nOhio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. At that time, Mrs. \nRobbins was more than eight months pregnant with a daughter they named \nJasmine. On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, Airman Robbins \nwrapped his fist in a T-shirt and savagely beat his wife by striking \nher repeatedly about the head and abdomen. Fortunately, Mrs. Robbins \nsurvived the violent assault. Tragically, however, her uterus ruptured \nduring the attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal cavity, \ncausing Jasmine's death.\n  Air Force prosecutors sought to prosecute Airman Robbins for \nJasmine's death, but neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor \nthe Federal code makes criminal such an act that results in the death \nor injury of an unborn child. The only available Federal offense was \nfor the assault on the mother. This was a case in which the only \navailable Federal penalty did not fit the crime. So prosecutors \nbootstrapped the Ohio unborn victims law to convict Airman Robbins of \nJasmine's death. Fortunately, upon appeal, the court upheld the lower \ncourt's ruling.\n  If it hadn't been for the Ohio law that was already in place, there \nwould have been no opportunity to prosecute and punish Airman Robbins \nfor the assault against Baby Jasmine. That's why we need a Federal \nremedy to avoid having to bootstrap State laws to provide recourse when \na violent act occurs during the commission of a Federal crime. A \nFederal remedy will ensure that crimes within Federal jurisdiction \nagainst unborn victims are punished.\n  Let me give you another example. In August 1999, Shiwona Pace of \nLittle Rock, AK, was days away from giving birth. She was thrilled \nabout her pregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, however, did not \nshare her joy and enthusiasm. In fact, Eric wanted the baby to die. So, \nhe hired three thugs to beat his girlfriend so badly that she lost the \nunborn baby. According to Shiwona, who testified at a Senate Judiciary \nhearing we held in Washington on February 23, 2000:\n\n       I begged and pleaded for the life of my unborn child, but \n     they showed me no mercy. In fact, one of them told me, ``Your \n     baby is dying tonight.'' I was choked, hit in the face with a \n     gun, slapped, punched, and kicked repeatedly in the stomach. \n     One of them even put a gun in my mouth and threatened to \n     shoot.\n\n  In this particular case, just a few short weeks before this vicious \nattack, Arkansas passed its ``Fetal Protection Act.'' Under the State \nlaw, Erik Bullock was convicted on February 9, 2001, of capital murder \nagainst Shiwona's unborn child and sentenced to life in prison without \nparole. He was also convicted of first-degree battery for harm against \nShiwona.\n  In yet another example--this one in Columbus--16-year-old Sean Steele \nwas found guilty of two counts of murder for the death of his \ngirlfriend Barbara ``Bobbie'' Watkins, age 15, and her 22-week-old, \nunborn child. He was convicted under Ohio's unborn victims law, which \nrepresented the first murder conviction in Franklin County, OH, in \nwhich a victim was a fetus.\n  Ultimately, the fact is that it is just plain wrong that our Federal \nGovernment does absolutely nothing to criminalize violent acts against \nunborn children. We cannot allow criminals to get away with murder. We \nmust close this loophole.\n  As a civilized society, we must take a stand against violent crimes \nagainst children--especially those waiting to be born. We must close \nthis loophole.\n  We purposely drafted this legislation very narrowly. Because of that, \nour bill would not permit the prosecution for any abortion to which a \nwoman consented. It would not permit the prosecution of a woman for any \naction, legal or illegal, in regard to her unborn child. Our \nlegislation would not permit the prosecution for harm caused to the \nmother or unborn child in the course of medical treatment. And finally, \nour bill would not allow for the imposition of the death penalty under \nthis Act.\n  This is about making sure justice is done when a pregnant woman is \nattacked. And ultimately, I think that everyone in this Chamber would \nagree that people who violently attack unborn babies should be \npunished. When acts of violence against unborn victims fall within \nfederal jurisdiction, we must have a penalty. We have an obligation to \nour unborn children who cannot speak for themselves. I think Shiwona \nPace said it best she testified at our hearing: ``The loss of any \npotential life should never be in vain.''\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join in support of this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1019\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Causing death of or bodily injury to unborn child.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nintroduction of S. 119, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2003. I \napplaud Senators DeWine and Lindsey Graham for their longstanding and \nessential leadership on this issue in the Senate and the House. The \nimportance of this issue is made tragically clear by the recent murder \nof Laci Peterson and her unborn son, Conner.\n  In my home State of Utah, if a criminal assaults or kills a woman who \nis pregnant and thereby causes death or injury to the unborn child, the \ncriminal faces the possibility of being prosecuted for having taken or \ninjured that unborn life. Twenty-five additional States have similar \nlaws on the books. Eleven of those States recognize the unborn child as \na victim throughout the entire period of prenatal development. This is \nonly proper and, it seems to me, only just.\n  But under existing Federal criminal statutes, if a criminal assaults \nor kills a woman who is pregnant and thereby causes death or injury to \nthat unborn child, the criminal faces no consequences in our Federal \ncriminal justice system for taking or injuring that innocent, unborn \nlife. This is wrong and it is not justified.\n  This bill fixes the gap in Federal law by making it a separate \nFederal offense to kill or injure an unborn child during the commission \nof certain already-defined Federal crimes committed against the unborn \nchild's mother. This bill does not usurp jurisdiction over States that \ndo not currently have laws that protect unborn victims of violence. It \nonly applies to Federal crimes.\n  I cannot imagine why anyone would oppose this bill. The only reason \nfor opposition that I can suppose is that some in the pro-choice \nmovement believe that our bill draws attention to the effort to \ndehumanize, desensitize, and depersonalize the unborn child. Given the \npolitical and legal arguments of abortion supporters, it may be \ndifficult for them to concede an unborn child is human and therefore a \nvictim of a crime.\n  Nevertheless, it is not our intention in this bill to turn the debate \ninto a battle on abortion. In no way does this bill interfere with the \nability of a woman to have an abortion under current law. The bill \nspecifically does not apply to a woman who engages in any action, legal \nor illegal, in regard to her unborn child. Therefore, it would not \napply to any abortion to which a woman consents. In my view, we should \nall be able to support this modest effort to protect mothers and their \nunborn children.\n  Some will try to claim that this bill weakens domestic violence laws \nby diverting attention to the unborn. That is simply not true. I am a \nstrong supporter of domestic violence laws in this Nation. I believe \ndomestic violence is an evil plague that needs to be stopped.\n  For nearly 15 years, I have worked hard on the issue of domestic \nviolence and violence against women. And when I stand here today before \nthe entire United States Senate and offer my support for a bill, I \ncertainly make sure that bill does not diminish in any way our capacity \nand will to curb domestic violence and protect women. This bill, in \nfact, strengthens domestic violence laws by making it a separate \ncriminal offense under our Federal legal system to cause death or \ninjury to an unborn child as a result of violence.\n  For several months now, the Nation has watched in the media the \nunfortunate and tragic story of Laci Peterson. She was an expectant \nmother from California who mysteriously vanished shortly before \nChristmas. In mid-April, her decomposing body and the body of her \nunborn child washed ashore at a San Francisco-area beach.\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\n  The Nation has witnessed a community in mourning over the \ndisappearance and death of Laci Peterson and her unborn son, Conner. \nLaci Peterson was the truly tragic victim of violence that not only \ntook her life but also the innocent life of her unborn son. This is a \ntruly devastating story, especially for those who knew and loved Laci \nPeterson and eagerly awaited the birth of her son Conner. I want to do \nwhat I can to see that justice is served if there is ever a case \nsimilar to this that comes before our Federal judicial system, and that \nis why I support this measure.\n  A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll conducted on April 22 and 23 \nindicated that of the 900 registered voters polled, 49 percent \nconsidered themselves pro-choice while only 41 percent said they are \npro-life. But what is even more interesting is this same poll showed 84 \npercent believed Scott Peterson should be charged with two counts of \nhomicide for murdering his wife and unborn son. California law permits \ncriminals to be charged with murder for killing an unborn child when it \nhas developed past the embryonic stage.\n  Now remember, the majority of those polled in this survey said they \nwere pro-choice. But the tragic murder of an innocent, unborn child is \nshocking and twisted enough that, regardless of any stance on abortion, \nthe vast majority of Americans strongly believe an unborn life taken in \nmurder should result in murder charges brought against the perpetrator. \nIt is only fair and just to ask for our Federal judicial system to \nincorporate such a strong desire of the American people.\n  Some will try to confuse the issue here. Let me be clear, the debate \non this bill is not about abortion--far from it. It does not affect \ncurrent law regarding abortion. This bill does not in any way interfere \nwith or weaken domestic violence laws or laws intended to prevent \nviolence against women. This is a simple remedy to a terrible crime. I \nhope that Congress will seriously consider this bill and promptly pass \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Alexander, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1023. A bill to increase the annual salaries of justices and \njudges of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address the serious matter of the \nerosion of pay for the Federal judiciary. There is consensus among all \nwho have seriously looked at this issue that the independence and \nquality of the judiciary is at risk because of the inadequacy of the \ncurrent salaries of Federal judges.\n  The American Bar Association and Federal Bar Association issued a \nreport on this issue in February 2001. That report documented the \nfactors impacting erosion of judicial pay and the detrimental effects \non the judiciary. Because of the withholding of cost-of-living \nadjustments, the impact of inflation, and the insufficient attempts to \nstabilize judicial pay, Federal judges are increasingly choosing to \nresign or retire. Furthermore, the report noted, the prospect of a \ndeclining salary in real terms also discourages potential candidates \nfrom seeking appointments to the bench.\n  In his 2002 Year-End Report, Supreme Court Chief Justice William \nRehnquist identified the need to increase judicial pay as the most \npressing issue facing the judiciary. He highlighted his concern that \nsalaries of Federal judges have not kept pace with those of lawyers in \nprivate firms and in business. He observed, ``Inadequate compensation \nseriously compromises the judicial independence fostered by life \ntenure. That low salaries might force judges to return to the private \nsector rather than stay on the bench risks affecting judicial \nperformance--instead of serving for life, those judges would serve the \nterms their finances would allow, and they would worry about what \nawaits them when they return to the private sector.''\n  In the Report of the National Commission on the Public Service, \nissued January 2003, the Chairman of the Commission, Paul Volker, made \nthis observation: ``Judicial salaries are the most egregious example of \nthe failure of Federal compensation policies. Federal judicial salaries \nhave lost 24 percent of their purchasing power since 1969, which is \narguably inconsistent with the Constitutional provision that judicial \nsalaries may not be reduced by Congress. . . . The lag in judicial \nsalaries has gone on too long, and the potential for diminished quality \nin American jurisprudence is now too large.'' Accordingly, the \nCommission made the recommendation that Congress should grant an \nimmediate and significant increase in judicial, executive and \nlegislative salaries to ensure a reasonable relationship to other \nprofessional opportunities.\n  Responding to this report and recommendation, the Judicial \nConference, at its recent meeting, unanimously adopted a Resolution \nwhich contains in part the following:\n\n       ``Whereas, the President at the request of the Chief \n     Justice has agreed to support legislation that would increase \n     judicial salaries by 16.5 percent, which will yield an \n     average of $24,948, across all levels of judicial offices;\n       Now therefore, the Committee on the Judicial Branch \n     recommends that the Judicial Conference endorse and \n     vigorously seek legislation that would increase judicial \n     salaries by 16.5 percent, which will yield an average of \n     $24,948, across all levels of judicial offices.''\n\n  Today, Senator Leahy and I, joined by Senator Cornyn, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Alexander, Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, and \nSenator Chambliss are introducing a bill that will restore the lost \ncost-of-living adjustments which were denied to the judiciary and will \nhelp reduce the gap between Federal judicial salaries and private \nsector salaries which still remains.\n  This legislation enacts a 16.5 percent increase in the salaries of \nthe justices of the Supreme Court and other Federal judges appointed \nunder Article III of the Constitution, an average salary increase of \nabout $25,000. It does so without altering the respective provisions of \ntitle 28, United States Code, which defines their salary rates. The pay \nadjustment would be effective with the first pay period beginning on or \nafter January 1, 2004, and would be applied before any annual salary \nadjustment authorized under the Employment Cost Index approval \nmechanism provided by 28 U.S.C. Sec.  461.\n  The judicial officers enumerated in this bill to receive the 16.5 \npercent pay increase are the Chief Justice of the United States, \nassociate justices of the Supreme Court, United States circuit judges, \nUnited States district judges, and judges of the United States Court of \nInternational Trade. In addition, this legislation would have the \neffect of increasing salaries of the judges of the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims, bankruptcy judges and full-time United States \nmagistrate judges whose salaries are related to the rate of pay of \nUnited States district judges.\n  This legislation will do much to improve retention on the bench and \nwill aid in the recruitment of outstanding judicial candidates. I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senator Leahy, Senator Cornyn, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Alexander, Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator Chambliss \nand me in this bipartisan measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judicial Conference Resolution, as \nwell as the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Judicial Branch Committee Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in January 2003, the National Commission on the \n     Public Service declared that ``Congress should grant an \n     immediate and significant increase in judicial, executive, \n     and legislative salaries to ensure a reasonable relationship \n     to other professional opportunities;'' and\n       Whereas, the National Commission also declared that \n     ``[j]udicial salaries are the most egregious example of the \n     failure of federal compensation policies''; and\n       Whereas, the National Commission found that ``that the lag \n     in judicial salaries has gone on too long, and the potential \n     for the diminished quality in American jurisprudence is now \n     too large''; and\n       Whereas, the National Commission recommended that Congress' \n     and the President's ``first priority should . . . be an \n     immediate and substantial increase in judicial salaries''; \n     and\n       Whereas, the President at the request of the Chief Justice \n     has agreed to support legislation that would increase \n     judicial salaries by 16.5 percent, which will yield an \n     average of $24,948 across all levels of judicial offices;\n       Now therefore, the Committee on the Judicial Branch \n     recommends that the Judicial Conference endorse and \n     vigorously seek legislation that would increase judicial \n     salaries\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\n     by 16.5 percent, which will yield an average of $24,948, \n     across all levels of judicial offices.\n\n                                S. 1023\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JUDICIAL SALARY INCREASE.\n\n       The annual salaries of the Chief Justice of the United \n     States, associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States, United States circuit judges, United States district \n     judges, judges of the United States Court of International \n     Trade, and judges of the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims are increased in the amount of 16.5 percent of their \n     respective existing annual salary rates, rounded to the \n     nearest $100 (or, if midway between multiples of $100, to the \n     next higher multiple of $100).\n\n     SEC. 2. COORDINATION RULE.\n\n       If a pay adjustment under section 1 is to be made for an \n     office or position as of the same date that any other pay \n     adjustment would take effect for such office or position, the \n     adjustment under this Act shall be made first.\n\n     SEC. 3.
