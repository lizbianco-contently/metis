Mr. President, I rise today to start what I hope will be \nconstructive debate on my amendment, S.J. Res. 40, the marriage \namendment, which states:\n\n        Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n   Before making my formal comments I would also like to express my \nsincere gratitude to my colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment. \nIt has taken countless hours of study and discussion to get to this \npoint and each of our cosponsors has shown courage and commitment to \nprotecting marriage.\n   I would like to express my appreciation to the majority leader for \nhis commitment and leadership. Without the support of Senate \nleadership, the public may never have had an opportunity to address \nthis vitally important issue in a democratic body.\n   I also thank President Bush for his early commitment to the \nprinciples embodied in this amendment. Marriage, the union between a \nman and a woman, has been the foundation of every civilization in human \nhistory. The definition of marriage crosses all bounds of race, \nreligion, culture, political party, ideology, and ethnicity. Marriage \nis embraced and intuitively understood to be what it is. Marriage is a \nunion between a man and a woman.\n   As an expression of this cultural value, the definition of marriage \nis incorporated into the very fabric of civic policy. It is the root \nfrom which families, communities, and government are grown. Marriage is \nthe one bond on which all other bonds are built.\n   This is not some controversial ideology being forced upon an \nunwilling populace by the Government. It is in fact the opposite. \nMarriage is the ideal held by the people and Government has long \nreflected this. The broadly embraced union of a woman and a man is \nunderstood to be the ideal union from which people live and children \nbest blossom and thrive.\n   As we have heard in hours upon hours of testimony in various Senate \ncommittees over the last 2 years, marriage is a pretty good thing. A \ngood marriage facilitates a more stable community, allows kids to grow \nup with fewer difficulties, increases the lifespan and quality of life \nof those involved, reduces the likelihood of incidences of chemical \nabuse and violent crime, and contributes to the overall health of the \nfamily. It is no wonder so many single adults long to be married, to \nraise kids, and to have families branching out in every direction.\n  Today there are numerous efforts to redefine marriage to be something \nthat it isn't. When it comes to same-gender couples there is a problem \nof definition. Two women or two men simply do\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\nnot meet the criteria for marriage as it has been defined for thousands \nof years. Marriage is, as it always has been, a union between a man and \na woman. American society has come to recognize the stability and \ncommitment of same-gender couples in a way unimaginable in many other \ncountries. In some State's partnership laws and civil union statutes \nhave been created--contractual bonds among same-gender couples--to \nsymbolize and codify these relationships. Some cities and States have \nelected to express this legal recognition while others have not. Some \nemployers extend benefits to same-gender partners while others do not. \nIn virtually every town and city, America's tolerance and respect for \ndiversity is second to none in the world. I believe that our democracy \ncontinually, systemically expresses these values.\n  Marriage, however, is what it is. It is a union between a man and a \nwoman. Gays and lesbians are entitled to the same legal protections as \nany one else. Gays and lesbians have the right to live the way they \nwant to. But they do not have the right to redefine marriage.\n  I believe the Framers of the Constitution felt that this would never \nbe an issue, and if they had it would have been included in the U.S. \nConstitution. Like the vast majority of Americans it would have never \noccurred to me that the definition of marriage, or marriage itself, \nwould be the source of controversy. A short time ago it would have been \nwholly inconceivable that this definition--this institution that is \nmarriage--would be challenged, redefined, or attacked. But we are here \ntoday because it is.\n  Traditional marriage is under assault. I say assault because the move \nto redefine marriage is taking place not through democratic processes \nsuch as State legislatures or the Congress or ballot initiatives around \nthe Nation. This assault is taking place in our courts and often in \ndirect conflict with the will of the people, State statute, Federal \nstatute, and even State constitutions.\n  Activists and lawyers have devised a strategy to use the courts to \nredefine marriage. This strategy is a clear effort to override public \nopinion and the long standing composition of traditional marriage and \nto force same-sex marriage on society.\n  Over the course of the last 10 years, traditional marriage laws have \nbeen challenged in courts across the Nation. Alaska, Arizona, \nCalifornia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, \nNebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, \nVermont, Washington, and West Virginia have all seen traditional \nmarriage challenged in court. Cases are pending today in 11 of those \nStates. But this is not a strategy based on tilting at windmills. It is \na strategy that has been employed with a good deal of success.\n\n  The first success in this legal strategy was in Vermont in 1999. The \nVermont State Supreme Court ordered State legislators to either \nlegalize same-sex marriage or create civil unions. The second, and to \ndate the most widely covered success in the effort to destroy \ntraditional marriage, came more recently in the State of Massachusetts \nwhere four judges forced the entire State to give full marriage \nlicenses to same-sex couples.\n  This edict came despite the fact that the populace of Massachusetts \nopposed this redefinition of marriage and despite the fact that no law \nhad ever been democratically passed to authorize such a radical shift \nin public policy. Proponents of same-sex marriage have shopped \ncarefully for the right venues, exploited the legal system, and today \nstand ready to overturn any and all democratically crafted Federal or \nState statute that would stand between them and a new definition of \nhumanity's oldest institution.\n  The question of process is very important in this debate--it is in \nfact the very heart of this debate. While recent court decisions handed \ndown by activist judges may not respect the traditional definition of \nmarriage, these decisions also highlight a lack of respect for the \ndemocratic process. No State legislature has passed legislation to \nredefine the institution of marriage. Not one.\n   Any redefinition of marriage has been driven entirely by the body of \ngovernment that remains unaccountable and unelected--the courts.\n   Many colleagues do not feel we should be talking about marriage in \nthe Senate. I say we must. Our government is a three-branch government. \nThe Congress is the branch that represents the people most directly. We \nhave a duty to, at the very least, discuss the state of marriage in \nAmerica. If we do not take this up, if we do not overcome procedural \nhurdles and objections we abdicate our responsibility. We will allow \nthe courts sole dominion on the state and future of marriage. This \nSenate, the world's most deliberative body, must provide a democratic \nresponse to the courts.\n   Legislatures across the country have joined Congress in recent years \nin affirming a 1996 law called the Defense of Marriage Act--DOMA. DOMA \ndefines marriage at the Federal level as a union between a man and a \nwoman and essentially prohibits one State from forcing its will on \nanother on the question of marriage. This bipartisan legislation passed \nwith the support of more than three-quarters of the House of \nRepresentatives and with the support of 85 Senators before being signed \ninto law by then-President Bill Clinton. To date 38 States have enacted \nstatutes defining marriage in some manner, and 4 States have passed \nState constitutional amendments defining marriage as a union of one man \nand one woman. These State DOMAs and constitutional amendments, \ncombined with Federal DOMA, should have settled the question as to the \ndemocratic expression of the will of the American public. As I outlined \nbefore, these laws--these expressions of the public--have been ignored \nby the activist courts.\n   State court challenges in Massachusetts or Vermont or Maryland may \nseem well and good to those concerned with the rights of States to \ndetermine most matters, a position near and dear to my heart. These \nchallenges, however, have spawned greater disrespect, even contempt, \nfor the will of the other States than any of us could have predicted. \nIt seems to me that there are long-term implications for both Federal \nDOMA and the rights of States to define unions through either state \nDOMA or the State constitutional amendment process. It is clear to me \nthat we are headed to judicially mandated recognition of same-gender \ncouples regardless of State or Federal Statute.\n   The same-sex marriage proponents achieved some success in Vermont \nand Massachusetts by forcing the hand of those States' legislatures.\n  The national effort to redefine marriage has also been buoyed by \ndecisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 2003 the Court \ninferred that a right to same-sex marriage could be found in the U.S. \nConstitution in Lawrence v. Texas. A variety of experts, including \nJustice Scalia and Harvard Professor Lawrence Tribe, forecast that this \ndecision points to the end of traditional marriage laws--including \nFederal and State DOMAs. The Massachusetts court relied heavily on the \nLawrence decision to strike down the State's traditional marriage law \nin that Goodridge case. The court further specifically threatened and \nquestioned the validity of DOMA and traditional marriage laws around \nthe Nation.\n  When Goodridge took effect on May 17 of this year, same-sex couples \nbecame entitled to Massachusetts marriage licenses.\n  In anticipation of Goodridge, a handful of local officials in New \nYork, California, and Oregon began issuing licenses to same sex couples \nin February and March. To date, through the combined efforts of lawless \nlocal officials and those licenses issued in Massachusetts, couples \nfrom at least 46 State shave received licenses in those jurisdictions \nand returned to their home States. These 46-plus States are State and \nFederal DOMA challenges just waiting to happen. A couple will file for \nrecognition--sue for recognition--under the full faith and credit \nclause. What we know about the Lawrence decision, that all traditional \nmarriage laws are unconstitutional, dooms those State DOMAs.\n  There is a case pending in Seattle today to force recognition of an \nOregon marriage license. More of these cases are expected and we look \nforward to nothing less than a patchwork of marriage laws, crafted by \njudges and forced on to one State from another outside the democratic \nprocess, regardless of the will of the voters.\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\n  It is important to highlight what is going on in the State of \nNebraska where an even more odious turn of events is unfolding. \nNebraskans passed a State constitutional amendment, defining marriage \nas a union between a man and a woman, that passed with 70 percent of \nthe vote. The ACLU and the Lambda Legal Foundation are now suing \nNebraska in a Federal court to undo the will of the voters.\n  According to testimony in the Senate Judiciary Constitution \nSubcommittee, Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning, whose office moved \nto dismiss the case and was denied, the language in the court's order \nsignals that Nebraska will very likely lose the case at trial. I find \nit chilling that the will of an entire State, expressed democratically, \nmay be undone by a Federal judge in an unelected position and tenured \nfor life.\n  So we find ourselves here today, seeking to debate an amendment to \nthe United States Constitution that reads in its entirety as follows:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor \n     the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require \n     that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred \n     upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  Our amendment defines marriage as it has been defined for thousands \nof years in hundreds of cultures around the world. This text further \ndefines that any establishment or nonestablishment of civil unions or \npartnership laws be created democratically, by the States themselves, \nand not by courts.\n  I have said it time and time again and I say here today for the \nrecord, the amendment does not seek to prohibit in any way the lawful, \ndemocratic creation of civil unions. It does not prohibit private \nemployers from offering benefits to same-gender partners. It denies no \nexisting rights.\n  What our amendment does is to define and protect traditional marriage \nat an appropriate level, the highest possible level--the Constitution. \nImportantly, the consideration of this amendment in the Senate \nrepresents the discussion of marriage in America in a democratic body \nof elected officials. This is something too long denied this important \ntopic.\n  I have heard from those who claim this amendment discriminates \nagainst people; that the very definition of marriage is somehow a tool \nfor oppression.\n  To those who believe that our marriage protection amendment is \ndiscriminatory, I ask them this: Do you truly believe that marriage, \nthe traditional and foundational union between a man and a woman, is \ndiscrimination? Is it discrimination to hold as ideal that a child \nshould have both a mother and a father?\n  It is important to make clear that on the question of federalism and \nStates' rights, I stand where I always have. While an indisputable \ndefinition of marriage will be a part of our Constitution, all other \nquestions will be left to the states. Gregory Coleman, former Solicitor \nGeneral of the State of Texas, testified before the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution last September and made the following \nstatement on this matter:\n\n       Some have objected to a proposed constitutional amendment \n     on federalism grounds. These concerns are misplaced. The \n     relationship between the states and the Federal government is \n     defined by the Constitution and, a fortiori, a constitutional \n     amendment cannot violate principles of federalism and States' \n     rights.\n       A federal constitutional amendment is perhaps the most \n     democratic of all processes--because it requires ratification \n     by three-fourths of the states--and simply does not raise \n     federalism concerns. The real danger to States' rights comes \n     from the recognition of unenumerated constitutional rights in \n     which the states have had no participation.\n\n  I share those sentiments and cannot express them any more clearly. We \nstand today at the commencement of the most democratic, most federalist \nprocess in all our government. Those around the country who have \nwatched as activist courts have wildly disregarded these principles I \nsay to you, watch the Senate; watch the House of Representatives, watch \nyour elected officials and see where they stand on this most important \ndebate.\n  This body and that on the other side of the Capitol represent the \nAmerican people more fully and completely than any other and it is time \nwe make this discussion truly national and truly democratic.\n  Those serving in the Congress understand that there is a great deal \nof emotion on both sides of this issue, and not every one of us will \nagree on this matter. It is my hope that we can agree that in matters \nconcerning marriage, the most fundamental of all social institutions, \nthis debate can not take place exclusively in the courts. The \ndemocratic process compels this Congress to discuss marriage and what \nis taking place--the judicial redefinition of marriage.\n  Marriage, the union between a man and a woman, has been the \nfoundation of every civilization in human history. This definition of \nmarriage crosses all bounds of race, religion, culture, political \nparty, ideology, and ethnicity. It is not about politics or \ndiscrimination, it is about marriage and democracy. It is incumbent \nupon us to remember that and to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Allard for his willingness \nto change and clarify the proposal he makes today so that it leaves \nopen to the States the elbow room that is appropriate to define legal \nrights for nontraditional families, gays and lesbians, and others.\n  It is a fact that sociologists say marriage, as we have traditionally \nknown and practiced it, is the ideal circumstance for the creation and \nrearing and nurturing of children. But it is a fact that not all \nchildren have the opportunity of a family with a mother and a father, \nthough what marriage does as a legal institution is to say to children \nhere and those yet unborn that there is a legal framework in which they \ncan enjoy protection and have the society of a mother and a father.\n  It is clear as we wrestle with this sensitive issue, it is clear to \nthe conscience of the American people that boys and girls need moms and \ndads. Not all get them, but the law has provided a framework for it. \nThose children who do not have it should also enjoy legal protections \nnot unlike those that are enjoyed in the institution of marriage.\n  In all the time that I have been a U.S. Senator, I have been an \nadvocate of gay rights. Yet throughout that time I also have believed \nit right to defend traditional marriage. I have tried hard to be clear, \nconsistent, and careful about this issue and this debate. I know my \nposition as being for gay rights but for traditional marriage is a \ndisappointment to many of my gay and lesbian friends.\n  I also note for the record I get little credit from the right because \nI do advocate for many gay rights. Indeed, the other night on his radio \nprogram, Dr. James Dobson said to a national audience, which included \nmany Oregonians, that I was not going to vote for traditional marriage. \nI wish he hadn't done that. I believe that is a form of bearing false \nwitness because I have been clear and I have been consistent on this \npoint. He may owe me no apology, but I wish he would make it clear to \nmy constituents.\n  I make no apology for supporting many of the needs of gay and lesbian \nAmericans. Issues of public safety, housing, employment, benefits: \nthese are rights that we take for granted, rights which many of them \nhave felt out of reach. So I have believed it is not just right to \nadvocate for these things but it even be a part of my belief system to \nadvocate for those who are oppressed and to show tolerance by helping \nthose in need. Matthew Shephard comes to mind, and many others who have \nsuffered hate crimes against them in the most vicious of fashion. I \nthink our society is changing its heart on these issues in ways that \nAmericans want to be tolerant, they want to be careful, they want to \nsay to gays and lesbians that we love you, we include you, we care \nabout you.\n  But in saying that, I think many feel intuitively to be careful on \nthe issue of marriage. Marriage is a word. Words have meaning. Few \nwords have more meaning to our culture and our future and our \ncivilization than marriage because marriage ultimately is about more \nthan just consenting adults. It is about the natural rearing and \nnurturing of children, preparing them for citizenship under the most \nideal circumstances possible.\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\n  Senator Robert Byrd often comes to this Chamber, and I love it when \nhe quotes Cicero, an ancient Roman Senator. So I quote Cicero this \nmorning. Cicero said very long ago, ``The first bond of society is \nmarriage.'' I believe Cicero was right. He was not a religious man, he \nwas a secular man. He was a nonbeliever. But he also saw the incredible \nbenefit to building up citizens of Rome through this first bond of \nsociety which was then and is still marriage.\n  I suppose I take this position, a nuanced position, to be sure, \nbecause I am somewhat of an old-fashioned idealist. However imperfectly \npracticed by the American people, marriage still is a perfect ideal. I \nthink the American people deserve a debate on this that is civil, that \nis respectful, and that includes all Americans.\n  Some have come to this floor, and will in the coming days, to hold up \nthe Constitution. Here is a copy of it. They will say this is a sacred \ndocument, a document that should not be amended. I will admit to the \nPresiding Officer it would be better that we not have to do this, to \neven resort to a constitutional amendment. But this is what Article V \nof the Bill of Rights says:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, \n     or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of \n     the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing \n     Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all \n     Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution. . . .\n\n  It goes on.\n  They would not have included this Article V in the Bill of Rights if \nit were not intended that this be a living document. But they intended \nthe Constitution to be a living document, and the United States has \namended this Constitution 27 times.\n  Were it not a living document, this document would have failed. Were \nit not subject to amendment, the most egregious kinds of actions would \nhave been put in place that would have made us ashamed forever.\n  For example, perhaps the most dreadful decision ever rendered under \nthis Constitution was that of Dred Scott. Roger B. Taney, the Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court, held that African Americans were not \nhuman and were the subject of property and could be controlled as \nproperty like any other chattel. That is a decision that goes down in \ninfamy, if ever there was one. It took a Civil War and then the \nthirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, which before \nwas silent on the issue of slavery, to ultimately overcome this \ninsidious practice in parts of the United States.\n  Some say: Well, that is a sacred thing that was done. And I agree, it \nwas. I believe the Constitution is both sacred and secular, but living \nand improving, and open to debate.\n  I mentioned the last time the Constitution was amended was in 1992. \nIt is the twenty-seventh amendment. It reads:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  That is the twenty-seventh amendment. It is about money. It is about \nsalaries for Senators and Representatives. I suggest to you that may be \nappropriate to be in the Constitution because it went through the \nprocess, but there is nothing sacred about that.\n  So the question then becomes, Is it appropriate to put a definition \nof marriage into our Constitution? I would say, as a matter of \npreference, it is better not to put cultural issues in the \nConstitution, until you come to this question: Shall the Constitution \nbe amended? And I tell everyone, the Constitution of the United States \nis about to be amended. The question is: By whom? Will it be done by a \nfew liberal judges in Massachusetts, a lawless mayor in San Francisco, \nor clandestine county commissioners, or by the American people in a \nlawful, constitutional process, as laid out in our founding document?\n  You will hear lots of people beating on their chests and sounding \nvery sanctimonious in this debate that: We should not do this or that. \nBut the truth is, the Constitution is going to be amended. And I say: \nInclude the American people.\n\n  Now, some also say: The issue of marriage has nothing to do with the \nFederal Government. Leave it to the States. My family has an \ninteresting history in regard to leaving it to the States. My ancestors \nwere, for the most part, Mormon pioneers who came from England in \nlittle boats, crossed the ocean, and walked across the country. They \nhad a peculiar practice among them. It is found throughout the pages of \nthe Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. They practiced a \nprinciple they called ``plural marriage.'' The marriages practiced by \nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n  My great-grandfather David King Udall had two wives, one large, happy \nfamily. I am descended from the second. He came to America, helped \nfound the State of Arizona, and spent time in prison because he \nviolated a Federal law, the Edmunds-Tucker law from the 1870s, in which \nthe Federal Government defined marriage as ``one man and one woman.'' \nHe was a great man, a great pioneer, had great sons and daughters who \nhelped the desert of the West blossom as a rose.\n  He has a large posterity. He sacrificed much for the principle of his \nfaith. But he paid a price because the Federal Government, long ago, \ndefined what marriage was. Ultimately, Grover Cleveland pardoned him, \nand he named one of his sons Grover Cleveland Udall.\n  Some people would say this is enacting discrimination into the \nConstitution. Well, my progenitors were discriminated against, I guess, \nbut the truth is, our country through a lawful process in the 1860s and \n1870s defined marriage at the Federal level.\n  Now what is happening? What is happening in our country is we have \nelected officials and unelected judges reinterpreting the Constitutions \nof their States and of our Nation to find in it rights that are not \nmentioned in it. This has happened a lot in recent years. I have \nconcluded it is better that these things be resolved with the American \npeople than without them.\n  The American people have a sense of fairness and tolerance and \njustice and right and wrong. What is happening is their views, their \nvalues, their beliefs, their respect for law is being trampled upon by \na few liberal elites. That is not right.\n  In my own State of Oregon, in 1862, Oregon passed its law on \nmarriage. Mr. President, 142 years have transpired, 142 years of Oregon \nlaw and practice and custom. But what happened recently? Four or five \ncounty commissioners in one of our counties ignored 142 years of law, \nignored 1,000 years and more of human history, and, without notice, \nwithout a public meeting, changed the law. To me, this is deeply \ndisappointing and terribly undemocratic. Before this happens again, I \nthink it is appropriate, on an issue this central to our country, to \nour civilization, to the future, we involve ``we the people.'' The only \nway to do that is through a constitutional process.\n  Now, I wish this cup would pass from us. I do not like this. I love \npeople. I believe in tolerance. But I believe in democracy. Many will \ntell you we should leave this alone. But if you leave this alone, you \nwill leave it to others. And if you leave it to others, they will \ndictate to the American people what it has to be. The only recourse \nthen available--when a Federal judge nullifies all State DOMA or \nconstitutional provisions of the several States, finding an equal \nprotection right to same-gender marriage--the only recourse then is \nthrough the constitutional process laid out by the fifth amendment in \nthe Bill of Rights.\n  That is how you include the American people. I say public meetings, \npublic notice, public debates, let people vote, let their elected \nrepresentatives in the several States vote on it. If we are going to \nchange it, let's change it with the American people, not at the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, that seems to be what many who will \nargue against this want to happen. They want to do this to us, not with \nus.\n  For the record, let me express to my gay and lesbian friends, I don't \nmean to disappoint you, but I can't be true to you if I am false to my \nbasic beliefs. I believe that marriage, as we have known and practiced \nit in this country for hundreds of years now, is something that should \nbe preserved. New structures can be created, new legal rights \nconferred, without taking down this word that represents an ideal--not \nabout adults but including children. I mean to hurt no one's feelings \nin my position. I intend to be your champion on many issues in the \nfuture, if you\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nwant me. But on this one, I have to be able to get up in the morning \nand look in the mirror and be true to myself.\n  I have spoken what I believe to be true this morning. I believe \nmarriage is more profoundly important than we might now recognize. \nBefore we let a few tell the many what it is going to be, I think we \nought to debate it, carefully consider it, because while we debate \nissues of war and peace and recession and prosperity, some will say \nthere are so many more important things to discuss than this.\n  I say to you, there probably isn't a more important issue to discuss \nthan the legal structure that binds men and women together for the \ncreation and the rearing and nurturing of future generations of \nAmericans. I make no apology for my vote for this process, for an \namendment that defines marriage, because that is where it is headed, \nbecause the courts will compel it. And our legal structure gives \nAmerican citizens an avenue to be included. So with my vote, I say \ninclude we the people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7875-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7875-S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUICIDE EPIDEMIC ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday on the Senate floor and this \nmorning watching an interview on NBC's ``Today Show'' by my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Smith, there was a great deal of discussion about \nthe issue of youth suicide. All of us in this Chamber, as part of the \nSenate family, have extended our hearts, thoughts, and prayers to the \nSmith family upon the loss of their son. It is devastating to lose a \nchild. I lost a beautiful, wonderful daughter some while ago to heart \ndisease.\n  Yesterday, as I listened to my colleague, Senator Smith, describe the \nloss of his son and discuss the issue of suicide, I know that it adds a \ndimension to what is an almost unbearable burden of losing a child, to \nlose a child to suicide. So my thoughts and prayers have been with the \nSmith family, and I know, too, that what Senator Smith has done in \nproviding leadership for the legislation passed last evening is going \nto save lives.\n  We will not know their names, but there are going to be young people \nin this country whose lives are going to be saved because the grants \nand the resources that are going to be made available through the \nlegislation passed by the Senate last night. I am glad to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill. It is going to give kids who are \ndespondent and have despair and depression hope, opportunity, and \ncounseling. So what the Senate did last night is going to save lives, \nand we owe a great debt of gratitude to Senator Smith. I hope the lives \nthat are saved in the years ahead in some way are a memorial to the \nlate son of Senator Smith and his family.\n  I had come to the floor some 2 months or so ago intending to speak \nabout a young girl on the Spirit Lake Nation Indian Reservation in \nNorth Dakota. When I came to the floor, I saw my colleague was in the \nChair at that point and I decided that I really did not want to \ndescribe the circumstances of her death because she had committed \nsuicide. I knew the burden the Smith family had been dealing with \nsurrounding the loss of their son. So I did not describe that young \ngirl's death in any detail, but I would like to today in light of the \nspeech that was delivered and in light of the action the Senate took \nlast evening, which has given me some hope.\n  I will describe this young girl. This young girl was named Avis \nLittlewind. She died a few months ago now. She took her own life. She \nwas 14 years of age. She lived on the Spirit Lake Nation Indian \nReservation. She was a seventh grader at the Four Winds Middle School. \nI am told she enjoyed riding horses, playing basketball, grooming her \nanimals, and listening to music. The day after she died, someone told \nme about the plight of this little girl. So I called the reservation \nand talked to the psychologist and the social worker involved. Since \nthat time, I have gone to that reservation, I have sat around in a \ncircle for an hour visiting with her classmates in the seventh grade, \ntalked to the counselors, talked to the school administrators, talked \nto members of the tribal council about what is happening on our Indian \nreservations. Because, although I am speaking today about Avis \nLittlewind, there is an epidemic of suicides on Indian reservations. \nThe legislation that Senator Smith, Senator Dodd, and others offered in \nthe Senate last evening will help address this epidemic by making \ntribal governments also eligible for grant funding for suicide \nprevention.\n  Avis Littlewind died just recently by her own hand. Her sister took \nher life 2 years ago. Her father took his life in a self-inflicted \nbullet wound 12 years ago. But it is more than that. The tragedy of \nsuicides is not just a problem on the Spirit Lake Indian reservation--\nJust in North Dakota, I have gone on the same mission to talk to people \nat the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation when there was an epidemic of \nthreats of suicide by young people.\n  In this case with Avis Littlewind, there were a lot of warning signs. \nThis little seventh grade girl missed 90 days of school up until April. \nShe was lying in her bed day after day in a near fetal position.\n  Tragically, she had an appointment to see the IHS social worker later \nthe same day that she took her life. She did not live long enough to \nmake that appointment.\n  When I called the reservation to talk to leaders about these issues \nand then subsequently went there to visit with them, this is what I \ndiscovered: The reservation has one psychologist and one social worker. \nThey did not have nearly the capability to follow up with these cases. \nThey just could not cope. They did not have the capability to give \nsomebody a ride to the clinic. They have to borrow a car, beg somebody \nto give someone a ride to some medical help.\n  It is interesting to me, and tragic as well, that the Federal \nGovernment is directly responsible for the health care of only two \ngroups of people. We have a trust responsibility for the health care of \nAmerican Indians. That is a trust responsibility. That is not optional, \nthat is our responsibility. And we have a responsibility for the health \ncare of Federal prisoners.\n\n  Do you know that on a per capita basis we spend almost twice as much \nfor health care for Federal prisoners as we do for health care for \nAmerican Indians? So little girls like Avis Littlewind are found dead \nby suicide, and we don't have the mental health services to reach out \nand help these kids. The mental health services are not available. Just \ncall around and ask.\n  There are kids who, for their own reasons, are desperate, are \ndepressed, are reaching out, and yet the services are not available to \nthem. We must do much better than that.\n  Let me describe the circumstances on our Indian reservations in this \ncountry because on many of them it looks as if you are visiting a Third \nWorld country. Alcoholism, seven times--not double, triple, quadruple--\nbut seven times the rate of the national average; tuberculosis, seven \ntimes the rate of the national average; suicide, double the national \naverage in this country; homicide, double; diabetes, four times. On the \nFort Berthold Reservation, the rate of diabetes is 12 times the \nnational average. We have to do much better. We have a responsibility.\n  I never met this young girl, but I met her classmates and they told \nme about her. She, like a lot of kids, was a wonderful young woman, but \nshe lived in a circle of poverty in a family in which two other family \nmembers had taken their lives. Her cousin, incidentally, 2 weeks after \nAvis Littlewind's death, threatened suicide and had to be hospitalized.\n  But it is not just this family. It is an epidemic on our Indian \nreservations with young people. We need resources to deal with it. That \nis why I was so pleased last evening to hear the speech given by \nSenator Smith, a speech that was obviously very difficult for him to \ngive on the Senate floor. Then that was followed by legislation enacted \nby this Senate that will begin the long road to\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\ndo something about this problem, to save the lives of kids like Avis \nLittlewind. She may not long be remembered because she is just a \nstatistic with respect to teen suicides on Indian reservations, but \nthis young girl, I am sure, wanted the things that we want and that our \nchildren want--a good life, an opportunity. She wanted to have hope for \nthe future. She is now lying in a grave, having taken her own life.\n  We bear some responsibility because the resources that were \nnecessary, needed to help treat the depression that this young girl \nhad, were simply not available. I met with the school administrators, \nthe tribal council, all those folks. The fact is, it was clear to me no \none took it upon themselves to reach out. If you have a young 14-year-\nold lying in bed for 90 days, not attending school, in desperate \ncondition, something is wrong. Someone needs to intervene. Someone \nshould have saved her life.\n  I am not blaming anybody today. I am just saying today there is hope. \nThere was not before. Today there is hope. The Senate has taken action \non a significant piece of legislation that I think will save lives. It \nis too late to save Avis Littlewind's life, but it will save other \nlives. Today I commend my colleague, Senator Smith, whom I believe, \nthrough the pain and suffering that his family has experienced, has \ndone something that will give others hope and offer life and \nopportunity to others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, let me add to the Senator's remarks. I \nlistened to my dear friend, my partner, Gordon Smith, yesterday on the \nSenate floor, and I was very impressed, having seen what he and his \nfamily have gone through and what others have gone through. It meant so \nmuch to have him lead the fight for this particular bill.\n  I certainly appreciated the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota. There is no question, this is a serious problem for young \npeople throughout our country--again, especially for those who are \nNative Americans. I believe the bill, sponsored by my dear friend from \nOregon, and of course a number of the rest of us, will go a long way \ntoward helping to resolve and alleviate some of these problems.\n  I compliment all concerned for their sensitivity and their desire to \ndo what we can to alleviate these problems and to help our children \nthroughout our country.\n  My home state of Utah has one of the highest suicide rates in the \ncountry, in fact, suicide rates in Utah for those 15 to 19 years of age \nhave increased close to 150 percent over the last 20 years. In response \nto these disturbing statistics, I authored legislation in 2000 to \ndirect the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to \nstates and other entities in order to create programs to reduce suicide \ndeaths among children and adolescents. This legislation was included in \nthe Children's Health Act of 2000 which was signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  Again, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act and I credit its rapid passage through the Senate \nlast night to one person--my dear friend, Senator Gordon Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7876-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7876-S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n A JOINT RESOLUTION PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES RELATING TO MARRIAGE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have been around here for 28 years. I \nhave seen a lot of very important issues. I have seen a lot of phony \narguments through the years. One of the phoniest arguments I have seen \nis, Why are you moving toward this constitutional amendment to preserve \nthe traditional definition of marriage? We have so many other more \nimportant things to do. Why, we have the economy, we have the war--we \ncan name thousands of things that are more important to some of the \nopponents of this measure than this particular measure. But I say I \ndon't know of anything in our society or in our lives or in our country \nor in the world that is more important than preserving our traditional \nfamily definition.\n  I don't know of anything that is more important to children. I don't \nknow of anything that is more important to morality. I don't know of \nanything that is more important to education. I don't know of anything \nthat is more important to strengthen our country. I don't know of \nanything that is more important to the overall well-being of our \ncitizens than the preservation of the traditional marriage definition \nthat has been the rule for 5,000-plus years in this world; that is, \nmarriage should be between a man and a woman.\n  Everybody in this body knows I have led the fight in three AIDS \nbills. I have been the primary sponsor of those bills along with \nSenator Kennedy. Everybody knows that I have fought hard against hate \ncrimes. One of the principal bills that lies before us is the Hatch-\nSmith-Kennedy-Feinstein bill against hate crimes, part of which are \nhate crimes against gay people. I do not believe in discrimination of \nany kind, and I do not believe that what some people have done to gay \npeople in our society is relevant or right.\n  Some of it has been purely prejudicial. I don't believe that type of \nthinking should see the light of day.\n\n  But like my colleague from Oregon and others, I draw the line when it \ncomes to traditional marriage and the definition of traditional \nmarriage. So I rise in support of an amendment to our Constitution that \nwould maintain the institution of marriage between a man and a woman, \nan institutional arrangement that is to this date supported by all of \nour State legislatures, every State legislature in the country. The \nbedrock of American success is the family, and it is traditional \nmarriage that undergirds the American family.\n  The disintegration of the family in this country correlates to the \nmany serious social problems, including crime and poverty. We are \nseeing soaring divorce rates. We are seeing soaring out-of-wedlock \nbirth rates that have resulted in far too many fatherless families. \nWeakening the legal status of marriage at this point will only \nexacerbate these problems, and we simply must act to strengthen the \nfamily. It is one of the most important things that we can consider and \nthat we should do.\n  To me, the question comes down to whether we amend the Constitution \nor we let the Supreme Court do it for us. I know which is the more \ndemocratic option, and that is for us, as elected officials, to amend \nthe Constitution. Questions that are as fundamental as the family \nshould simply not be left to the courts to decide. If we permit \nourselves to be ruled by judges, we further erode the citizenly \nresponsibility that is central to our republican form of government.\n  Many in this body, in the ivory tower, often fret that Americans do \nnot take politics seriously enough. Perhaps that is because we, through \nour inaction, routinely suggest to the electorate that the most \nimportant questions facing us as a political community should be \ndecided by a handful of Harvard-educated lawyers, rather than by the \npeople themselves. A free citizenry should not accept such a goal, and \nshould not accept such thin gruel.\n  Our hope for this amendment is that it will maintain the traditional \nright of American people to set marriage policy for themselves.\n  We do not take this proposal lightly. The Constitution has functioned \nto secure and extend the rights of citizens in this Nation, and it \nserves as a beacon of hope for the world. Aside from the Bill of \nRights, it has rarely been amended, but when it is, we have done so to \nexpand the rights of democratic self-government and to resecure the \nConstitution's original meaning.\n  That is precisely what we are intending here. Marriage policy has \ntraditionally been set by the States. The States have made their \nopinion on this subject clear. They have overwhelmingly acted in recent \nyears to preserve traditional marriage.\n  Still, absent an amendment, we should have no faith that the courts \nwill uphold these State decisions. Believe me, there are other ways we \nwould rather spend our time. We did not choose this schedule--the \ncourts did. But as public representatives, bound by the oath to defend \nthe Constitution, we will not hide from our obligations.\n  Our case is simple. Last fall, in its Goodridge v. Department of \nPublic\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nHealth decision, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts declared \nsame-sex marriage to be the policy of the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. Today, same-sex marriage couples live in 46 States, and \nactivists are implementing a well-funded, multifaceted, and highly \ncoordinated legal assault on traditional marriage.\n  Look at this. Not one legislature has voted to recognize same-sex \nunions. But in 1996, States with same-sex marriage couples, zero; in \n2004, States with same-sex marriage couples, 46. That is what has \nhappened as a result of this particular decision by the Massachusetts \nSupreme Judicial Court.\n  The inescapable conclusion is that absent an amendment to the \nConstitution, same-sex marriage is coming whether you like it or not.\n  Regardless of what the people think, regardless of what elected \nrepresentatives think, it is going to be imposed on America because of \none 4-to-3 version of an activist Massachusetts Supreme Court.\n  The opponents of this amendment urge us to remain patient. Our \nactions are premature, they tell us. Those opposed to protecting \ntraditional marriage keep moving the goal line, and to ignore this \nstrategy is to guarantee defeat.\n  Marriage first became a national issue in 1996. Then, as now, a State \ncourt threatened to impose same-sex marriage on citizens of their own \nState, and in so doing they jeopardized the traditional marriage laws \nof the entire Nation.\n  Given this scenario, it would have been flatly irresponsible for us \nnot to act. So when faced with the potential of the Supreme Court of \nHawaii dictating marriage policy for all 50 States, we passed the \nDefense of Marriage Act, or DOMA.\n  Then, as now, our opponents accused us of playing election year \npolitics--the same phony argument they are accusing us of today, or in \nthis particular matter. The opposition insisted there was no need for \nDOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. In fact, Senator John Kerry argued, \nand others with him, that it was not necessary since no State has \nadopted same-sex marriage. That was their argument. Eight years later, \na bare majority of John Kerry's own State's supreme court has brought \nsame-sex marriage to the State and to the citizens of Massachusetts.\n\n  What is his position now? Sounding much as he did 8 years ago, he \nsaid, and I quote:\n\n       I oppose this election-year effort to amend the \n     Constitution in an area that each State can adequately \n     address, and I will vote against such an amendment if it \n     comes to the Senate floor.\n\n  Keep in mind, the only thing that would permit each State to decide \nthis issue on its own is DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. What was \nSenator Kerry's opinion on DOMA? I don't mean to just single him out; \nthere are others on the other side who have taken the same position. \nWhat was their opinion on DOMA? Senator Kerry called it ``fundamentally \nunconstitutional.'' In fact, that was the opinion of much of the \nDemocratic Party and our academic legal establishment at the time.\n  Let me refer you to this chart. But isn't DOMA unconstitutional? \nSenator Kerry said: You don't have to worry about it because we have \nthe Defense of Marriage Act.\n  This is what he said on September 3, 1996:\n\n       DOMA does violence to the spirit and letter of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Senator Kennedy, our other distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nin his remarks on the Senate floor on September 10, 1996, said:\n\n       Scholarly opinion is clear. DOMA is plainly \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Professor Laurence Tribe, Harvard Law School professor, in a letter \nsubmitted for the Record in Senate proceedings, said on June 6, 1996:\n\n       My conclusion is unequivocal. Congress possess no power \n     under any provision of the Constitution to legislate as it \n     does in DOMA any such categorical exemption from the Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause of article IV.\n\n  The ACLU, in a background briefing in February of 1996, says:\n\n       DOMA is bad constitutional law . . . an unmistakable \n     violation of the Constitution.\n\n  Think about that.\n  So let me get this straight. We do not need DOMA, was the argument \nbecause no State has actually pursued same-sex marriage.\n  That is what Senator Kerry said against DOMA when he argued against \nit back then. But now that Massachusetts has, we do not need an \namendment because we fortunately have DOMA. How convenient. Except for \nthe fact they are all arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional. It just \ndoesn't seem to fit.\n  I have seen these ads on Senator Kerry flip-flopping. We all know \nthat around here. That is what he does. But this is the grand flip-\nflop, one of the grandest of all times. A person's head starts to spin \njust trying to undo this logical mess.\n  But in the end, that is the point. They hope to confuse and to \nobfuscate and cast aspersions, and, by so doing, maybe succeed in \nlulling citizens into apathy on this subject.\n  Fortunately, this issue is actually rather simple for those who \napproach it with any sincerity. There are, in fact, only two questions \nthat Senators must answer before voting on this amendment; that is, if \nthe filibuster will be ended and we are able to proceed to the \nconstitutional amendment and debate it.\n\n  The first thing is whether they support traditional marriage. \nBulletproof majorities in this body do. No question about that. The \nAmerican people do, as well.\n  The second is whether the majority's desire to protect traditional \nmarriage can be guaranteed without a constitutional amendment.\n  The assertion this was a State issue, that the States can protect \nmarriage, neglects the likelihood that the courts will overturn the \nwell-considered opinion of citizens in every State. Skeptics and \nopponents of this constitutional amendment claim, sometimes relying on \ntraditional Republican and conservative principles of federalism and \nlimited government, that this is not the time nor the place for the \nNational Government to act.\n  We must be clear. The States have already acted. Since marriage first \nbecame an issue in 1996, over 40 States--look at this--over 40 States \nhave acted explicitly to shore up their traditional marriage laws--40 \nStates. What a national consensus? States where legislatures have \napproved same-sex marriage, zero; not one State legislature, that is. \nThe people's representatives, the ones who have to stand for \nreelection, not one State. States where legislators and citizens have \nrecently acted to protect traditional marriage, 40 States.\n  But all of this legislation has been in danger by the Massachusetts \ncourt's actions this past fall and by recent decisions by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The courts, in an elite legal culture out of touch with \naverage Americans, have made this a national issue. It can no longer be \nadequately resolved by the States. More and more coordinated lawsuits \nare being filed every day, and the question of same-sex marriage will \nterminate in Federal courts at which point same-sex marriage will \nbecome the law of the land, in spite of the desires of the elected \nrepresentatives throughout at least 40 States, and I believe other \nStates would follow suit in time to preserve traditional marriage.\n  Let me say this slowly so it can sink in. Absent a constitutional \namendment that protects the rights of the States to maintain their \ntraditional understanding of marriage, the Supreme Court will decide \nthis issue for them.\n  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court commanded, in a fit of \nhubris, that the State must extend marriage to same-sex couples. Never \nmind that the Massachusetts Constitution created by the hand of John \nAdams himself clearly did not contemplate this conclusion. Never mind \nthere is an obvious national basis for the States' traditional marriage \nlaws and never mind the people in the Bay State were adamantly opposed \nto this judicial usurpation of policy development best left to \nlegislative judgment. No, they went right ahead and issued a decision \nthat certainly made them the toast of the town on the cocktail party \nand academic lecture circuit, but they put their personal self-\nsatisfaction ahead of their judicial responsibilities. By doing so, \nthey knowingly threatened the marriage laws in every State in our \ncountry.\n\n  The people of Massachusetts acted quickly to amend their constitution\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nand overturn this egregious abuse of judicial authority. The problem is \nthat amendment will not be ratified for at least 2 years--a fact, by \nthe way, of which the Massachusetts Supreme Court was keenly aware. In \nthe meantime, people will be married in Massachusetts and they will \nmove to other States. What will become of these same-sex marriages? \nWill they be recognized? Will they be dissolved? Can these people get \ndivorces in other States? Who will have custody of the children in the \nevent of disillusion? Already, as a result of the lawless issuing of \nmarriage licenses to same-sex couples by the mayor of San Francisco, \nsame-sex marriage couples live in 46 States now. Together, these \nactions have stirred up a hornet's nest of litigation.\n  When allowed to choose, legislatures protect marriage rather than \ndismantle it; therefore, advocates of same-sex marriage resort to \nstrategies involving the executive or judicial branches. In States such \nas California, Oregon, New York, and New Mexico, rogue local officials \nhave simply defied their own State marriage laws and married thousands \nof same-sex couples. While saying that New York law does not allow \nsame-sex marriages, State attorney general Elliot Spitzer will \nnonetheless recognize such marriages performed in other States. That is \nhis opinion. These actions have an impact on the legal landscape for \nsure, but in most cases advocates turn to the courts to impose their \npreferred policies on fellow citizens. Their legal war against \ntraditional marriage has at least five fronts.\n  Remember article IV of the Constitution, full faith and credit \nclause. Most authorities believe the Massachusetts Supreme Court will \nbe binding on every other State in the Union, not that they will have \nto allow same-sex marriages themselves in defiance of traditional \nmarriage beliefs, but they will have to recognize the marriages that \nare performed in Massachusetts that come to their States under the full \nfaith and credit clause. Most constitutional authorities agree with \nthat, and it is believed that the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold that \nand thus rule DOMA, or the Defense of Marriage Act, unconstitutional.\n  There are five legal fronts of attack on the Defense of Marriage Act \nor traditional marriage. First, as in Massachusetts, gay citizens who \nwish to marry allege that State laws protecting traditional marriage \nare violations of their own State constitutions. So far, there are 11 \nStates facing these challenges to their marriage laws.\n  This week, the ACLU filed suit in Maryland arguing that the State's \nfailure to recognize same-sex unions violates the State's constitution.\n  In California, even though more than 60 percent of the voters \nrecently approved a statewide ballot initiative to maintain traditional \nmarriage, the California Supreme Court is now considering the \nconstitutionality of that democratic action.\n\n  In Nebraska, the ACLU has actually challenged a duly passed State \nconstitutional amendment that defines marriage as being between a man \nand a woman. Similar challenges are pending in Florida, Indiana, \nWashington, and West Virginia, all of which have passed laws to secure \ntraditional marriage just in the last 10 years as a result of this \nfocused consideration of the subject by citizens of those States.\n  The legislatures in Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, and \nVermont are considering actual amendments to protect traditional \nmarriage. Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oregon have signature-\ngathering campaigns underway. Amendments are already on the ballot in \nArkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, \nand my own home State of Utah.\n  One would expect and hope that given this public concentration on the \nsubject, a proper respect would be given to a popular resolution of \nthis issue. We can be sure, though, that the legal advocates of same-\nsex marriage will not display any such reservations.\n  The second case against traditional marriage will emerge once two \ncitizens legally married in Massachusetts move to Ohio, Louisiana, or \nsome other State and seek to have their marriage recognized. It is \nsimply implausible to deny that this scenario will unfold. Already a \nsuit has been filed in Washington State requesting that Washington \nrecognize same-sex marriages performed in Oregon under a now halted \norder issued by a rogue county chairman even though Washington law \nexpressly precludes such unions.\n  The third and fourth cases also specifically involve challenges to \nthe Defense of Marriage Act now passed by 40 States and I believe will \nultimately be passed by all 50 States.\n  One of the standard crutches of those opposed to an amendment is that \nDOMA, the Defensive of Marriage Act, remains the law of the land. In \nthe hearing before the Judiciary Committee several weeks ago, Senator \nDurbin said that DOMA has ``never been challenged in court.'' This is \nsimply untrue. DOMA has been challenged for violating the U.S. \nConstitution. It is being challenged right now.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act did two things. For the purposes of \nFederal benefits, such as Social Security, it reserved the definition \nof marriage to traditional unions, and, most importantly, it gave a \nblanket exception to the full faith and credit laws for marriage \npolicy.\n  As it is now, the Constitution requires that, barring a rational \npublic policy to the contrary, my marriage in Utah must be recognized \nin Virginia. DOMA ensures that States would not be compelled under the \nConstitution to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other States. \nThe first prong of DOMA is being challenged in a Federal court. There \nis no doubt that a suit will eventually be filed challenging the \nconstitutionality of DOMA's exception to the full faith and credit \nclause.\n  Fifth, State laws protecting traditional marriage will be challenged \nas violating the Federal Constitution. That the U.S. Constitution \nprotects no such right will hardly be an obstacle to these suits. The \ndeath penalty is explicitly provided for in the fifth amendment, but \nthat does not stop liberal interest groups from attempting to undo this \nthrough judicial action. They cannot get these matters through the \nelected representatives, so they always try to get these activist court \njudges to do their bidding for them and to enact legislation from the \nbench that they could never get through the elected representatives of \nthe people. This is a perfect illustration.\n\n  The first amendment was obviously intended to guarantee political \nspeech, but that does not stop the ACLU from getting nude dancing \ndeclared a constitutional right. Nothing in the Constitution guarantees \na right to an abortion, but, through a creative analysis of the text, \nthe Court was persuaded to create a right to privacy extended in recent \nyears to include ``the right to define one's own concept of existence \nof the universe, and of the mystery of human life.''\n  These cases will inevitably wind up in Federal court. We cannot wash \nour hands of the implications of this issue's likely judicial \nresolution. As a Senator, my oath obligated me to protect the \nConstitution. That includes protecting it from corruption at the hands \nof the judiciary. These corruptions have become commonplace, and they \nare extremely difficult to undo once secured.\n  We have tried in the past, when constitutional meaning was violated \nin the moment-of-silence cases, in abortion rights cases, in religious \nliberty cases, in flag burning cases--all judicial activists' \ndecisions--we attempted to undo these decisions and to restore the \noriginal Constitution. We have never been successful in succeeding \nalong those lines. If this becomes the law of the land by judicial fiat \nof 4-to-3 verdict in the Massachusetts Supreme Court and because the \nfull faith and credit clause will impose it on every other State in the \nUnion, then we will have had the judges legislate for all of America \nagainst every State's law that we now must do away with traditional \nmarriage or at least allow this new form of marriage.\n  Now, there is a constitutional responsibility, I would suggest to my \ncolleagues in the Senate. In fact, once these decisions are in place, \nthe very people who tell us to wait for the courts to decide abdicate \ntheir stewardship of the Constitution. It is a phony argument to say \nwait until the courts decide. I think it is all too clear that if we \nrely on that, we are going to have the courts tell Americans what\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\nthey must believe on this matter, and that is in contradiction to all \nof the elected representatives' rights to determine these types of \nissues.\n  As an example, consider the response of some Democratic lawmakers to \nthe Supreme Court's rulings on abortion. In a recent letter to Roman \nCatholic Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, DC, 48 Catholic \nMembers of the House of Representatives explained that:\n\n       [W]e live in a nation of laws and the Supreme Court has \n     declared that our Constitution provides women with a right to \n     an abortion. Members who vote for legislation consistent with \n     that mandate are not acting contrary to our positions as \n     faithful members of the Catholic Church.\n\n  Now, regardless of the beliefs of the Catholic Church, or even the \nmerits of the arguments for or against abortion, this is a monumentally \nirresponsible attitude. These legislators, charged with protecting the \nConstitution, argue that they must vote against legislation that \ncurtails abortion because the Supreme Court obligates them to. In other \nwords, the Constitution, apparently, is what the Supreme Court says it \nis to these people.\n  Well, I think the Supreme Court has gotten it wrong on a number of \noccasions. But on this particular issue, when the Supreme Court rules \nthat DOMA is unconstitutional, that will be one of the most \nmonumentally wrongful decisions in the history of this country.\n  Now, with all due respect, these arguments that these Members of the \nHouse raised on the issue of abortion are absurd. Abraham Lincoln, the \nfounder of my political party, understood this. When Chief Justice \nRoger Taney handed down his infamous Dred Scott decision, Lincoln did \nnot defer to the Court. He did not accept its decision as a proper \ninterpretation of the Constitution. He rejected it root and branch, and \nexplained that:\n\n       [T]he candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the \n     government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is \n     to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court . . \n     . the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\n\n  That was Lincoln speaking, and we ought to follow that type of logic \nand that type of reasoning, that type of truth. We cannot just sit by \nand let the courts rule our country. That is not their job. Their job \nis to interpret the laws that we make as people who have to stand for \nreelection. We passed a law that is now approved by 40 States, and I \nbelieve will be approved by the other 10 States given time.\n  Now, this popular constitutional responsibility is a bipartisan \naffair. When Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was repeatedly stymied by \nthe Supreme Court, he did not throw up his hands and explain that the \nDepression would have to continue because the Supreme Court did not \nallow him to regulate the economy. Of course, he did not. Rather, he \ncontinued to push his policies and explained to the American people why \nthe Court's interpretation of the Constitution was wrong.\n\n  The Members of this body have a sacred trust as constitutional \nofficials, and we must take seriously the results of our inaction. If \nwe fail to pass an amendment, and we delegate our authority over this \nmatter to the Supreme Court of the United States, the decision will \ncome as no surprise. On this point, the Justices have made themselves \namply clear. There is no reason to believe that State marriage laws \nprotecting traditional marriage will be allowed to stand.\n  In the Lawrence decision handed down just last year, the Supreme \nCourt announced its intentions by effectively overturning Bowers v. \nHardwick. Bowers was hardly an antique. It was decided only in 1986, \nand it basically put the brakes on 20 years of judicially created \nprivacy rights. That decision concluded that the States remained able \nto regulate certain sexual practices in order to protect the health, \nsafety, and morals within its political community.\n  But in Lawrence the court reversed course. There, the Court concluded \nthat:\n\n       Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom \n     of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct, \n     and therefore, our laws and tradition afford constitutional \n     protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, \n     procreation, contraception, family relationships, child \n     rearing, and education.\n\n  Now, according to the Court, in Lawrence, these are fundamental \nrights, and the States must, therefore, advance a compelling reason for \nany legislation that denies them. Unfortunately, in Romer v. Evans, the \nCourt has previously held that any such legislation could only be based \non an ``irrational animus'' toward homosexuals.\n  So what, then, of same-sex marriage, which denies to homosexuals the \nprivilege of marrying? In his dissent in Lawrence, Justice Scalia \nunderstood that:\n\n       State laws against . . . same-sex marriage . . . are \n     likewise sustainable only in light of Bowers' validation of \n     laws based on moral choices. Every single one of these laws \n     is called into question by today's decision; the Court makes \n     no effort to cabin the scope of its decision to exclude them \n     from its holding.\n\n  Those who favored the decision at the time said it did no such thing. \nPrivately, however, they understood exactly what it meant. And the \njudges in the Goodridge case were quick studies. In the decision to \nrewrite the Massachusetts Constitution to compel same-sex marriage, the \nGoodridge court relied heavily on these rulings. Their conclusions that \nmarriage is a fundamental right and that the decision to restrict that \nright is patently irrational were taken straight out of the U.S. \nSupreme Court playbook. Goodridge has shown us the way. DOMA, the \nDefense of Marriage Act, will not stand, and absent DOMA, the States \nwill have to defend their marriage laws on their own. Their success, of \ncourse, is in serious doubt.\n  I do not subscribe to the conclusions of the courts. There is an \nobviously rational basis for legislation that protects traditional \nmarriage. Only a discriminatory animus against people who hold any \nreligious beliefs at all could lead someone to conclude otherwise. For \na simple and compelling reason, traditional marriage has been a \ncivilizational anchor for thousands of years. Society has an interest \nin the future generations created by men and women.\n\n  Decoupling procreation from marriage in order to make some people \nfeel more accepted denies the very purpose of marriage itself. \nMarriages between men and women are the essential institutions to which \nfuture generations are produced and reared. Political communities are \nonly as solid as their foundation, and these families and homes, the \nfirst schoolyards of citizenship, are essential for the future of \nrepublican government.\n  The fact that so many in the Democratic Party are openly opposed to \nsame-sex marriage should undercut the conclusion that the desire to \nmaintain traditional marriage is grounded simply in rank bigotry.\n  Let me refer to this chart again. These are leading Democrats who \nhave spoken out on same-sex marriage. The first one is Senator Kerry:\n\n       I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I oppose \n     gay marriage and disagree with the Massachusetts Court's \n     decision.\n\n  I don't think it could be any more clear.\n  Senator Daschle:\n\n       The word ``marriage'' means only a legal union between one \n     man and one woman as a husband and wife.\n\n  How about Representative Richard Gephardt:\n\n       I do not support gay marriage.\n\n  Or how about Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico:\n\n       I do believe that marriage is between a man and woman. So I \n     oppose same-sex marriage.\n\n  Or how about former President Bill Clinton:\n\n       I have long opposed governmental recognition of same-gender \n     marriages.\n\n  Or how about former Vice President Al Gore:\n\n       I favor protecting the institution of marriage as it has \n     been understood between a man and a woman.\n\n  These are leading Democrats, who I personally respect in many ways, \nwho have come out against this very dramatic change in traditional \nmarriage that is occurring in our society today.\n\n  I have to say that I think John Kerry was right in making that \nstatement at the time. I think Tom Daschle was right. I think Richard \nGephardt was right. I think Governor Bill Richardson was right. \nPresident Bill Clinton was right, and Vice President Al Gore was right \nwhen he said that. These Democrats are merely responding to a certain \ncommon sense articulated by the American people, and that\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\ncommon sense has expressed itself in legislative actions in nearly \nevery State.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in order to defend itself \nagainst the accusation that it is determining constitutional meaning \nfrom their morning reading of the New York Times, has taken to \ndefending only those rights supported by a developing national \nconsensus. In this case, there is a developing national consensus on \nthe issue of same-sex marriage, but it is developing in the other \ndirection.\n  State after State has acted to protect this vital institution of \ntraditional marriage. Still it would be a fool's wager to rely on the \nSupreme Court to affirm this consensus of all the people out there. \nWhen California acted through the superdemocratic process of a \nStatewide referendum to protect traditional marriage, that did not stop \nthe liberal mayor of San Francisco from defying this law and \ninstituting his own preferred policy preference instead. When it comes \nto a liberal agenda at odds with the beliefs of average Americans, \nlegal impediments or even simple respect for these popular decisions do \nnot long stand in the way.\n  It is important to mention another effect of abandoning our \ndefinition of marriage. We have vast numbers of institutions and \nindividuals in our society who will be stigmatized and marginalized by \ncourts trying to enforce a new moral norm. A group of notable legal \nscholars in Massachusetts, including Mary Ann Glendon, warned about the \ndanger to religious institutions in this country in a recent legal \nopinion.\n  They said:\n\n       Precedent from our own history and that of other nations \n     suggests that religious institutions could even be at risk of \n     losing tax exempt status, academic accreditation, and media \n     licenses, and could face charges of violating human rights \n     codes or hate speech laws.\n\n  Is this the road we want to go down? Gays and lesbians have a right \nto live as they choose. I would be the first to say that. But I am \nsorry, they do not have the right to define marriage and to redefine it \naway from the concepts of traditional marriage that have been in \nexistence for over 5,000 years. I have been a leader in advocating hate \ncrimes legislation against gays and lesbians. I know prejudice remains \nagainst gay and lesbian citizens. I reject each and every \nsubstantiation of it. But this amendment is not about discrimination. \nIt is not about prejudice. It is about safeguarding the best \nenvironment for our children.\n  African-American and Hispanic leaders, Catholics and Jews, Democrats \nand Republicans, people from every State, religion, and every walk of \nlife support traditional marriage as the ideal for this very same \nreason. I do not doubt alternative families can lovingly raise \nchildren, but decades of study show children do best when raised by a \nfather and a mother.\n  My own faith, which has been badly maligned through the years--and I \nhave personally been badly maligned, even by some who should be \nallies--only yesterday or within this week had this to say. It was \nissued on July 7:\n\n       The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-day Saints issued the follow statement today. This is \n     a statement of principle in anticipation of the expected \n     debate over same gender marriage. It is not an endorsement of \n     any specific amendment.\n       The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints favors a \n     constitutional amendment preserving marriage as the lawful \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  I have no doubt my faith and so many others would prefer and \nrecognize the need of a constitutional amendment to resolve this \nproblem. It is the right way to do it. For us to ignore it means we are \nabandoning our responsibilities. Given the acknowledged importance of \nthis institution, popular reservations about undoing it should be given \nthe utmost importance. Same-sex marriage is an unproven experiment, \nthough other nations have had some experience with it.\n   The Netherlands has recognized same-sex unions since 2001 and \nregistered partnerships since 1998. Since those reforms began, there \nhas been a marked decline in marriage culture. Just yesterday, in a \nletter published in a Dutch newspaper, a group of respected academics \nfrom the fields of social science, philosophy and law made a modest \nassertion. The decision to recognize same-sex marriage depended on the \ncreation of a social and legal separation between the ideas of marriage \nand parenting. And in that time, there has been, in their words, a \nspectacular rise in the number of illegitimate births. These scholars \ndo not argue that this rise is solely attributable to the decision to \nrecognize same-sex partnerships. But the correlation is undeniable. \nThey conclude that further research is needed to establish the relative \nimportance of all the factors.\n   Precisely! The jury is out on what the effects on children and \nsociety will be and only legislatures are institutionally-equipped to \nmake these decisions. If nothing else, given the uncertainty of a \nradical change in a fundamental institution like marriage, popular \nrepresentatives should be given deference on this issue. However, \nrecent actions by courts prove that no such deference is being given.\n  This is why we need an amendment. Without an amendment to the \nConstitution, same-sex marriage will be imposed by judges on an \nAmerican people who would not choose this institution for themselves.\n  Here is the language of the amendment. It contains two simple \nsentences:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The second sentence:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The amendment does nothing more than preserve perhaps the most \nfundamental relationship in society. The amendment does not violate the \nprinciples of Federalism and limited government.\n  Among other things the Constitution guaranteed to the people a right \nto govern themselves; in most instances, through their State \ngovernments. The Constitution protected traditional State prerogatives \nover subjects such as marriage and family policy. And should those be \nin danger, the Constitution guaranteed to the people a right to \nresecure these prerogatives through the amendment process. This is \nprecisely the situation we face here.\n  The States have acted on this issue time and time again. They have \nrejected same-sex marriage. Yet we face legal advocates and a judicial \nsystem that care little for these judgments and that are ready and \nwilling to substitute their own judgments for the common sense of the \nAmerican citizenry.\n  In the end, the only argument against this amendment is that the \nSupreme Court is the sole institution that determines the meaning of \nour Constitution. I reject that conclusion. It grossly misstates the \nhistory of this Nation. The Alien and Sedition Acts were repealed \nthrough legislative actions, not through the courts.\n  The Civil War amendments that guaranteed citizenship and the right to \nvote to black citizens came through Congress and the state \nlegislatures. The New Deal protected Americans in a time of need. The \n1964 Civil Rights Act promoted the rights of racial minorities.\n  President Ronald Reagan readjusted the New Deal settlement, \nprotecting the rights of small business owners and encouraging property \nownership and innovation. And in recent years this body has acted to \nprotect the rights of female victims of violence, the victims of hate \ncrimes, and the rights of disabled citizens.\n  The popular branches of Government, not the courts, are the primary \nguarantors of our rights. As Senators, we are obligated to interpret \nthe Constitution, and in this case we are not denying rights to same-\nsex couples, but protecting and extending the right of citizens to \ngovern themselves and to determine marriage policy on their own, and to \npreserve traditional marriage.\n  To delay action on the marriage amendment now is like agreeing to \nrepair a cracked dam only after it has burst and forever changed the \nlandscape. We know what the legal situation is on this issue and we \nknow what we have to do to repair it. A Constitutional amendment is the \nonly viable alternative to protect this most foundational relationship \nin society. We must act, and we must act now.\n  We need to send a message to our children about marriage and \ntraditional life and values. The American\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\npeople must have a voice. The people, through their elected \nrepresentatives--not judges--should decide the future of marriage.\n  Montana, Louisiana, West Virginia, Colorado, Washington, Maine, North \nDakota, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nebraska, South Carolina, Arkansas, \nAlaska, Pennsylvania.\n  All of these states and many others have made independent \ndeterminations to protect same-sex marriage. Without an amendment to \nthe Constitution, all that work will be for naught. They have made \nthose independent determinations to protect traditional marriage, not \nsame-sex marriage. I respectfully ask my colleagues to do the right \nthing here and to guarantee that the right to self-government on \nimportant issues such as this remains with the people rather than in \nthe courts.\n  This is an important issue. Anybody who argues this issue isn't as \nimportant as anything that can possibly come before this body fails to \nrecognize that traditional marriage and the rights of families and \nchildren are the most important elements of our societal function and \nwe need to protect them. We need to do it now and not wait until 2 or 3 \nyears from now when all this becomes mush and nothing will be able to \nbe done, such as on other bills that have occurred through the years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I understand we will be going back and \nforth. I wondered, because I have a time schedule, if I might ask \nunanimous consent that after the Senator from Vermont speaks--might I \nask how long he plans to speak?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I can't imagine I will speak much more than probably 10, \n15 minutes at most.\n  Mr. BOND. Might I ask that I be recognized for 5 minutes and then the \nprevious order, which was for the Senator from Texas and the Senator \nfrom Alabama to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such order in effect.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent to make such a request.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Following me.\n  Mr. BOND. Following the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 2636 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7881-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7881-S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FEDERAL BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, there is another important issue we have \nbefore the Senate. We don't yet have a Federal budget resolution, even \nthough we were supposed to have done that this spring.\n  It is July. We have considered only one appropriations bill, and that \nhas not been resolved with the House. We have not yet even considered \nthe other 12 appropriations bills, including the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. These are usually considered must-pass \nlegislation, whether there is a Republican-controlled Congress or a \nDemocratic-controlled Congress. Instead of passing these bills, \nhowever, we sit around not doing any work on the things that we \nabsolutely need to do. We are working on political matters. The \ndivisive constitutional amendment to federalize marriage is an example \nof that.\n  For 215 years, we have left it up to States to define marriage. All \nof a sudden, are we going to tell them they do not know what they are \ndoing? Are we going to take over the marriage issue from the States and \ndefine it for them? Are we going to treat this as a matter of urgency, \nthat we must proceed to immediately while setting aside homeland \nsecurity and the budget?\n  Heck, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held a few hearings on \nthis issue, has not even considered the language of this Federal \nMarriage Amendment. We have not even voted on it in the Republican-\ncontrolled Judiciary Committee. The fact that the Committee has been \nbypassed, and the FMA brought immediately to the Senate floor, is an \nunmistakable sign that political expediency--and haste in the \nfurtherance of political expediency--is why it is here.\n  Political expediency, whatever it takes, seems to be the leadership's \nguidepost, not the pressing needs of the country for homeland security \nfunding or a budget. I am afraid that the paramount thing for the \nRepublican leaders in this body at the moment are such divisive matters \nas federalizing marriage law by constitutional amendment. I remember \nthe days when the Republican Party would say we are going to keep the \nFederal Government out of the doings of the States. Well, now we seem \nnot only to politicize judicial nominations, making independent judges \na wing of the Republican Party, but to politicize the Constitution \nitself.\n  I think it is wrong. I think it is corrosive to seek partisan \nadvantage at the expense of the independent Federal judiciary or our \nnational charter, the Constitution. Maybe we should have a corollary to \nthe Thurmond rule, which is that in Presidential elections, after the \nFourth of July we do not consider judicial nominations, except by \nunanimous consent. Maybe we should have something called the ``Durbin \nrule.''\n  The senior Senator from Illinois observed that we should prohibit \nconsideration of constitutional amendments within 6 months of a \nPresidential election. I think he is right in pointing out that the \nConstitution is too important to be made a bulletin board for campaign \nsloganeering. Somehow we should find a way to restrain the impulse of \nsome to politicize the Constitution. I think we have 50 or 60 proposed \nconstitutional amendments before the Congress right now.\n  While we are doing this political posturing, let us talk about what \nwe might have been doing. I will take one issue, homeland security. \nThis week, we received further warnings from the Republican \nadministration about impending terrorist attacks. So what are we doing \nin the Senate to respond to those attacks? Why, we are going to launch \na debate over gay marriage.\n  The Homeland Security appropriations bill is stalled, but \nnotwithstanding the warnings by the administration that there are \nimpending terrorist attacks, first and foremost the Senate has to have \na constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. We cannot take time to \nbring up the Homeland Security bill, something that will probably pass \nin a day and a half.\n  If the American people are uneasy about their security during the \nsummer traveling season, that may be because of the conflicting signals \nthey are receiving from the Government. At least this time it was \nSecretary Ridge and not the Attorney General who appeared on our \nNation's television screens to warn of an impending al-Qaida attack. We \nmay remember a few weeks ago, when the Attorney General made dire \nwarnings the same day that Secretary Ridge, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, told Americans to go out and have some fun this summer. The \nAmerican people must wonder what is going on. They must find it hard to \nbelieve what is going on in this Senate, how we are using our time now.\n\n  I believe Congress should get on with providing the funding needed to \naddress our security vulnerabilities, even at the cost of forsaking \nsome of the President's tax cuts or a fruitless debate on marriage.\n  We have heard the administration say we are in dire danger. We have \ngiven them everything they have wanted: the Homeland Security \nDepartment; we have gone deep into debt; we have actually threatened \nthe Social Security fund by our huge deficits to give hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on the fight against terrorism.\n  It appears we simply cannot meet our needs with the resources we have \navailable. But what do we do? Do we address this in the Senate, the \ngreatest deliberative body on Earth? Heck, no. We are going to talk \nabout gay marriages.\n  Of course, the Republican Leadership has a history of not getting too \nconcerned about the substance of homeland security issues. The issue of \nhomeland security has been politicized from the start, and even the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security is a case study on the \npolitical partisanship of my friends in the Republican Party. We may \nrecall that at first they resisted strongly the idea of having a \nDepartment of Homeland Security especially the President himself.\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\n  Then we heard the partisan attacks from many Republicans on the 9/11 \nCommission, which the administration allowed to go forward in the first \nplace only after great resistance.\n  I hope and pray we can return to a time as we used to do, and as it \nwas when I came to the Senate, when security issues were not used for \npartisan effect or political benefit. Given the track record of this \nadministration for secrecy, unilateralism, overreaching, and abject \npartisanship, however, I certainly understand why many question their \nassertions. An administration that can hide legal memoranda justifying \ntorture and then, when forced to acknowledge them, disavow them, does \nnot earn our trust. An administration that reports that terrorism had \ndecreased last year and then, when questioned, had to admit that it was \nwrong and reissue the report has basic credibility problems.\n  So I wish we would turn away from these divisive legislative \nmaneuvers and work together on the Nation's agenda. The senior member \nof the Senate, Senator Byrd, said it all better than I can. He spoke \nyesterday afternoon about the need to get about our business and the \nNation's business. Senator Byrd offered wise counsel to the Republican \nleadership. I wish it had been listened to.\n  Roll Call reported earlier this week that this week's activities \namount to a showdown prompted by the Republicans' desire for a wedge \nissue they can use with undecided voters in November. That is a shame \nand a sham. When we should be considering measures to strengthen \nhomeland security, Republican partisans are focused on devising wedge \nissues for partisan political purposes. Well, that is wrong. I urge the \nRepublican administration and the Republican leaders in the House and \nthe Senate to come back to the work of Congress, not the work of \npolitical partisans. Let us complete our work for the American people.\n  The Senate does not have to be a battlefront for the Presidential \ncampaign. There is plenty of time for that. In fact, I wonder if we are \nnot setting ourselves up for people to say during the election season \nthat the Republican-controlled Congress did not do the work of the \npeople. Let us get on with doing it. One of the first things we can do \nis take the stalled Homeland Security appropriations bill and actually \nvote on it.\n\n  If the hundreds of billions of dollars we have spent so far have not \nmade us safe, then let us debate that and find what will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7882-S7883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I am very pleased to announce that today, \nabout 90 minutes ago, the report of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence on the pre-Iraq war has finally been released. We were \nbound not to talk about it until it was released at 10:30 today. Our \nstaff has done an excellent job reviewing 15,000 documents and 200 \nwitnesses, going back time and again to get the facts straight.\n  We came up with the unanimous conclusions that I think this body and \nour friends around the country, including the media, ought to pay \nattention to what is actually in that report. Some of my colleagues \nspent yesterday talking about the report and putting their spin on it.\n  I have been very distressed that the spin had nothing to do with the \nfacts that are actually in the report. It is a lengthy report. For the \nbenefit of my colleagues who have not been on the Intelligence \nCommittee, let me tell you a couple of things that were in the report.\n  First, the intelligence used by the President, the Vice President, \nthe chairman, and ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, along with \nthe rest of us, was the intelligence given to them by the CIA. This was \nintelligence given to them through three administrations. On the basis \nof that, on the floor the statement was made on September 19, 2002:\n\n       We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a \n     tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. \n     He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is \n     building weapons of mass destruction and the means of \n     delivering them.\n\n  Senator Levin stated that.\n  On October 10, 2002:\n\n       There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is \n     working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will \n     likely have nuclear weapons within the next 5 years. We also \n     should remember we have always underestimated the progress \n     Saddam has made in the development of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n\n  Senator Jay Rockefeller stated that.\n  These were conclusions that came from the best intelligence we had \navailable, that other intelligence agencies had available. Actually, if \nyou look at it, Iraqi Survey Group leader David Kay, when he came back \nto the United States, said we know that Iraq was a far more dangerous \nplace, even than we had learned from our intelligence because of other \nthings that were going on that were not fully reported.\n  We identified problems in this report. There was no human \nintelligence, which you absolutely need. There was faulty analysis in \nsharing of information among the various agencies. Some analysts did \nnot fully qualify the information that was not confirmed.\n  But despite the breathless headlines, despite the political charges \nthat are being made on the other side of the aisle, no one was \npressured to change judgments or reach specific judgments. In fact, the \ncommittee interviewed over 200 people, searching, searching, and \nsearching for those who might be pressured.\n  Chairman Roberts asked repeatedly, publicly and in hearings, that \nanybody who had information on pressure to change conclusions, come \nforward. Nobody did. They chased rabbits all through every brush pile \nthat could be imagined. Anybody who had an idea of pressure was \nchallenged. Do you know what they found? There was tremendous pressure \non the analysts because they had not put together the right information \nprior to 9/11. They felt pressure, but they all said it was pressure to \nget it right. They said it is the job of the intelligence community to \nrespond to the most searching questions of the people, the policymakers \nwho use it.\n  Let me cite three conclusions from the report, which I think are very \nimportant on intelligence. From page 284: conclusion 83:\n\n       The committee did not find any evidence that administration \n     officials attempted to coerce, influence, or pressure \n     analysts to change their judgments related to Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction capabilities.\n\n  Page 285, conclusion 84:\n\n       The committee found no evidence that the Vice President's \n     visits to the Central Intelligence Agency were attempts to \n     pressure analysts, were perceived as intended to pressure \n     analysts by those who participated in the briefings of Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction programs, or did pressure \n     analysts to change their assessments.\n\n  On page 359, conclusion 102:\n\n       The committee found that none of the analysts or other \n     people interviewed by the committee said they were pressured \n     to change their conclusions related to Iraq's links to \n     terrorism. After 9/11, analysts were under tremendous \n     pressure to make correct assessments to avoid missing a \n     credible threat and to avoid an intelligence failure.\n\n  These are the findings upon which we unanimously agreed. I think the \nVice President and others who have been politically maligned are \nentitled to an apology.\n  Do you know what this all comes back to? This comes back to a plan \nthat we learned about on November 6, 2003. I have in my mind a FOX News \nreport on this memo from a Democratic staffer. Nobody has denied it. In \nfact, they are playing their plays out of that game book now.\n  It talks about:\n\n       No. 1: Pull the majority along as far as we can on issues \n     that may lead to major new disclosures. . . .\n       No. 2: Assiduously prepare Democratic ``additional views'' \n     to attach to any interim or final reports. . . .\n       No. 3: We will identify the most exaggerated claims and \n     contrast them with the intelligence estimates that have since \n     been declassified. Our additional views will also, among \n     other things, castigate the majority for seeking to limit the \n     scope of the inquiry.\n\n  That is exactly what the game plan is that they are following. When \nyou look at the conclusion, the summary of that memo, it says:\n\n       Intelligence issues are clearly secondary to the public's \n     concern regarding the insurgency in Iraq. Yet, we have an \n     important\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\n     role to play in revealing the misleading--if not flagrantly \n     dishonest methods and motives--of senior administration \n     officials who made the case for a unilateral, preemptive war. \n     The approach outlined above seems to offer the best prospects \n     for exposing the administration's dubious motives and \n     methods.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. To sum it up, we are at war with terrorists. The terrorists \nwere in Iraq. They had access to the weapons of mass destruction that \nSaddam Hussein had produced in the past and were willing to produce in \nthe future. We have received increased briefings on recent threats in \nthe United States. The greatest danger we fear is that Saddam Hussein, \nhad we not taken him out, would be supplying those terrorists with \nchemical and biological weapons.\n  Our troops remain under fire, but some on this floor and some \ncommentators I have heard seem to be more interested in politicizing \nthe problems in the Intelligence Committee rather than getting at the \nroot of the problem. I hope we can put these partisan charges aside \nbecause there is much work to do to improve the gathering, the \nanalysis, and the dissemination of intelligence. For the good of this \ncountry, we need to put behind us this partisan effort to fingerpoint \nand make accusations that have been explicitly disabused and disavowed \nby this intelligence report.\n  I commend the staff of the Intelligence Committee. I thank the many \nthousands of dedicated people in the intelligence community who are \ndoing their best, under difficult circumstances, to get information \nunder systems that were not adequate for the needs at the time. We need \nto build a system where we get human intelligence, where we analyze it \nbetter, and where we share it among agencies that we have not done \nadequately in the past.\n  I thank my colleagues from Texas and Alabama for their courtesy.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    Raw Data: Dem Memo on Iraq Intel\n\n                     [From FOX News, Nov. 6, 2003]\n\n       We have carefully reviewed our options under the rules and \n     believe we have identified the best approach. Our plan is as \n     follows:\n       (1) Pull the majority along as far as we can on issues that \n     may lead to major new disclosures regarding improper or \n     questionable conduct by administration officials. We are \n     having some success in that regard. For example, in addition \n     to the president's State of the Union speech, the chairman \n     has agreed to look at the activities of the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense as well as Secretary Bolton's office at \n     the State Department. The fact that the chairman supports our \n     investigations into these offices and co-signs our requests \n     for information is helpful and potentially crucial. We don't \n     know what we will find but our prospects for getting the \n     access we seek is far greater when we have the backing of the \n     majority. (Note: we can verbally mention some of the \n     intriguing leads we are pursuing.)\n       (2) Assiduously prepare Democratic ``additional views'' to \n     attach to any interim or final reports the committee may \n     release. Committee rules provide this opportunity and we \n     intend to take full advantage of it. In that regard, we have \n     already compiled all the public statements on Iraq made by \n     senior administration officials. We will identify the most \n     exaggerated claims and contrast them with the intelligence \n     estimates that have since been declassified. Our additional \n     views will also, among other things, castigate the majority \n     for seeking to limit the scope of the inquiry. The Democrats \n     will then be in a strong position to reopen the question of \n     establishing an independent commission (i.e. the Corzine \n     amendment).\n       (3) Prepare to launch an independent investigation when it \n     becomes clear we have exhausted the opportunity to usefully \n     collaborate with the majority. We can pull the trigger on an \n     independent investigation at any time--but we can only do so \n     once. The best time to do so will probably be next year \n     either:\n       (A) After we have already released our additional views on \n     an interim report--thereby providing as many as three \n     opportunities to make our case to the public: (1) additional \n     views on the interim report; (2) announcement of our \n     independent investigation; and (3) additional views on the \n     final investigation; or\n       (B) Once we identify solid leads the majority does not want \n     to pursue. We could attract more coverage and have greater \n     credibility in that context than one in which we simply \n     launch an independent investigation based on principled but \n     vague notions regarding the ``use'' of intelligence.\n       In the meantime, even without a specifically authorized \n     independent investigation, we continue to act independently \n     when we encounter foot-dragging on the part of the majority. \n     For example, the FBI Niger investigation was done solely at \n     the request of the vice chairman; we have independently \n     submitted written questions to DoD; and we are preparing \n     further independent requests for information.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Intelligence issues are clearly secondary to the public's \n     concern regarding the insurgency in Iraq. Yet, we have an \n     important role to play in the revealing the misleading--if \n     not flagrantly dishonest methods and motives--of the senior \n     administration officials who made the case for a unilateral, \n     preemptive war. The approach outline above seems to offer the \n     best prospect for exposing the administration's dubious \n     motives and methods.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, Madam President, my remarks pertain to the issue \nof marriage. Of course, I have been here this morning while the \ndistinguished Senator, the current occupant of the chair, the chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, comprehensively laid out the reasons \nwhy this is an important debate.\n  I have also heard Senator Allard from Colorado and Senator Smith from \nOregon speak about this issue. I would like to associate myself with \neach of those comments. But I want to explain briefly my own reasons \nwhy I believe this is such an important issue.\n  First, I would like to respond to the comments made by the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Vermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. This is something that the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee has already touched on, but I think it is so important. We \nkeep hearing the same argument over and over again, so we really need \nto hit this issue hard.\n  But I think it is so important.\n  It is amazing to me to hear the Senator from Vermont and others say \nwe have no time to talk about the issue of marriage and the American \nfamily because there are more important issues we ought to be debating. \nThe truth is, while there have been Members on this side of the aisle \ntalking about this issue all morning long, there has been virtually \ndead silence on the other side of the aisle.\n  Then we hear comments that are made about, well, this really isn't \nthat important, and there are more important issues for us to talk \nabout: homeland security, the budget, appropriations, and the like.\n  But I concur with the comments made this morning by the present \noccupant of the chair, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nthat there is no issue more important in this country today than the \nAmerican family and preserving the traditional institution of marriage \nas the most basic building block in our society, one created for \nchildren in their best interests.\n  You know this common theme, that this issue is not important; it is \nnot one that has been demonstrated by the lack of presence on the \nSenate floor by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or even \nthe overt comments made about this not being an important issue. We \nhave had numerous hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, which I am honored to chair, and \nother committees in the Senate. Essentially, we have been met with \neither overt hostility or, in many instances no-shows, where Senators \nhave chosen to boycott a good-faith desire to have an honest discussion \nabout this issue and the threat that has been posed to the traditional \nfamily.\n  I, for one, am shocked and amazed at the attitude. Unfortunately, it \nis the reality we confront today and which the American family \nconfronts.\n  Of course, I have been concerned about this issue, as I think most \nAmericans have been, for a long time. But I note that in January of \n1999 when I served as Texas Attorney General, one of my \nresponsibilities--it was one of the few attorney general offices that \nhad this responsibility--was child support enforcement. It was my \nobligation, my duty, my privilege to enforce\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nchild support orders for about 1.2 million Texas children.\n  It is no secret to any of us that due to the growth of out-of-wedlock \nchildbirths now--about one out of every three children born in America \nare born outside of marriage; unfortunately, a fact that we all bemoan \nbut a real and present reality--that half of the marriages end in \ndivorce; that the American family is in fragile condition.\n  That is one reason I was so concerned when on May 17, 2004, we saw an \nassault launched on the American family and the institution of \nmarriage. But the truth is, we should have seen this coming. There were \na few people who did, but most did not.\n  I worry that the American family will not be able to sustain itself \nagainst this continued attempt to marginalize the importance of \ntraditional families and the importance of every child having a loving \nand supportive mother and father, which we all know as a matter of \ncommon sense, a matter of observation, and as a matter of social \nscience is the optimal situation for a child to be raised and grow \nup in.\n\n  I would be the first to say that there are heroic parents--single \nparents and children living in other arrangements--that adults do a \nheroic job of raising children in other-than-traditional family \nhouseholds. I congratulate them, and we ought to do everything we can \nto support them in every way we can because we know the optimal is not \nalways possible.\n  But that shouldn't cause us to shy away from or refuse to defend the \nimportance of the traditional family unit as the optimal situation in \nwhich children are born and raised into productive adults and have a \nchance to live up to their God-given potential.\n  We know that, as a sad fact of social science, children who are \nraised in a less than optimal situation through no fault of their own \nare at higher risk, that they are at higher risk of a host of social \nills. We hope and pray that they may overcome these higher risks. But \nwe know, tragically, that too many cannot. We see the evidence of that \nwith dropout students who fail to pursue their education because they \nsimply drop out of school, children who become involved in drugs and \nother self-destructive activity, children engaged in premature sexual \nexperimentation and pregnancy, and other problems that affect their \nability to grow up as fully productive and contributing citizens.\n  So we should not shy away from this debate when it comes to talking \nabout what is optimal, what is in the best interests of American \nchildren and American families.\n  I believe that fundamentally is what this debate is about.\n  Some people have asked me, Why is it that some seem to shy away from \nthis debate? I will tell you this: I think part of the reason is that \nsome people just prefer not to be called names or to have their motives \ncast in doubt. But I will tell you this: I believe with all my heart \nthat the people of this country believe in two fundamental propositions \nin addition to others.\n  No. 1, the American people believe in the essential dignity and worth \nof every human being.\n  At the same time, I think the American people overwhelmingly believe \nin the importance of traditional marriage and the traditional family as \nthe bedrock institution of our society and in the best interests of \nchildren. I don't think there is any conflict there. I think you can \nbelieve in both at the same time.\n  This is not about phobias. This is not about a desire to hurt anyone. \nThis is a discussion--an important discussion that we ought to have and \nwe are going to have about the institution of the American family and \ntraditional marriage as the optimal situation.\n  I fail to see how any one of us can remain neutral or on the \nsidelines when this debate is going forward. Indeed, we did not choose \nto engage in this debate at this time on this amendment. There is a \ndifference between launching an attack and acting in self-defense. The \nAmerican people know the difference. But I believe we must answer the \ncall to action now on behalf of the American family.\n  It was on May 17, 2004, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court declared \ntraditional marriage--remember these words because these are \nimportant--``a stain that must be eradicated.''\n  The Supreme Court, four members, the majority of that court, called \nit invidious discrimination to limit marriage to persons of the \nopposite sex, what we call traditional marriage.\n  They said ``limiting traditional marriage between members of the \nopposite sex lacks any rational basis.''\n  As has already been noted and as we observed on cable television and \nthe nightly news, this attack on the family and on traditional marriage \nthat occurred in Massachusetts was joined by lawless officials in San \nFrancisco and elsewhere around the country.\n  Soon the American people saw same-sex unions occurring on our \ntelevision screens, in our newspapers, and reported on the radio.\n  Tragically, it is not the adults who pay the price for the \nmarginalization of marriage as our most basic societal institution, it \nis our children who pay and pay and pay some more. Social science \nconfirms what common sense and simple observation dictate: When the \ninstitution of marriage is marginalized, children are at higher risk, \nas I mentioned before. In short, they are at higher risk for the sort \nof consequences that will follow them for the rest of their lives.\n  When the Massachusetts Supreme Court, following the decision of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, which I will discuss briefly in a minute, launched \ninto this radical social experiment in redefining the institution of \nmarriage, we have some glimpse of what that experiment may yield by \nwhat social scientists have been able to evaluate in Europe and \nelsewhere. We have seen what happens when government pretends this \nproblem does not exist until it is too late. We cannot afford to look \nback years from now and say we stood idly by while the American family \nwas marginalized into irrelevance.\n  How did we get here? How in the world did the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt, on May 17, 2004, decide that traditional marriage was a stain \nthat must be eradicated, represented invidious discrimination, and had \nno rational basis? They did not dream it up on their own. The origins \nof this language and this rationale for that decision came from the \ncase of Lawrence v. Texas. I have excerpted a segment of Justice \nKennedy's opinion for the majority of the Court because this is the \ngerm, this is the seed out of which this concept has grown and which \nnow, as I have stated, threatens to jeopardize the American family, \nfurther marginalizing the American family and, indeed, the traditional \ninstitution of marriage.\n  Relying on an earlier decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \nPennsylvania v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of \nthe liberty protected by the due process clause. For nonlawyers, they \nwere relying on this earlier decision and said that they were \nreaffirming the basis of that decision here. The Court went on to say:\n\n       The Casey decision again confirmed that our laws and \n     traditions afford constitutional protection to personal \n     decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, \n     family relationships, child rearing, and education.\n\n  In this following sentence, stated in the same place where they \ntalked about the liberty interests that protect marriage, they conclude \nby saying:\n\n       Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for \n     these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.\n\n  As Justice Scalia noted in his dissent, it was this juxtaposition of \nmarriage and this right of individual autonomy in one's relationships \nthat extends not just to heterosexuals in marriage but also to \nhomosexuals in their relationships that is the basis for the Court's \ndecision here. Not surprisingly, that was the very case cited by the \nMassachusetts Supreme Court in the Goodridge case when they held that \ntraditional marriage was a stain that must be eradicated, that it \nrepresents invidious discriminations to allow heterosexuals to enter \ninto that relationship but not homosexuals, and said that limiting \nmarriage to traditional marriage between persons of the opposite sex \nhad no rational basis.\n  Of course, the American people have not had a chance to express their \nviews on this issue. As was pointed out eloquently earlier, neither did \nthe people of Massachusetts. As it turned out, when the people of \nMassachusetts had\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\nthe chance to have their voice heard on this issue, they chose to \noverrule the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. The problem \nis in Massachusetts a constitutional amendment takes two consecutive \nsessions of the legislature, and they cannot amend the constitution \nuntil 2006 in that State. In the meantime, as we all know, since May \n17, clerks have been ordered to issue licenses for same-sex marriages, \nand this pending constitutional amendment of 2006 is too late to \neffectively let the people's voice be heard and control this debate.\n  We have seen what some have called ``government by the judiciary.'' \nWe believe in our fundamental constitutional documents. Our \nConstitution provides for government of the people, by the people, and \nfor the people, not government of the judiciary, by the judiciary, and \nfor the judiciary but government of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people. When we see an overturning, in essence, of the \nMassachusetts Constitution, 224 years after it was written, by a \nradical redefinition of marriage by a majority on the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court, it amazes me some of our colleagues would expect us to \nstand on the sidelines, mute, and expect us to be mere spectators in \nwhat is perhaps one of the most important debates we could possibly be \nhaving in this body or anywhere else around this country, and that is \nthe preservation of the American family and the preservation of \ntraditional marriage as the most important stabilizing factor in our \nsociety in a relationship that is most important for the raising and \nnurturing of children.\n  Some have suggested that this is not a Federal issue, this is not \nsomething the U.S. Congress should have anything to do with. Some have \nsaid in good faith--I think naively so but in good faith--well, let \nMassachusetts deal with that; that does not affect us. As already has \nbeen pointed out, people have married in Massachusetts under \nMassachusetts law and moved to 46 different States. Indeed, there are a \nnumber of lawsuits--I think at last count roughly nine lawsuits, maybe \nmore--where those persons, same-sex couples who married in \nMassachusetts, have moved to other States and filed lawsuits seeking to \nrequire those States to recognize the validity of those marriages even \nthough the laws of those other States do not recognize same-sex \nmarriage.\n  As was pointed out a little earlier, we should have seen this coming. \nIt has been coming for quite some time. It really did not start with \nLawrence v. Texas. Some of the most well-known legal scholars in the \nUnited States, such as Laurence Tribe, have been advocating this \nposition all along. He concludes after Lawrence, as he did beforehand, \nthat this was the death knell for traditional marriage in America. But \nhe said, ``You'd have to be tone deaf not to get the message from \nLawrence that anything that invites people to give same-sex couples \nless than full respect is constitutionally suspect.'' That is what \nleft-leaning liberal legal scholars have been saying for some time and \nwhat the Supreme Court embraced in Lawrence and now we have seen \ncarried to the next step, the logical conclusion, by the Goodridge \ncourt in Massachusetts.\n  But I guess what causes me such disappointment at the absence of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and of their statements--\nthose who have come to the floor and those who have shown up in \ncommittee--is saying this is not an important issue, that there are \nmore important issues.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The reason I say that is because in \n1996 the Congress passed--indeed, the Senate passed, by 85 votes--the \nDefense of Marriage Act which, as a matter of Federal law, defines \nmarriage as the union of one man and one woman.\n  Now what I fear is our colleagues who oppose this amendment, who \nvoted for the Defense of Marriage Act--they understand the Defense of \nMarriage Act is under threat and that a constitutional challenge will \nbe made to the Defense of Marriage Act based on this Lawrence \nrationale. Indeed, that has already occurred in the States of Utah, \nFlorida, and Nebraska, a Federal constitutional challenge that says: \nYour laws that limit marriage to traditional marriage, a marriage \nbetween one man and one woman, now violate the Constitution, using the \nvery rationale I described earlier in Lawrence, agreeing, perhaps, with \nProfessor Tribe. We are told this is not important, this is not worthy \nof debate, and there are other things that are more important. I \ndisagree. I think the American people, when this finally begins to sink \nin, will disagree as well.\n  Some people have asked me: Why is it there is not a greater popular \nuprising and outcry about this issue? Well, I remember when we saw \npeople getting married in San Francisco, same-sex couples there, and in \nMassachusetts, there was sort of a blip on the radar screen. Polls \nshowed that the American people, once they realized what was going on, \ndisapproved of what they saw. But, of course, we are all busy raising \nfamilies and going to work, and this perhaps has not been something \nthat has been sustained in their consciousness and their awareness. \nBut, indeed, this is an important issue and one that is under attack.\n  Some have said, though: Why can't we let Massachusetts do its own \nthing? And why can't each State decide for itself what its policy will \nbe? Well, we have seen, because of same-sex couples getting married in \nMassachusetts and moving to other States, that is not possible. \nRealistically that is not possible.\n  If you think about another aspect of what we call family law--let's \nsay the law of adoption--if one State says you can adopt a child under \ncertain circumstances, when that family moves to another State--when \nthey move to Texas, Utah, or somewhere else--we recognize the validity \nof that adoption, of that family law decision.\n  What I believe is some of our colleagues, indeed some of the American \npeople, are, No. 1, in shock at this radical transformation in our \nsociety's most basic institution. Secondly, after shock, people \nsometimes are in denial. They do not want to believe it. They do not \nwant to think they are going to have to deal with it. And then, after a \nwhile, the reality begins to sink in that this is indeed something that \nneeds to be addressed.\n  There are some who said: Well, if this is such a threat, why can't we \nwait until after the U.S. Supreme Court joins the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt in saying you cannot limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, \nbased on this rationale and the logical conclusion of the language I \nhave already described?\n\n  As you know, the U.S. Constitution has been amended 27 times. We have \nsome history, some track record of how long it takes the process to go \nforward. It requires, of course, as you know, a two-thirds vote in the \nCongress. It requires ratification by three-quarters of the States. In \nother words, it takes a little time. Some amendments have been adopted \nand ratified in as short as 8 months, but typically they take a little \nbit longer.\n  So what people are saying--if they want us to wait until after the \nFederal courts declare traditional marriage unconstitutional, if they \nwant us to wait until that time to raise this constitutional \namendment--they are, I suggest to you, inviting the same sort of chaos \nwe are seeing happening in Massachusetts. Because once same-sex \nmarriages occur, if months and maybe years later the Constitution is \namended to reinstate the status quo of traditional marriage, it may \nvery well be too late.\n  So I will conclude, because I see the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama in the Chamber, who I know has been waiting to address this \nissue. This is an important issue. This is an issue that deserves \nserious debate by serious people. This is an issue that cannot be \nlimited to one State. And this is an issue the American people deserve \na right to be heard on through the amendment process.\n  I would say, in conclusion, there are some who say the U.S. \nConstitution is a sacred document and should not be amended. If the \nAmerican people do not exercise their rights under Article V of the \nConstitution to amend the Constitution as they see fit--given that high \nbar, and given the deliberation that is required in order to meet that \nhigh standard--the only people who are going to amend the Constitution \nare judges--Federal, life-tenured judges who are accountable to no one.\n  I submit that is antidemocratic, it is contrary to the concept of \nself-government that is ensconced in our Constitution and was embraced \nby our Founding Fathers, and simply will not\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\nstand up under any close scrutiny. The whole concept that Federal \njudges ought to be the only ones to speak on what the laws are that \ngovern us is antithetical to a constitution that guarantees government \nof the people, by the people, and for the people.\n  Finally, I would say we have on this last chart a statement of intent \nby those who intend to pursue legal action across the country until \nthey reach their ultimate goal:\n\n       We will not stop until we have [same-sex] marriage \n     nationwide.\n\n  This was stated by a spokesperson for Lambda Legal, which is an \norganization that supports much of this concerted legal action across \nthe country in State and Federal courts, the logical conclusion of \nwhich is the judicial mandate of same-sex marriage.\n  I look forward to the additional debate and the words offered by my \ncolleagues on this subject. I hope those who have a different view will \nhave the courage to come here and tell the American people why it is \nthey think the preservation of the American family and the preservation \nof traditional marriage is unimportant. I think we can have a pretty \ngood debate. I hope they do not choose, instead, to stay in their \noffices or at home and hide from this issue. This is simply too \nimportant to the kind of country America is and the kind of country we \nwill become.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today the Senate has begun the formal \ndebate on the constitutional amendment that does something very simple; \nthat is, protect marriage. The question before us is fundamental: \nShould marriage remain the union between a husband and a wife? Marriage \nis the union between a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation, \nand has been, until this point, one of the great settled questions of \nhuman history and culture.\n  Yet our current legal system seems alarmingly out of step with this \nhistorical understanding of marriage. Over and against 5,000 years of \nrecorded human experience and social development, the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court has thrown out the definition of marriage. Marriage is no \nlonger to be understood as a covenant between a husband and wife in the \ninterest of their future children but, rather, the consummation of \nromantic attraction between any two adults. And they, these judges, \nappointed lawyers to these positions, imposed this radical change over \nthe strong objections of the people of Massachusetts, the Legislature \nof Massachusetts, and the Governor of Massachusetts.\n  Indeed, a number of local governments in California and Oregon and \nNew York followed the lead of the Massachusetts court, offering \nmarriage licenses in violation of State laws, in violation of State \nconstitutions. Same-sex couples from 46 States applied for marriage \nlicenses in these jurisdictions. There are pending lawsuits to overturn \nmarriage laws in 11 other States. It has become clear that the issue is \na national issue, and it requires a national solution, and thus this \ndebate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Last year's Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas, combined \nwith the Court's views of the constitutional clauses on full faith and \ncredit, equal protection, and due process, have convinced legal \nscholars of all political persuasions that the existing Defense of \nMarriage Act will be struck down. Harvard law school professor Laurence \nTribe said:\n\n       You'd have to be tone deaf not to get the message from \n     Lawrence that anything that invites people to give same-sex \n     couples less than full respect is constitutionally suspect.\n\n  Yale law professor William Eskridge agreed that the Lawrence decision \nwill add to the momentum for recognition of same-sex marriage.\n  The Harvard Law Review, last month, weighed in with its opinion: \n``The time is ripe for a constitutional challenge to DOMA'' because the \n1996 act ``violates equal protection principles.''\n  The truth is, the Constitution is about to be amended. The only \nquestion is whether it will be amended by the U.S. Congress, as the \nrepresentative of the people, or by judicial fiat. Will activist judges \namend the Constitution? Will they undo marriage as the union of a man \nand a woman? Or will the people amend the Constitution to preserve \nmarriage?\n  I say the people should have a voice. On such a fundamental question, \nthe only sure option is a constitutional amendment.\n  Some have argued marriage is already a weakened institution in \nAmerica and expanding marriage to same-sex couples will strengthen it. \nIt is true that marriage in this Nation today is not as strong as it \nshould be. But I question whether changing the definition of marriage \nwill help us strengthen the institution. We can look at what has \nhappened in other countries.\n  Scholar Stanley Kurtz has found that 10 years of de facto same-sex \nmarriage in Scandinavia has further weakened marriage. A majority of \nchildren in Sweden and Norway are today born to unmarried parents.\n  In the Netherlands, which adopted de facto same-sex marriage in 1997, \nthe proportion of children born outside of marriage has tripled. This \nisn't surprising. When the laws of a nation teach the next generation \nthat marriage no longer has anything important to do with bringing \nmothers and fathers together for their children's sake, how can we \nexpect otherwise? Rather than making marriage stronger, it has made \nmarriage optional for childbearing. And we know from social science and \nfrom common sense that children do best in stable two-parent \nhouseholds.\n\n  Conversely, children in broken and unstable homes suffer. They are \nmore prone to delinquency, more prone to poorer grades, high-risk \nbehaviors, a whole raft of negative social outcomes. Children need moms \nand dads. Marriage recognizes and addresses that need.\n  Yes, marriage is about love. But it is also crucially about pointing \nmen and women to the kind of loving union that binds them together and \nto their children. Far from strengthening the family, separating \nmarriage from childbearing and child rearing undermines the family and \ndistorts what we teach our children about the meaning of adult \ncommitment, responsibility, mutual loyalty.\n  As Governor Mitt Romney recently testified, the pressures to change \nhave already begun. The Massachusetts Department of Health has begun to \ninsist that even birth certificates must change. The lines for mother \nand father are being replaced by parent A and parent B. One wonders if \nparent A and parent B are even expected to be more than casually \nacquainted. So we can see that the implications of radically redefining \nmarriage are far reaching. They are dramatic. They are not private. \nThey are not measured.\n  As we proceed to debate this serious and intense issue, I urge all \nsides to accord one another respect. Let us agree at least on this one \npoint, that the Harvard Law Review is wrong and irresponsible when it \nsays that Americans who want to protect marriage are motivated by \nanimus or bigotry. And Cheryl Jacques of the Human Rights Campaign is \nwrong when she described marriage amendment proponents as ``hate-filled \npeople who will stop at nothing to achieve their discriminatory, \noffensive goals.''\n  Such allegations are neither fair nor true about the vast majority of \ndecent, law-abiding Americans. Nor do they help us understand the \nissues before us. Americans of all races, creeds, and parties are \ncoming together to protect marriage as the union of husband and wife. \nWe do so with respect for those Americans who disagree. The debate over \nsomething as basic and fundamental as marriage may be passionate and \nintense, but it need not be ugly and divisive. Amending the \nConstitution is a serious matter. We do not consider this action \nlightly. It is a serious matter that has to be addressed with the \nutmost respect, time for debate, consideration, and deliberation. That \nis what we will see play out on the floor of the Senate over the course \nof today and Monday and Tuesday.\n  Too many important decisions have been made by unelected judges. Far \nfrom settling issues, such sweeping decisions have only fueled the \ncontroversy. The American people have a right to settle this question \nof what marriage will be in the United States. That can only be done \nthrough the mechanism our Founding Fathers gave us for settling \nquestions of great national import. And that is the constitutional \nprocess. It is not autocratic but\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nsupremely democratic, consistent with the great principles of \nfederalism. The Constitution can only be amended if two-thirds of both \nHouses of Congress agree and three-quarters of the States, and it will \nonly happen if the great majority of the American people across this \nland agree. That is the democratic process.\n  Marriage is an issue that rightly belongs in the hands of the \nAmerican people. If the people do not speak, then the courts become our \nmasters by default.\n  Marriage and family are the bedrock of society. Before we embark on a \nvast untested social experiment for which children will bear the \nultimate consequences, we need a thorough public debate. It is my hope \nthat our debate in this body will add to the larger marriage debate \nalready underway.\n  Marriage is worth the time, energy, and attention of this Senate and \nof all the American people. The model of the family bound by marriage \nto fulfill its attendant responsibilities, indeed, is a worthy ideal.\n  The matter before us is critical. The debate before us is essential. \nLet's hold it with civility and respect. Let the debate be spirited, \nlet it be substantive, and let it be held now in this body, the Senate, \nfor this and future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7887-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7887-S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIORITIES AND ABSENCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes about \na subject different than the one we have been hearing about most of \nthis morning.\n  I rise as a proud member of the Senate. I treasure every moment that \nI serve here. I look at my voting record of over 20 years and I am \nproud of that record. It is important; whatever we do here is \nimportant. So I rise today to raise a question about a disturbing \ntelevision ad that President Bush is running against our colleague, \nSenator Kerry. The ad opens up with the President saying, ``I approve \nof this message.''\n  The President's commercial is called ``priorities.'' It criticizes \nSenator Kerry for missing votes here. The President's advertisement \nsays that ``leadership means choosing priorities.'' I could not agree \nmore because Senator Kerry has chosen the correct priorities, while \nPresident Bush has been absent from leadership--sometimes referred to \nas AWOL.\n  If you look at the priorities of these two men throughout their \nlives, you learn a lot about who was absent and who was a leader. \nSenator Kerry has never been absent, AWOL, from his responsibilities. \nThe President, on the other hand, has been absent at times when it \nrequired leadership. During the Vietnam war, an era in which 58,000 \nAmerican soldiers lost their lives, and many more than that were \nwounded, President Bush was AWOL from leadership, AWOL from serving our \ncountry. He was assigned to the Texas Air National Guard, but he was \nabsent from mandatory physicals, so he was grounded from flying. He was \nabsent from his duties. We will never know all of the facts about the \nPresident's National Guard service because, today, the New York Times \nrevealed that his records have been destroyed ``by mistake.''\n\n  If you look at Senator Kerry's history, you see a totally different \npicture. You see a man who signed up not just to join the Navy, but to \ngo to Vietnam to serve his country. Even though he disagreed with that \npolicy, he served bravely and courageously in a leadership role. He \ncommanded a swift boat and he led it bravely.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit with Del Sandusky, one of \nSenator Kerry's crewmen in the Navy. He tells many moving stories about \nthe bravery and leadership of Senator Kerry in Vietnam.\n  By the time he returned from Vietnam, Senator Kerry earned a Silver \nStar and a Bronze Star, which are high-standing awards for bravery and \ncourage in serving his country; and three awards of the Purple Heart \nfor his service in combat. In fact, a question has been raised about \nwhether he deserved the third Purple Heart. I don't know what that \nmeans. Does it mean we want to measure the depth of the wound to see \nwhether you pass a certain line, and the Purple Heart is one color or \nanother? The military has a process, and they said he is entitled to \nthree Purple Hearts. In my view, he is also entitled to the gratitude \nof this country for speaking up after he finished his service to talk \nabout what might have gone wrong with the decisions in Vietnam. But he \ndidn't ever relinquish or shirk his duties.\n  What about the President's service at this time? They won't reveal \nthe specifics. The records were destroyed, as we now know, and we will \nnever find out. In this current war, as our brave soldiers are battling \ninsurgents in Iraq, the President has not been honest about the true \ncost of this war. I am talking about the human cost as well as in \nmonetary terms.\n  The President has ordered that no cameras be allowed to film the \nflag-draped coffins of heroes returning from battle. In my view, that \nis disrespectful to these men and women who gave their lives for this \ncountry.\n  I went to a funeral at Arlington Cemetery, and I also went to the \nfuneral service of President Reagan. Each funeral had a similarity. \nThey had an honor guard of proud service people escorting the coffin, \ndoing their duty to say this Nation is grateful to these people they \nconsidered heroes. One act that the honor guard is required to perform \nis the folding of the flag and to finally put it into a triangle that \ncan be handed over to the family. I watched at Arlington Cemetery when, \ncrease by crease, each pair of service people--soldiers, marines, \nsailors--turned their part of the flag over. Finally, they folded it \ninto a triangle, and the head of the honor guard walked over to the \nmother of this man who died and handed it to her. You could see the \npride and the tears in her eyes with her family as she received this \ntribute from her country for her son's life.\n  The President has ordered that no cameras be allowed to film the \nflag-draped coffins of heroes returning from battle. In my view, it is \ndisrespectful. Other Presidents weren't afraid to show the American \npeople images of the honor guard receiving their coffins. In fact, \nPresident Reagan stood on the tarmac and publicly and openly received \nthe coffins of 241 marines killed by Iranian-backed terrorists in \nBeirut in 1983. President Clinton did the same for flag-draped coffins \nreturning from Kosovo. But President Bush hasn't been there. He is AWOL \nfrom this solemn duty.\n\n  When it comes to domestic issues, the President is AWOL from \nleadership. He was absent from funding the No Child Left Behind \nprogram. He signed it into law with great fanfare. But when the cameras \nwere shut off, his leadership stopped. The latest budget underfunds No \nChild Left Behind by $9.4 billion. The budget also proposes the \nelimination of 38 educational programs. That is absence from \nleadership.\n  When it comes to protecting the environment, the President is absent. \nHe refuses to make polluters pay for Superfund cleanups. He has \nproposed an outrageous rule to allow powerplants to spew mercury into \nthe air and water, which brings potential harm to our children and \nthose who are on the way to being born.\n  In the fight to cure disease, the President is absent. We have great \ntools to cure diseases such as Alzheimer's and juvenile diabetes at our \ndisposal, and that tool is the use of embryonic stem cells, but the \nPresident is refusing to allow such research to proceed for political \nreasons. That is an absence of leadership.\n  When it comes to our Nation's transportation needs, the President has \nbeen AWOL. He has threatened to veto the highway bill even though it \nenjoys overwhelming bipartisan support. That puts 1.7 million jobs at \nrisk at a time when we need to create jobs.\n  Thirty-eight percent of our roads are in fair or poor condition and \n28 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient. Traffic \ncongestion costs Americans more than $69 billion annually in lost time \nand productivity and 5.7 billion gallons of fuel annually is wasted \nwhile motorists sit in traffic. This absence of leadership on \ntransportation is harming American families across the country.\n  The President signed a Medicare drug bill into law and the law has \nturned into a confusing nightmare for our Nation's senior citizens, who \nare barely\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\ngoing to see little, if any, monetary benefit. That is an absence of \nleadership. Of course, the main benefit does not kick in until 2006, \nconveniently past the next election. He does not want the American \npublic to really see what is in that Medicare bill.\n  On homeland security, the President talks tough, but is he really \nthere? The President's budget would reduce funding for grants to local \npolice, fire, and emergency medical personnel from $4.2 billion in 2004 \nto $3.5 billion in 2005, more than a 15-percent decrease. Would anyone \nsuggest we have less to worry about from terrorists when we just heard \nthe dismal review by the Secretary of Homeland Security? The \nPresident's proposal will also cut first responder training by 43 \npercent.\n\n  The lack of leadership is not just at the White House. Unfortunately, \nmy Republican colleagues in the Congress almost always march in \nlockstep with the White House, even at the peril of their constituents. \nThis blind allegiance to the White House is having devastating effects. \nWe have seen our budget surplus turn into deficits as far as the eye \ncan see.\n  In Iraq, we bought the White House line and ignored military leaders. \nLook at the case of GEN Eric Shinseki, who said we need 300,000 troops \nin Iraq to do the job. He was right, but he was fired for telling the \ntruth. We have recently heard from one of the leading Army generals who \nsaid our forces are too thin, and as a result of that, it is fair to \nsay we have seen terrible casualties--879 Americans killed in Iraq, \nover 5,000 injured. If we had listened to General Shinseki and other \nmilitary experts rather than the White House, perhaps those numbers \nwould be less.\n  When the President said to the Congress, do not let Medicare \nnegotiate for drug prices, we should have said: Too bad. Prices are out \nof control. We see that in the newspapers regularly now. We need to do \nthis. Instead, the Republican majority said, ``yes, sir,'' and followed \nthe White House's orders, and drug prices keep soaring.\n  I say enough is enough. We are a coequal branch of the Government. \nLet us act like it. My Republican colleagues should stand up to the \nPresident when they think he is wrong.\n  Senator Kerry is on a noble mission to change the direction of this \ncountry for the better. In doing so, he is leading us down a path \ntoward a stronger America, and I can think of no better reason to \npursue that goal with every minute of time, with every ounce of effort, \nwith every bit of intellect he can muster. We wish him good health and \nsuccess, to lift our country out of the misery of worry about their \nchildren, their jobs, their parents, and their Nation. We wish Senator \nKerry Godspeed and hardly think of him as being AWOL. His record \ndisproves any notion of that.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7888-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7888-S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACTIVIST COURTS IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we finish up today, I want to share a \nfew thoughts on the problem we have with the activist courts redefining \nmarriage.\n  Marriage has been defined by every legislature that has ever sat in \nthe United States from every State, now 50 States, the same way, but \nnow we have unelected judges altering and changing that fundamental \ninstitution.\n  It is not a little matter. It is a very big matter. It is a matter \nthe American people have a right to be asked about. It is a matter the \nAmerican people have a right to be engaged in. It is an institution \nthat no one can dispute is central to American culture. Regarding the \nculture of any country in the world, the status of family and marriage \nis critical to that culture.\n  I had the privilege of chairing a committee that had a hearing on \nmarriage. It was a remarkable thing. Barbara Dafoe Whitehead was one of \nthe witnesses. She had written an article that was voted one of the \nmost significant articles in a news magazine in the second half of the \n20th century. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Mississippi, \nserved with Dan Quayle, the former Vice President and Senator of this \nbody. The name of the article was, ``Dan Quayle Was Right.''\n  She has since continued to study the science of families. She told us \nwhen she originally did her report she was criticized by academics \naround the country, but in the 10 years since she wrote that article \nthere is no dispute that children do so much better--every objective \nscientific test shows that--if they are in a traditional two-parent \nfamily. Indeed, the husband and wife do better. It is a healthy \nrelationship that the State, the Government--without any doubt, it \nseems to me--has every right to want to affirm and nurture and \nencourage through legislation.\n  To me, there is no discrimination whatsoever in a State deciding they \nare going to give a special protection to the marriage relationship \nthat produces children, who will eventually run our country when we are \ngone. Any nation, any country, and any State has an interest in \nproducing children who will take over and lead their country in the \nfuture.\n  They also have an interest in how those children are raised. It is a \nbig deal here. Some people in this body continually push for more State \nand Federal Government involvement in the raising of children. I will \nask you this: If there are not families to raise those children, who \nwill raise them? Who will do that responsibility? It will fall on the \nState. There will be a much less effective job done, at greater cost to \nthe taxpayers. Who could dispute that? I think the State has a \nremarkable and deep interest in it.\n  Likewise, when you have a universal, unequivocal, unbroken, \nconsistent decision by every State and virtually every nation, until \nthe last few years, that a marriage should be between a man and a \nwoman, I think anybody ought to be reluctant to up and change it; to \ncome along and say, well, you know, everybody has been doing this for \n2000 years, but we think we ought to try something different.\n  We should not do that. I mean, if you want to bring it up in the \nlegislature of the State of Alabama or the State of Massachusetts and \nyou want to debate it and have hearings on it and take evidence and \nthen you decide you want to vote on it, maybe that is one thing. But \nwhat we have had in this circumstance is a situation in which the \nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, citing language from the U.S. \nSupreme Court, up and declared it violates the equal protection clause \nof their Constitution to treat same-sex unions differently from \nheterosexual unions.\n  Maybe that is an equal protection violation. Maybe we could say that \nis what the Constitution says. But nobody, since the founding of this \ncountry, has ever interpreted it that way. What happens if a court \nmakes a mistake? What happens if a group of judges says: I don't like \nthe way the legislature has been handling this marriage thing. I don't \nthink they have been affirming same-sex couples' unions and they ought \nto do it. Why don't we rule that way? Why don't we do that?\n  Somebody says, How are you going to do it? They say, We will study \nthe Constitution. Here, it says everyone should be given equal \nprotection of the laws. So we can overrule the State legislatures and \nwe will say treating those two unions differently violates the equal \nprotection of the laws. We will declare it unconstitutional.\n\n  Where did that leave the people of Massachusetts? We are on the verge \nof it, if the U.S. Supreme Court does it, for the entire United States. \nWhere does that leave the people?\n  I remember in the early 1980s, Hodding Carter, who used to work for \nPresident Jimmy Carter, was on ``Meet the Press'' or one of those shows \nhe was on regularly and they were talking about judicial activism. He \nsaid the sad truth is we liberals have gotten to the point where we ask \nthe court to do for us that which we can no longer win at the ballot \nbox.\n  This cannot be won at the ballot box. It can only be imposed on the \npeople of America through a judicial ruling under the guise of \ninterpreting the Constitution. That is what activism is. It is judges \nallowing personal political views to infect their decision-making\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\nprocess, where they override the actions of the legislature.\n  I am sure some say they will pass a law and overturn the Supreme \nCourt. You cannot do that. It is important for everybody in this body \nto understand that. If the Supreme Court of the United States declares \nthe Constitution prohibits a differentiation between a traditional \nmarriage and other unions, the Constitutions of Massachusetts, or \nIllinois, or Alabama, or Mississippi is ineffective. It is trumped by \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  If we in the Congress pass a piece of legislation, a DOMA-like piece \nof legislation--I am sure it has been referred to earlier--it will not \nbe effective in the face of a declaration by the U.S. Supreme Court \nthat it is a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. \nConstitution to treat these unions differently. So it is a big deal for \nus.\n  We have one of the great institutions of our entire culture, for \nwhich there is virtually unanimous public support, virtually unanimous \nsupport among all the legislatures who have ever sat in the States of \nthe United States of America, and it is in danger of being wiped out by \nthe Federal courts.\n  I know Massachusetts has already so ruled on May 17. Less than 2 \nmonths ago they began to conduct same-sex marriages in Massachusetts. \nThey say those unions have to be given the same, equal treatment as the \nother unions.\n  I would ask, what about two sisters who live together, care for one \nanother, have been together 40, 50, 60 years? Are they treated as a \nmarital relationship? Why don't we call that a marriage? Two brothers? \nA brother and sister? A mother and a daughter who live together many \nyears without any kind of sexual activity? Why is this same-sex union \ngiven a preferential treatment over those unions?\n  When you get away from the classical definition of marriage, we get \ninto big trouble about where those lines will stay. The reason a State \nhas an interest in preserving marriage, traditional marriage, is \nbecause children are produced in that arrangement. Out of that \narrangement a new generation is born, raised, nurtured, trained, and \neducated. We need to affirm that.\n  We had an African American who spoke to a group of us yesterday.\n  He was Secretary of State of Ohio and he talked about that and how \ndeeply people felt about it and how important he thought it was.\n  Another African American was pastor of a 2,000-member church. He was \na bishop. He was also a city councilman in Detroit. He talked about how \nhard they have worked to overcome the breakdown of marriage in America \nand strengthen marriage in America.\n  We ought to be passing laws that encourage marriage, not discourage \nit. We ought to be, as a policymaking body, involved in establishing \npolicies that affirm that relationship. We know scientifically, we know \nintuitively, and we know morally that this is the better way.\n  I am not putting down single parents. I am not condemning people who \nhave a different sexual orientation. I don't mean that in any way \nwhatsoever. But the State, the government, has a right to define \nmarriage in the classical term because that is where children are born, \nthat is where they are nurtured, raised, and cared for. If the parents \ndon't do it, I guess the State has to, which is what is happening in \nEurope.\n  Earlier today, one of the Senators may have mentioned a new letter \nthat has come out of the Netherlands. Five scholars--social scientists \nand lawyers--have written a letter to warn that their actions in the \nNetherlands to affirm through legislation same-sex unions may well have \ncontributed to the collapse, decline, and very rapid disorder of \nmarriage in the Netherlands. We know that over 50 percent of the \nchildren in Norway, which a number of years ago created defacto same-\nsex marriage, are born out of wedlock. It is an incredible collapse of \nmarriage in northern Europe--Norway, Sweden and Denmark have declined, \nand the Netherlands has shown a rapid decline. These social scientists \nwarned other nations that are considering going in this direction, that \nare considering passing laws in this direction, that it would further \nweaken marriage and family.\n  We ought to pay heed to that. Why would we want to go down that way? \nWe do not follow the European model of national defense. We have an \nextraordinary, modern, and effective national defense capability that \nthe Europeans do not have. We do not follow the European model on \ntaxing and spending. That is why our Nation is stronger, more \neconomically dynamic, and is growing far faster than the European \nnations. They are not growing. Their growth rate is down. Their \npopulation is aging. They are having fewer and fewer children. Their \nwelfare rolls are growing. They have a workweek of 35 hours. We are \nsupposed to find more people more jobs so more people can work. And \ntheir unemployment is about twice ours.\n  We don't follow their idea on the economy, thank goodness. The \nsocialist model has not worked there and they are in a pell-mell race \nto secularize Europe. And we have not done that either. They don't \nallow a Muslim child to wear a scarf, or Christian child to wear a \ncross.\n  Why would we want to go that way? We should not go that way. We do \nnot have to. We can make a choice to go a different way.\n  Some in this country, and I think some on our courts, seem to believe \nthis is the wave of the future; that this is the enlightened Europe, \nand we ought to follow the enlightened Europe with a negative growth \nrate, I guess, and a rapid increase in secular relations in society. I \ndon't think we need to go there.\n  There is an opportunity and a big moment. This is a big moment. It is \nan opportunity for this Senate to allow the people of the United States \nto speak on this issue, to say how they want the future of this country \nto be handled, for them to say who is in charge of this country. As \nSenator Cornyn from Texas said earlier, when an unelected judge makes a \nruling in a political manner, like on the definition of marriage, it is \nan anti-democratic act. These are people, unelected, with lifetime \nappointments, not answerable to the public. If we vote wrong, you can \nremove us from office. That is the way the system works and the \nFounding Fathers all thought about it. That is what democracy is. But \nwe have unelected people not having hearings, not having debate, not \ngoing out and having town hall meetings throughout their State, as I do \nand most Senators do, listening to the people, thinking about the \nissues, having a sensitivity of what is occurring in society. They are \nsitting up there in their robes rendering rulings to go to the heart of \nwho we are as a people. I am concerned about it. I think we have every \nright to be concerned.\n\n  The substance of the matter is large. It is a very big deal. The \ndynamics of it are very crucial.\n  It is time for us as a people to utilize the power of the \nConstitution given us through our elected representatives to amend the \nConstitution. That is what it provides.\n  Frankly, when a judge redefines the Constitution's traditional \nmeaning and makes it say something it does not, that judge has amended \nthe Constitution contrary to the provisions in that document.\n  I remember back when I was U.S. attorney in Alabama. I had a parent \ncome to me and show me the textbook in the classroom. It said how the \nConstitution is amended. The one way was the amendment process, as \nprovided for in the Constitution. And they mentioned another way: \nAmended by ruling of the court. They are teaching children--the truth--\nwhich is courts, through their rulings, if they are not true and \nfaithful to the document itself, amend the Constitution.\n  We ought not to allow that to occur.\n  I think this would be in no way extreme, in no way improper, and \nhighly appropriate for this Senate to say let's let the American people \ndecide about this fundamental institution of marriage, and let us tell \nthe courts that we control life in this country, not them. They are not \naccountable.\n  Some say, well, this is all not going to happen; that you are not \ngoing to have the courts do this. It is not just not going to happen. \nIt is not thinkable. Was it thinkable that the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals in this country, the largest court of appeals in the United \nStates, would rule that ``under God'' could not be in the Pledge of \nAllegiance? When it got to the Supreme Court of the United States, do \nyou see\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\nwhat happened? They punted. They moved it out on procedural grounds and \ndid not state clearly what their view of it is. A number of their \nrulings, frankly, would indicate that it is not appropriate.\n  The Supreme Court has a problem in a lot of issues. They are not \nperfect. People are not without flaw. Many of these decisions are made \nby just a slim majority. It is not nine votes that are needed out of \nnine; it is only five, a majority. Five judges can redefine marriage \nand do a lot of other definitions that can impact significantly this \ncountry if they don't show personal discipline and fidelity to the law.\n  Let me just say this: This is the whole basis of a debate in this \nbody between our Members on the other side of the aisle and on this \nside of the aisle and President Bush over judges. It is over whether or \nnot judges will show restraint, whether they will remain true to the \ndocument, and not use the opportunity to rule as an opportunity to \nimpose their personal views on the American public. That is what this \ndebate is about over judges. It is not Republicans this, and Democrats \nthat, how many judges I confirmed here and how many judges you \nconfirmed there. It is a deep, fundamental difference.\n  The liberal activist groups in this country cannot win at the ballot \nbox. So they are determined to utilize court rulings like this to \nfurther their agendas that are contrary to the American people.\n  I make one point before I wrap up. We have the language from the U.S. \nSupreme Court, our Supreme Court. In Lawrence v. Texas, Justice \nKennedy, writing for a six-person majority, says:\n\n       In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. \n     Casey, the court reaffirmed the substantive force of the \n     liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\n  When the Presiding Officer was in law school and was taught law, I am \nnot sure he was told there was a substantive due process right to \nliberty. I don't think substantive due process is mentioned in the \nConstitution, but here we have ``liberty protected by the Due Process \nClause. The Casey decision again confirmed that our laws and tradition \nafford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to \nmarriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child \nrearing, and education . . . ''\n  This case has to do with whether a State could prohibit sodomy, and \nthey ruled they could not. It says in the case, Casey confirmed that \nour laws and our tradition afford constitutional protection. So we are \ndefining the Constitution, this says. The Constitution says you have a \nright to ``protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, \nprocreation, contraception,'' and more.\n  Then further it says:\n\n       Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for \n     these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.\n\n  Obviously referring back to marriage above.\n  That is a pretty good indication that the Supreme Court--in dicta, \nnot a holding of the case but in language and logic--made a clear \nsuggestion they were prepared to rule that heterosexual marriage could \nnot exist without homosexual marriage.\n  Let's hear how one of the brilliant Justices of the Court, Justice \nScalia, who believes the Court should show restraint, analyzed the \nimpact of it. Justice Scalia said it does mean we must recognize same-\nsex marriages.\n  Justice Kennedy says in the decision, ``The present case . . . does \nnot involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any \nrelationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.'' But, the logic \nand language I read earlier indicated that.\n  Justice Scalia, who dissented from the case, said in his dissent, \n``This case `does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if \none entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do \nwith the decisions of this court.''\n  Justice Scalia is correct. If you read the logic of that Court \ndecision, the language they used--dicta that it was--would indicate \nthat is where they are heading, and six judges signed off on that \nlanguage. It only takes five.\n  When a case comes up of this kind, we can say with certainty there is \na likelihood, and many scholars believe a very high likelihood, that \nthe Court would rule that traditional marriage is too restrictive, it \nhas to be changed from the way the people have defined it. We do not \nhave to accept that. We have every right to amend the Constitution. The \nlaws in the Constitution provided for slavery--that was changed. The \nlaws of the Constitution provide for free speech. It applies to every \nState. The right to keep and bear arms. All kinds of guarantees are in \nour Constitution. The American people can define what marriage is.\n  This amendment is narrowly drawn. It does not in any way threaten \nliberties. It does not take our money, it will not put us in jail, it \nwill not do all these horrible things that sometimes you have to deal \nwith in the law if you are not careful and the Constitution might get \naway from you. It is a narrowly drawn matter dealing with one issue, \nand that is marriage. We have every right to do that.\n  I am disappointed that some of the people I know, particularly on the \nother side of the aisle, are not going to vote for this constitutional \namendment, and they are not even here to talk about the amendment. They \ndon't want to talk about it. They say it is somehow wrong to discuss it \nduring a time when we are leading up to an election. What is wrong with \nthat? What is wrong with having a vote?\n  The reason it is coming up now is because a month and a half ago is \nwhen the marriages first started being conducted in Massachusetts, \nNovember was when the first ruling came out of there, and last year was \nLawrence v. Texas.\n  This has been building. Law reviews by liberal law professors are \npushing this issue all over the country. Lawsuits are being filed \nthroughout the country.\n  The pressure is on to destroy the traditional definition of marriage. \nIt is time and perfectly appropriate for us to deal with it. I hope we \nwill. The American people need to be watching this vote, watching the \nissues that are debated. They need to ask themselves how much \nconfidence they have in their representatives if they do not share \ntheir views on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, my friend, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, \njust prior to the cloture vote on the class action bill, made a \nstatement that I want to talk about briefly today.\n  He said Members can bring up nongermane or nonrelevant amendments \nafter cloture is invoked. I am reading from page S7818 of the \nCongressional Record where he said:\n\n       Keep in mind that if we invoke cloture, that doesn't mean \n     those who want to bring up extraneous, nongermane amendments \n     or nonrelevant amendments can't do it. They can bring them up \n     after cloture, but they are going to have to get a \n     supermajority vote to win. That doesn't foreclose them.\n\n  That simply is not valid.\n  If cloture is invoked, you can bring up a nongermane amendment, but \nif anyone raises a point of order that your amendment is not germane, \nthat amendment falls automatically. There is no such supermajority \nmotion available like there is under the Budget Act. The amendment \nfails without a vote--fails or falls without a vote, however you want \nto term it. The only way you can get a vote is if you choose to appeal \nthe Chair's ruling that your amendment is not germane. If you are \nsuccessful, you will set a precedent that will permanently throw out \nthe germaneness rule under cloture, and such an appeal of the Chair's \nruling is a majority vote, not a supermajority vote.\n  So the fact remains: Nongermane and nonrelevant amendments are not in \norder once cloture is invoked, and there is no such supermajority \nmotion available to make them in order.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to add to the statement I completed. \nIn the situation Senator Hatch talked about and I commented on, you \ncould the day before file a special motion and ask that the rules be \nset aside and that would take a two-thirds vote. So I guess that could \nbe the supermajority he was talking about. It would be extremely \ndifficult to do. You would have to file a notice the day before. I \ndon't think that would likely happen. But I wanted to make sure the \nrecord was clear that I did not miss anything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7891-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend the President for \nrenewing import sanctions against the repressive military junta in \nBurma. The quick action of both Congress and the President on this \nmatter underscores America's commitment to freedom and justice in that \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, there have been no significant developments inside \nBurma since I last spoke on this issue several weeks ago. In 2006, \nBurma is expected to assume chairmanship of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, ASEAN; there could be no greater loss of face \nto ASEAN or the region.\n  I am pleased that some of our allies in the European Union, E.U. have \ntaken a principled stand over Burma's participation in the upcoming \nAsia-Europe Meeting, ADEM. However, the United Nations must do more to \nrestore democracy to the Burmese people.\n  We need a full court press on the junta, which must entail the \ndowngrading of diplomatic relations with the illegitimate State Peace \nand Development Council, SPDC, by placing its senior representative in \nWashington on the next flight to Southeast Asia. We do not have a U.S. \nAmbassador in Rangoon; the junta should not have one here.\n  I ran into the SPDC's ``ambassador'' in Washington at a July 4th \ncelebration at the State Department, and told Mr. Linn Myaing to free \nBurmese democracy leader DAW Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  I find it incredible that someone from such an odious regime would be \ninvited to celebrate the independence of the freest country in the \nworld.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Warsaw, \nIN. Staff Sgt. Stephen G. Martin, 39 years old, died in the Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center in Washington, DC, after sustaining serious \ninjuries at the hands of a suicide bomber, just outside a U.S. military \ncompound in Mosul, Iraq. Stephen sacrificed his own life to save the \nlives of hundreds of fellow soldiers by causing the suicide bomber to \nignite the bomb before entering the compound. One other soldier also \nlost his life in this selfless and heroic action.\n  Stephen spent his early childhood and junior high years in Columbia \nCity, IN. He then moved to Pennsylvania and graduated from East \nPennsboro High School in 1983. Stephen later joined the Army's 101st \nAirborne Division and worked to become a member of the Trenton, NJ \nPolice Department, until he moved to Rhinelander, WI where he was a \nsergeant in the department. Just last year, Stephen joined the Army \nReserve 330th Military Police Detachment. He was deployed to Iraq to \nhelp train local police forces. Stephen's sister, Susan Fenker, told \nthe Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that Stephen told his family ``he was \nproud to help Iraqis build a free society and give hope to the next \ngeneration.'' With his entire life before him, Stephen chose to risk \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Stephen was the twenty-ninth Hoosier soldier to be killed while \nserving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his father, Jim; his mother, Carolyn; his wife, \nKathy; his two daughters, Jessica and Brianna; his son, Seth; and \nstepdaughters Jackie, Jessica and Kaitlyn. May Stephen's children grow \nup knowing that their father gave his life so that young Iraqis will \nsome day know the freedom they enjoy.\n  Today, I join Stephen's family, his friends and all Americans in \nmourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over his \ndeath, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting \nto make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of \ncharacter that people will remember when they think of Stephen, a \nmemory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict \nand grief.\n  Stephen was known for his dedicated spirit and his love of country. \nWhen looking back on the life of his late friend and co-worker, \nRhinelander Police Chief Glenn Parmeter told the Fort Wayne Journal \nGazette, ``He was always a soldier striving to bring about a better \nlife for everyone, whether as a Rhinelander police officer or a \nmilitary policeman in Iraq.'' Today and always, Stephen will be \nremembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true \nAmerican hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Stephen's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of Stephen's actions will live on far longer \nthan any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Stephen G. Martin in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Stephen's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Stephen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7891-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 14, 1992, Robert K. Woelfel, a transgendered individual, \nwas shot twice by a shotgun blast. Harold Maas, the assailant, claimed \nto have been assaulted by an unidentified transgendered individual the \nyear before and allegedly shot Woelfel in retribution for that crime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7891-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7891-S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am struck by the way the Republican \nmajority is managing the Senate. I have noted that we do not yet have a \nFederal budget resolution. It is July and we have as yet considered \nonly one appropriations bill, and that one bill still has to be \nresolved with the House. We have yet even to consider the other 12 \nappropriations bills that are normally regarded as ``must pass'' \nlegislation--that is unless Republicans intend to shut the Government \ndown, again.\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n  Instead, the Republican majority has apparently decided to devote the \nJuly work period to partisan political matters. We are reading press \naccounts about Republicans maneuvering to bring the divisive \nconstitutional amendment to federalize marriage to this floor for \ndebate. The Senate Judiciary Committee has held a few hearings on this \nissue but has yet to consider language of a proposed constitutional \namendment. Bypassing the committee of jurisdiction to bring this or any \nconstitutional amendment to the Senate floor is an unmistakable sign \nthat political expediency and haste, in the furtherance of political \nexpediency, are the guiding principles for the Republican majority in \nscheduling the Senate's time. Political expediency--whatever it takes--\nis their guidepost, not the pressing needs of the country to act on a \nbudget or on the annual appropriations bills. Paramount to Republican \nleaders at the moment are such matters as the divisive, hot-button \ntopic of federalizing marriage law, by constitutional amendment. \nRepublican partisans seem intent on politicizing not only judicial \nnominations but also the Constitution itself during this election \ncycle.\n  Democrats fulfilled our commitment to the White House when we \nconsidered the 25th judicial nomination that was part of our \narrangement this year. I read that Republicans will now insist on \ndevoting a good portion of the Senate's remaining time to the most \ndivisive and contentious of the President's judicial nominees. They are \nintent on following the advice of the Washington Times editorial page \nto, they believe, make Democrats look bad, when in fact it is the \nPresident who is seeking to make judicial confirmations a partisan \npolitical issue. Democrats have cooperated in confirming almost 200 \njudges already. That is more than the total confirmed in President \nClinton's last term, the President's father's presidency or in \nPresident Reagan's first term. Federal judicial vacancies have been \nreduced to their lowest level in decades.\n  It is wrong and it is corrosive to seek partisan advantage at the \nexpense of the independent Federal judiciary or our national charter, \nthe Constitution. I wonder in Presidential election years whether we \nshould not have a corollary to the ``Thurmond Rule'' on judicial \nnominations that we could call the ``Durbin Rule.'' The astute Senator \nfrom Illinois recently observed that we should prohibit consideration \nof constitutional amendments within 6 months of a Presidential \nelection. He is right in pointing out that the Constitution is too \nimportant to be made a bulletin board for campaign sloganeering. We \nshould find a way to restrain the impulse of some to politicize the \nConstitution.\n  This week the Republican leadership has stalled action for days on \nany legislation as it resists amendments to the class action \nlegislation from both Democratic and Republican Senators. The \nRepublican leadership's handling of this bill is a prescription for \nnonaction, not for legislative movement forward.\n  Just yesterday Roll Call published an insightful editorial lamenting \nwhat it called the ``Big Mess Ahead.'' I think we may already be stuck \nin that big mess. The editorial noted that ``July should be \nappropriations month in the Senate.'' I agree. This traditionally has \nbeen when we were focused on getting our work done and making sure the \nfunding for the various functions of the Federal Government were \nappropriated by the Congress, in fulfilling Congress's responsibilities \nand its power of the purse. Not this year.\n  Roll Call observes that ``the second session of the 108th Congress is \npoised to accomplish nothing.'' The way things are going, under \nRepublican leadership, this session will make the ``do-nothing'' \nCongress against which President Harry Truman ran seem like a \nlegislative juggernaut by comparison.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the July 7, 2004, Roll Call editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Roll Call, July 7, 2004]\n\n                             Big Mess Ahead\n\n        Here we go again. The Senate can't pass a budget \n     resolution. Only one of the 13 appropriations bills has \n     cleared both the House and Senate, July is a short \n     legislative month, and everyone will be gone in August. You \n     know what this means: a lame-duck session in November and a \n     messy, pork-riddled omnibus spending bill.\n        And it's not just on the money front that the second \n     session of the 108th Congress is poised to accomplish \n     nothing. The House and Senate can't agree on an energy bill \n     despite high gasoline prices, last year's Northeast blackout, \n     repeated urging from the White House and constant reminders \n     of America's over-dependence on risky Mideast oil. \n     Bankruptcy-reform legislation is stymied. So is welfare-\n     reform reauthorization. Maybe there will be a Transportation \n     reauthorization bill, maybe not. Even the Defense \n     reauthorization bill faces a tough conference.\n        Sure, the House and Senate have done a few must-do things. \n     The United States is in a war, so both chambers have passed a \n     Defense appropriations bill. And both have approved \n     legislation repealing a $5 billion-a-year export subsidy \n     after the World Trade Organization ruled against it and \n     authorized imposition of punitive tariffs against U.S. \n     products. Despite complaints from both parties about \n     expanding budget deficits, however, the House's repeal \n     measure contained $15 billion in new corporate tax breaks; \n     the Senate added $17 billion.\n        As any House Member will tell you, the perennial locus of \n     delay in Congress is ``The Other Body.'' And so it is this \n     year. The House has passed four appropriations bills, and \n     three more have cleared committee. In the Senate, it's one \n     and one. July should be appropriations month in the Senate, \n     but instead Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) has \n     scheduled class-action tort reform--which had the 60 votes \n     necessary for passage last November--and an anti-gay-marriage \n     constitutional amendment designed mainly to embarrass \n     Democrats before their national convention.\n        Republicans blame Democrats for Senate ``obstructionism,'' \n     but the failure to pass a budget resolution--which would have \n     made it easier to pass appropriations bills--is mainly an \n     intra-GOP affair. Moderates want to impose a pay-as-you-go \n     system to restrain spending. Conservatives, ironically \n     enough, don't. The situation has the conservative Senate \n     leadership so exercised that it's trying to acquire the means \n     to threaten wayward moderates with the loss of committee \n     chairmanships.\n        It's true that if Senate Republicans drop the seniority \n     system and give leaders the power to make committee \n     assignments and choose chairmen, they simply will be \n     following the authoritarian patter of Senate Democrats and of \n     both parties in the House. Still, the effect would be to \n     smother centrism--what there is left of it--and enhance \n     partisanship and polarization. That's a distinct \n     Congressional pattern: When things are going badly, make them \n     worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7892-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7892-S7893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERROGATION AND TREATMENT OF FOREIGN PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a number of us remain concerned about the \nabuse of foreign prisoners, and about the guidance provided by the \nPresident's lawyers with regard to torture. Much has happened since \nJune 17, 2004, when the Judiciary Committee defeated, on a party-line \nvote, a subpoena resolution for documents relating to the interrogation \nand treatment of detainees and June 23, when the Senate defeated an \namendment to the Defense Authorization bill on a party-line vote that \nwould have called upon the Attorney General to produce relevant \ndocuments to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Because of continued \nstonewalling by the administration, we remain largely in the dark.\n  Several Republican Senators have indicated that we should give the \nadministration more time to respond to inquiries, although some of us \nhad been asking for information for more than a year. The Republican \nadministration continues its refusal to provide the documents that have \nbeen requested and refused even to provide an index of the documents \nbeing withheld.\n  The Department of Justice admitted in the July 1 letter that it had \n``given specific advice concerning specific interrogation practices,'' \nbut would not disclose such advice to members of this committee, who \nare duly elected representatives of the people of the United States, as \nwell as members of the committee of oversight for the Department of \nJustice. USA Today reported on June 28, 2004, that the Justice \nDepartment issued a memo in August 2002 that ``specifically authorized \nthe CIA to use `waterboarding,'' ' an interrogation technique that is \ndesigned to make a prisoner believe he is suffocating. This memo is \nreportedly classified and has not been released. According to USA \nToday: ``Initially, the Office of Legal Counsel was assigned the task \nof approving specific interrogation techniques, but high-ranking \nJustice Department officials intercepted the CIA request, and the \nmatter was\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\nhandled by top officials in the deputy attorney general's office and \nJustice's criminal division.''\n  So while former administration officials grant press interviews and \nwrite opinion articles denying wrongdoing; while the White House and \nJustice Department hold closed briefings for the media to disavow the \nreasoning of this previously relied upon memoranda and to characterize \nwhat happened; Senators of the United States are denied basic \ninformation and access to the facts. The significance of such \nunilateralism and arrogance shown to the Congress and to its oversight \ncommittees cannot continue.\n  I have long said that somewhere in the upper reaches of this \nadministration a process was set in motion that rolled forward until it \nproduced this scandal. To put this scandal behind us, first we need to \nunderstand what happened. We cannot get to the bottom of this until \nthere is a clear picture of what happened at the top. It is the \nresponsibility of the Senate, including the Judiciary Committee, to \ninvestigate the facts, from genesis to final approval to implementation \nand abuse. The documents must be subject to public scrutiny, and we \nwill continue to demand their release.\n  There is ample evidence that American officials, both military and \nCIA, have used extremely harsh interrogation techniques overseas, and \nthat many prisoners have died in our custody. Administration officials \nadmit that 37 foreign prisoners have died in captivity, and several of \nthese cases are under investigation, some as homicides. On June 17, \nDavid Passaro, a CIA contractor, was indicted for assault for beating \nan Afghan detainee with a large flashlight. The prisoner, who had \nsurrendered at the gates of a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, died \nin custody on June 21, 2003, just days before I received a letter from \nthe Bush administration saying that our Government was in full \ncompliance with the Torture Convention.\n  Some individuals who committed abusive acts are being punished, as \nthey must be. But what of those who gave the orders, set the tone or \nlooked the other way? What of the White House and Pentagon lawyers who \ntried to justify the use of torture in their legal arguments? The White \nHouse has now disavowed the analysis contained in the August 1, 2002, \nmemo signed by Jay Bybee, then head of the Office of Legal Counsel. \nThat memo, which was sent to the White House Counsel, argued that for \nacts to rise to the level of torture, they must go on for months or \neven years, or be so severe as to generate the type of pain that would \nresult from organ failure or even death. The White House and DOJ now \ncall that memo ``irrelevant'' and ``unnecessary'' and say that DOJ will \nspend weeks rewriting its analysis.\n  As we all know, on June 22, 2004, the White House released a few \nhundreds of pages of documents--a self-serving and highly selective \nsubset of materials. The documents that were released raised more \nquestions than they answered. Now, more than two weeks later, none of \nthose issues have been resolved.\n  For example, the White House released a January 2002 memo signed by \nPresident Bush calling for the humane treatment of detainees. Did the \nPresident sign any orders or directives after January 2002? Did he sign \nany with regard to prisoners in Iraq?\n  Why did Secretary Rumsfeld issue and later rescind tough \ninterrogation techniques? And how did these interrogation techniques \ncome to be used in Iraq, where the administration maintains that it has \nfollowed the Geneva Conventions?\n  Where is the remaining 95 percent of material requested by members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee? Why is the White House withholding \nrelevant documents dated after April 2003?\n  I was gratified that the Senate on June 23 passed an amendment that I \noffered to the Defense authorization bill that will clarify U.S. policy \nwith regard to the treatment of prisoners and increase transparency. \nBut the stonewalling continues: The Pentagon opposes this amendment. I \nam hopeful that we will prevail in keeping this provision in the bill. \nFive Republican Senators supported the amendment against an attempt to \ntable it. I thank each of them. I also want to commend the Senate for \nadopting, also as part of the Defense authorization bill, the Durbin \namendment against torture, and I want to acknowledge an important step \ntaken in the House on the same day. The House Appropriations Committee \nadded language to the 2005 Justice Department spending bill that would \nprohibit any department official or contractor from providing legal \nadvice that could support or justify use of torture.\n  As it completed its term, the Supreme Court issued its decisions in \nhighly significant cases involving the legal status of so-called enemy \ncombatants. The Court reaffirmed the judiciary's role as a check and a \nbalance, as the Constitution intends, on power grabs by the executive \nbranch. The Court ruled that the Bush administration's assertion that \nthe President can hold suspects incommunicado, indefinitely and without \ncharge, is as arrogant as are its legal arguments that the President \ncan authorize torture. No President is above the law or the \nConstitution. The Court properly rejected the administration's plea to \n`just trust us' and repudiated its assertion of unchecked power.\n  This Senate and in particular the Judiciary Committee continues to \nfall short in its oversight responsibilities. President Bush has said \nhe wants the whole truth, but he and his administration instead have \ncircled the wagons to forestall adequate oversight. The President must \norder all relevant agencies to release the memos from which these \npolicies were devised. There needs to be a thorough, independent \ninvestigation of the actions of those involved, from the people who \ncommitted abuses, to the officials who set these policies in motion. \nOnly when these actions are taken will we begin to heal the damage that \nhas been done.\n  We need to get to the bottom of this scandal if we are to play our \nproper role in improving security for all Americans, both here at home \nand around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7893-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7893-S7896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THREAT TO ONLINE PRIVACY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to address a recent court decision \nthat has exposed America's e-mails to snooping and invasive practices. \nThe 2-to-1 decision by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in a case \ncalled United States v. Councilman has dealt a serious blow to online \nprivacy. The majority--both, Republican-appointed judges--effectively \nconcluded that it was permissible for an Internet Service Provider to \ncomb through its customers' emails for corporate gain. If allowed to \nstand, this decision threatens to eviscerate Congress's careful efforts \nto ensure that privacy is protected in the modern information age.\n  The indictment in Councilman charged the defendant ISP with violating \nthe Federal Wiretap Act by systematically intercepting, copying, and \nthen reading its customers' incoming emails to learn about its \ncompetitors and gain a commercial advantage. This is precisely the type \nof behavior that Congress wanted to prohibit when it updated the \nWiretap Act in 1986, as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy \nAct (ECPA), to prohibit unauthorized interceptions of electronic \ncommunications. Congress's goal was to ensure that Americans enjoyed \nthe same amount of privacy in their online communications as they did \nin the offline world. Just as eavesdroppers were not allowed to tap \nphones or plant ``bugs'' in order to listen in on our private \nconversations, we wanted to ensure that unauthorized eyes were not \npeering indiscriminately into our electronic communications.\n  ECPA was a careful, bipartisan and long-planned effort to protect \nelectronic communications in two forms--from real-time monitoring or \ninterception as they were being delivered, and from searches when they \nwere stored in record systems. We recognized these as different \nfunctions and set rules for each based on the relevant privacy \nexpectations and threats to privacy implicated by the different forms \nof surveillance.\n  The Councilman decision turned this distinction on its head. \nFunctionally, the ISP in this case was intercepting emails as they were \nbeing delivered, yet the majority ruled that the relevant rules were \nthose pertaining to stored communications, which do not apply to ISPs. \nThe majority rejected the Government's argument that an\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\nintercept occurs--and the Wiretap Act applies--when an email is \nacquired contemporaneously with its transmission, regardless of whether \nthe transmission may have been in electronic storage for milliseconds \nat the time of the acquisition. As the dissenting judge found, the \nGovernment's interpretation of the Wiretap Act is consistent with \nCongressional intent and with the realities of electronic communication \nsystems. I agree, and urge the Justice Department to continue to press \nthis position in the courts. The Department has been a powerful \nproponent of privacy rights in this case, and I commend its efforts.\n  I also will be taking a close look at possible changes to the law to \nensure that there is no room to skirt the wiretap provisions and engage \nin the type of privacy violation at issue in the Councilman case. We \nhave an obligation to ensure that our laws keep up with technology, and \nit may be that advances in communications warrant change. It is \nimperative that we continue to safeguard privacy adequately in our \nmodern information age.\n  In a world where Americans are already inundated with targeted mass \nmarketing and mailings, the Councilman decision opens the door to even \nmore invasive activity. With this kind of precedent, ISPs need not \noffer free services in exchange for reduced online privacy. They could \nsimply snoop in secret, and their unsuspecting customers would never \nknow.\n  The Councilman decision also opens the door to Government over-\nreaching. For practical reasons, surveillance devices are often \ninstalled at the point of millisecond-long temporary storage prior to \nan e-mail's arrival at its final destination. To date, law enforcement \nagencies have treated this as what it is--an interception--and have \nsought appropriate wiretap approval. But this decision allows law \nenforcement agents to potentially skip the rigors of the wiretap laws, \nand perhaps could unleash unrestrained use of search programs like \nCarnivore. This outcome belies the realities of electronic \ncommunications in today's society, undercuts Congress' intent, and is \ninconsistent with the current approach to such communications in law \nenforcement practice.\n  The Councilman decision creates an instant and enormous gap in \nprivacy protection for email communications, and we need to address it \nswiftly and responsibly. I urge my colleagues to make this a top \npriority as we finish up the session. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record four recent editorials and articles on this \nissue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 2, 2004]\n\n                         Derail E-Mail Snooping\n\n       Imagine that your friendly local mail carrier, before \n     delivering a letter for you, decides to steam it open and \n     read its contents. An outrageous and illegal infringement on \n     your privacy, obviously. But a Federal appeals court in \n     Boston has just permitted an Internet service provider to \n     engage in exactly this kind of snooping when the message is \n     sent in cyberspace rather than by snail mail. This ruling is \n     an unnecessarily cramped parsing of a law that Congress meant \n     to guard, not eviscerate, the privacy of communications. The \n     Justice Department, whose prosecution of the ISP executive \n     was thrown out by the appeals court, should seek a review of \n     the ruling. If that doesn't work--if the Federal wiretapping \n     law has been outpaced by the technology it was supposed to \n     regulate--Congress should quickly step in to fix the glitch.\n       The wiretapping law makes it a crime to intentionally \n     intercept ``any wire, oral, or electronic communication.'' \n     This language dates to 1986, when e-mail was at an embryonic \n     stage but Congress, in an effort to account for and \n     anticipate that and other technological changes, enacted the \n     Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n       The appeals court, however, ruled that opening and reading \n     e-mails isn't covered by the wiretapping law because the \n     messages weren't actually intercepted, as the law defines \n     that term, but were, rather, in ``electronic storage'' and \n     therefore covered by another, looser law. That finding stems \n     from the peculiar nature of e-mail transmission, in which \n     messages are briefly stored as they're transmitted from \n     computer to computer. As the court itself acknowledged, that \n     would leave little privacy for e-mail: ``It may well be that \n     the protections of the Wiretap Act have been eviscerated as \n     technology advances.''\n       In practcal terms, the implications of the ruling are \n     perhaps more troubling for the restraints it lifts on law \n     enforcement than for the theoretical leeway it gives service \n     providers to copy and read e-mails. The facts of the case \n     were unusual: A small online company that sold out-of-print \n     books and also provided free e-mail service wanted to peek at \n     Amazon.com's sales strategy and copied all of Amazon's \n     messages to the smaller company's customers. Mainstream ISPs \n     have policies that eschew such spying, and the customer \n     backlash that would ensure if they engaged in similar \n     practices would probably deter them from doing so. But the \n     ruling highlights the need for stringent privacy policies in \n     which customers give clear--and informed--consent.\n       Of more concern, the case could make it far easier for law \n     enforcement agents to engage in real-time monitoring of e-\n     mail and similar traffic, like instant messaging, without \n     complying with the strict rules applied to wiretaps. Under \n     this reading of the law, agents would still need to show \n     probable cause to obtain search warrants from a judge. But \n     they wouldn't have to hew to the more exacting requirements \n     of the wiretap law.\n       E-mail has become too ubiquitous, too central a facet of \n     modern life, for this ruling to stand.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 2, 2004]\n\n                          Intercepting E-Mail\n\n       When you click on ``send'' to deliver that e-mail note to \n     your lover, mother or boss, you realize that you are not \n     communicating directly with that person. As you well know, \n     you have stored the e-mail on the computer of your Internet \n     service provider, which, as you also know, may read, copy and \n     use the note for its own purposes before sending it on.\n       What, you didn't know all this? Sounds ludicrous? We would \n     have thought so, too, but a Federal appeals court recently \n     ruled that companies providing e-mail services could read \n     clients' e-mail notes and use them as they wish. Part of its \n     rationale was that none of this would shock you because you \n     have never expected much online privacy.\n       Count us among the shocked. The decision, on a 2-to-1 vote \n     by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     First Circuit in Massachusetts, sets up a frightening \n     precedent, one that must be reversed by the courts, if not \n     the Congress. It's true that people are aware of some limits \n     on online privacy, particularly in the workplace. But the \n     notion that a company like America Online, essentially a \n     common carrier, has the right to read private e-mail is \n     ludicrous.\n       All major I.S.P.s, including AOL, say they have no interest \n     in doing that and have privacy policies against it. The case \n     before the First Circuit involved a small online bookseller, \n     no longer in business, that also provided e-mail service. To \n     learn about the competition, the company copied and reviewed \n     all e-mail sent from Amazon.com to its e-mail users. One of \n     its executives was indicted on an illegal-wiretapping charge.\n       Both the trial and appeals courts ruled that the Federal \n     wiretap law, which makes it a crime to intercept any ``wire, \n     oral or electronic communication,'' did not apply because \n     there had been no actual interception. Technically speaking, \n     the judges held, the bookseller had simply copied e-mail \n     notes stored on its servers, and different laws apply to the \n     protection of stored communications.\n       These laws were drafted before e-mail emerged as a form of \n     mass communication, so there is some ambiguity in how to \n     apply them. But as the dissenting judge on the appellate \n     panel noted, his two colleagues interpreted the wiretap \n     statute far too narrowly. What's more, their analysis was \n     predicated on the bizarre notion that our e-mail notes are \n     not in transit once we send them, but in storage with an \n     intermediary. The same logic would suggest that the postal \n     service can read your letters while they are in ``storage.''\n       Americans' right to privacy will be seriously eroded if e-\n     mail is not protected by wiretap laws. The implications of \n     this erosion extend beyond the commercial realm. The \n     government will also find it easier to read your e-mail if it \n     does not have to get a wiretap order to do so. Congress ought \n     to update the law to make it clear that e-mail is entitled to \n     the same protection as a phone call.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Court Creates Snoopers' Heaven\n\n                             (By Kim Zetter)\n\n        It was a little court case, but its impact on e-mail users \n     could be huge.\n        Last week a Federal appeals court in Massachusetts ruled \n     that an e-mail provider did not break the law when he copied \n     and read e-mail messages sent to customers through his \n     server.\n        Upholding a lower-court decision that the provider did not \n     violate the Wiretap Act, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals set a precedent for e-mail service providers to \n     legally read e-mail that passes through a network.\n        The court ruled (PDF) that because the provider copied and \n     read the mail after it was in the company's computer system, \n     the provider did not intercept the mail in transit and, \n     therefore, did not violate the Wiretap Act.\n        It's a decision that could have far-reaching effects on \n     the privacy of digital communications, including stored \n     voicemail messages.\n        In 1998, Bradford C. Councilman was the vice president of \n     Interloc, a company selling rare and out-of-print books that \n     offered book-dealer customers e-mail accounts\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n     through its Web site. Unknown to those customers, Councilman \n     had engineers write and install code on the company network \n     that would copy any e-mail sent to customers from Amazon.com, \n     a competitor in the rare-books field.\n        Although Councilman did not prevent customers from \n     receiving their e-mail, he read thousands of copied messages \n     to discover what books customers were seeking and gain a \n     commercial advantage over Amazon. Interloc was later bought \n     by Alibris, which was unaware that Councilman had installed \n     the code on the system.\n        Councilman wasn't caught because customers complained \n     about his actions; a tip about another, unrelated issue led \n     authorities to discover what he had done.\n        But just what had Councilman done that was so bad?\n        Everyone knows that e-mail is an insecure form of \n     communication. Like a postcard, unencrypted correspondence \n     sent over the Internet is open to snooping by anyone.\n       Additionally, companies have the right to read their \n     employees' e-mail, since the companies own the computer \n     systems through which the correspondence passes, and \n     employees send the mail on company time. And ISPs scan e-mail \n     for viruses and spam all the time, before delivering the mail \n     to the provider's customers.\n       But there is an expectation that service providers will \n     access communications only with permission from customers, or \n     when they need to do so to maintain their network. In fact, \n     the Wiretap Act states that a provider shall not ``intercept, \n     disclose, or use'' communication passing through its network \n     ``except for mechanical or service quality control checks.''\n       In April, Google launched an e-mail program called Gmail \n     that gives customers 1 GB of e-mail storage in exchange for \n     letting Google's computers scan the content of incoming e-\n     mails to seed them with related text ads. Gmail customers \n     agree to let a computer read their e-mail.\n       In contrast, Councilman personally read customers' messages \n     to undermine his competitors' business. He did no without \n     customers' permission and with the knowledge that if his \n     customers found out, his company would likely lose their \n     business.\n       And yet the court found him innocent of violating the \n     specific law under which authorities charged him.\n       The court ruled that because the mail was already on \n     Councilman's computer network when he accessed it, he didn't \n     intercept it in transit and therefore was not guilty under \n     the Wiretap Act. The court said the mail was in storage at \n     that point and, therefore, was governed under the Stored \n     Communications Act.\n       In a similar case in 1991, the U.S. Secret Service seized \n     three computers belonging to a company called Steve Jackson \n     Games. The company, in addition to producing fantasy books \n     and games, hosted an online bulletin board for gamers to \n     communicate with one another. An employee of the company was \n     under suspicion for activities conducted outside work, but \n     the Secret Service confiscated his employer's computers as \n     well. The Secret Service accessed, read and deleted 162 e-\n     mail messages that were stored on the computers used for the \n     bulletin board.\n       In a suit filed by the game company against the Secret \n     Service, a federal district court found that while the Secret \n     Service agents did not intercept the e-mail, and thus violate \n     the Wiretap Act, they did violate the Stored Communications \n     Act.\n       Pete Kennedy, the lawyer from the Texas-based firm that \n     litigated the case, called the decision ``a solid first step \n     toward recognizing that computer communications should be as \n     well-protected as telephone communications.''\n       The Stored Communications Act, along with the Wiretap Act, \n     is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which \n     protects electronic, oral and wire communications.\n       But because Councilman was charged under the Wiretap Act \n     and not the Stored Communications Act, the court had to rule \n     in his favor. But even if prosecutors had wanted to charge \n     him under the Stored Communications Act, they could not have \n     done so, since service providers are exempted under the Act.\n       What this means is that before the Councilman case, ISPs \n     that read their customers' mail without permission could only \n     have been prosecuted under the Wiretap Act. But now the \n     Councilman case eliminates that possibility as well.\n       The problem with interpreting e-mail on an ISP's server as \n     stored communication is that it opens the possibility for e-\n     mail even outside the ISP to be viewed as stored e-mail.\n       At many points during its path from sender to recipient, e-\n     mail passes through a number of computer systems and routers \n     that temporarily store it in RAM while the system determines \n     the next point to send it on the delivery route. Under the \n     court's definition, an ISP could access, copy and read the \n     mail at any of these points. Anyone who is not exempt under \n     the Stored Communications Act, however, could still be \n     charged under that law, though penalties for violating this \n     law are less severe than penalties for violating the Wiretap \n     Act.\n       Last week's ruling means that e-mail has fewer protections \n     than phone conversations and postal mail. Granting e-mail \n     providers the ability to read e-mail is equivalent to \n     granting postal workers the right to open and read any mail \n     while it's at a post office for sorting, but not while it's \n     in transit between post offices or being hand-delivered to a \n     recipient's home or business.\n       The ruling also has repercussions for voicemail messages, \n     as long as certain provisions in the Patriot Act remain law.\n       Before the Patriot Act, the legal definition of wire \n     communication included voicemail messages. This meant that \n     authorities had to obtain a wiretap order to access voicemail \n     messages or face charges of illegal interception under the \n     Wiretap Act. Under the Patriot Act, however, the definition \n     of wire communication changed. Voicemail messages are now \n     considered stored communication, like e-mail. As a result, \n     law enforcement authorities need only a search warrant to \n     access voicemail messages, a much easier process than \n     obtaining a wiretap order.\n       The provision in the Patriot Act that changed this is set \n     to sunset in December 2005, but if the current administration \n     has its way, the law will be renewed.\n       The changes in the Patriot Act, combined with the decision \n     in the Councilman case, also mean that a phone company could \n     now access voicemail messages without customers' permission \n     and not be charged with intercepting the messages under the \n     Wiretap Act. They also would not be charged under the Stored \n     Communications Act, since they are exempt from this statute.\n       If all of this is hard to follow, it's just as confusing to \n     the people who make their living interpreting the law.\n       ``This is one of the most complex and convoluted areas of \n     the law that you will run across,'' said Lee Tien, senior \n     staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``The \n     statutes themselves are not models of clarity. Even for the \n     judges it's complicated, and then, on top of the statutes, \n     you add the changing technology.''\n       In the end, in the absence of laws to preserve privacy, the \n     best solution for e-mail users to protect their privacy is to \n     use encryption. But until encryption for voicemail messages \n     becomes common, you'll have to settle for talking in tongues.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 6, 2004]\n\n          You've Got Mail (and Court Says Others Can Read It)\n\n                           (By Saul Hansell)\n\n       When everything is working right, an e-mail message appears \n     to zip instantenously from the sender to the recipient's \n     inbox. But in reality, most messages make several momentary \n     stops as they are processed by various computers en route to \n     their destination.\n       Those short stops may make no difference to the users, but \n     they make an enormous difference to the privacy that e-mail \n     is accorded under federal law.\n       Last week a Federal appeals court in Boston ruled that \n     federal wiretap laws do not apply to e-mail messages if they \n     are stored, even for a millisecond, on the computers of the \n     Internet providers that process them--meaning that it can be \n     legal for the government or others to read such messages \n     without a court order.\n       The ruling was a surprise to many people, because in 1986 \n     Congress specifically amended the wiretap laws to incorporate \n     new technologies like e-mail. Some argue that the ruling's \n     implications could affect emerging applications like \n     Internet-based phone calls and Gmail Google's new e-mail \n     service, which shows advertising based on the content of a \n     subscriber's e-mail messages.\n       ``The court has eviscerated the protections that Congress \n     established back in the 1980's,'' said Marc Rotenberg, the \n     executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information \n     Center, a civil liberties group.\n       But other experts argue that the Boston case will have \n     little practical effect. The outcry, said Stuart Baker, a \n     privacy lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, is \n     ``much ado about nothing.''\n       Mr. Baker pointed out that even under the broadest \n     interpretation of the law, Congress made it easier for \n     prosecutors and lawyers in civil cases to read other people's \n     e-mail messages than to listen to their phone calls. The \n     wiretap law--which requires prosecutors to prove their need \n     for a wiretap and forbids civil litigants from ever using \n     them--applies to e-mail messages only when they are in \n     transit.\n       But in a 1986 law, Congress created a second category, \n     called stored communication, for messages that had been \n     delivered to recipients' inboxes but not yet read. That law, \n     the Stored Communications Act, grants significant protection \n     to e-mail messages, but does not go as far as the wiretap \n     law: it lets prosecutors have access to stored messages with \n     a search warrant, while imposing stricter requirements on \n     parties in civil suits.\n       Interestingly, messages that have been read but remain on \n     the Internet provider's computer system have very little \n     protection. Prosecutors can typically gain access to an \n     opened e-mail message with a simple subpoena rather than a \n     search warrant. Similarly, lawyers in civil cases, including \n     divorces, can subpoena opened e-mail messages.\n       The case in Boston involved an online bookseller, now \n     called Alibris. In 1998, the company offered e-mail accounts \n     to book dealers and, hoping to gain market advantage, \n     secretly copied messages they received from Amazon.com. In \n     1999, Alibris and one employee pleaded guilty to criminal \n     wiretapping charges.\n        But a supervisor, Bradford C. Councilman, fought the \n     charges, saying he did not know\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\n     about the scheme. He also moved to have the case dismissed on \n     the ground that the wiretapping law did not apply. He argued \n     that because the messages had been on the hard drive of \n     Alibris's computer while they were being processed for \n     delivery, they counted as stored communication. The wiretap \n     law bans a company from monitoring the communications of its \n     customers, except in a few cases. But it does not ban a \n     company from reading customers' stored communications.\n        ``Congress recognized that any time you store \n     communication, there is an inherent loss of privacy,'' said \n     Mr. Councilman's lawyer, Andrew Good of Good & Cormier in \n     Boston.\n        In 2003, a Federal district court in Boston agreed with \n     Mr. Councilman's interpretation of the wiretap law and \n     dismissed the case. Last week, the First Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, in a 2-to-1 decision, affirmed that decision.\n        Because most major Internet providers have explicit \n     policies against reading their customers' e-mail messages, \n     the ruling would seem to have little effect on most people.\n        But this year Google is testing a service called Gmail, \n     which electronically scans the content of the e-mail messages \n     its customers receive and then displays related ads. Privacy \n     groups have argued that the service is intrusive, and some \n     have claimed it violates wiretap laws. The Councilman \n     decision, if it stands, could undercut that argument.\n        Federal prosecutors, who often argue that wiretap \n     restrictions do not apply in government investigations, were \n     in the somewhat surprising position of arguing that those \n     same laws should apply to Mr. Councilman's conduct. A \n     spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Boston \n     said the department had not decided whether to appeal.\n        Mr. Baker said that another Federal appeals court ruling, \n     in San Francisco, is already making it hard for prosecutors \n     to retrieve e-mail that has been read and remains on an \n     Internet provider's system.\n        In that case, Theofel v. Farey-Jones, a small Internet \n     provider responded to a subpoena by giving a lawyer copies of \n     339 e-mail messages received by two of its customers.\n        The customers claimed the subpoena was so broad it \n     violated the wiretap and stored communication laws. A \n     district court agreed the subpoenas were too broad, but ruled \n     they were within the law. The plaintiffs appealed, and the \n     Justice Department filed a friend of the court brief arguing \n     that the Stored Communications Act should not apply.\n        In February, the appeals court ruled that e-mail stored on \n     the computer server of an Internet provider is indeed covered \n     by the Stored Communications Act, even after it has been \n     read. The court noted that the act refers both to messages \n     before they are delivered and to backup copies kept by the \n     Internet provider. ``An obvious purpose for storing a message \n     on an I.S.P.'s server after delivery,'' the court wrote, ``is \n     to provide a second copy of the message in the event that the \n     user needs to download it again--if, for example, the message \n     is accidentally erased from the user's own computer.''\n        Calling e-mail ``stored communication'' does not \n     necessarily reduce privacy protections for most e-mail users. \n     While the Councilman ruling would limit the applicability of \n     wiretap laws to e-mail, it appears to apply to a very small \n     number of potential cases. The Theofel decision, by contrast, \n     by defining more e-mail as ``stored communications,'' is \n     restricting access to e-mail in a wide range of cases in the \n     Ninth Circuit, and could have a far greater effect on privacy \n     of courts in the rest of the country follow that ruling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7896-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   IBM AND THE RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK\n\n Mrs. DOLE.

A bill to criminalize Internet scams involving fraudulently \nobtaining personal information, commonly known as phishing; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, the Anti-\nPhishing Act of 2004, that targets a large and growing class of crime \nthat is spreading across the Internet.\n  Phishing is a rapidly growing class of identity theft scams on the \nInternet that is causing both short-term losses and long-term economic \ndamage.\n  In the short-term, these scams defraud individuals and financial \ninstitutions. Some estimates place the cost of phishing at over two \nbillion dollars just over the last 12 months.\n  In the long run, phishing undermines the Internet itself. By making \nconsumers uncertain about the integrity of the Internet's complex \naddressing system, phishing threatens to make us all less likely to use \nthe Internet for secure transactions. If you can't trust where you are \non the web, you are less likely to use it for commerce and \ncommunications.\n  Phishing is spelled ``P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G.'' Those well-versed in popular \nculture may guess that it was named after the phenomenally popular \nVermont band, Phish. But phishing over the Internet was in fact named \nfrom the sport of fishing, as an analogy for its technique of luring \nInternet prey with convincing email bait. The ``F'' is replaced by a \n``P-H'' in keeping with a computer hacker tradition.\n  Phishing attacks usually start with emails that are, in Internet \njargon, ``spoofed.'' That is, they are made to appear to be coming from \nsome trusted financial institution or commercial entity. The spoofed \nemail usually asks the victim to go to a website to confirm or renew \nprivate account information. These emails offer a link that appears to \ntake the victim to the website of the trusted institution. In fact the \nlink takes the victim to a sham website that is visually identical to \nthat of the trusted institution, but is in fact run by the criminal. \nWhen the victim takes the bait and sends their account information, the \ncriminal uses it--sometimes within minutes--to transfer the victim's \nfunds or to make purchases. Phishers are the new con artists of \ncyberspace.\n  To give an idea of how easy it is to be fooled, we have reproduced \nsome recent phishing charts, with the help of the Anti-Phishing Working \nGroup. These are just two examples of a problem that affects countless \ncompanies. The website on the right is an actual website of MBNA, a \nwell-established financial institution and credit card issuer. On the \nleft is a recently discovered phishing site that mimicked the MBNA \nsite.\n  As you can see, the two websites are practically identical. Both have \nthe MBNA logo, and both have the same graphics, in the same layout. But \nif you end up going to the website on the left, when you enter your \naccount information, you are giving it to an identity thief.\n  As another example, the next two websites both appear to be from \neBay. Again, the one on the right is from the genuine website. The one \non the left is a fake website that is controlled by a phisher. As you \ncan see, if you end up at the website on the left, it would be next to \nimpossible to know that you are not at the real eBay website. Informed \nInternet users can avoid this problem if they simply use their web \nbrowser to go to the website, instead of using a link sent to them in \nan email, but far too many people do not do this.\n  This is a growing problem. Phishing is on the rise. In recent months \nthere has been an explosion of these types of attacks. As you can see \nfrom the next chart, these attacks are growing at an alarming rate. \nRoughly one million Americans already have been victims of phishing \nattacks.\n  And phishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated. Early phishing \nattacks were by novices, but there is evidence now that some attacks \nare backed by organized crime. And some attacks these days include \nspyware, which is software that is secretly installed on the victim's \ncomputer, which waits to capture account information when the victim \neven goes to legitimate websites.\n  Phishers also have become more sophisticated in how they cast their \nhuge volumes of email bait on the Internet waters. Security experts \nrecently discovered that vast networks of home computers are being \nhijacked by hackers using viruses, and then they are rented to \nphishers--all without the knowledge of the owners of these home \ncomputers.\n  Some phishers can be prosecuted under wire fraud or identity theft \nstatutes, but often these prosecutions take place only after someone \nhas been defrauded. Moreover, the mere threat of phishing attacks \nundermines everyone's confidence in the Internet. When people cannot \ntrust that websites are what they appear to be, they will not use the \nInternet for their secure transactions. So traditional wire fraud and \nidentity theft statutes are not sufficient to respond to phishing.\n  The Anti-Phishing Act of 2004 protects the integrity of the Internet \nin two ways. First, it criminalizes the bait. It makes it illegal to \nknowingly send out spoofed email that links to sham websites, with the \nintention of committing a crime. Second, it criminalizes the sham \nwebsites that are the true scene of the crime.\n  It makes it illegal to knowingly create or procure a website that \npurports to be a legitimate online business, with the intent of \ncollecting information for some criminal purpose.\n  There are important First Amendment concerns to be protected. The \nAnti-Phishing Act protects parodies and political speech from being \nprosecuted as Phishing.\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\n  We have worked closely with various public interest organizations to \nensure that the Anti-Phishing Act does not impinge on the important \ndemocratic role that the Internet plays.\n  To many Americans, phishing is a new word. It certainly is a new form \nof an old crime. It also is a serious crime, and we need to act \naggressively to keep phishing from infecting the Internet and from \neroding the public's trust in online commerce and communication. I look \nforward to working with others in the Senate in addressing this growing \nthreat to the Internet, with effective and responsible action.\n  Again, this is called the Anti-Phishing Act. It targets a large and \ngrowing class of crime that is spreading across the Internet.\n  Phishing is a rapidly growing class of identity theft scams. It \ncauses both short-term losses, but long-term economic problems. In the \nshort-term, these scams defraud individuals and financial institutions.\n  To give some idea that this is not a minor matter, some estimates \nplace the cost of phishing at over $2 billion over the last 12 months. \nYou can imagine the outcry in this country if they said we had $2 \nbillion worth of bank robberies in that same period of time. But it is \nnot only the economic loss that undermines the Internet itself; it \nmakes consumers uncertain about the integrity of the Internet's complex \naddressing system. It makes us all less apt to use it for commerce and \ncommunication, because if you cannot trust where you are on the Web, \nyou are not going to use it for commerce or communication.\n  Incidentally, fishing is spelled P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G. Those who are well \nversed in popular culture might think it was named after the \nphenomenally popular Vermont band called Phish. But phishing over the \nInternet was named for the sport of fishing, as an analogy for its \ntechnique of luring Internet prey with a convincing e-mail bait. The \n``F' was replaced by ``PH'' in keeping with computer hacker tradition.\n  Phishing usually starts with e-mails that are, in Internet jargon, \n``spoofed.'' They appear to come from some trusted commercial entity or \nfinancial institution. The spoofed e-mail asks the victim to go to a \nWeb site and confirm their identity, in effect, their Social Security \nnumber, credit card numbers, and so on. What it does is, the victim \nthinks they are going to a trusted institution, perhaps one they have \ndealt with for years. Instead, it takes them to a sham Web site that is \nvisually identical to that of the trusted institution, but it is run by \na criminal. When the victim takes the bait, when they send their \naccount information, of course, the criminal uses it. Sometimes they \nuse it within minutes. They can transfer the victim's funds or make \npurchases. These phishers are new con artists of cyberspace.\n  I will give you an idea of how easy it is to do it. Here on this \nchart we have the genuine Web site. We actually had to mark them as \n``genuine Web site'' and ``fake Web site'' because they look so \nidentical. I am a heavy user of the Internet, and I could not tell them \napart. On the other side, of course, is the fake Web site. They both \nhave the MBNA logo. That is a trusted financial institution. They have \nthe same graphic layout.\n  Suppose you were a customer of MBNA and they asked you to put your \nuser name in, your password, and so on, and you go on there and they \nwould continue to ask information. You would have given up your account \nnumber, whatever ID number you use, and it could be 20 minutes later, \nwhen you go on the right site and you want to withdraw some money or \nmake a cash transfer, you may find it is all gone in that short time.\n  In fact, we also have a chart for eBay. I wasn't going to show it, \nbut it is worthwhile, I think. We will show the two from eBay. Again, I \nhave had them marked ``genuine Web site'' and ``fake Web site.'' Here \nis the genuine one. For those who use PayPal, it is increasingly used \nif you are using eBay. Anybody who has done that is well aware of \nPayPal. It is something you could be safe with, you know where your \nmoney is going, you know who is handling it, and you know you are going \nto get paid for something you might have sold.\n  Look what we have here. When you look at it, it is hard to tell the \ndifference. Of course, the internal address is different. What do you \ndo? You send money, you pay money, you are supposed to receive money. \nYou are not going to do it. Somebody else is going to do it and they \nare going to walk off not only with your money but with your trust of \nthe Internet.\n  That is why it is important that we do this, that we have some way of \ncriminalizing this. We have in every one of our States businesses that \nthrive and survive because they can use the Internet. This is trying to \nstop them. Again, we must address this growing threat to Internet \nusers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 402--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \nTO THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOOD AID PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE \n       AGRICULTURAL TRADE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1954\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Lugar, \nand Mr. Dayton) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 402\n\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the Second World War, many \n     countries did not have sufficient cash to buy the \n     agricultural commodities needed to feed the people of those \n     countries, especially in war-torn Europe and Asia;\n       Whereas, during the term of President Dwight David \n     Eisenhower, it became apparent that the abundance of food \n     available in the United States could be used as an instrument \n     in building a durable peace after the Second World War;\n       Whereas a concessional credit program was established under \n     title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954 (commonly known as ``P.L. 480'') (7 U.S.C. 1701 \n     et seq.), signed into law on July 10, 1954, to allow for \n     sales of agricultural commodities from the United States to \n     developing countries for dollars on generous credit terms or \n     for local currencies, with proceeds to be used by \n     participating governments or nongovernmental private entities \n     to encourage economic development;\n       Whereas since the enactment of the Agricultural Trade \n     Development and Assistance Act of 1954, the title I program \n     has facilitated sales of agricultural commodities from the \n     United States, totaling an estimated $30,000,000,000 to \n     nearly 100 countries;\n       Whereas the Food for Peace program was established under \n     title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.), to provide humanitarian \n     assistance to poor and hungry people in developing countries, \n     based on legislation originally introduced by Senator Hubert \n     Humphrey;\n       Whereas during the half-century since the establishment of \n     the Food for Peace program, the United States Agency for \n     International Development and the Department of Agriculture \n     have worked together to provide 107,000,000 tons of food aid \n     to developing countries, helping an estimated 3,400,000,000 \n     people through 2003;\n       Whereas the government of the United States has depended on \n     the commitment, skill, and experience of dozens of private \n     voluntary organizations based in the United States, as well \n     as the United Nations World Food Program, to carry out the \n     Food for Peace program on the ground in developing countries; \n     and\n       Whereas a number of countries that were early beneficiaries \n     of both programs have emerged as democracies and strong \n     commercial trading partners, including South Korea, Taiwan, \n     the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico, and \n     Turkey, in part as a result of development projects and food \n     distribution programs conducted using agricultural \n     commodities from the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) on the 50th anniversary of the date of enactment of the \n     Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1691 et seq.) on July 10, 1954, recognizes the United \n     States Agency for International Development, the Department \n     of Agriculture, and associated partners for--\n       (A) providing emergency food assistance to address famine \n     or other extraordinary relief requirements;\n       (B) forging linkages between the abundance of food produced \n     under the agricultural system of the United States and people \n     in need of assistance throughout the world;\n       (C) undertaking activities to alleviate hunger;\n       (D) promoting economic, agricultural, educational, and \n     community development in developing countries;\n       (E) identifying the private partners capable of carrying \n     out the mission of the programs established under that Act;\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\n       (F) implementing procedures governing the use and \n     evaluation of the programs and funds;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 122\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     many whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;\n       Whereas in 1946 a significant number of the nations of the \n     world adopted the International Convention for the Regulation \n     of Whaling, which established the International Whaling \n     Commission to provide for the proper conservation of whale \n     stocks;\n       Whereas in 2003 the Commission established a Conservation \n     Committee, open to all members of the Commission, for the \n     purpose of facilitating efficient and effective coordination \n     and development of conservation recommendations and \n     activities, which are fully consistent with the conservation \n     objectives stated in the 1946 Convention;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of whale stocks, many of which had been hunted to near \n     extinction by the commercial whaling industry;\n       Whereas the Commission has designated the Indian Ocean and \n     the ocean waters around Antarctica, as whale sanctuaries to \n     further enhance the recovery of whale stocks;\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas two member nations currently have reservations to \n     the Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling, and one \n     member nation is currently conducting commercial whaling \n     operations in spite of the moratorium and the protests of \n     other nations;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted several resolutions at \n     recent meetings asking member nations to halt commercial \n     whaling activities conducted under reservation to the \n     moratorium and to refrain from issuing special permits for \n     research involving the killing of whales;\n       Whereas one member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     also continues to conduct unnecessary lethal scientific \n     whaling in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific Ocean;\n       Whereas one member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     also continues to conduct unnecessary lethal scientific \n     whaling in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific Ocean;\n       Whereas whale meat and blubber is being sold commercially \n     from whales killed pursuant to such unnecessary lethal \n     scientific whaling, further undermining the moratorium on \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas the Commission's Scientific Committee has \n     repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the scientific \n     need for such lethal research and recognizes the importance \n     of demonstrating and expanding the use of non-lethal \n     scientific research methods;\n       Whereas last year one member nation unsuccessfully sought \n     an exemption allowing commercial whaling of up to 150 minke \n     whales and 150 Bryde's whales, contrary to the moratorium and \n     without review of the scientific committee, and continues to \n     seek avenues to allow lethal takes of whales by vessels from \n     specific communities in a manner that would undermine the \n     moratorium on commercial whaling;\n       Whereas more than 8500 whales have been killed in lethal \n     scientific whaling programs since the adoption of the \n     commercial whaling moratorium and the lethal take of whales \n     under scientific permits has increased both in quantity and \n     species, with species now including minke, Bryde's, sei, and \n     sperm whales; and\n       Whereas engaging in commercial whaling under reservation \n     and lethal scientific whaling undermines the conservation \n     program of the Commission: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by \n     the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That it \n     is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) at the 56th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling \n     Commission the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling;\n       (B) support the purposes and functions of the Conservation \n     Committee, which provides a system for ensuring good \n     governance of the Commission's conservation activities;\n       (C) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;\n       (D) oppose the unnecessary lethal taking of whales for \n     scientific purposes, seek support for expanding the use of \n     non-lethal research methods, and seek to end the sale of \n     whale meat and blubber from whales killed for unnecessary \n     lethal scientific research;\n       (E) seek the Commission's support for specific efforts by \n     member nations to end trade in whale meat;\n       (F) support the permanent protection of whale populations \n     through the establishment of whale sanctuaries in which \n     commercial whaling is prohibited; and\n       (G) support efforts to expand data collection on whale \n     populations, monitor and reduce whale bycatch and other \n     incidental impacts, and otherwise expand whale conservation \n     efforts; and\n       (2) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \n     implement the goals set forth in paragraph (1).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 402, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Harkin and Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 402) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate with respect to the 50th anniversary of the Food Aid \n     Program established under the Agricultural Trade Development \n     and Assistance Act of 1954.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in recognition of the 50th anniversary of \nthe Food for Peace and concessional credit programs established in the \nAgricultural Trade and Development Act of 1954 enacted on July 10, \n1954, Senator Cochran and I are submitting a Senate Resolution to honor \nthose programs' many achievements over the past half century.\n  The 83rd Congress, working with the Eisenhower administration, \nrecognized that the productive capacity of the U.S. agricultural sector \nwas outstripping the food and feed needs of our domestic economy and \nthat citizens of many war-torn countries had need for our food but \ncould not afford to pay for it. They saw that the abundance of food \navailable in the United States could be utilized as an instrument in \nbuilding a durable peace after the Second World War.\n  Through the past 50 years, the various programs established under the \nAgricultural Trade and Development\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nAct of 1954, known as P.L. 480, have helped billions of people in \ndeveloping countries. According to USDA estimates, the Title I program, \nwhich provides concessional credit to developing countries to purchase \nU.S. agricultural commodities, has enabled the sale of $30 billion \nworth of commodities to nearly 100 countries. In addition, the Food for \nPeace program, authorized under the provisions of Title II of the Act, \nhas helped an estimated 3.4 billion people through 2003. These figures \nrepresent accomplishments we should be proud of.\n  Behind these figures lie many years of commitment and hard work by \nemployees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture and their partners in private voluntary \norganizations and intergovernmental organizations such as Catholic \nRelief Services, CARE, World Vision, and the UN's World Food Program. \nTheir crucial efforts include delivering food and development projects \non the ground in developing countries, assembling and shipping \ncommodities from the United States under the program, and evaluating \nproject requests and monitoring the programs in Washington, DC. The \nsuccessful implementation of the programs also requires the cooperation \nof governments and non-governmental organizations in the developing \ncountries in which the projects occur.\n  With such a record of achievement in the past half century, it is \ncrucial that Members of Congress and the administration do all they can \nto make sure these programs remain vigorous over the next half century \nand beyond.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 402\n\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the Second World War, many \n     countries did not have sufficient cash to buy the \n     agricultural commodities needed to feed the people of those \n     countries, especially in war-torn Europe and Asia;\n       Whereas, during the term of President Dwight David \n     Eisenhower, it became apparent that the abundance of food \n     available in the United States could be used as an instrument \n     in building a durable peace after the Second World War;\n       Whereas a concessional credit program was established under \n     title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954 (commonly known as ``P.L. 480'') (7 U.S.C. 1701 \n     et seq.), signed into law on July 10, 1954, to allow for \n     sales of agricultural commodities from the United States to \n     developing countries for dollars on generous credit terms or \n     for local currencies, with proceeds to be used by \n     participating governments or nongovernmental private entities \n     to encourage economic development;\n       Whereas since the enactment of the Agricultural Trade \n     Development and Assistance Act of 1954, the title I program \n     has facilitated sales of agricultural commodities from the \n     United States, totaling an estimated $30,000,000,000 to \n     nearly 100 countries;\n       Whereas the Food for Peace program was established under \n     title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.), to provide humanitarian \n     assistance to poor and hungry people in developing countries, \n     based on legislation originally introduced by Senator Hubert \n     Humphrey;\n       Whereas during the half-century since the establishment of \n     the Food for Peace program, the United States Agency for \n     International Development and the Department of Agriculture \n     have worked together to provide 107,000,000 tons of food aid \n     to developing countries, helping an estimated 3,400,000,000 \n     people through 2003;\n       Whereas the government of the United States has depended on \n     the commitment, skill, and experience of dozens of private \n     voluntary organizations based in the United States, as well \n     as the United Nations World Food Program, to carry out the \n     Food for Peace program on the ground in developing countries; \n     and\n       Whereas a number of countries that were early beneficiaries \n     of both programs have emerged as democracies and strong \n     commercial trading partners, including South Korea, Taiwan, \n     the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico, and \n     Turkey, in part as a result of development projects and food \n     distribution programs conducted using agricultural \n     commodities from the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) on the 50th anniversary of the date of enactment of the \n     Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1691 et seq.) on July 10, 1954, recognizes the United \n     States Agency for International Development, the Department \n     of Agriculture, and associated partners for--\n       (A) providing emergency food assistance to address famine \n     or other extraordinary relief requirements;\n       (B) forging linkages between the abundance of food produced \n     under the agricultural system of the United States and people \n     in need of assistance throughout the world;\n       (C) undertaking activities to alleviate hunger;\n       (D) promoting economic, agricultural, educational, and \n     community development in developing countries;\n       (E) identifying the private partners capable of carrying \n     out the mission of the programs established under that Act;\n       (F) implementing procedures governing the use and \n     evaluation of the programs and funds;

and\n       (B) the accomplishments of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, the Department of Agriculture, and \n     associated private voluntary organization and nongovernmental \n     organization partners in alleviating hunger and poverty, \n     bolstering development, and restoring hope around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7900-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF NATIONAL MARINA DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I have worked a lot this afternoon and this morning \nclearing with our Members the fact that it would not be necessary that \nwe deal with cloture on the motion to proceed. We have cleared that. We \nwould also be in a position to have no amendments on the constitutional \namendment that we are going to debate next week. Whatever the majority \nbelieves to be a reasonable time to debate that, we will be in \nagreement with that and have a vote on the resolution. We are cleared \non our side to do that.\n  We would hope, if the majority leader can get a clearance on that, we \ncan move forward and have a definite time sometime next week for a vote \non the resolution itself. We are ready to move forward on it.\n  Yesterday, we believed it was necessary that we have the leader file \nthis cloture motion on the motion to proceed, but we will not need that \nnow. We are ready to rock and roll on the debate of this issue.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, we are \ntalking about the issue surrounding marriage and the constitutional \namendment and procedurally how best to address the issue. We have had \ndebate and discussion over the course of the day. Because of the late \nhour, I was not able to talk to the managers on our side and have the \nsame discussions as the other side has had as far as the best way to \naddress the issue procedurally. Because of the late hour, I have not \nbeen able to reach our managers of the bill, but over the course of the \nweekend we will do that.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues, we will substantively be debating \nthe issue Monday and Tuesday. In all likelihood, we will have a vote on \nWednesday through one of the two modes that have been mentioned, but we \nwill make a final decision Monday morning after we have had the \nopportunity to talk to the managers on our side as well.\n  Mr. REID. I simply state again, procedurally we are not going to be \nin the way. We are ready to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask one other question before the majority \nleader begins to speak, are we going to have any votes on Monday? I \nhave gotten a number of requests through Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, in a few moments, I am going to be making \nanother statement before closing, but before doing that, I want to \npoint out to our colleagues that over the course of today, there have \nbeen a number of meetings held between both sides of the aisle and \nleadership to keep moving along issues that are important to this body \nand to the American people. One of the bills that the assistant \nDemocratic leader and myself and the Democratic leader and our \nleadership addressed earlier this morning is the jobs in manufacturing \nbill, the FSC/ETI bill, and the efforts that we are making to move \ntoward conference. This bill has passed the Senate, it has passed the \nHouse of Representatives, and now we are doing our best to address how \nto get to conference. This is a time-sensitive matter because the \ntariffs on U.S. products are increasing.\n  Since we passed the Senate bill and the House bill, these tariffs, \nwhich started at 5 percent in March and reached 9 percent on July 1, \ncontinue to increase at 1 percent a month.\n  We spent 14 days debating the bill. We had 100 amendments, made real \nprogress, and now it is important that we go to conference to fully \naddress and resolve the differences between the House and the Senate \nbills. For the benefit of all of our colleagues, I wanted to let them \nknow that we are in constant discussion about how best to get to \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7901-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7901-S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to very briefly, before bringing us \nformally an end to this week, address an issue that sits on the back \nburner all too often. It is an issue that affects mankind globally in a \nvery direct way, in a moral sense. It is the HIV/AIDS virus. I speak \ntoday because on Tuesday of this week, UNAIDS released a comprehensive \nreport on the spread of global HIV/AIDS.\n  This little, tiny virus, which people knew nothing about 23 years \nago, has killed over 23 million people. The sobering statistics that \nwere released this week are grim. Last year, the number of newly \ninfected victims reached an all-time high of 5 million. The number of \npeople living with this little virus has gone up in nearly every region \nof the world. The numbers have increased. The UNAIDS chief told the \nAssociated Press:\n\n       The virus is running faster than all of us.\n\n  Every 14 seconds a child is orphaned by AIDS. According to the U.N. \nreport:\n\n       An estimated 15 million children under the age of 18 \n     worldwide have lost one or both parents to AIDS.\n\n  In Swaziland and in Botswana, over a third of the population, one in \nthree people, has the HIV virus. One-third of the country, if not \ntreated, will end up dying from a terrible, a painful, and an entirely \npreventable disease.\n  One out of three people in Swaziland and Botswana, these are \nstaggering numbers. It is hard to comprehend. When you hear the \nstatistics, it is hard to relate them to real people on the ground. I \nhave had the opportunity to do just that because each year I travel, \nnot as a Senator but as a physician, to Africa. While I am there, I see \nthe devastation in real people's eyes and lives, the destruction of the \nfamily, the destruction of the most productive fabric\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\nof society--dying, disappearing because of this little virus.\n  Every time I go to Africa--last year I was there in September--I am \noverwhelmed by the devastation this little vicious virus causes. To me, \nand I know to the distinguished Senator occupying the chair now, who \nalso has spent his life studying disease and viruses and the like, it \nis remarkable because in 1983 we didn't know this thing existed. It \nprobably didn't really exist as we know it today in the United States \nof America in 1983, when both I and probably the distinguished Senator \nin the chair were not that old. I was in my training at the time. To \nthink that little virus is devastating the world in the way it has over \na 21-year period is just unbelievable to me.\n  If you walk through a village in Africa, or parts of Africa, it \nbecomes apparent what this virus is doing. You see older people and you \nsee little kids running around. What you do not see is people from \nabout 19 years of age to 28 or 30 years of age, or 35, right through \nthat age. That whole layer of the population has been wiped out by this \nvirus. That segment is also usually the most productive, strongest part \nof a society and it is just wiped out.\n  The young boys and girls you see running around, if you project that \nout, are left to fend for themselves. They might live with their \ngrandparents or great-grandparents, but they generally don't have the \nsort of mentors which that age would otherwise be provided. Mature \nbeyond their years, these little kids watch hopelessly as their parents \ndie, as their uncles die, as their aunts die. When I say 35 percent of \nthe population has HIV/AIDS, that is what it means when you are on the \nground.\n\n  That is depressing. That is the depressing part. Despite that \ndepressing picture, there is a lot of hope. If you look in countries \nsuch as Brazil and Thailand, there has been a real success in keeping \nthose infection rates down. Uganda has achieved remarkable success.\n  President Museveni, from Uganda, was here a few weeks ago. I had the \nopportunity to speak with him about their success. They have used some \ninnovative programs. They have really pioneered programs we know are \nsuccessful.\n  The one we talk about the most and has become a model for much of the \nglobal effort is the ABC program, a program of A, abstinence; B, be \nfaithful to your partner; and C, condom use if the A and B are \nineffective. So the strategy of ABC was pioneered in Uganda. It took \nPresidential leadership there. President Museveni was the President \nwho, in every speech, talked about HIV/AIDS, which really wasn't \npopular when he started, about 15 years ago, to do so.\n  The strategy incorporates both reducing the risk through the use of \ncondoms with a strategy of risk avoidance through the message of \nlimiting sexual partners.\n  It is totally preventable. The disease itself, this little virus and \nthe contagiousness of the virus is totally preventable.\n  The comprehensive strategy is working. Uganda's HIV/AIDS infection \nrate has steadily declined. In 2001, the infection rate for 18- to 49-\nyear-olds was 5 percent. In Kampala, which is a major urban center in \nUganda, where HIV/AIDS once raged, aggressive intervention lowered it \nfrom 29 percent down to 8 percent.\n  I had the opportunity to operate at a wonderful hospital in Kampala \nabout 2 years ago, 3 years ago. So to see that remarkable progress, \ncutting the infection rate from 30 down to 8 percent, has been \nremarkable.\n  The world community must respond. The world community is responding. \nThe United States of America has stepped up to lead the battle. Last \nyear, Congress passed and the President signed a global HIV/AIDS bill \nwhich projects out $15 billion over 5 years for the prevention and \ntreatment of HIV/AIDS. At the end of the program's first year, over \n200,000 people will be on treatment with 1.1 million people receiving \ncare. In the past few months, the U.S. has released $865 million in \nHIV/AIDS funding to the 15 nations receiving those emergency funds.\n  This year, America will provide $2.4 billion to combat that HIV/AIDS \nvirus, as well as tuberculosis and malaria, two other infectious \ndiseases that cause about between 1 and 2 and 3 million deaths in \naddition, each year, respectively. Ultimately, America's efforts will \nprevent 7 million new infections. It will provide antiretroviral drugs \nfor 2 million HIV-infected people. It will provide care for 10 million \nHIV-infected individuals with AIDS and AIDS orphans. This will bring \nhope to millions of people around the world. It is a lofty goal of a \ngreat and compassionate nation.\n  I have taken the opportunity to mention this today, on Friday, \nbecause much of that is from the report of last Tuesday.\n  Next week there will be some very significant meetings. Over 15,000 \nscientists and AIDS activists and advocates will gather in Thailand, in \nBangkok, for the International AIDS Conference. They will look at \nprevention efforts. They will look at treatment efforts. They will look \nat real-life experience. They will look at what works and what does not \nwork, so we can better address this global epidemic.\n  Americans can be proud of our commitment and compassion. The United \nStates of America is the most generous nation in the world today in \nfighting HIV/AIDS and providing substantial resources for that \nprevention, care, and treatment for those infected with the virus.\n  We will spend about $2.4 billion on global AIDS this year and an \nestimated $2.8 billion next year. We have already provided over $1.1 \nbillion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. \nThat is approximately one-third of all the commitments to the fund. Our \ncountry, the United States of America, has provided about one-third of \nall the commitments to the fund and the rest of the world makes up the \nother two-thirds.\n  We can't do it alone. It is going to take participation of the \nrecipient countries. They must do their part to promote effective \nprevention and treatment strategies. It takes demonstrated national \nleadership such as the leadership of President Museveni in Uganda. Our \nfriends and our allies must continue to provide firm financial and \nmoral support. Nations are contributing. We want to encourage them to \ncontribute more, and that is reflected in the statistics from last \nweek. But demand continues to outstrip or grow faster than supply. \nOther wealthy nations must increase their contributions. We cannot rely \non the Global Fund alone to combat global HIV/AIDS. It takes sustained, \nfocused efforts on the part of individual countries, rich and poor, to \nlift the shadow of HIV/AIDS. Our Congress, this body, and the President \nof the United States have shown tremendous leadership in the battle \nagainst HIV/AIDS.\n  It is my hope this week's U.N. report and next week's conference will \nnot just be occasions for more talk but will be catalysts for greater \naction on the part of the world's leaders. History is going to judge \nwhether the global community stood by and permitted one of the greatest \ndestructions of human life in recorded history or stepped in and \nperformed one of its most heroic rescues. America has chosen the \nlatter. Let us hope the world will, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/09/senate-section/article/S7902-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
