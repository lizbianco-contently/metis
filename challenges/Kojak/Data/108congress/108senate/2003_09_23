Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will conduct a \nperiod for morning business to allow Senators to speak. Following \nmorning business, at approximately 10:30 a.m., the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill. Under the order from \nlast night, there will be 10 additional minutes for debate in relation \nto Senator Daschle's amendment on Indian health care. Therefore, the \nfirst vote of today's session will occur at approximately 10:45 a.m. \nFollowing that vote, we hope to be in a position to schedule additional \nvotes on some of the other pending amendments.\n  We will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party \nluncheons to meet, and it is our hope to have additional votes prior to \nthat recess.\n  We do expect to finish the appropriations bill today or this evening, \nif necessary. Once completed, we will continue with other \nappropriations bills, possibly the DC appropriations legislation.\n  I also remind Members once again that we will be scheduling votes on \navailable judicial nominations and others throughout the week.\n  Over the course of the last 24 hours, people have been recovering in \nthe region from the natural disaster we had last week. Our thoughts and \nprayers go out to them, of course. There are many people, including \nmany people in this body, who do not have electricity or are having \nwater problems. We had rain last night, so we have continued problems. \nWe will continue to work together to get people back to normal lives, \nbut our thoughts and prayers are with them.\n  Lastly, as I mentioned yesterday, this week is a very busy week in \naddressing the request for $87 billion to further the war against \nterrorism, and our goal is to have a good debate, good exchange of \ninformation, asking the tough questions. That started yesterday \nafternoon with some fantastic hearings chaired by the President pro \ntempore, who is in the Chair now, that went into last evening. Hearings \nwill be held by a number of other committees over the course of this \nweek, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  Next week, I hope to be able to address the request on the floor of \nthe Senate. I would like to aim for having that request completed by \nthe end of next week and before we go out for the following week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11771-6", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the weekend the country heard one of \nthe more senior Members of this body, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, make a charge against the President of the United \nStates, particularly with respect to the war in Iraq.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts said the war in Iraq was \n``hatched in Texas'' in a conversation between the President of the \nUnited States and the Republican leadership and that the purpose of \nattacking Iraq was to help the Republicans politically in the \ncongressional elections of 2002. The Senator from Massachusetts \nsummarized the President's position with respect to the war in a single \nword. He called it a ``fraud.''\n  To quote a comment from the Washington Post in another situation \ndealing with Iraq, this is a serious charge and it deserves a serious \nresponse. It is my attempt today to give a serious response to this \ncharge.\n  If the charge made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts is \naccurate, then the President is deserving of a serious rebuke. If in \nfact the charge is not accurate, the senior Senator from Massachusetts \nis deserving of a serious rebuke.\n  I intend to examine whether or not the charge could be substantiated \nand give it the attention that I think it does in fact deserve.\n  I will turn not to sources that are friendly to the President of the \nUnited States; I will go in my analysis to those who have been critical \nof President Bush with respect to Iraq and to his Presidency generally.\n  Let me start by quoting a Presidential statement with respect to \nIraq:\n\n       Saddam Hussein's priorities are painfully clear, not caring \n     for his citizens but building weapons of mass destruction and \n     using them--using them not once, but repeatedly in the \n     terrible war Iraq fought with Iran, and not only against \n     combatants but against civilians, and not only against a \n     foreign adversary but against his own people, and he has \n     targeted Scud missiles against fellow Arabs in Iran, Saudi \n     Arabia, and Bahrain.\n       Nobody wants to use force, but if Saddam Hussein refuses to \n     keep his commitments to the international community, we must \n     be prepared to deal directly with the threat these weapons \n     pose to the Iraqi people, to Iraq's neighbors, and to the \n     rest of the world. Either Saddam acts, or we will have to.\n\n  As I say, that was a Presidential quote, but it was not from George \nW. Bush, and it was not after a meeting in Texas between George W. Bush \nand Republican leaders. That was a statement made by President William \nJefferson Clinton on February 20, 1998--long before the congressional \nelections of 2002 and 2 years before George W. Bush became President of \nthe United States.\n  The suggestion that President Bush created the fraud or the specter \nthat Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction does not stand up \nagainst that statement by President Clinton.\n  I make reference to the Washington Post. This is a newspaper that is \nnot known for its support of either Republicans or President Bush. But \nthey were a supporter of attacking Iraq and, as I have said, there were \nthose who charged the Washington Post editors with a ``jingoistic rush \nto war,'' and the paper said, as I have noted:\n\n       That is a serious charge and it deserves a serious \n     response.\n\n  Then the paper goes on to make these comments:\n\n       In fact, there is nothing sudden or precipitous about our \n     view that Saddam Hussein poses a grave danger.\n\n  Quoting further:\n\n       In 1997 and 1998, we strongly backed President Clinton when \n     he vowed that Iraq must finally honor its commitments to the \n     United Nations to give up its nuclear, biological, and \n     chemical weapons, and we strongly criticized him when he \n     retreated from those vows.\n\n  Again, that was a comment made after the supposed meeting in Texas \nand made after the congressional elections of 2002. If, indeed, \nPresident Bush made the decision to go into Iraq for purely political \nreasons, why would the Washington Post, which is not one of President \nBush's supporters, be commenting after those congressional elections in \na way that makes it clear they came to the same conclusion that \nPresident Bush did?\n  Would the Senator from Massachusetts suggest that the Washington Post \nwas part of the conspiracy that went on in Texas prior to the \ncongressional elections, and that the Washington Post was complicit in \nthe fraud visited on the American people by the decision to go ahead in \nIraq?\n  The Post editorial goes on, and this was February 27, 2003:\n\n       When we cite Mr. Clinton's perceptive but ultimately empty \n     comments, it is in part to chide him and other Democrats who \n     take a different view now that a Republican is in charge. But \n     it has a more serious purpose, too. Mr. Clinton could not \n     muster the will, or the domestic or international support, \n     to force Saddam Hussein to live up to the promises he had \n     made in 1991, though even then the danger was well \n     understood.\n\n  We need not stay within our shores to find those who believe the \nPresident made the right decision in Iraq. Let us go overseas. I had \noccasion to visit with a group of European Parliamentarians. One of \nthem, who came from Great Britain, made this comment to me. He said \nthey have never had a politician in Great Britain who is as poll-driven \nas Tony Blair, and they never had one who pays so much attention to \nfocus groups. The man said Tony Blair almost allows focus groups to \ndetermine what kind of tie he will wear in the morning. Yet when we \ncome to this Iraq business, said this particular Parliamentarian, Tony \nBlair is going against all of the polls and all of the focus groups. He \nis acting in a manner that is completely uncharacteristic for him as a \npolitician. He is actually willing to risk his position as Prime \nMinister in order to make sure we go after Saddam Hussein. He said they \ncannot understand it, except on one possible basis, and that is that \nTony Blair must be completely convinced that the information is \ncorrect, that the intelligence is right, and that Saddam Hussein does \nindeed pose a threat. He said that there is otherwise no explanation \nfor the way he is behaving, that it is contrary to his entire political \nexperience.\n  Would the senior Senator from Massachusetts suggest that Tony Blair \nwas\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\npart of a conspiracy in Texas prior to the 2002 elections, and that \nTony Blair was convinced by the President of the United States he \nshould help him win a Republican victory in the congressional elections \nby supporting the action in Iraq?\n  It is interesting when we are talking about Tony Blair we can once \nagain turn to the words of William Jefferson Clinton. On March 18, \n2003, once again, after the congressional elections had taken place, \nPresident Clinton had this to say in the Guardian Newspaper, published \nin Great Britain. He talked about those in America who were calling for \naction. Then he says:\n\n       On the other side, France, Germany and Russia are adamantly \n     opposed to the use of force or imposing any ultimatum on \n     Saddam as long as the inspectors are working. They believe \n     that, at least as long as the inspectors are there, Iraq will \n     not use or give away its chemical and biological stock and \n     therefore no matter how unhelpful Saddam is, he does not pose \n     a threat sufficient to justify invasion.\n\n  Here is President Clinton using a phrase that is now current in the \nDemocratic Presidential race: ``He does not pose a threat sufficient to \njustify invasion.''\n  Then President Clinton goes on and responds to that statement by \nsaying this:\n\n       The problem with their position is that only the threat of \n     force from the US and the UK got inspectors back into Iraq in \n     the first place. Without a credible threat of force, Saddam \n     will not disarm.\n\n  Then President Clinton goes on to conclude:\n\n       If we leave Iraq with chemical and biological weapons, \n     after 12 years of defiance, there is a considerable risk that \n     one day these weapons will fall into the wrong hands and put \n     many more lives at risk than will be lost in overthrowing \n     Saddam.\n       . . . Prime Minister Blair will have to do what he believes \n     to be right. I trust him to do that and hope the labor MP's \n     and the British people will, too.\n\n  This is President Clinton supporting Prime Minister Blair in his \nsupport of President Bush after the congressional elections of 2002 \nhave taken place.\n  Are we suggesting again that President Clinton and Prime Minister \nBlair and the Washington Post were all part of the conspiracy to \nperpetuate a fraud on the American people? I don't think so.\n  Now, I come to my final comment that I wish to make, again, from a \nsource not friendly to the President. Once again, it is the Washington \nPost. I began with them and I shall conclude with them. This is an \neditorial published on August 10, 2003, almost a year after the \ncongressional elections are over. They are referring to a speech made \nby the former Vice President, Al Gore:\n\n       The notion--that we were all somehow bamboozled into war--\n     is part of Mr. Gore's larger conviction that Mr. Bush has put \n     one over on the nation, and not just with regard to Iraq.\n\n  That is essentially what the senior Senator from Massachusetts said, \nand which the former Vice President said, and the Washington Post \nrepeats that. This is the comment they make, referring to that proposal \nPresident Bush ``put one over on the nation.''\n  The Washington Post says of that idea that it is:\n\n       . . . one that many Americans might find a tad insulting: \n     The administration has developed a highly effective \n     propaganda machine to embed in the public mind mythologies . \n     . .\n\n  Again, that is Vice President Gore's comment, and that was the gist \nof what the senior Senator from Massachusetts said.\n  Back to the Washington Post:\n\n       Thus, Mr. Gore maintains, we were all under the ``false \n     impression'' that Saddam Hussein was ``on the verge of \n     building nuclear bombs,'' that he was ``about to give the \n     terrorists poison gas and deadly germs,'' that he was partly \n     responsible for the 9/11 attacks. And because of these \n     ``false impressions,'' the nation didn't conduct a proper \n     debate about the war. But there was extensive debate going \n     back many years; last fall and winter the nation debated \n     little else. Mr. Bush took his case to the United Nations. \n     Congress argued about and approved a resolution authorizing \n     war. And the approval did not come, as Mr. Gore and other \n     Democrats now maintain, because people were deceived into \n     believing that Saddam Hussein was an ``imminent'' threat who \n     had attacked the World Trade Center or was about to do so.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       It would certainly be fair now to argue that the logic was \n     wrong. There was a cogent case to be made against the war, \n     and even those who supported it might now say that the \n     absence of any uncovered weapons of mass destruction, or the \n     continuing violence against Americans, gives them, in \n     hindsight, a different view. There's plenty to criticize in \n     the administration's postwar effort, too. What isn't \n     persuasive, or even very smart politically, is to pretend to \n     have been fooled by what Mr. Gore breathlessly calls the Bush \n     ``systematic effort to manipulate facts . . .''\n\n  From these sources outside of the Republican base and outside of the \nadministration, it is clear the senior Senator from Massachusetts has \nmade a charge he cannot substantiate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I compliment my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah. The Bennett family has given two generations of \nservice to the Senate, and the Senator can speak with a background and \nunderstanding of this institution and a conscience for this institution \nto follow. I commend my distinguished colleague.\n  I join this morning in speaking out about this situation, and indeed, \nif I may say, the responsibility of this Chamber, each individually and \ncollectively, as we deal with these issues. I have been privileged to \nbe a member of this Chamber for a quarter of a century. I, too, was \ngravely concerned to hear remarks from several of our colleagues \nregarding criticism of this operation in Iraq. Criticism is welcome. \nOur President welcomes it. It is freedom of speech. But there seems to \nbe a responsibility, if you criticize, answer the question, Are we as a \nnation--is the world better off today, having deposed Saddam Hussein \nand his regime of terrorism, or should we have left it as it was?\n  That question has to be answered by those who wish to employ this \nstrident rhetoric, but they fail to do so.\n  Throughout the military history of this country, from World War I, \nWorld War II, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, our military planners \nhave done their best--a clear victory in World War I, a clear victory \nin World War II, an indecisive conclusion in Korea--still there is no \narmistice as such--and an indecisive and somewhat tragic conclusion in \nVietnam. So as we look at the records in Afghanistan, militarily, it \nclearly was a success. Could the planning have been more comprehensive? \nPossibly so. And there will come a time--and I wish to stress that--\nthere will come a time when this Chamber and the House of \nRepresentatives and the Congress as a whole can determine the \naccountability for these operations.\n  At this time, our focus should be behind the Commander in Chief, our \nPresident, who at this very moment is addressing the United Nations on \nthe policies and the goals of our Nation working with a coalition of \nforces in Iraq.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator is the military historian and \nhas served as Secretary of the Navy. Could the Senator confirm my \nrecollection that General Eisenhower once said, before the attack: The \nplan is everything? After the attack starts, the plan goes out the \nwindow.\n\n  Is that a correct quote? And does that apply in this situation?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that carefully paraphrases what \nthat brilliant strategist and President said. There is no doubt about \nit. And there will be a time to determine what went right, what did not \ngo according to plan, and such deficiencies, and the accountability. \nBut right now our obligation is owing to the men and the women who are \nfighting there and their families at home. Stop to think of the \nreaction of a young wife, surrounded by small children, not knowing \nfrom day to day whether her husband will survive another day's \nengagement in Afghanistan or Iraq, and they hear this whole thing has \nbeen a fraud perpetrated upon this family and was made up in Texas. I \nfind that very painful.\n  I have had the privilege of almost a lifetime of association with the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces of the United States--over half a \ncentury. Modest was my contribution on active duty, but through this \nhalf century I have learned much from these men and women with whom I \nhave been privileged to work and support now as a Member of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11774]]\n\n  We always have to focus on that family and their reaction to every \nword we say on this floor, every word that is said in the Congress. How \ndoes it affect that young wife or spouse of a female serving in \nuniform, as many are in these troubled areas of the world? How is that \nfamily affected, and not only the children but the parents?\n  By and large, people who go into uniform do so solely for patriotism. \nIt is an all-volunteer force. There is no draft. No one is compelled to \ndo this. They volunteer. They volunteer as a consequence of the \ninspiration of their older brothers and sisters, their fathers, their \nuncles, their grandfathers who have served in previous military \nconflicts.\n  They look upon the Congress as that bastion that safeguards--\nsafeguards--those who are put in harm's way. I ask, do these comments \nconstitute embracing, as we should, those families, those children? Is \nthat safeguarding those put in harm's way? I say no.\n  I simply say the goal of this operation in Iraq and the goal of the \noperation in Afghanistan is to bring to those troubled regions of the \nworld, at long last, a measure of freedom for the peoples of those \nnations, a measure of their ability to govern themselves.\n  I am proud the United States, behind our President, has taken that \nleadership to bring about that measure of freedom and democracy in \nthose foreign lands. Yes, each of us is paying by the loss of life, the \nloss of limb, but history will record, in this hour of world history, \nAmerica stands strong. It is committed to its goals. I am confident \nthis body will support our President on measures that he needs to \nfulfill these objectives.\n  The decision to confront Saddam Hussein was not without careful \ndeliberation, extensive diplomacy, and substantial effort to find a \npeaceful solution. It had been the conclusion of three consecutive \nAmerican administrations, countless other nations, and the United \nNations that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime had weapons of mass \ndestruction, had used them on his own people and neighboring countries, \nand was a clear and present danger to regional and world peace. It had \nbeen the conclusion of the Clinton administration that Saddam Hussein \nhad stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, was actively seeking \nmore, and would ultimately use them again. The United Nations Security \nCouncil had passed 17 resolutions, stretching back to 1991--12 years--\nrequiring full cooperation in disarming itself of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Saddam Hussein's response was defiance and deception.\n  In October 2002, after an unprecedented amount of debate, the Senate \nvoted 77-23 to authorize the President to use force in Iraq. The House \nof Representatives also voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing \nthe use of force. By that act, it became our war and the American \npeople's war, not the President's war. At this critical juncture, it is \nour responsibility to provide the resources necessary to finish the \njob.\n  American armed forces, joined by a robust coalition, achieved \nextraordinary, rapid military success in Iraq, with minimum casualties \nand damage. This is a clear tribute to the professionalism and \ndedication of our young men and women in uniform and those who support \nthem. We have succeeded in ridding the world of a brutal tyrant and \nhave revealed the extent of his barbarism. We should be congratulating \nour President and our armed forces on a job well done, not criticizing \nand undermining their heroic efforts.\n  Extensive planning was done for combat operations, as well as post \nconflict stability operations. We all know that no plan survives its \ninitial confrontation with reality on the battlefield. Plans must be \nflexible and adapt to conditions as they are encountered. No one could \nhave anticipated the complete disintegration of Iraqi security and \ngovernance institutions. No one knew how badly the Iraqi infrastructure \nhad deteriorated under Saddam Hussein's 30-plus years of mismanagement.\n  American forces and coalition partners have done a remarkable job of \nrestoring basic services, rebuilding schools and hospitals, preventing \nethnic violence and creating an environment where reconstruction can \nsucceed. This is being done in a difficult environment of harsh \nconditions and significant risk, as those who have been removed from \npower seek to delay inevitable defeat and as terrorists lash out at the \nloss of another haven.\n  What is the best way to reduce U.S. casualties and create the \nconditions for withdrawing U.S. troops? The key is to improve the \nsecurity situation by restoring essential services, recruiting and \ntraining dependable, indigenous Iraqi security forces, and repairing \nthe infrastructure so that real economic growth and opportunity can \nflourish. The emergency supplemental request of $87 billion submitted \nby President Bush specifically addresses this need.\n  It is imperative that we give our President and our troops the \nresources they need to complete their missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe faster the money gets to these countries, the faster conditions \nwill improve, and the faster our troops will come home. We must, and we \nwill, stay the course and achieve our goals. This is also a clear \nmessage of support and resolve to our troops, their families, and the \nneighborhoods and communities that support them.\n  Lasting peace and security in Iraq will be achieved when we establish \nthe environment for a democratic, economically viable Iraq. The \nsupplemental request now before the Congress will ensure such an \nenvironment and is the best path to the earliest possible return of our \ntroops. Half a century ago, the Marshall plan brought peace and \nprosperity to a war-ravaged continent. That modest investment has been \nrepaid a hundredfold or more. The funding we are being asked to provide \nfor this important region is an equally important investment that will, \nlikewise, be repaid many times over in the decades to come. I urge my \ncolleagues to support and rapidly approve the President's request and \nsend a message of overwhelming bipartisan support to our troops, and to \nall American citizens, of the need to stay the course and secure this \nimportant victory in the war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it was my understanding that the \nDemocratic side had from 9:30 to 10, and the Republican side from 10 to \n10:30. Could you clarify where we stand at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There were 60 minutes divided starting at 9:38 \na.m. Currently on the majority side there are 6\\1/2\\ minutes; on the \nminority side there are 7 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to ask, then, that the \nminority take its time, after which I would like to reserve the \nremainder of our time for Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are not going to take our time now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me clarify that. What is the \nstatus, then, of the minority's time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 7 minutes 41 seconds. The majority \nhas 6 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it was my understanding that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement. The time is just \nequally divided.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. May I ask the distinguished minority leader what his \nintentions are, then, with regard to the minority time, because we had \nthought we had a division that is the tradition here where the minority \ntakes the last 30 minutes on one day and then the majority the next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is correct. What \nhappened this morning is the majority went ahead of their normal time. \nI say to my friend, the Senator from Texas, we are going to ask for \nmore time, anyway. Quite frankly, we didn't know when morning business \nwas scheduled that the purpose was to attack another Senator. Based \nupon that, we are going to ask, when all time expires, for more time. \nSo we should all have time to state our respective positions.\n  We have a number of Senators who are on their way to the Chamber now. \nSenator Dodd is here now to say a word regarding the statements that \nhave been made by the majority. So we are going to ask for more time.\n\n[[Page S11775]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in that case, I will withhold for our \nmajority leader to make a decision about what the time allocation would \nbe, and I yield up to 5 minutes to Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Having reflected on this debate on Iraq and postwar Iraq, a lot of \nwhat I am hearing--the rhetoric I am hearing about this administration \nnot having a plan, this administration not preparing for all the \ncontingencies, this administration not having an exit strategy or an \nend strategy--reminds me of a couple of things. No. 1, it reminds me \nabout the same people making the same criticism about the same \nadministration about a month into the war that the generals didn't \nconsider all the different problems they were going to confront, they \ndidn't have a plan, didn't have an exit strategy, et cetera--and then 2 \nweeks later the war was over.\n  I am not suggesting that 2 weeks from now everything in Iraq is going \nto be settled, but this idea that every contingency had to be \nconsidered is ridiculous. No one is smart enough anywhere to consider \nevery contingency. What you are smart enough to do is put a basic game \nplan in place, and then, as things develop, have that game plan \nflexible enough to adjust and meet those contingencies. It is exactly \nwhat Tommy Franks did when he put the game plan together for the war in \nIraq. As things changed and developed, as new things came up, they \nadjusted. It is exactly what is going on with Jerry Bremer over in Iraq \ntoday.\n  I also harken back to postwar Germany after World War II. A lot of \nanalogies are being made by both sides about the importance of this \nreconstruction of Iraq as was the reconstruction of the Axis powers \nafter World War II. I remind my colleagues that this plan Truman gets a \nlot of credit for, Marshall gets a lot of credit for, was not in place \nuntil 2 years--2 years--after Germany fell. It was not passed in the \nCongress until 3 years after Germany fell.\n  I remind my colleagues of some of the comments some Members of this \nbody made and some Members of the House made back then. A House Member, \na Mr. Vursell, from Illinois, said--this is in the Congressional \nRecord--\n\n       There is little question in my mind but that the launching \n     of the Marshall plan asking 16 nations to gather in \n     conference and determine how much aid they needed from the \n     United States was a colossal blunder in the very beginning.\n\n  Does this sound familiar--``a colossal blunder''?\n  He said:\n\n       It will be less disastrous to this country if the Members \n     of this Congress will now take over and have the courage to \n     try to salvage what we can in the interest of our Government \n     and the [American] people.\n\n  Now you are hearing the same thing today.\n  History proved that great leadership and great vision have their \nplace in the world. Sometimes Members of Congress, with very narrow \nvision and very parochial interests, don't necessarily do what is in \nthe best interest of the Nation or the best interest of the world.\n  What the President is doing is providing true leadership at a time \nwhen leadership is at a premium. He provided in the Iraq war a great \nplan. He stuck to it in spite of criticism and followed that plan to \nits successful conclusion.\n  There were speeches in the Senate, both sides of the aisle, about how \ndifficult not the war was going to be but how difficult postwar Iraq \nwas going to be, that it would be the difficult and long challenge. Yet \nhere we are a few months afterwards and we are already carping, saying \nit is not finished, it has not been accomplished. Yet by every measure, \nwe are doing much better in postwar Iraq than they did with the most \nsuccessful reconstruction plan in the history of the world, the \nMarshall plan. We are moving forward with economic reforms, currency \nreforms, banking reforms, money to be put in to restore their \ninfrastructure at a much faster and more effective rate than what \noccurred after World War II. This is a plan that needs time to work.\n  I understand the pressures of the 24-hour news cycle. Thankfully, in \n1947 they didn't have that. But we have it today. And so the need is \nalways immediate. There can be no room for delay or failure. We are in \na push-button world, and we have to solve the problems today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 14 seconds left.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. For the majority side. And how much on the minority \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to use the 1 minute 14 \nseconds to say that there is one thing I must object to that was said \nrecently by Senator Kennedy, when he said that the war is ``a fraud \nthat was made up in Texas to give the President a political boost.'' I \nhave great respect for Senator Kennedy and every Senator who represents \nhis or her State in this body. But that is a slur on my home State of \nTexas, to say this plot was made up in Texas.\n  I remind the people of America that Texas is a patriotic State, that \nTexas has 1 in 10 Active-Duty military. On the very day that statement \nwas made, a plot in Texas to help a political campaign of a President, \nin fact, on that very day, three Texas soldiers were ambushed in Iraq \nand lost their lives serving our country. Those are great Texans. The \n4th Infantry Division from Fort Hood, TX, is there now, as we speak.\n  As I traveled through Afghanistan and Iraq, I met Texans who were \nserving their country. I don't think there should ever be a slur on \nanother State when we are talking about foreign policy or the policies \nof a President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11775-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11775-S11779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ATTACK ON SENATOR KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are still negotiating with \nregard to the schedule for the course of the next hour or so. We will \nask for some additional time to respond to this attack on Senator \nKennedy. I believe this is getting to be a real practice here. I was \nthe brunt of similar criticism last spring. It seems as if anyone who \ncomes to the floor to express concern or to express his or her views on \nIraq is now the subject of attack.\n  Regardless of one's views, to impugn someone's patriotism, to \nquestion the motives, to challenge the integrity is wrong. We ought to \nhave an opportunity to have an open, candid expression of views without \nchallenging----\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am going to finish my statement and I will be happy to \nyield to the Senator from Utah.\n  We ought to have an opportunity to have this open discussion and \nexpression of views without challenging the motives, the patriotism, or \nthe very right of any Senator to express him or herself. Senator \nKennedy did that. Many of us have done that now over the course of the \ndebate. We may ultimately come to different conclusions about what the \nfacts are or about the specific policies involving Iraq or our \ninvolvement in the questions we are facing right now with regard to the \n$87 billion. But I must say, let's keep this an open and fair \ndiscussion of the facts, without always impugning someone's integrity \nor personal motivation.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Utah. I am told we only have \na couple minutes left. Until we reach agreement, I will yield at this \ntime to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that the \nexchange between the Democratic leader and myself not be charged to \ntheir time, if he would be willing to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Does the Senator yield for \na question?\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DODD. Under the circumstances the Senator from Utah has \ndescribed, this will not detract from the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. My question is very simple: I ask the Democratic leader \nif at any time in my presentation did he find where I attacked the \nmotives, the patriotism, or the rights of the Senator from \nMassachusetts? My intent was--and it is my belief that I stood up to my \nintent--to challenge the accuracy of the statement of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, never having made any reference to his motives, his \npatriotism, or his rights. If the Democratic leader has instances where \nI did that, I would appreciate it if he would point that out to me so I \ncan make the appropriate response.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was not on the floor when the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah spoke. I am relating not necessarily to \nhis comments specifically but to this general approach Members on the \nother side seem to use any time one of those in the Democratic caucus \nspeaks out, expresses him or herself, raises concerns or in some way \ncriticizes this administration with regard to its policy in Iraq. There \nis an orchestrated effort to attack those who criticize.\n\n  I am not saying that the Senator from Utah may have done so \nspecifically on the floor this morning. I will look forward to reading \nhis comments. But that is the approach. I think it is unfair. I think \nit is unfortunate. It demeans the debate that we ought to be having in \nthe Senate about these important issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I wish to quickly respond to my colleagues and friends on the other \nside. I supported the President's request for authority in Iraq. I \nbelieved at the time that was the right vote to cast.\n  But it is important to focus on the war issue and what is going on in \nIraq in the construction period, the economic and political efforts \nthere. There is growing concern, both here and abroad, that this is not \ngoing well. We can spend all day debating about what our colleagues \nsaid or didn't say, what their motives or intentions were, but that \ndiverts attention from what the debate ought to be; that is, we have a \nrequest before us for $87 billion. We will have to vote on that in the \ncoming days. The American people want to know where we stand on that. \nHow is the money going to be spent? Where is it going?\n  Why are we losing a soldier a day it seems, or 10 are being wounded \nevery day? Why isn't the rest of the world joining us? What efforts are \nbeing made? The President may be giving a speech right now at the \nUnited Nations. Spending our time in this great deliberative body \narguing over what one of our colleagues said over the weekend in an \ninterview detracts from what ought to be the real debate, and that is \nwhether we are on the right track or the wrong track when it comes to \nrebuilding Iraq, getting the government turned over to the Iraqi \npeople, getting international support for the efforts and how the \ntaxpayer money is going to be used.\n  Spending our time talking about what Senator Kennedy said--I think \nhis spirit reflects where many Americans are. You may not agree with \nevery word. That is not the point. We rarely agree around here on \nspeeches we give, but we ought to be debating how we get it right in \nIraq instead of spending time this morning arguing about whether or not \nwe agree or disagree with what our colleague said in an interview in \nhis home State. The American public wants to know what is happening in \nIraq, not what is happening in Massachusetts--not what one said but \nwhat is the policy of this Government and what is the Senate saying \nabout it. That ought to be the debate.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if any of my colleagues want to be \nyielded some time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, morning business has expired. I would ask \nunanimous consent--and I do this with the greatest respect--that we, \nthe minority, be given the next 20 minutes and that the minority have \n10 minutes to respond.\n  The reason I suggest that is that there has been a half hour here \ndirected toward one Senator. We think that we would, with the 7 minutes \nwe have been given and the 20 minutes that I am asking, be nearly \nbalanced--not totally balanced. In fact, it would still be out of \nbalance, with 40 minutes for one side and about 30 to respond to that--\nin fact, 27. So I would ask unanimous consent that we be given the next \n20 minutes; following that, the majority be recognized for 10 minutes, \nstill as if in morning business, and that the work of the Interior \nappropriations subcommittee, the vote, plus the 10-minute speeches \nprior to the vote, be set aside for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot suggest the absence of a \nquorum until he gets time.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my unanimous consent request and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. As to the unanimous consent request, for \nclarification, after the 30 minutes that we have just allocated by \nunanimous consent, there will be 10 minutes equally divided on the \nDaschle amendment, after which there will be a rollcall vote. So \nMembers would know that at about 11:20 to 11:25 we will have a vote.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am not quite sure. What is the \nparliamentary situation?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, if I could answer the \nSenator from Vermont, we have 20 minutes now. The Republicans have 10 \nminutes. We will allocate that time as if in morning business. I would \nbe happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle who have come to the Senate floor this morning to \ncriticize the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  Last week, Senator Kennedy, speaking for millions of concerned \nAmericans, challenged the President and his advisers for misleading the \ncountry about the war in Iraq.\n  Every Senator is free to disagree with the views of another Senator. \nThat is the nature of debate. But too often, officials in this \nadministration, and some of my Republican friends, have questioned the \npatriotism, and the right to disagree, of those who criticize policies \nthey believe are fundamentally flawed.\n  Senator Kennedy has asked hard and important questions about a policy \nthat--contrary to what the American people were told to expect--has \nalready resulted in the loss of life or limb of hundreds of American \nsoldiers and is costing billions of dollars with no end in sight.\n  The reality is that since the fall of Baghdad, practically everything \nthe White House and the Pentagon predicted about Iraq has turned out to \nbe wrong. Yet you would hardly know it from listening to officials in \nWashington who consistently give evasive and overly optimistic \nassessments.\n  The administration's own shifting statements show that the threat \nposed by Iraq was not what we were led to believe.\n  Just a few months ago, Vice President Cheney insisted that Saddam \nHussein had reconstituted nuclear weapons. No weapons of mass \ndestruction have yet been found.\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\n  Last week, Secretary Powell said the use of chemical weapons against \nthe Kurds was the justification for a preemptive war 15 years later. As \nmuch as I admire and respect the Secretary, that is grasping at straws.\n  For months, the White House and the Pentagon tried mightily to draw a \nconnection between Saddam Hussein and the attack against the World \nTrade Towers. Last week, the President belatedly conceded that there \nwas no link.\n  Vice President Cheney said our troops would be treated as liberators. \nI am sure that most Iraqis are grateful that Saddam Hussein is gone. I \nam too. But it is clear the Iraqi people increasingly don't want us \nthere.\n  We should all be concerned that when our soldiers--who have performed \nso bravely--are ambushed and killed, there seems to be increasing \njubilation in the streets, and not just by the remnants of Saddam's \nregime.\n  Then, there is the issue of cost. Five months ago we passed a wartime \nsupplemental with $2.5 billion for reconstruction in Iraq. At the time, \nwe were told that was all that U.S. taxpayers would be asked for this \nyear. That, we have learned, was a gross miscalculation.\n  Former-OMB Director Mitch Daniels said the total cost would be \nbetween $50 and $60 billion. Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz said:\n  We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own \nreconstruction, and relatively soon. The oil revenues of that country \ncould bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next \ntwo or three years.\n  We now know those predictions were wildly off the mark.\n  We are also paying other countries to support us. The State \nDepartment's own documents show that since April, the United States has \nprovided almost $4 billion to coalition partners, other nations who \nsupported our efforts in Iraq, and allies in the region. This does not \ninclude billions of dollars in loans.\n  Now the President wants another $87 billion for Iraq. Within a year, \nwe will have spent far more than $100 billion, and it is clear that the \nadministration will be back for many more tens of billions of dollars \nbefore next year is out.\n  We don't have this money in the bank. It is red ink. We are headed \nfor a $1 trillion deficit, which will fall squarely on the backs of our \nchildren and grandchildren. That could very well be our most lasting \nlegacy.\n  We are spending all this money in Iraq, but there is no supplemental \nto help the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have lost their jobs \nhere at home. There is no money to fix our dilapidated public schools. \nThere is no money for health care for the millions of Americans who \nlack health insurance. None for low income housing for Americans living \nin poverty.\n  I hope my Republican friends who have rushed here to defend the \nPresident's preemptive war and his policy of nation building, are also \nconcerned about how much it may cost, how long it may take, and how \nmany American troops may be needed in the years to come. They should be \nasking these questions too.\n  We cannot continue to drift along, spending more than $1 billion a \nweek, with no plan other than business as usual, no realistic time \ntable, every week another four or five Americans killed or wounded, and \nthe growing resentment of the Iraqi people.\n  It is long past time to abandon the same old ``go it alone'' \nstrategy. We need to get the international community involved. We need \nto work towards bringing our soldiers home sooner rather than later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from \nVermont for his comments. I think I will simply add that the vast \nmajority of the American people agree with him. I appreciate very much \nhis contribution to this discussion.\n  Teddy Roosevelt once said:\n\n       To announce that there must be no criticism of the \n     President or that we are to stand by the President right or \n     wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but it is also \n     morally treasonable to the American public.\n\n  There has to be open dialog, candid discussion about the \nextraordinary ramifications of many of the issues that are confronting \nus relating to Iraq, or we will be morally treasonable.\n  The President has requested an additional $87 billion in money for \nIraq over the next several months. Requesting the money is no \nsubstitute for a plan, and the President has no plan. In fact, we don't \nknow where the money has gone so far. There is little accounting of the \nbillion dollars a week that we are currently sending to Iraq--$1 \nbillion a week, with very little if any transparency with regard to \nthat commitment.\n  Now the President is saying he wants $87 billion more. General \nAnthony Zinni recently spoke to a group of Marine officers, and here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       [Our troops] should never be put on a battlefield without a \n     strategic plan, not only for the fighting--our generals will \n     take care of that--but for the aftermath and winning that \n     war. Where are we, the American people, if we accept this, if \n     we accept this level of sacrifice without that level of \n     planning? Almost everyone in this room, of my \n     contemporaries--our feelings and our sensitivities were \n     forged on the battlefields of Vietnam; where we heard the \n     garbage and the lies, and we saw the sacrifice. We swore \n     never again would we do that. We swore never again would we \n     allow it to happen. And I ask you, is it happening again? And \n     you're going to have to answer that question, just like the \n     American people are. And remember, every one of those young \n     men and women that don't come back is not a personal tragedy, \n     it's a national tragedy.\n\n  You cannot say it any more powerfully than that. That was not some \npolitician. That wasn't one of our elected Senators. That was General \nAnthony Zinni, who knows a great deal about sacrifice and about what it \nis to go into circumstances like this without a plan.\n  So I think it is incumbent upon us to ask the questions: Where is the \nplan? What will it cost? Why can't we get better international support? \nHow long will our troops be there? When will they come back? What level \nof cooperation are we getting from the Iraqis themselves?\n  If you read the papers in the last couple of days, we are not even \ngetting full support from the Iraqi Council.\n  I think it is critical, especially in these days before the \nsupplemental is brought before the Senate floor, that the level of \ndebate, the questions that we have a right to ask, are asked and \nanswers are given. Where is the sacrifice, you might ask, when the \naverage tax cut for those at the top 1 percent is $238,000 this year? \nWhere is the sacrifice for those who benefit the most?\n  We are asking a lot of sacrifice from our soldiers. We are asking a \nlot of sacrifice for those veterans who come back. Then we tell them we \nare not going to give them the full measure of support in the budget \nfor the health care needs they have once they are here? You see the \nbumper stickers: ``Support Our Troops.'' What happened to our veterans? \nWhy don't we see the same bumper stickers with some advocacy, some \nrecognition of the need to support our veterans, too? But it is not in \nthe administration's budget. We are told we can't afford it. We are \ntold they have to just suck it up and sacrifice. The sacrifice is not \nbeing borne equally, and that is what many of us have been asking a \nlong time--why not? Why not?\n\n  So I look forward to the coming days where we can have an all-out \ndebate. Many of us will be presenting alternatives, amendments to this \nrequest by the President. We will have more debate about that matter. I \nknow there are other Senators who wish to be recognized and to speak in \nthe time that we have remaining.\n  I yield such time as he may wish to the distinguished Democratic \nwhip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I ask Senator Dodd be given the last 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in baseball you have seen the teams pile \nonto each other. That only happens on one occasion, generally, in \nbaseball, which I understand quite well. One of the pitcher's weapons \nis to throw a ball inside, and that happens all the time to keep the \nbatter loose. But you never throw at someone's head. That, in effect, \nis what happened here, and that is why we have had the Senators \nrallying here because, in effect, someone threw a ball at the head of \none of our Senators, and that is not right.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Dodd, whom we all know is a close \npersonal friend of Senator Kennedy--I\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\nwould expect nothing less--defending his close personal friend. But he \nalso defends the institution itself. He is in the process not only of \ndefending his close personal friend but the institution.\n  As we have said, people who deliver a message that this \nadministration doesn't like are attacked. There is no better example of \nthat than Senator Daschle, who has been attacked personally with TV ads \nbeing run against him in his own State by people who are just voicing \nthe administration's line. There have been many other ways he has been \nattacked.\n  When it comes to rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure--the electric grid, \nthe water supply, the highways--I think there are a number of questions \nthat need to be answered for the American people. People may not have \nliked how Senator Kennedy phrased his objection to what has gone on and \nwhat is going on, but he said it. He raised issues. Let's not attack \nhim; let's talk about the issues.\n  I have some questions. What are the assumptions underlying the \nPresident's request for $87 billion, and how many months for \nreconstruction will it cover? Why haven't we done more for Afghanistan? \nThat is a question I have. What is the best case scenario for \ninternational contributions? What will the administration request next \nyear? What is going on with Iraqi oil revenue, which we were led to \nbelieve would pay to rebuild the country? What happened to their seized \nassets?\n\n  Another question is, Why is the contracting process less transparent \nthan U.S. law requires, and which companies are profiting from these \ncontracts? What is the status of the Iraqi Army and the police?\n  The American people deserve answers to these questions. That is why \nMembers of Congress, including decorated Members such as Congressman \nMurtha and Senator Hagel, have been raising these and other questions. \nNo one should question their patriotism. They are doing their duty just \nas Congressman Murtha and Senator Hagel did when they wore the uniform \nof the American military.\n  No one should dream of questioning the patriotism of Senator Kennedy, \nwho has served the body for four decades. He doesn't have all the \nanswers of what is going on in Iraq, but he has a right to ask \nquestions. The responses to his questions, unfortunately, have all been \ntoo familiar. Whenever someone has the temerity to criticize the \nactions of this administration, the response is a personal attack.\n  A former Member of this body, Senator Max Cleland, was the first to \nrecognize the need for the Department of Homeland Security. But he \ndidn't agree with every detail of the administration's plan for that \nDepartment. So this man was attacked and his patriotism was questioned \nduring the 2000 Presidential race. Even Senator McCain, who served 7 \nyears in a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam, was attacked because he did \nnot agree with the President on every issue.\n  The list goes on. It should trouble any of us when Americans feel \nfree to raise questions about the policies of their Government and then \nare criticized. What troubles me is when those questions go unanswered \nand personal attacks take place.\n  I have asked questions about today's plan in Iraq because my ultimate \nconcern is the protection and safety of our troops. I will do anything \nI can to support our troops in every way possible. They will get every \ndollar they need for security and ongoing military operations. But I \ndon't want to give Iraq a blank check, while our children get a bounced \ncheck for education, while our efforts to rebuild our own roads and \npower grids go begging.\n  The President has the responsibility as commander in chief to bring \nthe international community together and rally our allies behind a \ncomprehensive plan that will complete our mission in Iraq. We cannot \ncontinue to fight a war without a plan for victory.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of questions. It has nothing to do with \none's patriotism. We have a right to ask these questions. I say to the \nadministration, please don't attack the person who asked the question. \nAnswer the question.\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 4 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the Democratic leader \nand the Democratic whip, Senator Reid, for their comments, and Senator \nLeahy for his comments as well.\n  As I said a few minutes ago, I voted to give the President the \nauthority to use force. Others didn't. I respected that decision but \nreached a different conclusion. I am just concerned when I hear the \ndebate shift, as it has this morning, from what we need to be doing in \nIraq to get this right, to those who take a different position or \nquestion the motivations that led us to this particular point. By the \nway, going back looking historically, the comments Senator Kennedy \nmade--whether you agree or disagree with them, and I don't think they \nought to be the subject of the debate; the debate ought to be about \nIraq--go back to January 19, 2002, and Karl Rove, Chief of Staff of the \nWhite House addressing the Republican National Committee. I quote him \nwhile speaking to that group. According to the Washington Post story, \nhis top political advisor said this:\n\n       . . . Republicans will make the President's handling of the \n     war on terrorism the centerpiece of their strategy to win \n     back the Senate and keep control of the House in this year's \n     midterm elections.\n       We can go to the country on this issue because they trust \n     the Republican Party to do a better job of protecting and \n     strengthening America's military might and thereby protecting \n     America.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The second place we should go to the country is on \n     protecting the homeland. We can go to the country confidently \n     on this issue because Americans trust the Republican party to \n     do a better job of keeping our communities and families safe.\n\n  That is the top political advisor to the President in January of 2002 \nsuggesting that in fact we can make this a partisan issue. You may not \nlike the statements of Senator Kennedy, but there is a genesis here \nthat could draw a conclusion that there have been political \nmotivations.\n  My view is simply, look, to spend this morning debating what one of \nour colleagues said on an interview someplace detracts from what ought \nto be the subject of debate: how do we get it right in Iraq? That ought \nto be the common challenge. We have a major request of $87 billion in \nfront of us and there are legitimate questions being raised about how \nto do this, how to get this right. We ought to be spending our energy \nand time and that of our staffs on organizing and debating and \ndiscussing how we can get this right as a coequal branch of Government, \nconstitutionally charged with the conduct of foreign policy. This body \ndeserves--in fact, its history and the country demand that we do a much \nbetter job of focusing on the foreign policy matter before the Nation \nand the world, getting about the reconstruction, and getting the \npolitical and economic questions right in Iraq, and taking our time to \ndebate what one Senator says seems to be, quite transparently, an \neffort to divert the attention of the country and the media to one of \nour colleagues rather than the far larger issue, and that is whether we \nare going to go further into debt without paying for these additional \nmoneys that are deserved for our military, certainly, and questionably \non the reconstruction effort.\n\n  My hope is we can move away from the debate of what one colleague \nsays and start talking about what needs to be done to get this \nsituation in Iraq on the right track.\n  Certainly, if you go back and look at the history, as I said earlier, \nthe suspicions that the administration was motivated in part by \npolitics are rooted in the fact that the top political advisers of this \nadministration have made the case to their own party faithful that in \nfact part of their motivations are to look at gaining political favor. \nIt was a great disappointment then because there was a sense of unity \nin the country about fighting terrorism together, getting homeland \nsecurity right together, and certainly getting Iraq right together is \nwhat we ought to talk about. There are legitimate issues. Why are we \nnot getting the international support? Where will the money come from? \nAre we going to get ourselves further into debt? How are our needs at \nhome going to be addressed? How are we going to get the Iraqis back in \ncontrol of their country?\n\n[[Page S11779]]\n\n  These are the questions we ought to be working on--not whether some \ncolleague made a statement you disagree with and that we organize \nourselves in a structured response to that, rather than take the time \nwe ought to in order to get a situation that the American public wanted \nto know more about, which is a deep problem that is getting worse. The \nlonger we fail to address it and try to divert attention to other \nmatters, it does a great disservice to our men and women in uniform and \nto the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I hope any further debate about what one colleague \nsays would be confined to how we can get the Iraq situation on the \nright track and how we are going to spend the bulk or a good part of \nthe $87 billion on the reconstruction phase of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11779-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11779-S11780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STANDING UP FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 4 minutes. I \nthink a lot has been said here about the words of Senator Kennedy. I \ndon't think anyone on the floor has cast aspersions on the Senator. He \ncertainly has a right to say anything he wants to say. But I also think \nmany of us who believe the President is trying very hard to do the \nright thing for our country have the right to take up for our \nPresident, stand up for our President, and talk about the issues.\n  I think Senator Kennedy would be the first to say he should stand by \nhis words, he must take responsibility for his words. It is my opinion \nthat when you use words such as ``fraud'' and ``bribery'' in talking \nabout the policies of the United States, it is fair game for us to \nrespond to that and say I think it is absolutely wrong to say we are \nbribing political leaders all over the world by giving them American \ndollars.\n  We are giving foreign countries American dollars for a variety of \nreasons. Is it a bribe that we would make a loan to the country of \nTurkey after Turkey has just led the command and control of the \nsecurity forces in Afghanistan, doing a great service for all of the \npeople of the world to try to help keep the peace and security in \nAfghanistan, which was very costly to a relatively small country? That \nwe would be making loans to Turkey, is that a bribe? I don't think so. \nIs it a bribe to give money to Russia for part of its economic \nimprovement? I don't think so. I think Russia has shown it can be quite \nindependent. So has Turkey. No one is accusing them of doing everything \nthe United States has asked them to do. But foreign aid is part of \nAmerican policy and, in most instances, foreign aid goes for buying \nAmerican products. It gives them the money to buy American products to \nhelp our economy.\n  So I think when people use words, they should be able to take \nresponsibility for those words, and I don't think it casts aspersions \non anyone's patriotism.\n  But if anyone questions my right to stand up for my President who is \nspeaking before the United Nations as we are talking on the floor \ntoday, then I think they are wrong. Of course, we are going to stand up \nfor him. Why would that be a surprise? We are in a terrible war on \nterrorism. We are doing everything we can to support the President as \nhe prosecutes that war. It is not for helping other countries \nexclusively. It is for helping America. It is for American security \nthat we are in Iraq and Afghanistan--to keep terrorists on their soil \nso they do not come to American soil again.\n  The President has not forgotten 9/11. Sometimes I think when I hear \npeople talking that they have forgotten America was attacked.\n  People are talking about an $87 billion package. It is a big package. \nMany of us are trying to ask for contributions from other countries to \nhelp defray the cost of rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan. But let me \nremind you about the cost of 9/11. The cost of 9/11 is estimated at \n$300 billion, and that was one incident. What will be the cost if we \nallow terrorists to come in here because we haven't contained them in \nIraq and Afghanistan? What will be the cost to the American people?\n  We have a right to stand up for our President, and that is exactly \nwhat we are doing. We are trying to talk about the policies that are \nimportant to our country.\n  I yield up to 4 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, after which \nI will yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The Senator from Texas noted the irony of our standing on the floor \nof the Senate at the very moment the President is speaking to the \nUnited Nations. He is speaking before the United Nations to rally the \nworld for our efforts in Iraq. As we stand on the floor of the Senate, \nsome Members are calling into question the President's actions and \ncalling into question the President's motives. It is one thing to call \ninto question his action. It is one thing to call into question his \nplan. But to call into question his motives is one of the things that I \nthink disturbs many people on this side of the aisle, and, frankly, \nmany members of the American public.\n  The Senator from Nevada said that some Members here have been using \nthe baseball analogy of throwing a high hard one at Senator Kennedy's \nhead to back him off the plate. Having reviewed what was said here this \nmorning, I think the best thing we can throw is a change-up on the \noutside corner. Hopefully, we have gotten a strike since we have been \naccurate in what we are saying. But it was not put to anybody's head \nand it was not thrown hard. These were principled statements about the \naccuracy of the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts. We did not \ncomment on his motives. We did not comment on his patriotism. We \ncommented on the accuracy of his statement, which is a legitimate \ndiscussion here in the Senate. I hope we keep to that.\n  We have had a debate on the floor of the Senate. Senator Daschle \nagain questions the planning and actually questioned whether there was \na plan. He used terms which were used back in 1948. A Senator Revercomb \nsaid, ``I charge tonight that there are no restraints placed upon those \nwho administer this act''--similar to what Senator Daschle and Senator \nByrd said. In fact, the statement has been made describing it as a \n``blank check.'' Senator Byrd from West Virginia has used that term \nrepeatedly on the Senate floor--only this comment is not about, \nobviously, the Bush plan in Iraq; it was about the Marshall plan of the \nTruman administration.\n\n  It is remarkable as I have gone through the Congressional Record of \nthe House and the Senate about the debate and the way it happened 3 \nyears after V-E Day. Not 3 months was the plan put into place, not 3 \nweeks was this plan put into place--it took 3 years for the Truman \nadministration to put a recovery plan into place in Europe and for \nCongress to act on it.\n  Back then Members of Congress talked about how this was a blank check \nwhich was going to be a failure and it was unwise policy. Of course, it \nis now seen as one of the greatest foreign policy accomplishments of \nthis country's history. Why? Because we had a President at the time--\nand who at the time was not popular among the American people for what \nhe was doing--who was seen as someone who was not providing a great \nplan or strong leadership but he stuck to his guns. He went to the \nAmerican people at election time, and the American people sustained him \nin office because he provided leadership at a time when leadership was \nneeded; when Members of Congress were looking at their own parochial \ninterests instead of the interests of the country and of the world such \nas, again, is the case here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I certainly join my colleagues in underscoring the fact that, of \ncourse, this shouldn't be a discussion about motives or patriotism. \nThis is not a discussion about a former Senator, Mr. Cleland, or any \nother individual. All of us have the right to disagree on issues of \nsubstance.\n  Senator Dodd was absolutely right. The issues of substance that we \nshould be discussing are how to succeed in\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\nIraq and how to do the right thing for homeland security. But at the \nsame time, all of us are responsible for the words we use and the terms \nwe use and what it conveys not just to the American people but to our \nallies abroad.\n  In this regard, I was most concerned about the use of the word \n``bribery'' in reference to foreign assistance. I think that was a \nmistake. I think that was not just a poor choice of words but a \ncounterproductive choice of words, because to suggest that the funds we \nprovide for reconstruction is bribery suggests that all of the foreign \nassistance we engage in around the world is misspent, or, again in the \nworst case here, bribery.\n  I believe our foreign assistance should be scrutinized, should be \ndebated, and that we should strike the right balance, but in all cases \nthe foreign assistance that we provide around the world should be used \nto further our national security interests. That is an important issue \nof substance. The funds we are providing to Iraq should strengthen \nsecurity in the United States and should strengthen the stability and \nsecurity of the people in Iraq and in the region of the Middle East.\n  In all cases, we should scrutinize that foreign assistance budget. \nBut to refer to it as ``bribery'' I think is a mistake. It sent the \nwrong message to our allies and to those who are benefiting from our \neconomic support, foreign military financing program, and even our \nhumanitarian aid around the world. It is for our national security \ninterests and the purposes for which we do that, and our debate should \nreflect that point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11780-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11780-S11781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2691, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2691) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 1731, to prohibit the use of funds for \n     initiating any new competitive sourcing studies.\n       Reid amendment No. 1732, to authorize the Secretary of the \n     Interior to acquire certain lands located in Nye County, \n     Nevada.\n       Reid amendment No. 1733, to provide for the conveyance of \n     land to the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, for the construction \n     of affordable housing for seniors.\n       Daschle further modified amendment No. 1734, to provide \n     additional funds for clinical services of the Indian Health \n     Service, with an offset.\n       Daschle further modified amendment No. 1739, to strike \n     funding for implementation of the Department of the \n     Interior's reorganization plan for the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee and to transfer the \n     savings to the Indian Health Service.\n       Bingaman amendment No. 1740, to ban commercial advertising \n     on The National Mall.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1734\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote in relation to the amendment \nNo. 1734.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take 5 minutes to talk briefly \nabout this amendment.\n  I have had an opportunity to come to the floor on a couple of \noccasions. Basically this comes down to whether or not we mean it when \nwe say we will provide meaningful health care to our Native American \npopulation. That is what we are talking about today. Unfortunately, as \nmost people know, we are far from that promise. It would take about $5 \nbillion for us to fulfill the promise and to live up to the \nexpectations on the reservations that we see with health care delivery \nin the rest of the country--$5 billion for the IHS clinical services \naccount.\n  This year's budget is $1.9 billion--less than half of what it would \ntake to meet that obligation. As a result, today there is severe \nrationing of health care on every reservation--rationing so severe that \nthey call it the ``life or limb'' test. Unless your life or limb is in \njeopardy, you often do not get care on a reservation today.\n  This chart shows as clearly as anything can just what the commitment \nmade to the Native American people is today when it comes to health \ncare.\n  We spend about $5,915 per capita on Medicare. We spend about $5,200 \nper capita within the VA. We spend about $5,000 per capita in our \npopulation generally for health care. We spend about $3,800 per capita \nfor every Federal prisoner--$3,800 a year goes to our Federal prisons \non a per capita basis for health care alone. We spend $1,900 for Indian \nchildren and their families, in spite of commitments we have made for \nfour generations.\n  What this amendment does is very simple. Last spring, when we had \nthis debate and when we offered the amendment to the budget resolution \nto make whole the Indian health care budget, it was defeated. We \nproposed that we try to level the playing field. That was defeated.\n\n  What the Senate agreed to, reluctantly on my part, but agreed to \nnonetheless, was $292 million, one-tenth of the amount required to make \nthe IHS clinical services budget whole, to provide some parity between \nIndian health and prison health. That was incorporated in the Senate \nversion of the budget.\n  Now we are simply saying: Let's live up to what the Senate said we \nwould do on Indian health this year during the budget debate. Let's \nprovide that $292 million, one-tenth of the amount required, if we are \ngoing to do this right.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how someone could vote \nagainst this, knowing, as we do, we are giving one-half the amount of \nmoney to Indian children as we are to Federal prisoners. We are giving \na fraction to the Native-American population that we give to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This amendment simply acknowledges our need to rectify that \nextraordinary disparity, to deal with it in a way that only we can, to \nsay it is not enough just to talk about it, not enough just to lament \nit, we have to do something about it. Granted, $292 million is a far \ncry from what is required, but at least it is what the Senate said we \nwould do last spring. It is now time to put our money where our mouth \nwas last spring. This amendment is intended to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this amendment provides an additional $292 \nmillion for the Indian Health Service. There is no offset.\n  I don't doubt the numbers the Senator from South Dakota presented. \nThey are factual. I do not doubt his passion for this subject. But \nlet's take a look at what is really happening.\n  Since we have focused on that, over the last 5 years we have added \n$725 million funding to the IHS account. In addition, thanks to the \nwork of my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, we have provided $30 million per year for \ndiabetes efforts. We know that is one of the primary focuses in Indian \nhealth for the following 5 years. That amount was increased to a total \nof $100 million beginning in fiscal year 2001. Reauthorization of this \nprogram has ensured that $150 million for the next 5 years will be \navailable beginning in fiscal year 2004. In short, over the last 5 \nyears, well over $1 billion in new money has been provided in order to \nimprove the health care within our Native-American community.\n  Within the extremely limited resources this subcommittee has been \ngiven over the past several years, we have been responsive to the needs \nof Native Americans and we will continue to make every effort to \nprovide the additional dollars within the overall allocation we were \ngiven.\n  We know well, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know \nwell, what happened last year. Under their leadership, the IHS account \nwas reduced by $75 million in the final hours before markup in order to \nreduce the subcommittee's allocation. Clinical services alone were \nreduced by $50 million.\n  Saying that, despite the decrease, we still have a problem even with \nthe additional moneys we put in this year. We understand the problems \nin the Indian Health Service. We are $88 million over last year's \nlevel, and the adoption of this amendment would exceed the \nsubcommittee's allocation and is subject to a point of order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator yields the floor, I will be recognized \nfor what remaining time I have.\n  This amendment is not offset. Yes, we are told we cannot afford $292 \nmillion. We need $2.9 billion. We are told\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\nwe cannot afford that. I hope someone will come to the floor next week \nor the week after on the other side and say we cannot afford $87 \nbillion for Iraq, then, either. If we cannot afford $292 million for \nour Native-American population, who are experiencing life or limb \ntests, then I sure hope we will not hear the argument on the other side \nthat somehow we can afford providing health care dollars to the Iraqi \nchildren. I bet that is exactly what we are going to hear--$87 billion \nworth of requests. It is a double standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. The pending amendment No. 1734, offered by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, increases discretionary spending in excess of the \n302(b) allocation to the Subcommittee on Interior of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to waive the relevant portions of the balanced \nbudget amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Gibson, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am sure my colleagues want to hear \nabout the outstanding qualifications of this judicial nominee so they \nwill be prepared to vote yea or nay.\n  The Senate is about to vote on the nomination of Common Pleas Judge \nKim Gibson for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania. Judge Gibson now serves on the State court, where he has \nbeen a distinguished jurist since 1998. He has gone through the \nbipartisan, nonpartisan nominating panel that Senator Santorum and I \nhave set up. He is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in 1974. He \nhas a law degree from Dickinson Law School, magna cum laude, 1975. He \nserved with the defenders office helping the indigent. He has had a \ndistinguished practice and now is on the Common Pleas bench in Somerset \nCounty, PA. He is well grounded academically, well grounded \nprofessionally, and I recommend to my colleagues that he will make an \noutstanding Federal judge.\n  I now yield to Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe senior Senator from Pennsylvania. I thank my colleagues for \nallowing the vote to go forward on this very distinguished individual.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we vote to confirm another district \ncourt nominee, to the Western District of Pennsylvania. This nominee, \nMr. Kim Gibson, is currently a judge on the Court of Common Pleas in \nSomerset County, in Western Pennsylvania. Judge Gibson is a graduate of \nWest Point Military Academy and graduated second in his class from \nDickinson School of Law in Carlisle, PA. Over the course of his career \nhe has served in the Army's Judge Advocate General Corps and the public \ndefender service. Not surprisingly, the ABA gave this nominee its \nhighest rating--unanimous ``well qualified.''\n  With today's confirmation, the Senate has now confirmed 154 judicial \nnominees for this President. As I noted this week, the current pace of \nconfirmation stands in stark contrast to what occurred with judicial \nnominees during the Clinton administration. It was not until well into \nthe fourth year of President Clinton's second term when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate, before this many judicial nominees were \nconfirmed. It took President Reagan, during his first term, almost to \nthe end of his fourth year to get this many judicial nominees \nconfirmed, and that was with a Senate that was controlled by the same \nparty. It also took President George H.W. Bush well into his fourth \nyear to get this many of his judicial nominees confirmed.\n  In contrast, today, with the shifts in Senate control, it has \neffectively taken\n\n[[Page S11782]]\n\na little more than 2 years of rapid Senate action to confirm 154 \njudicial nominees for this President, including 100 during Democratic \ncontrol. This year alone the Senate has confirmed 54 judicial nominees, \nincluding 11 circuit court nominees in 2003. That is more confirmations \nin just nine months than Republicans allowed for President Clinton in \n1996, 1995, 1999, or 2000. Overall, we have confirmed 28 circuit court \nnominees of President Bush since July of 2001, which is more than were \nconfirmed at this time in the third year of President Reagan's first \nterm President George H.W. Bush's term, or either of President \nClinton's terms.\n  The Senate has held hearings for 13 Pennsylvania nominees of \nPresident Bush's to the Federal courts in Pennsylvania. While I was \nchairman, the Senate held hearings for and confirmed 10 nominees to the \ndistrict courts in Pennsylvania, plus Judge D. Brooks Smith to the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  A look at the Federal judiciary in Pennsylvania indicates that \nPresident Bush's nominees have been treated far better than President \nClinton's. Today, there is no State in the union that has had more \nFederal judicial nominees confirmed by this Senate than Pennsylvania.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the way vacancies in Pennsylvania were \nleft unfilled during Republican control of the Senate when President \nClinton was in the White House, particularly regarding nominees in the \nwestern half of the State.\n  Just a few months ago, on May 16, 2003, Jon Delano wrote in the \nPittsburgh Business Times, an article titled ``Despite Bush Protests, \nCourt Vacancies are Down,'' about how this President's nominees in the \nwestern part of Pennsylvania have been treated more fairly than \nPresident Clinton's nominees. He wrote:\n\n       Take the Western District of Pennsylvania, for example. \n     During the years of the Santorum filibuster, that court of 10 \n     judges had as many as five vacancies. Today, the Senate has \n     confirmed four Bush appointees--Judges Joy Contie, David \n     Cercone, Terry McVerry, and Art Schwab--and the fifth \n     nomination, attorney Tom Hardiman, has just been sent to the \n     Senate.\n       With the elevation and confirmation of Judge Brooks Smith \n     to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the president still needs to \n     name one more judge to the local court, but once completed, \n     Mr. Bush, with less than three years in office, will have \n     named--and the Senate will have confirmed--six of the 10 \n     judges on the local federal court. That hardly sounds like \n     obstructionism.\n\n  Despite the best efforts and diligence of the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure the confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home State, there were nine \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies who never got a \nvote: Patrick Toole, John Bingler, Robert Freedberg, Lynett Norton, \nLegrome Davis, David Fineman, Harry Litman, Stephen Lieberman, and \nRobert Cindrich to the Third Circuit. Despite how well-qualified these \nnominees were, many of their nominations sat pending before the Senate \nfor more than a year without being considered.\n  The record of this nominee stands in contrast to the record of many \nof this President's judicial nominees, particularly for circuit \npositions. Judge Gibson received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating \nfrom the American Bar Association and has enjoyed a tremendous career \nas both a litigator and a judge. Far too many of this President's \njudicial nominees have limited legal experience and no judicial \nexperience but significant partisan experience. In fact, 23 of this \nPresident's judicial nominees have earned partial or majority ``not \nqualified'' ratings from the ABA. Another nominees to the same court, \nTom Hardiman, has significantly less litigation experience, no judicial \nexperience and was give a partial ``not qualified'' rating by the ABA. \nIt is also interesting to note that their local bar association, the \nAllegheny County Bar Association, gave the two nominees very different \npeer-review ratings. Judge Gibson received a rating of ``highly \nrecommended'' for the district court position. Mr. Hardiman, however, \nreceived a rating of ``not recommended'' by the same local bar \nassociation.\n  Certainly, the citizens of Western Pennsylvania deserve a well \nqualified judiciary to hear their important legal claims in Federal \ncourt. I am pleased to lend my support to Judge Gibson's nomination. He \nwill be the 13th judicial nominee of this President confirmed to the \nState of Pennsylvania and the fifth judge confirmed to the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. I congratulate Judge Gibson and his family.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I heard many of my colleagues today \ndiscussing my remarks on this administration's go-it-alone policy in \nIraq. This administration and my colleagues across the aisle are trying \nto deflect attention away from the administration's failed policy in \nIraq. For the sake of our troops, it is time for this administration to \nspeak honestly about its failures in Iraq. Many Americans share my \nviews, and I regret that the President considers them uncivil and not \nin the national interest. The\n\n[[Page S11783]]\n\nreal action that was not in the American interest was the decision to \ngo to war unilaterally without the support of our allies and without a \nplan to win the peace.\n  There is no question that the White House sees political advantage in \nthe war. You can see it in Karl Rove's speeches to Republican \nstrategists. Just this morning, the New York Times reports that ``the \nWhite House goal is to show substantial improvement in Iraq before next \nfall's reelection campaign.'' You can see it in the way they attack the \npatriotism of those who question them.\n  There are valid questions and deep concerns about the \nadministration's rush to war in Iraq--in its rationale, whether there \nis a plan for winning the peace, how the money is being spent, and when \nour troops can come home with honor. Our troops, their families, and \nthe American people deserve answers--not more politics as usual.\n  The administration has no plan for Iraq, and it shows. American \nservice men and women are paying with their lives. The President's trip \nto the United Nations this week is now the most important journey of \nhis administration but it didn't have to be this way.\n\n  The situation in Iraq is out of control, and American troops are \npaying the price every day with their lives. We have now lost more \ntroops since the President declared an end to major combat than during \nthe war itself. The administration says it has an international \ncoalition, but it is paper-thin. America has 85 percent of all the \ncoalition troops on the ground, and we are taking 85 percent of the \ncasualties. This administration is muddling through day-by-day, while \nthe lives of our soldiers are at risk and their families worry here at \nhome. The administration has been unwilling so far to make the \ncompromises needed at the United Nations to obtain the support our \ntroops need to ease their burden and bring stability and peace to Iraq. \nThe American people want to know from President Bush, when can their \nsons and daughters, their husbands and wives, their fathers and \nmothers, return from Iraq with dignity, having fulfilled their mission?\n  The White House may be saying things are going well and we should \nstay the course. But the American people know that major changes in \npolicy are essential. We need a plan from the administration--a real \nplan--before we write an $87 billion blank check to pay for this \nadministration's hollow policy in Iraq. Terrorist are sabotaging the \nreconstruction efforts, lashing out in every way they can. U.S. \ncasualties continue to rise. The headquarters of the United Nations was \ndevastated by a truck bomb that specifically targeted and killed the \nU.N.'s highly respected chief representative in Baghdad. Nothing is \nsacred. A key Shiite cleric was assassinated in the bombing of a \nmosque. Even the Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad was bombed, in an ominous \nmessage to other Middle East nations that cooperate with the U.S. \nTerrorists are said to be streaming into Iraq to take advantage of the \nnew breeding ground that our failed policy has given them.\n  President Bush has asked Congress to provide $87 billion more in the \ncoming year to set it right in Iraq, but it is essentially a blank \ncheck. He says he will internationalize the conflict, but he doesn't \nwant to share power on the ground. The administration had a brilliant \nplan to fight the war, but no plan to win the peace. It had a brilliant \nplan to overthrow a government, but no plan to deliver on the promise \nof democracy. The American people are confused about why we fought this \nwar, and what our strategy is for winning the peace.\n  Last fall, the President said that Iraq was developing nuclear \nweapons. The, he said Iraq has an active weapons of mass destruction \nprogram. This spring, the administration claimed that Iraq was linked \nto al-Qaida. None of these are true. No one doubts that Saddam Hussein \nwas an evil dictator, but what was the imminent threat to our national \nsecurity? The administration's rationale was built on a quicksand of \nfalse assumptions. In terms of how we will win the peace, the \nadministration also seems confused. The Secretary of State has argued \nthat additional time is needed to establish a new government in Iraq. A \nfew weeks ago, he said, ``it will be some time before any new \ngovernment could take over the responsibilities inherent in being in \ncharge of security.'' But Secretary Rumsfeld, in an effort to assure \nthat we are not getting bogged down, says that things are ``moving at a \nvery rapid pace in Iraq.''\n  Which is it?\n  These and other facts lead the American people to question whether \nthe administration has an effective plan to share the security burden \nwith the international community, reduce the burden on our troops, and \ndeliver on the promise of democracy. The American people deserve \nanswers.\n  How will the administration obtain a broader international mandate--\nthrough the United Nations--to bring in other countries' troops and \nprovide a greater role for the United Nations in the political \ndevelopment and reconstruction of Iraq? How many additional troops are \nneeded to prevent the sabotage undermining the reconstruction? What \nnations will supply troops? What is the estimate of the duration of the \nU.S. military occupation and the likely levels of U.S. and foreign \ntroops required for security? What is the estimate of the total cost of \nsecurity and reconstruction, including the likely amount of \ninternational contributions?\n  What is the schedule for restoring electricity, water, and other \nbasic services to the Iraqi people? What is the long-term schedule for \nthe withdrawal of foreign and American armed forces?\n  The administration must answer these questions and provide a credible \nlong-term plan for Iraq. We can't afford to continue our failed \nstrategy of making it up day-by-day as we go along, when our soldiers \nare paying for it with their lives. We all hope the window to peace \nwill stay open. If it closes, history will have no mercy--it will say \nthis is how we went to war against Iraq, for the wrong reason, and lost \nthe war on terrorism. That is the precipice we not stand on. The \nadministration needs to show the American people and the world a \nplausible plan to correct this colossal failure in our policy.\n  In addressing the United Nations, the President should have taken \nresponsibility for his administration's mistakes in going to war \nwithout the broad support of the international community. We need to \ninvolve the United Nations in a meaningful way in the transition in \nIraq. Our policy cannot be all take and no give. The President should \nwork with the United Nations as long as it takes to get an agreement to \nhelp our troops and bring stability to Iraq. Our troops are doing their \njobs in Baghdad; now President Bush must do his in New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I rise today to offer some comments on \none of the most serious problems we face in this Nation--the severe \nerosion of our manufacturing base.\n  This crisis has been well documented, and the statistics are \ndismaying. According to the Economic Policy Institute, between January \n1998 and August 2003, manufacturing employment dropped by three \nmillion, and manufacturing's share of total gross domestic product fell \nfrom 16.3 percent in 1998 to 13.9 percent in 2002. In my own State of \nWisconsin, 77,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost just in the last \n2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Of course, as shocking as those numbers are, they do not begin to \nconvey the depth of the personal tragedies behind them. Millions of \nfamilies have had their breadwinner thrown out of work, and entire \ncommunities have been ravaged. When the factory shuts down, everybody \nin town feels the impact. Across my home State of Wisconsin communities \nare trying to cope with this crisis on a daily basis. There are, no \ndoubt, a number of reasons for this sudden loss of manufacturing jobs, \nbut at the absolute center has been our appalling trade policy. The \ntrade agreements into which we have entered have failed to protect our \nbusinesses and workers against unfair competition from overseas \ncompetitors. This failed trade policy was the result of an unholy \nalliance of leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties over \nthe past decade and more. I opposed those trade agreements, and\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\nuntil this country's trade policy is changed we will see more and more \njobs shipped overseas.\n  We have seen this most clearly in the manufacturing jobs lost to \nChina, but the problem is broader than just China. People have turned a \nblind eye to the impact of these trade agreements for too long. It is \ntime for reality to set in here in Congress: These trade agreements \nhave failed the American people. They have taken Americans' livelihoods \nand shipped them overseas. People in my State are left wondering who \nthese trade agreements were for, if they weren't for America's workers? \nThese men and women are the heart and soul of the economy in Wisconsin, \nand these agreements have taken their jobs out from under them.\n  The tool and die industry is one of the hardest-hit parts of the \nmanufacturing sector in my State. In the town of Kewaskum, it was \nreported that the county board has taken the extraordinary step of \nmaking a loan to a local tool and die company to help it stay afloat in \nthe face of competition with China. That is not typical for a county \nboard, but it just goes to show how hard communities across Wisconsin, \nand across the country, are fighting to keep manufacturing businesses \nalive. These businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, and we \nturn our back on them every time we say yes to another one of these \nkinds of trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, no single policy can adequately address this problem. \nIf we are to stop this hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs it will take \na concerted effort on several fronts, and over the next few weeks I \nwill come to the floor to discuss some of the steps I think we ought to \ntake.\n  Today I want to very briefly discuss one, and that is tax policy. A \nnumber of my colleagues have advocated changing our Tax Code to help \nbeleaguered domestic manufacturers. In the other body, Representatives \nCrane and Rangel have proposed legislation to help domestic \nmanufacturers by providing them with a tax incentive to keep production \nhere at home, and to encourage those runaway plants that left our shore \nto return. In our body, Senator Hollings has introduced the Senate \ncompanion to that proposal, S. 970, the Jobs Protection Act, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of that measure.\n  Under this bill, the new tax incentive for domestic manufacturers is \noffset by repealing the extraterritorial income provisions of the Tax \nCode. This offset means that the bill is paid for, and won't increase \nour already exploding budget deficit. I think that feature is essential \nto any measure we propose to spur economic growth for, as we know, \nbudget deficits undermine long-term economic growth.\n  The repeal of the extraterritorial income provision deserves at least \na brief comment. The foreign sales corporation tax benefit, and it \nsuccessor, the extraterritorial income, ETI, tax subsidy, were \nchallenged by the European Union before the World Trade Organization as \nillegal export subsidies, and the WTO ruled in favor of the EU.\n  I opposed the ETI provisions when they were before the Senate in the \nfall of 2000 in part because, as I noted at the time, I fully expected \nthe WTO to rule against them, which would subject American firms and \nworkers to a possible multibillion dollar tax on American products \npurchased in the EU.\n  I regret to say that we now face that very problem. If we fail to \nrepeal the ETI provisions enacted in November of 2000, American firms \nand workers will bear the brunt of billions of dollars in trade \nsanctions.\n  This situation is a testament to the failed trade policy that has, in \ngreat part, led to the crisis we are seeking in American manufacturing. \nOur tax policy is being held hostage to the rulings of an international \nbureaucracy, making decisions largely in secret.\n  As I noted 3 years ago, while the ETI tax subsidy may be bad tax \npolicy, it is our tax policy--a policy arrived at through the elected \nRepresentatives of the people of this Nation. The ability of some \ninternational bureaucracy to impose punitive taxes or tariffs on \nAmerican goods should offend all of us. Unfortunately, that is what we \nface because of the action Congress took in 1994 to ratify the GATT. \nAnd unless we eliminate the ETI export tax subsidy, American firms and \nAmerican workers are at risk.\n  Faced with that situation, the best possible choice is to take this \nopportunity to repeal the ETI tax subsidy and use the additional \nrevenue raised by that repeal to help our domestic manufacturers, many \nof whom are directly impacted by the WTO's ruling against the ETI tax \nsubsidy.\n  As I noted earlier, I have cosponsored legislation offered by Senator \nHollings, and I was pleased to do so, but that bill certainly is not \nthe only possible model, and I am willing to consider supporting other \napproaches so long as they are focused on domestic operations and are \nalso fiscally responsible. I understand the chairman and ranking member \nof the Finance Committee are developing a measure that may fit the \nbill. I commend them for doing so, and look forward to reviewing their \nproposal. Our manufacturers are facing a crisis that is in great part \nthe result of the policies promoted by our Government over the past \nseveral years. It is essential that we reform those policies to stop \nmore jobs from being shipped overseas. But we must also take other \nsteps to help American workers, and this sensible change to our Tax \nCode should be one of them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1753.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike section 333 relating to a special judicial appeals \n process for cases involving timber harvesting in the Tongass National \n                                Forest)\n\n       Strike section 333.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is to strike \nsection 333 from the Interior appropriations bill. Essentially, section \n333 is an anti-environmental rider which would impose a 30-day statute \nof limitations for the public to seek judicial review of certain Forest \nService timber sales in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. In other \nwords, it is putting on very tough time constraints for the public to \nfollow if they have a problem with timber sales in the Tongass.\n  I want to show you a little bit of what the Tongass Forest looks \nlike. I was very fortunate to spend a week in Alaska looking at this \nmagnificent park. I think I may well have been right in this area \ndepicted in the photo. You can see how magnificent these pictures are \nand why this rider could be so\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\ndamaging. If there was, say, some movement by the Forest Service to cut \ndown trees and put roads in here, we want the public to have a chance \nto make their case to a court as to why this is not the right thing to \ndo. So that is one photo. I will show you some other photos.\n  This photo represents the area we are talking about. As I said, I had \nthe joy of being in Alaska to actually see this with my own eyes. It is \nso magnificent there. When I was there, of course, daylight lasted \nuntil about midnight. You can see this beautiful land.\n  I will show you one more beautiful photograph. Again, what we are \ntalking about is an anti-environmental rider which would take away the \npublic's right to go to court if they believed some of these lands were \ngoing to be destroyed. The other thing the amendment does is it \ninterferes with the ability of the Federal district court to manage its \ndocket because that section also puts a deadline on the court. So it \nnot only puts a deadline on the people in terms of their inability to \nstudy timber sales, it says to a judge who may have a very busy docket \nthat he or she has to act on this case in 180 days.\n  The Tongass National Forest is the last remaining old-growth \ntemperate rain forest in the world, spanning nearly 70 acres. You have \nseen it here with some of these beautiful photographs. It is the crown \njewel of America's natural forests, and conservation is very much in \nthe interest of all Americans because it is our land and we are the \nstewards of that land.\n  When I was up there, I saw glaciers, mountains, growths of hemlock \nand cedar that grow to be over 200 feet tall. The trees can live as \nlong as a thousand years. I am not a person large in stature anyway, \nbut when you see some of this beauty and realize how comparatively weak \nwe are to the forces of nature, it seems to me when we have a \nmagnificent national forest such as this, at the minimum you don't \nchange the rules just for this one forest. It does not seem right.\n\n  The species that thrive in this forest include the brown bear--I saw \nsome of those--bald eagles--and I saw some of them. I did not see gray \nwolves and wolverines, but I am told they are there. And there are lots \nof salmon.\n  We have this temperate rain forest. It is really a jewel. We want to \nmake sure that, at the minimum, there is a check and balance in the \ncourts if somebody feels or a group feels or a resident feels they are \nnot being protected enough.\n  We are not telling the court they cannot make a decision that favors \ncutting down trees or building roads. We are just saying don't contract \nthe time. It does not seem right.\n  I am going to read parts of letters I have seen. This is one from a \ncouple who is very upset about this anti-environmental rider. They are \nowners of the Clover Bay Lodge, a fishing lodge on Prince of Wales \nIsland in the Tongass. They write:\n\n       We recently received a bad decision from the U.S. Forest \n     Service that will probably mean the end of our very \n     successful fishing lodge business. The Forest Service had no \n     interest in listening to us or others affected by their \n     decisions or even using the correct data regarding our \n     business.\n\n  Then they talk about other elected officials who tried to intercede. \nThey said:\n\n       We wrote letters, we had meetings for over 6 years with the \n     Forest Service and came to the same conclusion time and time \n     again: The U.S. Forest Service had the money and the power \n     and the control to force any decision, good or bad, down the \n     taxpayers' throats. So sometimes the courts are the only \n     place left and the people should not be constrained. Please \n     stop this damaging rider, and do not accept any limitations \n     on the American people's right to defend against the actions \n     of the Federal Government.\n\n  This is really important because so many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle talk about how big Government is bad and we \nshouldn't intrude in private property. Here we have a couple who owns a \nfishing lodge who wants to make a living doing that and says they have \nno other recourse but to go to court. They cannot make headway. With \nthis rider, they will be constrained to get their whole act together in \n30 days, and the court will have to act in 180 days. It seems to me not \nright.\n  I am going to read another paragraph from a letter written by a group \nof scientists who talk about the Tongass in this fashion:\n\n       Alaska's national forests occur within the Pacific Coast's \n     temperate rainforest ecosystem. Throughout the world, old-\n     growth temperate rainforests are rapidly disappearing. Today, \n     the Tongass National Forest represents the largest remaining \n     tracts of old-growth temperate rainforest in the world.\n\n  We are talking about an incredible resource for our Nation.\n  They continue:\n\n       Established in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt, the \n     Tongass is the country's largest national forest. . . . \n     Unlike most national forests, both the Tongass and Chugach \n     still encompass many undisturbed watersheds with a full \n     complement of all native species, including productive \n     populations of bald eagles, wolves, brown bears, and \n     five species of anadromous salmon. And we still have much \n     to learn about the unique biodiversity and archeological \n     resources of this forest.\n\n  The reason I took a moment to read this is because this is quite a \ngroup of people who signed on to this description of this land we are \ntrying to protect: Craig Benkman, Ph.D., from New Mexico State \nUniversity; Andrew Hansen, Ph.D, from the Department of Biology, \nMontana State University; Robert Jarvis, Ph.D., Oregon State \nUniversity; David Klein, Ph.D., Institute of Arctic Biology in Alaska; \nRussell Lande, Ph.D., from the University of California, San Diego; \nWilliam Lidicker, Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley; Dale \nMccullough, Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley; Sterling Miller, \nPh.D., Missoula, MT; Paul Paquet, Ph.D., University of Calgary in \nCalgary, Alberta; Roger Powell, Ph.D., from Raleigh, NC; John Ratti, \nPh.D., University of Idaho; John Schoen, Ph.D., senior scientist at the \nNational Audubon Society, Department of Biology and Wildlife, \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks; Mark Shaffer, Ph.D., Defenders of \nWildlife; Christopher Smith, Ph.D., Kansas State University; Richard \nTaber, Ph.D., University of Montana; and Mary Willson, affiliate \nprofessor, School of Fisheries and Ocean Science, University of Alaska \nFairbanks.\n  The point I am making is, if this is, indeed, a national gift to us, \nwhy we would want to make special rules for 39 timber sales there \nreally escapes me. It just does not seem right, and it does not seem \nfair, and it seems to go against bipartisan support for this \nmagnificent place.\n  I have read parts of a letter from a fishing lodge owner and I have \nread parts of a letter from scientists who do not want to see this \ndamaging rider. I have received another letter from a lodge operator in \nthe same area, Larry McQuarrie, who owns Sportsman's Cove Lodge. I ask \nunanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Sportsman's Cove Lodge,\n\n                                Ketchikan, AK, September 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to describe what's at \n     stake if Senator Stevens rider limiting the public's ability \n     to fully defend their interests in timber sale decisions \n     (Sec. 333 of S. 1391) are passed. If this rider passes, my \n     business would be deprived of my rights to defend my \n     commercial interests against actions of the Federal \n     Government. Any limitation of my right to sue is unreasonable \n     because it would curtail my ability to uphold major business \n     interests and protect my business's economic well-being.\n       I am the owner of Sportsman's Cove Lodge, which is located \n     in Saltery Cove--an area slated for logging. My business \n     relies on the undeveloped nature of the surrounding area. I \n     assure you that our clientele would be singularly unhappy at \n     the sights and sounds of timber harvest dashing their \n     expectations of wild and pristine Alaska. In most cases they \n     would not return until the activity was over--if at all. \n     While the lodge is filled to capacity every season, it is not \n     because there are clients lined up, beating down our doors. \n     It is because we have learned, like other businesses have, \n     that marketing is the key to success.\n       As fishing lodges go, ours is a marketing challenge. We do \n     not have the spectacular King Salmon fishing of the west \n     coast resorts, nor do we have the nearby population centers \n     and draw of the Kenai Peninsula and South Central Alaska. \n     What we do have going for us is excellent service in a \n     beautiful Inside Passage setting. Timber harvest activities, \n     scarred landscapes, log dumps in our cove and in scenic \n     McKenzie inlet, road blasting, helicopters buzzing overhead, \n     and log trucks rumbling across our now pristine backlands \n     would necessitate an increased marketing burden that indeed \n     could very\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\n     well place our operation in jeopardy. If we lose the one \n     thing that we can always market--the solitude and pristine \n     nature of the surrounding--then we face business failure.\n       We have tried to work with the Forest Service to find \n     logging plans that would allow the sale to proceed while not \n     causing problems with our business. Yet the Forest Service \n     has turned a deaf ear to my business concerns and those of \n     other Saltery Cove residents.\n       In FY 2000, Sportsman's Cove Lodge grossed just under $1.9 \n     million. Payroll for the year was $498,000, Capital \n     investment in the lodge and its associated equipment \n     (including a new $250,000 heated winter boat storage and boat \n     hauling facility in Ketchikan) totals approximately $3.7 \n     million. This family business has contributed approximately \n     $1.0 million to the Ketchikan community annually for the past \n     ten years. That contribution is expected to increase for \n     many, many years to come. These are not estimates or \n     projections. These are real numbers of an existing, ongoing, \n     vibrant business that will be in operation far past the 3-4 \n     year life of this project. Make no mistake, this business, \n     the 30 seasonal and 8 full time employees, and the financial \n     contributions it makes to the local economy will be seriously \n     at risk if this sale proceeds as planned.\n       Forest Service timber sales plans show that logging the \n     Saltery Cove area would generate only a total of 42 \n     seasonable timber-related jobs divided up over a period of 5 \n     years. This represents direct earnings of $1.99 million, \n     again, not annually, but for the total of the 5-year project \n     lifetime. Almost apologetically, the Forest Service says that \n     this is justified to ``help maintain the capital investment \n     [in existing mills and lodging operations] already in place \n     in several communities.'' By contrast, the payroll for the \n     lodge during the same 5-year period, assuming nothing happens \n     to impact it, will be approximately $2.5 million, and it will \n     not stop at the end of those 5 years.\n       Let me state that I am not opposed to the responsible \n     harvest of timber in the Tongass, or anywhere else for that \n     matter. I was born and raised in a community that was heavily \n     dependent upon timber. I understand and appreciate all of the \n     reasons for responsibly harvesting our great renewable forest \n     resources.\n       In searching my own soul over these issues I have \n     repeatedly asked myself the question, ``Are the lodge and \n     logging mutually exclusive?'' Sadly, I have come to the \n     conclusion that when the two are in close proximity, they \n     are. I wish that it were not so, but that is the reality. \n     Each one is the antithesis of the other, and no amount of \n     mitigation will resolve the differences other than to \n     physically distance the two. The lodge, is already \n     established in Saltery Cove and cannot be relocated. Logging \n     however is not established, does not make economic sense \n     here, and can go somewhere else.\n       If this rider passes, then there is no due process for the \n     lodge or for my neighbors, and my business and community will \n     suffer major and unnecessary economic harm. Ordinary Alaskan \n     businessmen should be allowed to sue to protect our business \n     and economic interests. Please take actions to remove Sec. \n     333 from the Interior Appropriations bill.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                               Larry G. McQuarrie,\n                                    Owner, Sportsman's Cove Lodge.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Mr. McQuarrie, who owns the Sportsman's \nCove Lodge, says:\n\n       This family business has contributed approximately $1.0 \n     million to the Ketchi-\n     kan community annually for the past ten\n     years . . .\n       If the rider passes, then there is no due process for the \n     lodge or for my neighbors, and my business and community will \n     suffer major and unnecessary economic harm.\n\n  Let's look at Chomley Sound again. That is where this lodge is \nlocated. We can see it is magnificent, but it is unprotected, and it is \non Prince of Wales Island in the southern Tongass. We can see how \nunbelievable this forest is. This small businessman is saying he is \ngoing to suffer irreparable harm if he cannot protect this area. What \nsometimes gets lost is there are so many who seem to say the only way \nwe are going to make money, to lift the economy, is to go after \nresources--cut down trees and drill for oil. Of course, we need to do \nthat in areas where it makes sense, but I am here to say that when you \ngo in to an area that is as magnificent as this forest, the whole \neconomic potential revolves around tourism. I saw that when I was in \nAlaska. It was a pretty wonderful trip.\n  The bottom line is, if there were a lot of trees being cut down and \nnoise being made, we would lose the wildlife and we would lose the \ntourism. That is why I oppose this rider that I think is completely \nunnecessary.\n  I do not have much else to say except I think it is a bad rider and \ninterferes with the judiciary, which I don't think is our job to do. It \nsays to the court: You must hear this in so many days. A lot of us know \nthe courts are backed up. There are a lot of people waiting for \njustice, whether it is one business suing another or somebody has a \nproblem. Now we are saying go to the head of the class. You get to go \nto the head of the line if you want to cut down trees or build a road \nin one of these areas or there is a question about any of these timber \nsales.\n  We encourage courts to move quickly, but it seems to me we don't want \nto force them to have to act on one particular case in a certain number \nof days. It doesn't seem fair to me, and I don't think this section \nsolves any problem.\n  The last lawsuit challenging a Tongass timber sale was 4 years ago. \nIt is not like this is a pressing problem. There are no pressing \nproblems challenging or enjoining the timber sales in Tongass, and \ntimber companies on the Tongass have a huge backlog of timber under \ncontract to be cut. As a matter of fact, they have about 300 million \nboard feet left to be cut. They only logged 34 million board feet last \nyear. So it is hard to understand why we have to make this rule for a \nproblem that doesn't seem to exist. Yet it would take away a \nfundamental right of judicial review for timber sales in Alaska.\n  Maybe there is some good reason this should be done. I have been \ntrying to figure it out myself. Maybe they actually want to reopen \nthese sales. I don't know what it is. But I can say I have looked up \nand down to figure out what is going on. We have people here who are \nvery nervous. They don't want to see a series of attacks continue on \nthe Tongass National Forest. We had an attack last year. I spoke out in \nopposition to it. And we have it again this year.\n  Once again, I hope we strike this rider from the bill and assure the \npublic is given an opportunity to seek judicial review, and that the \njudicial system is not unjustly hindered. The beauty of our country is \nthe checks and balances that we have. All of us learn that when we go \nto school, in the sixth grade, eighth grade, high school, college--the \nchecks and balances between the executive branch, the legislative \nbranch, and the courts. When Congress starts standing up and saying: \nJudge, you have to hear a particular case in 180 days and, people, you \nbetter get your act together, get your case together in 30 days, in my \nview, this is really interfering in the rights of the people we \nrepresent and interfering in the duties of the courts.\n  Once again, feast your eyes on this magnificent area. It was my joy \nto be there for 7 days. I will never forget that trip. The last thing I \nwant to see happen is to weaken the protections we have afforded this \ntemperate rain forest that is so magnificent.\n  It honestly takes your breath way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for some other \npresenters, speakers on the amendments that are pending, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak in morning business for 5 minutes, and ask \nit appear in the morning business section of today's Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to address the pending Boxer \namendment. Is that still the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this provision which Senator Boxer seeks \nto strike--which I call the expedited judicial review provision--has \nbeen misconstrued by the Senator from California. Let me give you first \na little history of the Tongass Forest.\n  In 1917 this forest was established, 17 million acres. It is the \nlargest national forest in the United States. It encompasses over 80 \npercent of all of southeastern Alaska, which is roughly the size of New \nEngland.\n\n[[Page S11787]]\n\n  In 1947, the Tongass Act set aside an allowable sale quantity level \nof 1.38 billion board feet per year. Let me repeat that--1.38 billion \nboard feet per year.\n  In 1959, as part of the Statehood Act, there was an allowable sale \nquantity level established at 1.3 billion board feet per year.\n  Congress continued to review the Tongass. In 1971, the Alaska Native \nLand Claims Settlement Act set what we called the ASQ--the allowable \nsale quantity--level at 950 million board feet.\n  In 1980, that was reduced to 250 million board feet. Under the law, \nwe call it ANICA--the Alaska National Interest Conservation Act--from \n1980 to 1987, the average volume of timber sold and harvested per year \nin the Tongass was 280 million board feet per year.\n  In 1990, the Tongass Timber Reform Act set the ASQ at 440 million \nboard feet. That act also directed the Forest Service to provide a \nsupply of timber to meet the market demand.\n  But in 1997, Congress further reduced the level to 260 million board \nfeet. That was through the Tongass land management plan. We call it the \nTLMP process.\n  So today only 676,000 acres of the 17 million acres in the Tongass \nNational Forest is currently available for timber or timber harvesting \nfor the timber industry. That is from the largest national forest in \nthe United States.\n  Due to litigation, only 34 million board feet in total was cut in \n2002.\n  This forest once supported 4,000 timber jobs. Now the lumber jobs \nhave been reduced by 50 percent. Some of them work for independent \noperators or outside of the national forest on Native land. But 99 \npercent of the jobs associated with the processing of timber, \nparticularly the pulp industry, have been eliminated.\n  In 2001, the timber industry had about 2,000 workers--again, a lot of \nthem not on Federal land--with an annual payroll of $108 million.\n  The Senator from California represents a State that also has national \nforests. In California, there is a healthy and robust timber industry. \nOver 259 million board feet of timber was harvested in 2002 on 10 \nmillion acres of California land. In 2001, the timber industry \nsupported 110,000 jobs with $3.4 billion in annual payroll.\n\n  Despite the rhetoric of the Senator from California, my amendment \ndoes not cripple the public's due process at all. It seeks to deal with \nthe lawsuits pertaining to timber sales in the Alaska region and the \nway they have been handled by those who oppose cutting timber in Alaska \nbut support cutting timber in a national forest half the size of one of \nAlaska's forests, the Tongass Forest. Lawsuits pertaining to timber \nsales are filed in a way that delays the process through the \nadministrative courts, then through the Federal courts. By the time \nthey are through, they are not harvesting.\n  My amendment provides that suits be filed in Alaska District Court \nwithin 30 days after the administrative appeals have been exhausted, or \n30 days after enactment of this act. It directs the District Court of \nAlaska to render a decision within 180 days of the date the lawsuit was \nfiled. We are dealing with judicial process, not environmental process, \nnot the rights of individuals, but abuse, primarily from lawyers from \nCalifornia who file these lawsuits in Alaska. If the court has not \nrendered its decision, the provision in this bill authorizes the \nSecretary of Agriculture to petition the court to proceed with the \naction.\n  The timber sales at issue are subject to an intense public review \nprocess. For each timber sale, a notice of intent to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement is published. The environmental impact \nstatement is prepared, which generally takes 2 to 3 years. Each one of \nthem costs $1 to $3 million. The draft EIS is issued, at which time \nthere is a public comment period. The final EIS is then issued which \naddresses the public comments and makes any necessary changes.\n  Again, the public is invited to comment on the final EIS. Once that \nextensive review process is completed, a record of decision is released \nwhich stipulates the conditions under which the timber sale may \nproceed. My amendment does not cover that part of this process at all. \nThere is no limitation put upon the administrative side at all.\n  If the public has additional concerns, they have an opportunity to \nappeal the record of decision administratively to the Forest Service. \nInvariably that happens. An appeal is made to the Forest Service. After \nthat appeal, there is what we call the record of decision. Of the last \n36 records of decision, 32 were administratively appealed.\n  Despite the extensive environmental review, public participation, and \nadministrative use, lawsuits are still filed. Of the 32 claims \nadministratively appealed, 9 have been litigated. It takes an average \nof 2 years from the time the complaint is filed in district court until \na final judgment is reached, and then it is usually by the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals in California.\n  These lawsuits add enormously to the expense of the taxpayers. They \nhave a devastating effect on the men and women involved in the timber \nindustry in my State. This process can take between 4 and 7 years \nbefore a single tree is harvested under a contract that authorizes \nharvesting of the timber. My provision does not limit access to the \njudicial system, nor does it impair the rights of those seeking \njudicial review of records of decisions. It does not affect the \nenvironmental process. It does not affect the public's right to \ncomment. There is no time line for filing appeals to the district \ncourt's decision. That would be the Ninth Circuit.\n\n  This provision merely ensures there will be timely consideration of \nthis equal process that is fair to environmental groups, the Forest \nService, and men and women of my State who rely upon the timber \nindustry for their livelihood. We merely set a time line for the \njudicial review of records of decision that have been made after the \nadministrative process has been completed. That normally takes 1 to 2 \nyears. Each of these is then appealed to the courts, the district \ncourts, but there is no requirement now that those appeals be filed on \na timely basis. This requires that within 30 days after the decision, \nthere has to be a decision whether they will appeal. If they appeal, \nthe district court must render the decision within 180 days. After \nthat, they have the right to consider the process and appeal to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals if they wish. As a practical matter, we \nhave eliminated the basic area where delay has taken place.\n  Again, let me point out, what we are seeking to do is to require that \nthis judicial review process be expedited. That is a fair way to handle \nthis process which has been so abused by these lawyers. I am a \nCalifornia lawyer, incidentally. California lawyers in my day did not \nact the way these guys are acting; I can state that right now. This \nsays if you take an appeal from the Forest Service--mind you, they are \nafter public hearings on the EIS, they are after public hearings and \ncomments, and after administrative appeals to the Forest Service; and \nthen the time for the basic delay. After they fail to file appeals, \ndelay, delay, and delay, and they get to the court and the court \ndelays. This is relieving the delay in the courts and relieving the \ndelay in filing the appeal from the administrative court.\n  I urge that the motion to strike of the Senator from California be \neliminated. Today these lawyers have 6 years within which to file that \ncomplaint after it has gone through the process of two public hearings, \nadministrative appeal. For the record of decision, they can wait up to \n6 years to file for review of the record of decision. This is, as far \nas I am concerned, a defect in the administrative process for judicial \nreview. That is all we are dealing with.\n  We do not affect environmental rights. We do not affect the right to \nappeal. All we say is, you have to do it within a timely period. The \ndistrict court must act within a timely period so we can tell whether \nthe contracts that have been issued and approved by the Forest Service \ncan be carried out by those who seek to make a living off harvesting \nthe small amount of timber still available from forests in my State.\n  I point out the inconsistency of the Senator from California in \ncomplaining about relieving this process, the delay in this judicial \nprocess, when in the State of California they harvest an enormous \namount of timber from an area that is less than half the size of our \nnational forests. Surely the people of the State of California would \nunderstand that if a decision is made, the\n\n[[Page S11788]]\n\nsmall amount of Alaska's timber area, 676,000 acres in the Tongass \nForest, is available for harvesting, there has to be certainty in the \nreview process so the economics of the timber industry will be sound.\n  I urge defeat of the motion to strike of the Senator from California \nand I move to table that amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I intend to speak on the Reid amendment \nand I would ask what the pending business is.\n  Mr. BURNS. The order of business now is the Boxer amendment. We have \nset aside some time for the Senator to speak on the outsourcing \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Alaska making a motion?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did inquire whether the Senator from Washington was \nseeking to speak on the Boxer amendment. I made a motion to table the \nBoxer amendment and ask unanimous consent that the time for the vote on \nmy motion be determined by the leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. If the Senator from Washington wants to speak on the Reid \namendment, I ask unanimous consent that the present amendment be set \naside and the Senator from Washington retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1731\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Reid that temporarily bars the Department \nof the Interior from spending any more money on competitive sourcing \nstudies.\n  The House has already inserted this language into its Interior \nspending bill, and I hope the Senate will do the same.\n  This amendment is critical so we can assure the people who visit our \nalready overstressed national parks that they will not be subjected to \neven fewer services. ``Competitive sourcing'' is a new term that has \nbeen created to describe the opening up of public sector jobs to \nprivate sector competition. Now, we have all been told that competitive \nsourcing is not the same as outsourcing, but I think it is pretty safe \nto say it is not a whole lot different.\n  As all of us know, one of the primary goals of this current \nadministration is to privatize large numbers of Federal workers. This \nadministration, under its initial outsourcing policy, mandated that \neach Federal agency review for privatization no less than 15 percent of \nits commercial activities by the end of fiscal year 2003. \nUnfortunately, this onerous and apparently arbitrary privatization \nquota did not take into account the different agencies' unique \nconditions.\n  After a lot of pressure from Federal workers, environmentalists, and \nlabor groups, the White House finally abandoned its original blanket \ncompetitive sourcing scheme. But now the initial plan has been replaced \nby a new plan that actually pushes for more outsourcing, not less.\n  Although there is no concrete timeline, this new incentive-based plan \nencourages Federal agencies to outsource 50 percent or more of their \ncommercial activities. So while we in Congress are trying to slow down \nthis outsourcing drive, the administration is now working to speed it \nup.\n  So what does that mean for an agency such as the National Park \nService? I am very concerned that the President's outsourcing policy \nmay well cause critically needed maintenance funds in our parks to be \nspent, instead, on further studies for competitive sourcing.\n  In my home State of Washington, we are very concerned about the \nreports that Mount Rainier National Park, for instance, could possibly \nhave to divert up to 40 percent of its repair budget due to this \noutsourcing and antiterrorism requirements. So when they were faced \nwith this possibility, the National Park Service director at Mount \nRainier promised that at Mount Rainier no more outsourcing studies \nwould be conducted using 2003 and 2004 dollars. This comes as a great \nrelief to the users of Mount Rainier National Park and the surrounding \ncommunities, but now everyone is asking, What about Olympic National \nPark? What about Cascade National Park? Those are national treasures \nthat are in my home State. And what about all the other national parks \nacross the country that remain vulnerable to this proposal?\n  Outsourcing is by no means a new policy for the Department of \nInterior, especially in the National Park Service. The Park Service, in \nfact, currently outsources nearly $2 billion in services, including \nover $800 million in concessions and over $1 billion for contractors.\n  Those contractors currently provide functions such as janitorial \nservices, tree work, garbage pickup, construction, and management \nconsulting--things like that. So when the Department of Interior is now \ntold to outsource up to 50 percent of its commercial responsibilities, \nwe are very concerned that some of the National Park Service's key \nfunctions are going to be threatened.\n  The Park Service, as we all know, was initially created to preserve \nthe natural and cultural resources of the Park System and to provide \nrecreational opportunities for generations of Americans. The last thing \nwe should be doing is lessening the agency's ability to do just that.\n\n  The amendment now before the Senate, that was offered by the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Reid, will not completely stop all outsourcing \nefforts. It will simply slow them down. I believe that is the right \nthing to do.\n  So far, in the case of the Department of Interior, OMB's outsourcing \ninitiative has been on the fast track. The Reid amendment will simply \nprevent funds from this year from being used to initiate any new \nstudies for competitive sourcing. It will, however, still allow the \nstudies initiated with money from the last 2 years to be completed. I \nthink that is the right course to take.\n  Slowing down this outsourcing initiative will allow us in Congress to \nhave the time to analyze the costs and implications of this \nadministration's proposal--I believe something we should have done in \nthe first place.\n  The National Park Service is truly a mission-driven organization. Its \ncore responsibilities include promoting the highest level of \nenvironmental stewardship, and, in turn, providing the best possible \nservice to each and every park visitor.\n  So far, as we all know, the Park Service has done a tremendous job of \ndoing just that. Consistently, 97 percent of our national park visitors \nhave indicated they are ``satisfied'' or ``very satisfied'' with their \nnational park experience. A lot of this public regard is attributed to \nthe high quality and high morale of our Park Service employees.\n  Historically, National Park Service workers have maintained an \nextremely high level of camaraderie and positive spirit. Often these \nwonderful employees of ours are called upon to perform multiple duties \nthat fall outside any one particular job title. It is not uncommon, in \nour national parks, for a maintenance worker to give interpretive talks \non the weekends, or a park geologist to perform first aid, when it is \nnecessary, or for a visitor assistant to help in fighting forest fires.\n  This kind of overlap of job duties is possible because of the way in \nwhich Park Service employees are currently cross-trained and because of \nthe workers' extraordinary commitment to their jobs. In my opinion, \nhaving these kinds of outcomes with 9-to-5 contract workers would be \nvery unlikely.\n  All of the implications of the President's policy of outsourcing in \nthe National Park Service are not yet known or understood by those who \nuse the parks or by Members of Congress who are passing this \nlegislation. I think Congress has yet to carefully consider the \nconsequences of this policy, especially when it comes to the services \nwe expect for our families when they visit our national parks.\n  I am on the floor of the Senate today to thank Senator Reid for \nputting this amendment forward, and I urge the Members of the Senate to \nfollow the House and slow down the President's outsourcing policy to \nprotect the core mission of the National Park Service by voting for the \nReid amendment, and then thoroughly taking the time to analyze and \nunderstand how this will impact our incredible heritage at our national \nparks before we move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week I proposed an amendment to this \nbill\n\n[[Page S11789]]\n\nthat would prevent the administration from privatizing parts of the \nPark Service, Forest Service, BLM, and related agencies.\n  I would like to submit for the Record some statements supporting my \namendment. These are from the National Parks Conservation Association, \nthe Wilderness Society, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, \nand the American Federation of Government Employees.\n  These organizations support my amendment because they share my belief \nthat our National Parks and National Forests are public treasures that \nshould be managed for posterity, not for profit.\n  Their letters cite many reasons why privatizing the operation of our \nNational Parks and Forests would reduce the quality of maintenance and \nservice.\n  As the letter from the Wilderness Society points out, the director of \nthe National Parks Service wrote an internal memo warning that the \nadministration's privatization policy could reduce visitor services, \nand cause layoffs of Parks Service workers.\n  These organizations realize that if we lose dedicated foresters, fire \nfighters, archaeologists and scientists, we will lose valuable \nknowledge about our precious public lands.\n  Protecting our National Parks and Forests is not just a job for these \ndedicated workers; it is a way of life. No job description can do \njustice to their dedication.\n  Just last month at Shenandoah National Park, a search team of four \nPark Service employees found a 10-year-old boy who was lost.\n  Today, the Park Service is reviewing their jobs, trying to determine \nwhether they ought to be turned over to private contractors. Trying \ntelling that little boy's parents that it isn't important to have \nworkers who are familiar with our parks and forests.\n  These are some of the reasons that these organizations are opposed to \nprivatization. There is another reason, which ought to concern every \nMember of this Senate. That is the unauthorized expenditure of public \nfunds. It is our job as legislators to direct public funds to agencies \nand projects that will serve a public need. Congress has never \nauthorized funds for outsourcing studies.\n  The Forest Service spent $10 million just last year on its \noutsourcing studies, 10 million that Congress had designated for \npreserving and protecting our national treasures. The Park Service has \nestimated that it could spend $3 million just to hire consultants. \nPresident Bush made a campaign promise to eliminate the $4.9 billion \nmaintenance backlog that existed in the Park Service when he took \noffice. That backlog is now estimated at $6.1 billion. Meanwhile, the \nPark Service has diverted funds from maintenance projects to conduct \nstudies about outsourcing.\n  In the Pacific West region, several projects are being put off to pay \nfor security measures and outsourcing, including: removing asbestos \nfrom old buildings in Yellowstone National Park, seismic safety \nrehabilitation for 18 buildings in Golden Gate National Recreation \nArea, and upgrading the sewage lagoon at Crater Lake National Park. \nThese projects would protect our parks and visitors. That's why \nCongress set aside money for them.\n  Just because a private contractor knows how to run a business doesn't \nmean he knows how to take care of our public parks. A few years ago, \none park needed five new courtesy docks on a lake. The lowest bidding \ncontractor designed metal docks for an area where temperatures in the \nsummer reach 115 to 120 degrees. Metal docks would have burned \nvisitors, so the design had to be thrown out. That wasted $21,000, and \nonly two docks could be built with the remaining funds.\n  In another incident, public workers used to handle their own garbage \ncollection, at a cost of about $150,000 a year. Then they contracted it \nout. Six years later, the cost is about $500,000 a year. It is no \nwonder that environmentalists, park visitors, and public employees are \nso concerned about the effect this policy is having on our public \nresources. The Bureau of Land Management just wasted $60,000 to study \n26 positions in two States. The BLM employees won their competitions.\n  In all, BLM will spend almost $2 million this year to show the \nadministration that its employees are the most capable and efficient to \ndo their jobs. The public servants at BLM don't need an expensive \nconsultant to prove their commitment to preserving our public \nresources; they prove it every day. Congress doesn't need that, either. \nThat is why we never voted for it\n  Ten million dollars in the Forest Service, $3 million in the Park \nService, $12 million in BLM, and next year it will be more--unless we \nstop it.\n  Article I of the Constitution requires Congress, not the President, \nto authorize and appropriate funds. The administration is bypassing \nCongress to implement its own agenda and is using unauthorized funds to \ndo it. We work hard to make sure we fund projects that are in the best \ninterest of the taxpayers. The administration wants to take away that \nrole. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in doing our \nduty as United States Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Parks Conservation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 300,000 members of \n     the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), we urge \n     you to support the Reid amendment to the FY 2004 Interior \n     Appropriations Act, which forestalls the Administration's \n     effort that could privatize more than half of the National \n     Park Service workforce.\n       The House passed a bipartisan provision sponsored by \n     Interior appropriations chairman Charles Taylor (R-NC) that \n     slows the initiative that is already harming one of the most \n     beloved institutions of American government--the National \n     Park Service. The Park Service, comprised of some of the most \n     dedicated and underpaid public servants in our nation, is the \n     guardian of our most precious natural and cultural treasures. \n     Our collective American heritage should not be placed at risk \n     by a politically driven, inside-the-beltway top-down strategy \n     that places the guardianship of our parks in the hands of the \n     lowest bidder without regard for the impact on the values \n     embodied by our national parks.\n       Outsourcing is an appropriate tool when appropriately used. \n     But that's not what the administration is doing. Although \n     Clay Johnson III, OMB's deputy director for management, \n     argued recently that the administration is interested in \n     allowing contracting on work that is ``really, really \n     commercial,'' such as food service, check processing, and \n     other similar functions, the thousands of Park Service \n     positions the administration has defined as commercial \n     include archaeologists, biologists, museum curators, masons, \n     and other workers who serve park visitors, educate school \n     groups, and protect the parks for future generations.\n       A few points to consider: The Park Service is spending \n     millions of dollars to fund, competitive sourcing efforts \n     without authorization from the appropriations committee, and \n     at the expense of the enormous pressing fiscal needs of the \n     parks; No study has been undertaken about the extensive \n     outsourcing that has already occurred in the National Park \n     Service, to determine the cumulative impact of the \n     administration's proposals. Privatization could adversely \n     impact the diversity of the Park Service as well as the \n     quality of local jobs available in many areas; Protection of \n     our national parks is a way of life for the National Park \n     Service, not just a job. The esprit-de-corps of the Park \n     Service is something businesses try to emulate, not something \n     that should be easily discarded or put at risk; The Reid \n     amendment does not prevent the Department of the Interior \n     from contracting out services or existing outsourcing \n     studies. Interior agencies retain the ability to hire \n     contractors to supplement the existing federal employee \n     workforce.\n       A vote for the Reid amendment is a vote to protect our \n     national parks, and we will consider using this significant \n     vote in our biennial ``Friend of the National Parks'' \n     scorecard for the 108th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n The Wilderness Society--Support the Reid Amendment To Protect Jobs in \n                       the National Park Service\n\n       Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) has filed an amendment to the \n     FY04 Interior Appropriations bill that provides protection \n     for National Park Service employees' jobs. The language in \n     the Park Service section of the bill reads . . .\n       ``None of the funds in this act can be used to initiate any \n     new competitive sourcing studies.''\n       This is the exact language that the House Subcommittee on \n     Interior Appropriations added as a bipartisan provision \n     earlier this summer. The provision protects the National Park \n     Service (NPS) from losing some of its most skilled employees. \n     The Office of Management and Budget has imposed an onerous \n     quota on all agencies to review for privatization 15% of \n     their ``commercial'' activities by the end of this year. This \n     assault on dedicated park employees applies regardless of its \n     impact on the agency.\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\n       The Park Service has the potential to lose irreplaceable \n     institutional knowledge of dedicated park scientists, \n     archeologists, architects, curators, engineers, fire \n     fighters, and laborers . . . jobs considered to be \n     ``commercial'' in nature.\n       The Reid amendment limits the use of funds for competitive \n     sourcing studies to those already initiated in fiscal years \n     2002 and 2003. At this point the Park Service has already \n     expended $2 to $3 million on privatization studies at the \n     expense of funding daily operations within the parks!\n       An internal memo penned by NPS Director Mainella as \n     reported in an April 19 Los Angeles Times article says this \n     policy could reduce visitor services and cause unexpected \n     layoffs, as well as undermine the agency's efforts to create \n     a more ethnically diverse work force.\n       For further information contact: Sue Gunn, Director, \n     National Park Program, (202) 429-2676.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                National Trust for\n\n\n                                        Historic Preservation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, the Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: Congress chartered the National Trust \n     for Historic Preservation more than 50 years ago to protect \n     America's irreplaceable historic and cultural treasures \n     including those that are part of the country's great \n     inventory of federal lands. As a private nonprofit \n     organization with more than a quarter million members, the \n     National Trust is the leader of a vigorous preservation \n     movement that is having the best of our past for the future. \n     Because of our concern for the welfare of the nation's \n     historic and cultural resources, we urge you to support \n     Senator Reid's amendment to the Interior appropriations bill \n     that would place a temporary hold on the large-scale \n     privatization effort already underway at the Department of \n     Interior and related agencies--especially within the National \n     Park Service and the Forest Service. This privatization \n     effort would outsource many of the professional and expert \n     responsibilities now performed by federal employees.\n       The National Trust supports a similar bipartisan provision \n     that is now part of the House version of the bill. It would \n     withhold FY'04 funds from the rampant privatization program \n     so that Congress can make a comprehensive assessment of \n     outsourcing's effects on the important work performed by \n     scientists, archeologists, architects, curators, engineers, \n     fire fighters, and laborers. Before advancing headlong into \n     this initiative, Congress would have an ``in-depth report'' \n     on the results of pending privatization efforts including \n     information related to ``specific schedules, plans, and cost \n     estimates for implementing [the privatization initiative].'' \n     The Department's FY'02 and FY'03 privatization work in \n     progress would be unaffected by the provision.\n       The Interior Department and related agencies have been \n     under intense pressure to privatize key programs because of \n     an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) government-wide \n     quota that requires all agencies to review 15 percent of \n     their ``commercial'' activities for privatization by the \n     close of this fiscal year. OMB is applying this quota \n     regardless of the effect on the government's responsibility \n     to all Americans who depend on efficient and reliable \n     service. Last year Congress was so concerned about OMB \n     proceeding too hastily that it included a reporting \n     requirement in the FY'03 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. So far, \n     however, OMB has not provided any research or analysis to \n     justify the quota as it quickly progresses on outsourcing \n     positions and imposes sanctions on agencies that fail to \n     fulfill the quota. Those penalties are severe, ranging from \n     arbitrary reductions in staff to punitive budget cuts.\n       The National Trust, like many Republican and Democratic \n     lawmakers on Capitol Hill, is concerned by the scale, lack of \n     methodology, and expense associated with this initiative, \n     which comes at a time when federal budgets are declining and \n     resources are thin. Congress and the public need more time to \n     assess the process adequately, and fully understand the costs \n     and implications of the decisions being made before \n     outsourcing diverts governmental staff from high-priority \n     assignments, consumes funding that is directed towards \n     mission-essential requirements, and undermines efforts to \n     ensure that the federal workforce reflects the American \n     people in its diversity.\n       Services provided by the federal government should always \n     include a mix of public and private sector resources where \n     appropriate. Contractors can play a valuable role in an \n     agency's mission to service the American public. OMB's \n     privatization quota, however, is forcing the Interior \n     Department and other agencies to privatize services without \n     heed to the full effects on safeguarding the nation's \n     historic and cultural treasures. The National Trust asks you \n     to support Senator Reid's amendment to the Interior \n     appropriations bill and take a more measured approach to \n     outsourcing those federal responsibilities best performed by \n     governmental staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Richard Moe.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                            American Federation of\n\n\n                                Government Employees, AFL-CIO,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American federation of \n     Government Employees, which represents more than 600,000 \n     federal employees who serve the American people across the \n     nation and around the world, I urge you to supoprt the Reid \n     Amendment to the Interior Appropriations Bill that would \n     temporarily suspend new privatization studies in the \n     Department of Interior and related agencies. These \n     privatization studies have been ordered by the Office of \n     Management and Budget (OMB), regardless of need or impact on \n     those agencies' services, in order to fulfill a wholly \n     political privatization quota.\n       The Reid Amendment is identical to language that was \n     earlier included in the House Interior Appropriations Bill by \n     Chairman Charles Taylor (R-NC). The Taylor provision was \n     inspired by the diversion of staff and resources to conduct \n     costly privatization reviews instead of fulfilling agencies' \n     missions, even if that meant not eliminating longstanding \n     maintenance backlogs in the National Park Service or \n     protecting Forest Service lands from the scourge of fire.\n       We appreciate the leadership of Senate Interior \n     Appropriations Committee Chairman Conrad Burns (R-Mt) in \n     defunding all new and ongoing privatization studies in the \n     Forest Service without Congressional approval. However, the \n     same problems caused by OMB's wholesale privatization effort \n     in the Forest Service are adversely affecting all agencies \n     funded under the Interior Appropriations Bill. Moreover, the \n     Reid Amendment strikes a fair balance in that it allows \n     ongoing privatization reviews to continue but suspends new \n     ones until the Congress has a better understanding of OMB's \n     extremely controversial wholesale privatization initiative.\n       That the recently revised OMB Circular A-76, which governs \n     the rules for privatization, has been tilted dangerously in \n     favor of contractors, is no longer subject to dispute. In \n     fact, the House of Representatives, in bipartisan fashion, \n     recently passed an amendment to the Transportation and \n     Treasury Appropriations Bill that would completely defund the \n     new A-76 and force OMB to craft a more fair and balanced \n     process, one that exalts the interests of taxpayers and every \n     American who depends on the federal government for important \n     services, not contractors.\n       Among the many flaws, the new privatization process denies \n     federal employees opportunities to submit their best bids in \n     most competitions, fails to require contractors to at least \n     promise appreciable savings before taking work from federal \n     employees, and doesn't ensure that a subjective and \n     unprecedented privatization process is first tested and \n     evaluated in the limited context of information technology \n     before it is used across-the-board on all services, as was \n     required by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John \n     Warner in this year's defense authorization bill, instead of \n     using it across-the-board on all services, as would be \n     allowed by the new A-76.\n       Despite OMB's professed determination to ensure \n     competition, the new circular requires federal employees to \n     be subject to public-private competitions to perform new \n     work, to be recompeted in the event of failure to perform, \n     and be automatically recompeted every five years except in \n     isolated circumstances. In those same circumstances, no such \n     competition or recompetition requirements apply to \n     contractors. And although OMB is determined to review for \n     outsourcing at least 416,000 federal employee jobs, no \n     contractor jobs are scheduled to be reviewed for insourcing.\n       At the same time, the new circular appears to give the \n     interests of taxpayers short shrift. The rewritten A-76 makes \n     no changes of any significance with respect to the \n     administration of contracts. Moreover, despite the imposition \n     of the privatization quota, OMB provides already overwhelmed \n     agencies with no new resources to conduct fair competitions \n     and satisfactorily administer resulting contracts. In \n     addition, the new A-76 does little to encourage the use of \n     alternatives to A-76 that can generate superior savings--but \n     without the significant costs and wrenching controversies \n     associated with privatization reviews. And despite the \n     documented disproportionately adverse impact on women and \n     minorities who are part of the civil service, a particular \n     problem in the National Parks Service, according to the \n     Director, the new circular does nothing to ensure that the \n     OMB privatizaiton initiative does not force federal agencies \n     to turn the clock back on diversity and inclusiveness in the \n     civil service.\n       Finally, we note that the new A-76 does not discourage \n     contracting out from being undertaken in order to undercut \n     the pay and benefits of those who work for the federal \n     government. The Senate recently passed, without opposition, \n     an amendment to the defense appropriations bill that would \n     exclude health care costs from the cost comparison process if \n     a contractor provides inferior health care benefits. The new \n     A-76 fails to take that approach.\n       Again, AFGE, standing proudly with many different \n     environmental groups, urges Senators to support the Reid \n     Amendment to the Interior Appropriations Bill and prevent \n     privatization from polluting the agencies that the American \n     people have entrusted to safeguard our nation's most valuable \n     natural treasurers. Please contact John Threlkeld in AFGE's \n     Legislative Department at (202) 639-6413 if you have any \n     questions about our position on this important matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Beth Moten,\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\n       Director, Legislation & Political Action Department.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Washington leaves \nthe floor, I would like to say it was only recently that I had the \nopportunity to see some of the natural beauty of the State of \nWashington. I, of course, had been to Seattle a number of times--the \nairport, went into town, and left. But I had the opportunity, within \nthe past couple of months, to see various parts of Washington.\n  I will never forget the drive from Pasco, WA, to Seattle over the \ngreat Cascades. Those mountains and trees, the forests are so much \ndifferent than the forests of Nevada. We are very proud of the great \ntreasures we have around Lake Tahoe and other forests we have in \nNevada. But the Cascades are in a different class, with totally \ndifferent kinds of trees, different forests.\n  That is what the Forest Service is all about, having these people, \nwho sign on to the Forest Service for life, to be the guardians and \nprotectors of these great national treasures such as those around Lake \nTahoe and those beautiful Cascades that I drove through.\n  To think we are considering putting these great national treasures \nout for profit rather than posterity frightens me. I appreciate very \nmuch the Senator from Washington standing up for the great Cascades. I \nam sure there are other beautiful parks in the State of Washington that \nyou have described here that are as beautiful as I can imagine. But I \nwant the Senator from Washington to know--and everyone within the sound \nof my voice--I was so impressed driving through those Cascades.\n  I repeat, I hope--and I know there is going to be efforts made to \nsecond degree this amendment because the majority is afraid of an up-\nor-down vote because we will win an up-or-down vote because people of \nboth parties do not want to put these national treasures up for bid. \nWhat they are going to do is offer some kind of an amendment saying: \nWell, we have studied them. Let's get a report. And we will go ahead \nand continue doing the studies around Lake Mead, around the areas the \nSenator from Washington pointed out.\n  The reason this is such a calculated effort to hurt our parks is that \nthey are taking money, as I outlined earlier, that has been set aside \nby congressional votes to take away the asbestos we have in some of our \npark facilities, to do work on sewers, and a lot of other things. They \nare taking money from that and studying whether it is a good idea to \nprivatize. That is wrong. If they were going to do it the right way, \nthey would come before Congress and say: We want to study what is going \non in our national parks. Appropriate money for us.\n  They are doing indirectly what they know they can't do directly.\n  I hope everyone understands that this second-degree amendment, which \nwill be offered shortly, is only an effort to help those who want to \ndefeat this amendment to, in effect, get well by saying: Well, we voted \nfor a study and the President has to report on these studies.\n  I want everyone to know a vote for this second-degree amendment--it \nmay be a side-by-side amendment--is a vote to allow the outsourcing, \nthe privatizing of the workforce of our national parks.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I heard the Senator from Nevada \ncorrectly, am I to understand there is going to be a second-degree \namendment to his amendment that I just spoke about that will \nessentially allow the outsourcing to continue while we move forward in \nthe appropriations process this year? If that is the case, I ask the \nSenator from Nevada, if you are a park employee in one of our beautiful \nparks--and you referenced the Cascades; we have Olympia National Park, \nMt. Rainier. I invite all of our colleagues to come and see--if you \nwere an employee and you knew Congress was going to continue to move \nforward with this proposal or some type of variation, would you not be \nworried that you would not continue to do the same good job that our \nemployees do right now because really your future is up in the air and \nyou would be looking for something else?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respond to my friend from Washington that \nthis second-degree amendment, which I haven't seen but I have been told \nwhat is in it, would basically allow the outsourcing studies to go on. \nAnd they have no money to do that so they are robbing other programs to \ndo it. So the answer to the Senator's question is, yes, they would \ncontinue doing the outsourcing studies, as they call them, in an effort \nto privatize the workforce in the national parks.\n  There is a handout that has been distributed. When you can't defeat a \nmeasure on its face, what you resort to is name-calling. Here is what \nthey have written:\n\n       Now is not the time to promote inefficiency. The Reid \n     amendment would support the Federal employees union agenda to \n     grow the size of the Federal workforce and avoid competition \n     of any kind.\n\n  That is so mean spirited and so wrong. When you can't defeat an issue \non its face, what you do is resort to name-calling. What they have done \nhere is say, this is all a big ploy of the unions. I offered into the \nRecord earlier today groups that support this amendment that is \nsponsored by the Senator from Washington and the Senator from \nNevada. There wasn't a single union I put forward as favoring this. I \nam sure they do, but I haven't talked to them. But we have resorted to \nname-calling, saying this is bad because the unions like it. I am sure \nthe unions do like it if, in fact, there are unions there. I don't \nreally know. But this has nothing to do with unions.\n\n  It has everything to do with protecting a dedicated workforce and to \nnot put these employees out to minimum wage. That is in effect what it \nis. I know what we will do as we do in all of these privatizing \nmethods: We will come in with a low-ball figure. We can do it so much \ncheaper. And then as soon as the contract is entered, it balloons. I \ngave an example this morning. One of the parks was picking up garbage. \nIt cost $150,000. They put it out for private bid. And now within 3 \nyears time it is a half a million dollars for the same work Government \nemployees were doing.\n  I appreciate very much the support of my friend from Washington. \nAgain, I recognize her ability to support working men and women and not \ncorporate America. I do know the Senator from Washington has done a \ngreat job of protecting the corporations in her State. But here is an \nissue that deals directly with working men and women. And, of course, \nthe Senator from Washington has sided with the working men and women of \nour country.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1754 To Amendment No. 1731\n\n     (Purpose: To substitute a requirement for an annual report on \n  competitive sourcing activities on lists required under the Federal \n  Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 that are performed for the \n       Department of the Interior by Federal Government sources)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment 1731. I have an amendment to send to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 1731 is now pending.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich], for himself and Mr. \n     Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered 1754 to amendment No. \n     1731:\n\n       Strike lines 3 through 6, and insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. Not later than December 31 of each year, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the competitive sourcing activities on the list required \n     under the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-270; 31 U.S.C. 501 note) that were performed \n     for the Department of the Interior during the previous fiscal \n     year by Federal Government sources. The report shall \n     include--\n       (1) the total number of competitions completed;\n       (2) the total number of competitions announced, together \n     with a list of the activities covered by such competitions;\n       (3) the total number of full-time equivalent Federal \n     employees studied --under completed competitions;\n       (4) the total number of full-time equivalent Federal \n     employees being --studied under competitions announced, but \n     not completed;\n       (5) the incremental cost directly attributable to \n     conducting the competitions identified under paragraphs (1) \n     and (2), including\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\n     costs attributable to paying outside consultants and \n     contractors;\n       (6) an estimate of the total anticipated savings, or a \n     quantifiable --description of improvements in service or \n     performance, derived from completed competitions;\n       (7) actual savings, or a quantifiable description of \n     improvements in --service or performance, derived from the \n     implementation of competitions completed after May 29, 2003;\n       (8) the total projected number of full time equivalent \n     Federal employees covered by competitions scheduled to be \n     announced in the fiscal year covered by the next report \n     required under this section; and\n       (9) a general description of how the competitive sourcing \n     decisionmaking processes of the Department of the Interior \n     are aligned with the strategic workforce plan of that \n     department.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to offer a second-degree \namendment to the Reid amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. \nBefore I speak to the specifics of the underlying Reid amendment, I \nwill first describe my examination of the administration's competitive \nsourcing initiative which I have spent a great deal of time on.\n  Competitive sourcing is one of the five management initiatives \nincluded in the President's management agenda. As I said, I paid close \nattention to this initiative because it is closely related to the \nFederal Government's strategic human capital management. It is fair to \nsay I have spent more time on this issue than anyone in the Senate \nduring the last 5 years.\n  It is important to note that competitive sourcing is not \nprivatization, nor is it outsourcing. It is public-private competition, \na methodical process for evaluating the most efficient and cost-\neffective manner of providing a service that is commercial in nature \nand not inherently governmental.\n  I would like to make clear to my colleagues that the total Government \nworkforce is about 1.609 million. And inherently governmental is about \n751,000; commercial, about 858,000; and of the 858,000 that are \ncommercial, only about 416,000 are available for competition. That is \n26 percent of the Federal workforce. The Department of Interior \npositions being evaluated, which we are talking about today, under U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, clerical support and appraisers; National \nPark Service, maintenance of vehicle, lawn, bathroom, and air \nconditioner, archeological support; Bureau of Reclamation, Job Corps \nCenters; Bureau of Land Management, maintenance of lawn, vehicle, \nbathroom, and air conditioner, geographic information services, and \nphotography.\n\n  These are positions that are being evaluated. It doesn't necessarily \nmean they are going to be put out for competitive outsourcing. Contrary \nto what has been said on the floor of the Senate, I want to quote from \nthe Government Executive, which talks about:\n\n       April 25, 2003.\n       Feds Win Job Competition at Park Service Agriculture \n     Department.\n       Federal employees have won several small public-private job \n     competitions in land management agencies, including a \n     competition at the National Park Service Office that had run \n     into opposition on Capitol Hill.\n       A team of 45 archaeologists at the Southeastern \n     Archeological Center in Tallahassee, Florida, defeated \n     private contractors earlier this month, according to Park \n     Service officials. The in-house team re-organized itself into \n     the ``most efficient organization,'' eliminating 17 seasonal \n     jobs and trimming $850,000 in annual personnel costs, \n     according to Donna Calvels, coordinator of the Park Service's \n     competitive sourcing program.\n       ``Not one permanent employee lost their job.''\n\n  Hear me?\n\n       ``Not one permanent employee lost their job, and the \n     competition will save $4.2 million over the next five \n     years,'' Calvels said Thursday.\n       Federal workers have prevailed in other small competitions \n     decided recently. In the Forest Service, civil servants won \n     competitions at six Job Corps centers across the country, \n     according to Thomas Mills, the agency's deputy director for \n     business operations. The Forest Service operates 18 Job Corps \n     centers as part of a job training program for young adults, \n     which dates back to the New Deal programs of the 1930s. \n     Employees at every center--940 workers in all--are now \n     competing for their jobs.\n       So far, roughly 300 civil servants at Job Corps centers in \n     Anaconda and Darby, Montana; Franklin, North Carolina; \n     Estacada, Oregon, and Pine Knot and Mariba, Kentucky, have \n     won their competitions. At each center, the Forest Service is \n     using the ``streamlined'' competition method, which compares \n     the cost of the in-house team with the going rate in the \n     private sector. The agency received a waiver from the Office \n     of Management and Budget that allows it to give incumbent \n     workers a 10 percent cost advantage in the competitions, \n     according to Mills. The cost advantage is prohibited under \n     the revised OMB Circular A-76, issued in late May.\n       Federal workers have also fared well in several streamlined \n     competitions held by the Agriculture Department's Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service.\n\n  So the point is what we are talking about here is evaluating \npositions in various Federal agencies to determine whether those \npositions can be competitively bid and, in most of the cases, the in-\nhouse people win those competitions. In most cases, it is found after \nit is done that those people have been given an opportunity to get \ntogether and figure out how they can do a better job in order to save \ntheir job and compete with the private sector. That is what this is \nabout. This is not like, well, if we don't pass this amendment, \neverything is going to be farmed out in the Interior Department.\n\n  Historically, Government employees at the Department of Defense, the \nagency with by far the most experience in conducting competitions, have \nwon more than two-thirds of public-private competitions since 1997 and \nin the process have saved taxpayers billions of dollars. Furthermore, \nfrom 1997 to 2001, Federal employees won 98 percent of the streamlined \ncompetitions conducted at the Defense Department.\n  This demonstrates that Federal employees can compete and win. During \nthe competition process, Federal employees form a most efficient \norganization--an MEO--to develop the most competitive bid possible. \nThrough this process, employees make substantive changes to their \norganization in a collaborative process involving both managers and \nline employees.\n  What I like is that is quality management--going to the employees and \nasking them how they can do their job better than they are now doing \nit. The result is, regardless of who wins the competition, performance \nis improved and savings are realized. Isn't that what we want, better \nperformance and savings? Ultimately, MEOs allow agencies to work harder \nand smarter and do more with less. The teamwork and collaboration that \ncharacterize most efficient organizations should be present at all \nFederal agencies, not just those that are undergoing competition.\n  The original goal of competitive sourcing was to compete a percentage \nof the Federal commercial functions with the private sector to cut \ncosts and improve performance. This policy has merit. As a former mayor \nand Governor, I know from experience there are times when it is \nappropriate to compete government functions to obtain the best value \nfor the taxpayers. At the same time, I know what motivated and well-\ntrained public employees can accomplish.\n  The original sourcing goals of this administration--and I had real \nproblems with it--were to compete 5 percent of commercial functions in \nthe first year, an additional 10 percent in the second year, and \neventually 50 percent of eligible commercial activities. I have been \nvery concerned with these goals since they were announced. My chief \nconcern was that the governmentwide goals for competitive sourcing had \nnot been based on comprehensive analysis of the Federal workforce on an \nagency-by-agency basis. The amendment I offer today requires that be \ndone and reported on.\n  In that regard, these goals reminded me of the workforce downsizing \nof the Clinton administration. The U.S. General Accounting Office has \ndocumented that little or no strategic workforce planning was conducted \nin Federal agencies before downsizing took place. It was a mindless \ndownsizing, without looking at the jobs agencies had to perform. What \nthis administration is trying to do right now is reshape their \nworkforce to be able to do the job they have been asked to do.\n  Therefore, I have endeavored to learn more about the initiative. I \nattended a Governmental Affairs Committee oversight hearing on sourcing \nin March 2002 and criticized--that was Chairman Durbin--the manner in \nwhich the administration was pursuing this program. Over the last 2 \nyears, I have pressed this point in meetings with various officials \nfrom the OMB and the White House, urging them to modify the goals of \nthe program. To its credit, the Bush administration has agreed. Clay \nJohnson was in my office last week. He gets it.\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\n  At a Governmental Affairs subcommittee hearing I held on July 24, \n2003, Angela Styles, who was, until recently, the administrator of \nFederal procurement policy, announced the administration would drop its \ngovernmentwide goals for competitive sourcing.\n  I was pleased to learn that each Federal agency will decide the way \nin which competitive sourcing will proceed. Furthermore, the \nadministration will release a report later this month that will outline \nthe manner in which they have conducted this initiative over the last 3 \nyears.\n  The administration has demonstrated flexibility and a willingness to \nmake significant modifications to this program. This is a significant \nstep in the right direction and demonstrates that congressional \noversight can yield positive results.\n  However, Congress is considering several amendments that undermine \nthe administration's progress on competitive sourcing. The amendment \noffered by Senator Reid would prohibit competitive sourcing studies and \nactivities at the Department of the Interior. This is, in my opinion, \nmisguided, for several reasons.\n  First and foremost, since the Eisenhower administration decreed that \nthe public sector should not compete with the private sector, the \ndecision of whether or not to initiate competitions and the rules \ngoverning these competitions has been the purview of the executive \nbranch of Government. We are stepping on the prerogatives of the \nexecutive branch of Government. There is another way we can do that, \nand that is what our amendment does--in a way that I think is \nappropriate. This authority has been exercised in the past by both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations.\n  Legislatively exempting the Department of the Interior from \ncompetitive sourcing circumvents longstanding executive branch \nprerogative. It is not surprising the administration would strenuously \nresist efforts to diminish this authority, which is why OMB has said it \nwill recommend a veto of any bill that abolishes or weakens existing \nmanagement prerogatives.\n  Second, this amendment is one of a variety of different restrictions \non competitive sourcing that have been placed on 5 appropriations bills \nthat, if enacted, would constitute an incoherent set of restrictions. I \nagree Congress needs additional information on the implementation of \nthis initiative. However, any reporting requirements, which I support \nand will discuss in the context of my second-degree amendment with \nSenator Thomas, should be uniform across the executive branch, not \nwilly-nilly from one department to another department.\n  Third, I consider this issue the jurisdiction of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. That committee has held hearings on this initiative \nunder both Republican and Democratic leadership.\n  Any Senator seeking to make changes to this initiative should \nintroduce a bill, have it referred to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and advance it through the normal committee process. It \nshould not be addressed through a series of disjointed amendments to \nappropriations bills.\n  Fourth, as I noted a moment ago, the administration announced a major \nchange to its sourcing initiative at my subcommittee July 24 hearing. \nIt dropped its governmentwide goals and plans and will now do this on \nan agency-by-agency basis. It is reasonable for us to monitor how this \nchange is implemented. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment being offered by Senator Thomas and me.\n  Our amendment would require the Interior Department to provide \nCongress with detailed information on how it is implementing public-\nprivate competitions. This includes a description of how the \nDepartment's competitive sourcing decisionmaking process is aligned \nwith the Department's strategic workforce plan. It also requires the \nDepartment to report the projected number of full-time equivalent \nemployees covered by competitions scheduled to be announced in the next \nfiscal year.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it will not affect the Interior \nDepartment's consideration this year, but if they want to do them next \nyear, in this report they are going to be required to say which ones \nnext year they are going to be putting out for competition and why they \nare putting them out for competition. This is not some arbitrary type \nof activity as some people would like to characterize it.\n  Imposing rigorous reporting requirements is the right approach. It \nhas been the prerogative of every administration since the 1950s to \ndecide when to conduct public-private competitions and the manner in \nwhich these competitions would be conducted. Congress, in its oversight \nrole, has a right and responsibility to know what the executive branch \nis doing. The amendment would require the Bush administration to \nprovide exactly that information.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this report from \nGovernment Executive magazine be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Government Executive Magazine, Aug. 25, 2003]\n\n   Feds Win Job Competitions at Park Service, Agriculture Department\n\n                         (By Jason Peckenpaugh)\n\n       Federal employees have won several small public-private job \n     competitions in land management agencies, including a \n     competition at a National Park Service office that had run \n     into opposition on Capitol Hill.\n       A team of 45 archaeologists at the Southeastern \n     Archaeological Center in Tallahassee, Fla., defeated private \n     contractors earlier this month, according to Park Service \n     officials. The in-house team reorganized itself into a ``most \n     efficient organization,'' eliminating 17 seasonal jobs and \n     trimming $850,000 in annual personnel costs, according to \n     Donna Kalvels, coordinator of the Park Service's competitive \n     sourcing program.\n       ``Not one permanent employee lost their job, and the \n     competition will save $4.2 million over the next five \n     years,'' Kalvels said Thursday.\n       Last month, the House voted overwhelmingly to cut off funds \n     for job competitions at the Southeastern Center and at the \n     Midwest Archaeological Center in Lincoln, Neb., where the \n     competition still is ongoing. The funding freeze would not \n     take effect until fiscal 2004, meaning it would not apply to \n     competitions finished during this fiscal year.\n       But John Ehrenhard, director of the Southeastern Center, \n     said the legislation is still needed to protect other Park \n     Service archaeologists from the Bush administration's \n     competitive sourcing push. ``Even though we won our \n     competition, I'd like to see some [legislation] saying that \n     no more money could be put toward . . . competitive \n     sourcing,'' he said. ``It's just another layer of \n     protection.''\n       Ehrenhard added that four employees left the center during \n     the competition because they didn't want to risk losing their \n     jobs. ``Most were in their late 20s and early 30s, and they \n     were looking forward to having a career in the National Park \n     Service, and they felt they were denied that,'' he said.\n       Federal workers have prevailed in other small competitions \n     decided recently. In the Forest Service, civil servants won \n     competitions at six job corps centers across the country, \n     according to Thomas Mills, the agency's deputy director for \n     business operations. The Forest Service operates 18 job corps \n     centers as part of a job-training program for young adults, \n     which dates back to the New Deal programs of the 1930s. \n     Employees at every center--940 workers in all--are now \n     competing for their jobs.\n       So far, roughly 300 civil servants at job corps centers in \n     Anaconda and Darby, Mont.; Franklin, N.C., Estacada, Ore.; \n     and Pine Knot and Mariba, Ky., have won their competitions. \n     At each center, the Forest Service is using the \n     ``streamlined'' competition method, which compares the cost \n     of the in-house team with the going rate in the private \n     sector. The agency received a waiver from the Office of \n     Management and Budget that allows it to give incumbent \n     workers a 10 percent cost advantage in the competitions, \n     according to Mills. The cost advantage is prohibited under \n     the revised OMB Circular A-76, issued in late May.\n       Federal workers have also fared well in several streamlined \n     competitions held by the Agriculture Department's Natural \n     Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). In Columbus, Ohio, NRCS \n     workers won three competitions involving mail, clerical and \n     soil-mapping work because procurement officials did not \n     receive valid private sector offers, according to Michelle \n     Lohstroh, state administrative officer with NRCS. Seven and \n     one-half full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) were involved \n     in these competitions.\n       In Annapolis, Md., four NRCS employees triumphed in a \n     competition, according to Debra Hepburn, a contracting \n     specialist with the agency. ``We have a pretty small office \n     out here in Annapolis,'' she said.\n       Competitions involving a single NRCS employee in Auburn, \n     Ala., and Lake City, Fla., respectively, also went to federal \n     employees. In Lake City, officials put a vacant position up \n     for competition, to minimize the possible impact on workers, \n     according to Lynn Merrill, an NRCS contract specialist.\n       Meanwhile, in Michigan, four soil-mapping specialists edged \n     out companies in a competition for their jobs, and in \n     Oklahoma, 17\n\n[[Page S11794]]\n\n     soil conservation technicians successfully defended their \n     jobs, according to Luann Lillie, an NRCS contracting officer \n     in Stillwater, Okla. And in California, in-house workers \n     triumphed in competitions involving 12 and one-half FTEs, \n     according to Ray Miller, a contract specialist in Davis, \n     Calif.\n       The NRCS is competing roughly 800 soil conservation \n     technician positions on a state-by-state basis, according to \n     Patty Brown, competitive sourcing coordinator with the \n     agency. These technicians help farmers and ranchers apply \n     conservation techniques to their land, she said in an \n     interview last month.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this report contradicts some of the \narguments that have been made for the Reid amendment this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request to \npropound. I ask unanimous consent that prior to a series of stacked \nvotes, which will begin at 4:45 p.m., there be 10 minutes of debate \nequally divided in relation to the Bingaman amendment No. 1740; \nfurther, that there be a total of 50 minutes equally divided in the \nusual form in relation to the Voinovich and Reid amendments on \ncompetitive sourcing.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 4:45 p.m., the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Bingaman amendment No. \n1740, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment No. \n1753, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Voinovich amendment \nwhich is to be modified to be a first-degree amendment, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Reid amendment No. 1731; provided, \nfurther, that no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendments \nprior to the vote, with 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time \nconsumed by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, will be \ncounted toward the 25 minutes; is that right?\n  Mr. BURNS. Is that agreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is related to \nthe next hour.\n  Mr. REID. The unanimous consent request has 50 minutes divided--\nactually 60 minutes. That time is equally divided. It is my \nunderstanding that the 50 minutes between Senator Voinovich and myself \nis to be equally divided. I simply ask that the time he already \nconsumed should be counted against the 25 minutes. That is my statement \nin the form of a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair does not interpret the unanimous \nconsent request that way. Would the Senator like to amend the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for that modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, we have some statements on \nour side we would like to give. That is why we wanted 25 minutes. If we \ntake Senator Voinovich's time out of it--I am not sure how long he \nspoke--it will not give time for Senator Thomas and me.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in my day-to-day life, I have worn many \nhats. In my life, I have been a small business owner, a mayor, a \nparent, and a consumer, just to name a few of the roles I have played \nover the years. I mention them because with each of them, whenever \nthere was a job that had to be done, I always knew the best way to \nensure I got the best deal on a project or product was to put it up for \nbid and place the job in competition. It is a simple philosophy, and it \njust makes sense to apply the same logic even to Government.\n  President Bush has said Government should be market based; we should \nnot be afraid of competition, innovation, and choice. Why is the \nadministration so enthusiastic about competitive sourcing? Because it \nsaves money while holding quality standards high. In other words, we \nget the same quality at less cost. Who wouldn't like a deal like that?\n  We do not need to look far to find the results of competitive \nsourcing. The Department of Defense, NASA, and the Coast Guard have a \nfair amount of experience in the field. In fact, the Department of \nDefense reports that it will have saved $6 billion from 2000 to 2003 \nthrough A-76 reviews.\n  Another telling example cited by this study was OMB's decision to \ntake a job usually given to the Government Printing Office and put it \nup for bid. The job was the printing of the 2004 Federal budget. When \nforced to compete, the Government Printing Office turned in a bid for \nthe project that was 24 percent lower than the previous year.\n  I do not think there can be any doubt that competitive sourcing saves \nmoney. But it does more than that by allowing Government to more \nactively engage in contracts with the private sector. Government can \nincrease its access to the skills, technologies, and innovations of the \nsmall business communities throughout the country.\n  This spring, I had an opportunity to visit the Mint in Philadelphia, \nand the employees there told me what a good job they were doing. I \nobserved them doing a good job. They let me know they were doing that \nso their jobs would not be outsourced. It was a good attitude. They \nwere doing quality work. They were improving. I saw an article in last \nweek's USA Today that talked about the improvement at the Mint since \nthe new director, a business person, was put in charge.\n  We have before us an amendment to slow the process and prohibit the \ncontinuation of funding for competitive sourcing in the Department of \nthe Interior. Adopting this amendment would turn back the clock and \nhead us in the wrong direction. At a time when budget deficits must be \ncontrolled, we should be taking full advantage of tried and true \nmethods to cut spending and control costs, not trying to remove the \noption.\n  One concern that has been raised about competitive sourcing is that \nit might have a seriously negative impact on the Federal workforce. \nThis is not true. Competitive sourcing is about increasing efficiency, \nnot eliminating workers.\n  As Senator Voinovich said, it is about asking the employees how it \ncan be done best. The person actually doing the job usually knows how \nand best. As a case in point, the Department of the Interior has \nreported that of more than 2,500 full-time employees whose jobs have \nbeen analyzed under A-76, none have been involuntarily dismissed from \ntheir jobs. Those who claim we are out to toss out the Federal \nworkforce are missing the point about this program.\n  Simply stated, competitive sourcing is better for taxpayers and the \nFederal Government. It makes Federal dollars go further, and it forces \nFederal agencies to perform more like businesses where the highest \nlevel of efficiency is the only acceptable level, and it is working.\n  If we allow passage of the Reid amendment, we are in fact taking away \nthe one tool a Federal agency has to ensure it is getting maximum \nefficiency and quality. As a member of the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, I have a responsibility to oppose \nlegislation that may harm our small business community. I cannot \nsupport the Reid amendment because it would have a negative impact on \nthe small businesses of our Nation by refusing to allow them to \ncompete. I have been holding some procurement conferences in Wyoming \nfor small business so they could learn how to compete, how to combine \nif the job is too big for one small business. It has been working. It \nhasn't kicked Federal employees out of their jobs, but it has produced \nsome lower prices and some employment for small businesspeople.\n\n  Studies have shown that when the private sector does win public/\nprivate competitions through Circular A-76, a small business, a woman-\nowned business, or a minority-owned business wins that competition 60 \npercent of the time. By cutting funding for competitive sourcing in the \nDepartment of the Interior, we would be blocking off one of the few \nentryways that small businesses have available to gain access to jobs \nin the Federal Government.\n  With more than 50 percent of the Federal workforce eligible for \nretirement within the next 5 years--let me repeat that--with more than \n50 percent of the Federal workforce eligible for retirement within the \nnext 5 years, it is essential to ensure we have the right people in the \nright positions.\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\n  Competitive sourcing creates an atmosphere in which the Government is \nnot forced to deflect its valuable Federal employees to tasks that are \nnot inherently governmental. It allows Federal agencies to more \neffectively manage their personnel.\n  That kind of management was clearly in evidence when a number of \nnational parks on the eastern seaboard used temporary employees during \nthe summer as lifeguards. Through competitive sourcing, the National \nPark Service contracted this work to private lifeguard companies. These \ncompanies then hired the Park Service's temporary employees, giving \nthem full-time year-round jobs. The local communities benefited through \nthe enhanced opportunities for local businesses and the former Park \nService employees benefited by getting better pay and more work.\n  Circular A-76 is important because it represents a win-win situation \nfor small businesses; also for the Government; also for the taxpayer; \nand for all those who need and perform the work.\n  We are all familiar with the old adage, if it isn't broke, don't fix \nit. Circular A-76 is working well and will only get better as we fine-\ntune the process. It is a process that isn't broke and it deserves to \nkeep doing what it does best, saving the Government money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will wait for the floor manager here.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, thanking my good friend from Wyoming for \nallowing me to interrupt here, I renew the unanimous consent request \nwith regard to the votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to a series of stacked votes, \nwhich will begin at 4:45, there will be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in relation to the Bingaman amendment No. 1740; further, that \nthere be a total of 50 minutes equally divided in the usual form in \nrelation to the Voinovich and Reid amendments on competitive sourcing.\n  I further ask that at the hour of 4:45, the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to the Bingaman amendment No. 1740, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to the Boxer amendment No. 1753, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to the Voinovich amendment, which is to be modified to \nbe a first-degree amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to \nthe Reid amendment No. 1731; provided further that no second-degree \namendments be in order to the amendments prior to the vote, with 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will try this again. Is the time for \nSenator Enzi going to be counted toward the 25 minutes that the \nmajority has?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would advise that that is acceptable, that the Enzi \nstatement would be part of that 25 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair inform me how long the Senator from Wyoming \nspoke?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Seven minutes.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am sorry, Mr. President, how much time is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1731\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much, I say to the Senator from Montana.\n  It is interesting to be talking about this issue. The fact is, I \nsuspect all of us are looking for the most efficient way to operate the \nGovernment. I guess that is what we spend a lot of time doing. We spend \na lot of time looking for ways to make it less costly to get the job \ndone. We spend a lot of time providing opportunities for small \nbusinesses. These are the very things that are involved here. Yet we \nseem to be trying to keep that from happening. It is a bit of a \nsurprise.\n  Competitive sourcing seeks to streamline Federal agencies. This has \nbeen going on, by the way, for a long time. In 1996 we passed the FAIR \nAct and began to do something with it. There were different kinds of \nreactions to it. There were some efforts made in the Clinton \nadministration that did not go very far to utilize this.\n  Then 2 years ago we started to revamp the thing a little bit and make \nit work. That is what this administration has done--to make the \nGovernment more accountable to the taxpayers, to reduce the \nGovernment's direct competition in the private sector. These are the \npurposes of this competitive sourcing.\n  The President's competitive sourcing initiative is designed to \nimprove performance and efficiency. That is really the bottom line. \nWhen the Government competes with the private sector, we erode the \nlocal tax base, we drive up prices, decrease performance of Federal \nagencies because there is no competition, and we know that is a key to \nour whole effort within the sector.\n\n  Regarding cost savings, both the General Accounting Office and the \nCenter for Naval Analysis, two independent groups, have found through \nextensive research that competitive sourcing reduces costs by 30 \npercent--regardless of who wins. Keep in mind, this is competitive \nsourcing. When this particular job or this particular task is set up \nfor competitive sourcing, the Federal employees have a chance to \ncompete for it as well as the outside. In most cases, over half the \ncases in the past, Federal employees have won.\n  Nevertheless, because of that, because of looking for ways to do it \nmore efficiently, there has been a 30-percent reduction in costs. So \nthe Government can save billions of dollars by allowing the private/\npublic competition to occur. Stopping this competition only wastes \ntaxpayer dollars, increases the inefficiency of a Government monopoly, \nand prevents us from improving upon services the taxpayers receive.\n  One of the troublesome things has been that the image of that kind of \naction has not often been clear. I have here an article by Fran \nMainella, who is the Director of the National Park Service.\n\n       Over the past several months, a number of media reports \n     have mischaracterized the scope, purpose and effects of the \n     National Park Service competitive sourcing efforts.\n\n  She goes on:\n\n       Our competitive sourcing initiative challenges us to put \n     our finger on our own pulse. It provides a framework by which \n     we examine whether we have the right skills, the right \n     techniques, organizational structures to provide Americans \n     the best possible service--service that is effective and \n     efficient.\n\n  So we have had a great deal of success in doing that. Actually, the \ncompetitive sourcing idea is not a new one. It has been talked about \nfor a good long time. In fact, I point out here--this is a statement \nmade in 1996 by the unions publicly supporting competition. It says:\n\n       Over the years, the OMB Circular A-76 competitive process \n     has benefited taxpayers with billions of dollars in savings. \n     I am proud of the fact that these competitions have shown \n     Federal workers to be just as competitive as their private-\n     sector counterparts in terms of their cost, efficiency and \n     overall quality of performance.\n       Mr. Chairman, you have often heard me say that Federal \n     employees are not afraid of competition. If we cannot provide \n     the services better, faster and cheaper than our private-\n     sector competition, then we do not deserve to perform the \n     work in the first place. We ask you and the members of this \n     committee not to deny us the opportunity and dignity of \n     competing.\n\n  This is the national president of the American Federation of \nGovernment Employees. This is, of course, some time back.\n  So what we are dealing with here, of course, is an amendment that \nprevents the improvement of the Department of the Interior's commercial \nactivity competitive sourcing. This is something we have dealt with for \na good amount of time.\n  We talked about the Printing Office and the money that has been saved \nthere. We talk a lot about parks. Of course, I come from a State with \nparks, such as the Grand Tetons.\n  There is an idea that we are going to replace the park rangers. That \nisn't true at all. This has nothing to do with park rangers and people \nwho have those kinds of professional jobs. We are talking about people \nwho do maintenance work and people who do other kinds of activities. \nThat is the case.\n  We agree parks are special. It is one of the things we hear about a \ngreat deal. We hear about it incorrectly from time to time. That, I \nguess, is what is happening here.\n  Secretary Norton noted that 2,500 positions have been reviewed under \ncompetitive sourcing since 2001. Not one full-time Federal employee has \nbeen involuntarily separated. These are things that change. We have a \ngreat deal of retirement coming up, and there will be some opportunity \nto do\n\n[[Page S11796]]\n\nsome things here that will give us a chance to make our Federal \nGovernment more effective and more efficient.\n  Over the past several years it has been our Government policy not to \ncompete with the private sector. However, the Federal Government \ncurrently has about 416,000 positions that are characterized as \ncommercial in nature. Seeing that Congress has done a poor job with \nsourcing policy, President Bush initiated competitive sourcing to \nimprove the way it functions. We are now in the process of seeing that \nimprovement take place.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are always concerned \nabout economic developments. They should support this opportunity to \nimprove competitive sourcing. Keep in mind that Government competition \nin the private sector erodes the local tax base and creates a \nGovernment monopoly.\n  Here we are. I think we have an opportunity to continue to strengthen \nthat. The amendment before us is certainly not one that helps that. It \nprecludes going forward with this very useful thing. The amendment we \nwill be voting on is a first second-degree amendment.\n  This reporting requirement addresses a number of the concerns many \nSenators had about competitive sourcing. This second-degree amendment \ndoes the following:\n  It requires the Secretary of the Interior to report annually on its \ncompetitive sourcing efforts, including listing the total number of \ncompetitions completed; list the total number of competitions \nannounced; the activity covering the total number of full-time \nequivalent Federal employees studied under the completed competitions; \ntotal number of full-time equivalent Federal employees being studied \nbut not completed; the incremental costs directly attributable to \nconducting the competition, including costs attributable to paying \noutside consultants; estimate of the total and completed savings; \ndescription of the improvements in services and performance derived \nfrom the competition actually reported; and total number of full-time \nequivalent employees covered by competition rescheduling for next \nfiscal year.\n  That is the kind of reporting we will have.\n  We have a number of letters. I ask unanimous consent to have them \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\nLegislative Alert--Support Competition Among the Federal Government and \n                           Private Businesses\n\n       The Senate will likely debate and vote on an amendment \n     offered by Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) to H.R. 2961, the \n     Department of the Interior (DoI) and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004, which is currently \n     being debated by the Senate. The amendment prohibits the \n     initiation or continuation of any competitive sourcing \n     studies until the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations have been given a detailed competitive \n     sourcing proposal and have approved in writing such proposal.\n       Because the amendment significantly limits the DoI's \n     management flexibility and prevents the agency's ability to \n     identify and access the best and most efficient sources for \n     the performance of its commercial activities, Americans for \n     Tax Reform (ATR) strongly opposes Senator Reid's amendment.\n       In his two years in office, President Bush has worked to \n     make government more efficient by streamlining federal \n     regulations and holding government bureaucracies accountable \n     to the American taxpayer who funds their departments. The \n     president constructed a strong Management Agenda, focusing on \n     public-private competition to create a performance-based \n     management initiative designed to improve performance and \n     efficiency.\n       Public-private competition, or competitive sourcing, is the \n     process for determining if the government's commercial jobs, \n     like computer services, food services, or maintenance, should \n     be performed by federal agencies or by private sector \n     companies. However, President Bush's plan to subject federal \n     workers to competition has come under constant attack from \n     labor unions and liberal lawmakers on Capital Hill.\n       While Senator Reid claims that the bill will eliminate \n     thousands of federal jobs, it is simply not true. For \n     example, of the 1,600 full-time employees the Department has \n     already analyzed for competitive sourcing, not one federal \n     employee has been involuntarily dismissed from his job. In \n     addition, DoI employees have won roughly 50% of the sourcing \n     competitions and not a single DoI employee has been \n     involuntarily separated as a result of competition.\n       Competition among public and private entities drives down \n     costs and ratchets up performance. According to the General \n     Accounting Office and the Center of the Naval Analysis, two \n     independent and objective groups that have conducted the most \n     thorough research on competitive sourcing, the cost of a \n     function goes down 30 percent regardless of whether the in-\n     house government employees or a private contractor win the \n     competition. These efficiencies translate into savings of \n     billions of dollars that can be used for much needed tax \n     relief for all Americans.\n       More competition leads to huge savings. Absent competition, \n     inefficient government monopolies will continue to waste tax \n     dollars while failing to provide even a reasonable level of \n     service. Therefore, the taxpayer is the ultimate loser when \n     competitive sourcing is stymied.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 28, 2003.\n\n  An Open Letter to Congress: Competitive Contracting Saves Taxpayers \n                                Dollars\n\n       Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned organizations \n     strongly support implementation of President Bush's \n     competitive contracting program and oppose Congressional \n     schemes to make implementation of this vital initiative more \n     difficult or impossible. According to official government \n     estimates, there are 850,000 jobs in the federal government \n     that qualify as ``commercial positions.'' These jobs include \n     everything from writing software to mowing lawns and are done \n     every day by private firms. President Bush's Management \n     Agenda set the goal of having half of the commercial \n     activities performed by federal agencies face competition \n     over the next four years.\n       The potential benefits of increased outsourcing are clear. \n     For example, in 2002, the Office of Management and Budget \n     decided to use competition in response to poor performance by \n     the Government Printing Office (GPO) and opened the job of \n     printing the fiscal 2004 federal budget to competitive \n     bidding. GPO turned in a bid that was almost 24 percent lower \n     than its price from the previous year in order to keep its \n     job. That was $100,000 a year that GPO could have saved \n     taxpayers any time it chose, but didn't until it faced \n     competition.\n       Contrary to popular belief, competitive bidding does not \n     achieve cost savings by simply reducing the ranks of federal \n     employees. Research by the General Accounting Office and \n     other agencies has shown that federal workers win competitive \n     sourcing bids against private firms about half the time, and \n     when they do lose, the majority go to work for the contractor \n     or shift to other jobs in the federal government. Typically, \n     less than 7 percent of them are laid off.\n       In spite of the obvious benefits of competition in other \n     areas of the economy, several efforts are underway in \n     Congress that would kill competition at the federal level. \n     Legislative proposals have been introduced to prohibit \n     competitive outsourcing in the Departments of Agriculture and \n     Interior, and attempts to prevent reform of air traffic \n     control are proliferating.\n       Competition and choice are important marketplace forces. \n     Harnessing them to provide commercial activities within the \n     federal government will save taxpayer money and allow federal \n     agencies to do their jobs more effectively and offer better \n     service. Congress should be embracing competitive contracting \n     rather than undermining it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Paul J. Gessing,\n         Director of Government Affairs, National Taxpayers Union.\n                                              Dr. Adrian T. Moore,\n                      Vice President, Research, Reason Foundation.\n                                               Randall W.

The amendment would block funding for \n     all future public-private competitions, thereby sacrificing \n     government efficiency, innovation and cost savings.\n       The competitive sourcing program is a centerpiece of the \n     President's Management Agenda. The Bush Administration's plan \n     to open non-inherently governmental functions to competition \n     from the private market will ensure that taxpayers receive \n     the best services for their tax dollars. If passed, the Reid \n     Amendment would prevent Interior from realizing cost savings \n     that result from public-private competitions. A report from \n     the General Accounting Office states that public-private \n     competitions typically result in savings of over 30%.\n       Private engineering companies provide a range of highly \n     technical services to the Federal government, including the \n     Forest Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Over the past \n     several years, our member firms have grown increasingly \n     frustrated over the practice of some Interior agencies that \n     actively market their services to state and local governments \n     in direct competition with the private sector. This practice \n     hits our smaller firms particularly hard. The Bush plan would \n     help to correct this problem and as such, any\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\n     attempt to derail this process is strongly opposed by the \n     engineering industry.\n       ACEC respectfully urges you to place the interests of the \n     taxpayers first, and support effectiveness and efficiency in \n     government. Again, we urge you to vote against the Reid \n     Amendment to the F.Y. 2004 Interior Appropriations bill as \n     well as any other amendment that may be attached during the \n     remainder of the 108th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Camille Fleenor,\n      Director, Federal Procurement Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Citizens Against Government Waste,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than one million \n     members and supporters of the Council of Citizens Against \n     Government Waste (CCAGW), we urge you to vote against an \n     amendment being offered by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to H.R. \n     2691, the Interior Appropriations Bill for FY 2004, which \n     would defund competitive sourcing studies provided for under \n     OMB Circular A-76.\n       OMB Circular A-76 is the federal process of obtaining \n     commercial services at the best price through open and fair \n     competition. This practice is also known as competitive \n     sourcing, and is the cornerstone of President Bush's \n     Management Agenda reforms. Competition between the private \n     sector and government employees performing commercial work \n     ensures accountability, efficiency, and budget savings.\n       An inventory of government services conducted during the \n     Clinton administration identified more than 850,000 of the \n     1.8 million jobs in the federal government as commercial in \n     nature. Opening up these services to competition promotes the \n     principles of government reform and service to the taxpayers. \n     Numerous studies demonstrate that public-private competition \n     improves service delivery and decreases costs to taxpayers by \n     anywhere from 10-40 percent on average.\n       Opponents of A-76 contend that staging job competitions is \n     cost prohibitive. This argument is a political smoke screen \n     meant to derail the administration's management reforms. The \n     President's commonsense proposals would follow private sector \n     management practices, such as linking budgets with \n     performance targets, improving general agency performance \n     through development and implementation of strategic plans, \n     and improving service while providing the best value to the \n     taxpayer.\n       We urge you to vote ``No'' on Sen. Reid's amendment to H.R. \n     2691 and allow the continuation of public-private \n     competition. CCAGW will consider rating this amendment, and \n     any votes related to competitive sourcing, in our annual 2003 \n     Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Congressional & Public Affairs,\n\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2003.\n       To Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation, representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations every size, sector and region, I urge you \n     to vote against an amendment offered by Senator Harry Reid \n     (D-NV) to the Fiscal Year 2004 Interior Appropriations bill. \n     This amendment would prohibit the Department of Interior \n     (DOI) from conducting competitive sourcing studies, thereby \n     sacrificing government efficiency, innovation and significant \n     cost savings.\n       Prohibiting competition within DOI strikes at the heart of \n     the President's Management Agenda, particularly the \n     Competitive Sourcing Initiative, which aims to increase \n     government efficiency, improve government performance and \n     save taxpayer dollars through competition. On average, a 30% \n     cost savings is realized when a competition between the \n     public and private sector is held on commercial government \n     functions, regardless of who wins. In this era of sharply \n     constrained resources it seems particularly irresponsible to \n     arbitrarily limit an agency's ability to identify and access \n     the best and most efficient sources for the performance of \n     its commercial activities. Senior Administration officials \n     have recommended that the President veto the FY04 Interior \n     Appropriations bill if such language is included.\n       Contrary to common rhetoric, competitive sourcing does not \n     achieve cost savings by simply reducing the ranks of federal \n     employees. In fact, of the 2,500 positions that have been \n     reviewed under competitive sourcing since 2001 in DOI, not \n     one full-time federal employee has been involuntarily \n     separated. Federal workers win competitive sourcing bids \n     against private firms over half the time, and when they do \n     lose, the majority go to work for the competitive or shift to \n     other jobs in the federal government.\n       We respectfully urge you to place the interests of the \n     taxpayers first, and support effectiveness and efficiency in \n     government by voting against any anti-outsourcing provisions \n     in the Fiscal Year 2004 Interior Appropriations bill. The \n     Chamber may consider votes on or in relation to this matter \n     in our annual ``How They Voted'' scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                               September 22, 2003.\n\n              Stand Up for Main Street and Small Business\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I urge \n     you to oppose the Reid competitive sourcing amendment to the \n     Fiscal Year 2004 Interior Appropriations Bill. The amendment \n     would prohibit the Department from conducting any competitive \n     sourcing studies and deny small businesses the opportunity to \n     compete for Interior's commercial activities.\n       Competitive sourcing is not only an opportunity for federal \n     agencies to improve the efficiency of their operations, but \n     it also saves taxpayer dollars. Independent studies by the \n     General Accounting Administration, among others, contend that \n     competition will save taxpayers an average of 30 percent. \n     Congress should not limit the management flexibility of the \n     Department to study ways to optimize their delivery of \n     services to the taxpayer. We believe, for example, that \n     allowing small businesses to bid on services they already \n     successfully provide in the commercial marketplace will lead \n     to improving government efficiency and decreasing costs.\n       We strongly urge a ``no'' vote on any amendment that would \n     prevent the Interior Department from moving forward on this \n     important initiative.\n       This vote will be recorded as a NFIB ``Key Vote'' for the \n     108th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n                                Sr. Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Here is one in behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nfavoring the competitive sourcing and opposing the amendment.\n  Here is the NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, \nwhich opposes the amendment.\n  Citizens Against Government Waste is also in support of this.\n  American Council of Engineering Companies, the National Taxpayers \nUnion, and Americans for Tax Reform--all of these are in strong support \nof continuing to give the private sector an opportunity in these areas.\n  I also finally would like to tell you there is a statement of \nadministration policy here in which the administration indicates they \nwill veto a bill that includes this kind of program. They say the \nadministration understands the amendment will be offered on the Senate \nfloor which would effectively shut down the administration's \ncompetitive sourcing initiative to fundamentally improve the \nperformance of government in many commercial activities. The \nadministration seeks to improve performance of Government services \nbased on the comprehensive principle of competition, a proven way of \nprotecting taxpayer dollars while providing better services and \nperformance. Now is the wrong time to short circuit the implementation \nof this principle, especially since numerous agencies are starting to \nmake real progress in providing public/private competition. If the \nfinal version of the bill contains such a provision, the President's \nsenior advisers would recommend he veto the bill.\n  I urge we get support for this amendment so we can continue the \ncompetitive notion.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone should understand a vote for the \nEnzi-Craig-Voinovich amendment is a vote to allow further outsourcing \nstudies to go on. That is wrong.\n  What is this amendment about? It is about the Park Service spending \nmillions of dollars in outsourcing studies which would siphon off funds \ncritical to the needs within the parks.\n  The amendment that has been offered by a significant number of \nSenators--and I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kerry and Senator \nClinton as cosponsors--allows current studies to move forward on the \nimplications to be evaluated. Current studies can go forward. A short \npause is not too much to ask, for the protection of our national \nheritage is at stake.\n  The House included the same reasonable language in its bill. \nAccording to the House report, the Appropriations Committee was \n``concerned about the massive scale of seemingly arbitrary targets and \nconsiderable costs of initiatives which are on such vast tracts that \nCongress and the public are neither able to participate nor understand \nthe costs and implications of the decisions being made.''\n  That is the end of the quote. That is from the Republican House of \nRepresentatives report language in their appropriations bill.\n  The administration's own Park Service director has indicated the \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\nplan will reduce services to the public, will negatively impact the \ndiversity of the Park Service, and will not save resources. That is \nfrom the administration's own Park Service director.\n  I would like to read from a letter sent to me by a Park Service \nemployee. Remember, this applies to more than just the Park Service. \nThe Forest Service, the BLM, and other Interior agencies are affected. \nThis man even signed his name, and, of course, it jeopardizes his job. \nBut he is a substantial man, I am sure. His name is Chuck Luttrell. It \nis a long letter. I will not read all of it.\n\n  Among other things, he said:\n\n       . . . will the public be tolerant of the selling of the \n     care and operation of our national treasures to a profit \n     corporation? Will our parks get the same care, will our \n     culture and natural heritage be safe in the hands of \n     companies that could turn out to be Enrons, Worldcoms?\n\n  He further states:\n\n       The United States of America owes and has pledged a \n     commitment to our military veterans. We have preferential \n     hiring regulations for veterans. A private contractor has no \n     such obligation. The Federal Government has the strongest \n     commitment to diversity and equality there is.\n\n  He says if it is put out to the private sector, veterans will have no \nfurther preference, and diversity will go out the window.\n\n       In recent years the Congress wrestled with the issues of \n     health care and insurance. Federal employees have excellent \n     health insurance options. Again contractors have far \n     different priorities and as we all know millions of people \n     working in private industry have no insurance.\n       Years ago Congress passed the Davis Bacon Act to ensure \n     that some workers earned a fair, liveable, negotiated wage. \n     We employees of Lake Mead's Maintenance Division are an \n     example of Congress' will. But any contractor that would \n     replace us has no such obligation.\n       The Park Service, in my 22 years of service, has never been \n     sufficiently funded. As an agency, we have always been on \n     starvation rations, and I can assure you that at my level, \n     Lake Mead N.R.A., there is absolutely no fat in the \n     system. For years our managers have been required to do \n     more with less.\n\n  The National Park System he talks about has 10 million visitors a \nyear. Lake Mead is the second busiest park in the whole United States.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       When it comes to saving the taxpayer's dollars nothing is \n     more efficient than having the work done for free. Nationwide \n     the National Park Service receives hundreds of thousands of \n     hours of donated labor. At Lake Mead N.R.A. alone last year \n     the public volunteered over 92,000 hours of which nearly \n     21,000 hours were in performing maintenance work. People will \n     volunteer to work for the National Park Service because they \n     recognize it is a noble and worthy gift to the country. \n     People do not, as we all know, volunteer to work for private \n     contractors.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Beyond being a workforce for our respective Parks, we \n     employees of the National Park Service are a national work \n     force. Lake Mead N.R.A. has sent people out over the years to \n     help with everything from oil spill cleanups to hurricane \n     relief. Every year Lake Mead employees are fighting this \n     Nation's wildland fires. This year, as always, we are on the \n     line protecting places like Denver, Colorado, and Show Low, \n     Arizona. But who will serve and man the fire camps when we \n     are gone?\n       It sounds cliche, but for the large majority of the \n     National Park Service's employees their work is more than \n     just a job. It is commonplace for people in my outfit to do \n     much more than just what is written in their position \n     descriptions. I am a carpenter. I also teach all of our \n     Rangers how to conduct water search and rescues. I'm not \n     special. The maintenance employees of Lake Mead N.R.A. serve \n     on the SCUBA team, on District fire engine companies, and \n     with search and rescue teams. We serve on Park committees and \n     often volunteer for special details. We are trained in first-\n     aid and are first responders. We direct traffic at accident \n     sites, we help land medical evacuation helicopters, and we \n     help handle victims and patients. We are also the eyes and \n     ears for our Rangers. We often are the ones who discover \n     trouble and report it. I don't think that it is too far of a \n     stretch to say that in some small way we are even part of \n     homeland security . . . let me say that we are essentially \n     ambassadors for the National Park Service. We are uniformed \n     employees constantly in the public eye. We are often the \n     first and sometimes the only ``official'' contact visitors \n     have with the Service. We answer questions, give directions, \n     and not all that uncommonly change a tire or two. We do all \n     these things and more, yet they are not in our job \n     descriptions and a contractor replacing us would not be \n     obligated to perform any of them.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   August 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: My name is Chuck Luttrell and I am an \n     employee of Lake Mead National Recreation Area. I am writing \n     to you on behalf of my fellow employees of the Maintenance \n     Division. The reason I am writing is because we believe a \n     process is taking place that is detrimental to the National \n     Park Service in general and Lake Mead in particular. It is my \n     hope that I can adequately articulate our concerns and enlist \n     your support and the power of your office to stop a \n     bureaucratic train before it becomes a train wreck.\n       As you know the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) \n     Act, along with the President's Management Agenda has \n     required Federal agencies to start implementing the \n     requirements of the Office of Management and Budget's \n     Circular A-76. The Department of the Interior and the \n     National Park Service have begun this ``Competitive \n     Sourcing'' process. The Lake Mead N.R.A. Maintenance Division \n     is part of the first round of studies and will begin its \n     evaluation in June of 2003.\n       The stated purpose and goals of Competitive Sourcing are \n     efficiency and cost savings. The dedicated people I work with \n     welcome ways to improve and do our jobs better. However, we \n     are very concerned that the Competitive Sourcing or A-76 \n     process is flawed when applied to the National Park Service. \n     We suspect that no only will it fail in its basic objectives, \n     but worse it will betray public trust and threaten the very \n     resources the Service was created to protect. Our ranks \n     provide services that will be ignored by the Competitive \n     Sourcing process and therefore lost to the visitor. Private \n     contractors simply can never completely replace our own work \n     force. Much of what we do and represent isn't even on the bid \n     sheet.\n       It is my understanding that in dozens and dozens of A-76 \n     conversions from the public to the private sector, no real \n     and tangible cost savings can be shown. Rather, substantial \n     cost such as employee severance packages, contract change \n     orders, contract disputes, litigation, etc. more than \n     eliminate any anticipated savings. But more importantly, \n     will the public be tolerant of the selling of the care and \n     operation of our National treasures to a for profit \n     corporation? Will our Parks get the same care, will our \n     cultural and natural heritage be safe in the hands of \n     companies that could turn out to be ENRON's or WORLDCOM's?\n       I realize that what I have written so far could be \n     dismissed as the ravings of a man fighting to save his job. \n     Indeed it would be easy for irrational fear to drive my pen. \n     But Sir, that is not it at all. If only you could speak to \n     the real managers and leaders of the Park Service. The career \n     professionals who actually run this outfit and who are the \n     ones responsible for getting the job done day to day, I have \n     confidence that you would hear that our concerns are valid.\n       The United States of America owes and has pledged a \n     commitment to our military veterans. We have preferential \n     hiring regulations for veterans. A private contractor has no \n     such obligation. The Federal Government has the strongest \n     commitment to diversity and equality there is. While all \n     contractors are required by law to provide equal opportunity, \n     as we see in courts all across this land not all live up \n     fully to those requirements. We've all heard it, ``Social \n     Security is not a retirement plan.'' Yet while the Federal \n     work force is provided a fair retirement package, contractors \n     have very different priorities and their employees may or may \n     not have some type of retirement future. In recent years \n     Congress has wrestled with the issues of health care and \n     insurance. Federal employees have excellent health insurance \n     options. Again contractors have far different priorities, and \n     as we all know millions of people working in private industry \n     have no insurance. Federal employees that have been \n     ``competitively sourced'' out of their jobs may add to those \n     uninsured rolls. Years ago Congress passed the Davis Bacon \n     Act to ensure that some workers earned a fair, liveable, \n     negotiated wage. We employees of Lake Mead's Maintenance \n     Division are an example of Congress's will. But any \n     contractor that would replace us has no such obligation.\n       However, rather than focus on issues we believe are \n     important but can be viewed as self serving, let me now turn \n     to why we are the best option for the public and this \n     country. The Park Service, in my 22 years of service, has \n     never been sufficiently funded. As an agency we have always \n     been on starvation rations and I can assure you that at my \n     level, Lake Mead N.R.A., there is absolutely no fat in the \n     system. For years our managers have been required to do more \n     with less. Being efficient is how we get the job done. Long \n     ago we made decisions to contract out certain maintenance \n     functions, namely garbage collection, lawn services, and \n     certain custodial work, because those things could be done \n     cost effectively by contractors. Unfortunately the \n     Competitive Sourcing study we now face gives us no credit for \n     this forward thinking.\n       When it comes to saving the taxpayer's dollars nothing is \n     more efficient than having the work done for free. Nationwide \n     the National Park Service receives hundreds of thousands of \n     hours of donated labor. At Lake Mead N.R.A. alone last year \n     the public volunteered over 92,000 hours of which nearly\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\n     21,000 hours were in performing maintenance work. People \n     will volunteer to work for the National Park Service \n     because they recognize that it is a noble and worthy gift \n     to this country. People do not, as we all know, volunteer \n     to work for private contractors. Despite this reality, the \n     A-76 process prohibits us from counting volunteers as part \n     of our efficiency/cost savings model.\n       When it comes to getting the job done the National Park \n     Service's proud tradition of employees being ``generalists'' \n     make us extremely efficient. Here at Lake Mead N.R.A. even \n     though our maintenance employees are classified as \n     electricians, mechanics, operators, or whatever, the bottom \n     line is we get the work done by using all of our people in \n     the most efficient combinations. For example on a day when \n     there are no pressing plumbing issues we might use our \n     plumbers to help our carpenters pour concrete, rather than \n     hire day labor. Our Maintenance Division has the flexibility \n     and capacity to respond to any situation. Whether it be to \n     repair storm damage or to prepare for an unscheduled event \n     like the recent visit of the Secretary of the Interior to our \n     area, our work force is agile and immediately responsive. \n     With contractors however, if it isn't in the contract it \n     doesn't happen without delays, change orders, and \n     renegotiated fees.\n       Beyond being a work force for our respective Parks, we \n     employees of the National Park Service are a national work \n     force. Lake Meed N.R.A. has sent people out over the years to \n     help with everything from oil spill clean ups to hurricane \n     relief. Every year Lake Meed employees are out there fighting \n     this Nation's wildland fires. This year, as always, we are on \n     the line protecting places like Denver, Colorado and Show \n     Low, Arizona. But who will serve and man the fire camps when \n     we are gone?\n       It sounds cliche, but for the large majority of the \n     National Park Service's employees their work is more than \n     just a job. It is common place for people in my outfit to do \n     much more than just what is written in their position \n     descriptions. I am a carpenter. I also teach all of our \n     Rangers how to conduct water search and rescues. I'm not \n     special. The maintenance employees of Lake Meed N.R.A. serve \n     on the SCUBA team, on District fire engine companies, and \n     with search and rescue teams. We serve on Park committees and \n     often volunteer for special details. Because our maintenance \n     staff is slightly larger than the Ranger force, and we are in \n     the field all day, everyday, we effectively bolster their \n     ranks. We are often the first on the scene or the first \n     person contacted when incidents occur. We are trained in \n     first-aid and are first responders. We direct traffic at \n     accident sites, we help land medical evacuation helicopters, \n     and we help handle victims and patients. We are also the \n     years and ears for our Rangers. We often are the first ones \n     to discover trouble and report it. I don't think that it is \n     too far of a stretch to say that in some small way we are \n     even part of our homeland security. After all it could well \n     turn out the some maintenances worker at the Statue of \n     Liberty or Mount Rushmore and could see something that would \n     make a difference. But without speculating what could be, let \n     me say that we are essentially ambassadors for the National \n     Park Service. We are uniformed employees that are \n     constantly in the public eye. We are often the first and \n     sometimes only ``official'' contact visitors have with the \n     Service. We answer questions, give directions, are not all \n     that uncommonly change a tire or two. We do all of these \n     things and more, yet they are not in our job descriptions \n     and a contractor replacing us would not be obligated to \n     perform any of them.\n       Up until now I have been talking about things that in some \n     way could be counted or measured. There is however one more \n     point I wish to make. Something that is there but can't be \n     bought or sold at any price. Every organization has a \n     culture, an ethic, and a personality. Employees of the \n     National Park Service are no different. We believe what we do \n     is special and important beyond merely just doing a good job. \n     We see ourselves as partners in the stewardship of this \n     Country's heritage. Virtually all embrace our over riding \n     mission from the 1916 act creating the National Park Service: \n     ``which purpose is to conserve the scenery and natural and \n     historic objects and wildlife therein and to provide for the \n     enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations.'' Our motivation is much different than those \n     who would replace us. The goal of commercial industry is \n     efficiency in pursuit of profit. That objective could not be \n     more different than our goal of preserving and protecting our \n     National treasures. I would strongly argue that no matter how \n     conscientious a contractor is, he could never match the \n     service and dedication we give to this Nation and our Parks. \n     The public instinctively recognizes that motivation counts. \n     As we saw with the issue of airport security, the public \n     wanted a Federal work force because they knew quality and \n     profit margins are opposing forces in the private sector.\n       As a Statesman I know any action you take is taken in light \n     of the greater good of the Nation and Nevada. In this letter \n     I have tried to persuade you that Competitive Sourcing, while \n     it sounds good on paper, is not good for the National Park \n     Service or Lake Mead National Recreation Area. I have tried \n     to describe why we believe we are the best value for the \n     public, but most importantly I hope I have been able to \n     convey to you that we are a fundamental part of the National \n     Park Service's mission. It is our sweat and toil that keeps \n     this Park open. We are central in the 1916 act creating us. \n     We help preserve and protect this special place with our \n     tools and our skills.\n       It is my understanding that the A-76 and Competitive \n     Sourcing processes have provisions to exclude certain work \n     because it is either inherently governmental or represents a \n     core function of the agency. It is also my understanding the \n     decision as to whether an activity should be retained in-\n     house rests with the director of that agency. We hope that \n     you agree with us that the work we do is so closely related \n     to the public interest that it would be a mistake to put it \n     on the auction block. If you are sympathetic with our cause I \n     would like to most respectfully ask that we be removed from \n     further consideration in the Competitive Sourcing process. I \n     know not where your authority rests in matters concerning the \n     Executive Branch's internal business, but I do know right is \n     might.\n       Finally, Sir, my apology for the length of this letter. I \n     know your time is extremely valuable and we the proud and \n     dedicated people of the Maintenance Division are most \n     grateful for your time and consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Chuck Luttrell,\n                                       Carpenter, Lake Mead N.R.A.\n       Also signed by 40 members of the Maintenance Staff of Lake \n     Mead National Recreation Area.\n\n  Mr. REID. But it is just not employees trying to protect their jobs. \nThey are people of good will who enjoy our parks. This is not a \nstatement from an employee of the Park Service or BLM or the Forest \nService. This is a letter from a person who cares about what is going \non.\n\n       This letter is intended to voice my outrage at President \n     Bush's plans for privatizing our Nation's National Park \n     System.\n       The President's planned study and outsourcing of our \n     Nation's most valuable and symbolic resource should create \n     indignation in the heart of any American. Our parks have been \n     on the short end of the funding stick for years, but this \n     recent maneuver goes too far. As you know, private contracted \n     companies are only interested in generating the maximum \n     profit, no matter what corners and services get cut in the \n     process.\n       Will you allow our National Parks to become another victim \n     of the ``Wal-Mart Syndrome''? Are we going to allow a system \n     that services our nation's last natural treasures with a \n     network of uninsured low wage caretakers from the lowest \n     contract bidder?\n       The other factor that you should consider is the loss of \n     thousands of annual volunteer hours that our parks receive \n     from the American public. Hundreds of men and women give on \n     themselves each year to support our parks. However, no one \n     will wish to denote their personal time to maintain the \n     thousands of miles of roads and trails in our parks to the \n     benefit of some private company.\n       The President has gotten his war and desired tax cuts, but \n     I urge you as my representative to put your foot down and \n     stop this plan from proceeding.\n\n  Mr. President, from another citizen:\n\n       As a resident of Nevada I find the proposed outsourcing of \n     National Park Service personnel to be outrageous and almost \n     offensive.\n       Employees of the Park Service are driven by a respect for \n     the parks and love of what they do. Nevadans visiting our \n     national parks want members of the Park Service, not profit-\n     minded corporations, enriching their experiences. I oppose \n     privatizing the Park Service because it would hurt Nevadans, \n     endanger our national parks, and waste taxpayer money.\n       Too many private firms have gone this route, costing jobs \n     in local communities, opening doors for big business, while \n     causing the local economies to falter.\n       We live, work, and play in this State. Many of the Park \n     personnel are our neighbors and friends. They care deeply \n     about what they do.\n       I do not think a commercial corporation can do this--I have \n     visions of an HMO system for our National Lands and shudder. \n     Who gets the profit from this private enterprise? We've seen \n     enough of the favoritism the current administration employs, \n     and frankly, this seems another opportunity for more of the \n     same.\n       I would certainly no longer volunteer for the Forest \n     Stewardship activities in the Lake Tahoe basin. I doubt that \n     many would. Volunteering time for a profitmaking concern is \n     not logical--why help a corporation that doesn't care diddly \n     about the land, the lakes, or the environment increase their \n     profits and not be paid for the ``contribution?''\n       I'm one small voice but I am convinced that privatization \n     of our national park system would be another step to \n     demolishing what little resources we have now and what we can \n     hope to gain in the future to hold and treasure for future \n     generations.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As a resident of Nevada I find the proposed outsourcing of \n     National Park Service personnel and resources to be \n     outrageous and almost offensive.\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\n       Senator Reid is so ``right on'' with the statement, \n     ``Employees of the Park Service are driven by a respect for \n     the parks and a love of what they do. Nevadans visiting our \n     National Parks want members of the Park Service, not profit-\n     minded corporations, enriching their experiences.'' I oppose \n     privatizing the Park Service because it would hurt Nevadans, \n     endanger our National Parks and waste taxpayer money.\n       Too many private firms have gone this route, costing jobs \n     in local communities opening doors for big business while \n     causing the local economies to falter (GE in San Jose, CA, \n     outsourced their printing to a national company to save \n     money. It ultimately led to layoffs in the local community \n     and an increase in their operating expenses). We're having \n     enough trouble with the local and Nevada budget without \n     adding additional unemployment which will ultimately mean \n     increased tax burdens via supplemental income, job \n     retraining, and money for employees in Nevada going outside \n     the State to bigger business. This is not simply an issue to \n     be addressed for our own State, but for the Nation as a \n     whole.\n       We live, work and play in this State. Many of the Park \n     personnel are our neighbors and friends. They care deeply \n     about what they do. (Their pay is relatively low for the \n     expertise they must have--they do it because they know the \n     value of protecting our parks, wildlife habitats, and the \n     environment.)\n       I do NOT think a commercial corporation can do this.--I \n     have visions of an HMO system for our National Lands and \n     shudder. Who gets the profit from this private enterprise? \n     We've seen enough of the favoritism the current \n     administration employs, and frankly, this seems another \n     opportunity for more of the same. This aspect of what the \n     administration is proposing bears watching closely.\n       What about the numbers of people and hours required to \n     maintain our Parks as best we can? With dollar to cost \n     averaging, they cannot factor in the vast number of hours \n     spent by volunteers to assist the Park Service. I would \n     certainly no longer volunteer for the Forest Stewardship \n     activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin. I doubt that many would. \n     Volunteering time for a profit making concern is not \n     logical--why help a corporation that doesn't care diddly \n     about the land, the lakes or the environment increase their \n     profits and not be paid for your ``contribution?''\n       I'm one small voice but I am convinced that privatization \n     of our National Park system would be another step to \n     demolishing what little resources we have now and what we can \n     hope to gain in the future to hold and treasure for future \n     generations.\n       What can we do to help see this does not happen and ensure \n     that our Parks Service maintains its integrity?\n           Thank you.\n                                                      Lin Yeazell.\n\n  Mr. REID. We read editorial comments from all over America opposing \nwhat is happening here. I have one editorial from the Las Vegas Sun \nnewspaper, written by Michael O'Callaghan: ``These Are Your Parks.''\n  Among other things, he says:\n\n       Americans who love and use our nation's parks have been \n     wondering when former secretaries of the Interior were going \n     to speak. Two of them just did that Tuesday when Bruce \n     Babbitt and Stewart Udall challenged the attempt to privatize \n     the positions servicing the parks and the public visitors . . \n     . They both see the turning over of 70 percent of the jobs to \n     the private sector as both ``radical'' and ``reckless.''\n\n  Among other things, O'Callaghan states:\n\n       Privatization of services forces within our park system \n     would be but the first deadly step to turning them away from \n     public recreation into a big business. Next they could have \n     neon signs at park gates leading to Yellowstone Enron, RCA \n     Zion, U.S. Cellular, Crater Lake, or Death Valley Coors. How \n     about Basin Bank One? They already have signs in big city \n     ballparks and this could be their next big step.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the full context of the O'Callaghan editorial \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Las Vegas Sun, Aug. 1, 2003]\n\n         Where I Stand--Mike O'Callaghan: These Are Your Parks\n\n       Americans who love and use our nation's parks have been \n     wondering when former secretaries of the Interior were going \n     to speak. Two of them did just that Tuesday when Bruce \n     Babbitt and Stewart Udall challenged the attempt to privatize \n     the positions servicing the parks and their public visitors. \n     Both challenged the present secretary's attempt to have \n     almost all of the loyal public servants replaced by private \n     sector employees. They both see the turning over of 70 \n     percent of these jobs to the private sector as both \n     ``radical'' and ``reckless.''\n       This situation has outdoor enthusiasts recalling when \n     Interior Secretary Gale Norton's mentor, then-Interior boss \n     James Watt, had his own agenda that threatened public lands \n     and parks. That's when a former assistant secretary from the \n     Ford and Nixon years, Nathaniel Reed, recommended that \n     President Ronald Reagan fire Watt.\n       It was in May 1981, during a speech, when Reed reminded his \n     fellow Republicans of their party's role in protecting public \n     lands. He started by telling them it was President Abraham \n     Lincoln who first withdrew Yosemite Valley for protection, \n     U.S. Grant's signing of a bill to create Yellowstone, and \n     Theodore Roosevelt's creation of the Forest Service and the \n     first national wildlife refuge. Yes, and it was Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower who created the Arctic Game Refuge that Norton now \n     wants to drill for oil.\n       The Reed went to work on Watt saying, ``But two of Watt's \n     actions have convinced me that he is already a disaster as \n     secretary. One of these is his butchery of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund. The other is the talk that he delivered to \n     the Conference of National Park Concessioners on March 9 of \n     this year--surely one of the most fawning, disgusting \n     performances ever given by a Secretary of the Interior. He \n     was so eager to please that he all but gave away the park \n     system.''\n       Privatization of the service forces within our park system \n     would be but the first deadly step to turning them away from \n     public recreation into a big business. Next they could have \n     neon signs at park gates leading to Yellowstone Enron, RCA \n     Zion, U.S. Cellular Crater Lake or Death Valley Coors. How \n     about Basin Bank One? They already have signs in big city \n     ballparks and this could be their next big step.\n       If Nevada Sen. Harry Reid has his way this won't happen. \n     Reid's Park Professionals Protection Act, if passed, will \n     take care of this challenge. It is designed to ``prohibit the \n     study or implementation of any plan to privatize, divest, or \n     transfer any part of the mission, function, or responsibility \n     of the National Park Service.''\n       In support of his bill, Reid gave some insight to the work \n     of park professionals when writing: ``Many of these Park \n     Service jobs have direct contact with visitors to our parks. \n     They not only collect fees and maintain parks but also give \n     directions, fight wildfires when necessary, and provide \n     emergency medical assistance to injured park visitors. They \n     are not required to do these things; they are driven by a \n     love for the parks and commitment to public service that \n     contractors lack.\n       ``Privatizing the Park Service would jeopardize our \n     national parks. Members of the Park Service have a career-\n     long interest in maintaining the parks and perform their jobs \n     because they are dedicated to serving the public. They often \n     go beyond the call of duty to fix a problem in the middle of \n     the night or change a tire for an unlucky park visitor. Can \n     we be sure that a contractor would do the same? No.''\n       Friends of our national parks have suddenly awakened and \n     the gloves are off. Let's hope it's not too late. How about \n     Basin Bank One?\n\n  Mr. REID. How much of my 25 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I repeat, anyone who supports the amendment of my friends, \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio and the two Senators from Wyoming, \nis voting to allow privatization of our national treasures to continue. \nMuddle it up--and that is what this amendment does--muddle it all you \nwant, that is what it is. Some people think you can privatize \neverything. You cannot do that. You cannot do that. There are certain \nthings that should be off limits. Our national treasures should be one \nof them.\n  I repeat for the third time, anyone who votes for the amendment of my \nfriends from Ohio and Wyoming is voting to privatize. Say it however \nyou want, but Udall and Babbitt, former Secretaries of the Interior, \nrecognize what is taking place. We have been told by my friends that \nthere is no such privatization plan underway. If that is true, I point \nout there should be no objection to my amendment.\n  Why study a plan, a privatization plan that will never be put into \neffect? My amendment puts a hold on the administration's privatization \nplans for this coming fiscal year.\n  I am getting more concerned each day. This Constitution I carry \naround with me sets forth the separation of powers doctrine, executive \nbranch of government, legislative branch of government, judicial branch \nof government, separate but equal. One is not superior to the other. I \nsee more and more coming from this administration that the Congress is \nnot relevant.\n  If the President of the United States and his people want to study \nthe privatization of our national treasures, let them come to Congress \nand get the money to do it. What are they doing? They are scavenging \nthe money from present programs. I listed today a number not being done \nbecause they were using this money for studies.\n  We have already learned from the Park Service director who works \nunder George Bush that the current plan will reduce service to the \npublic, negatively impact the diversity of the Park Service workforce, \nand will not save resources. This is something that should\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\nbe under the prerogative of the legislative branch.\n  Let us provide money if it is such a good idea. Do not just steal it \nfrom other programs within the agencies. That is what they are doing. \nTherefore, we cannot do things to remove asbestos, to repair sewer \nsystems, to take care of water systems, and to provide renovation in \nthe parks.\n  President Bush said when he took office that he wanted to reduce the \nbacklog of renovation, repair, and maintenance that needed to be done \nin our parks. Well, that was doublespeak, I guess. That is ``1984'' \nrevisited--Orwell's book--because, in fact, it has gone up. The backlog \nhas gone up from 4.9 billion to 6.1 billion. Let's do it the right way. \nLet's protect our constitutional prerogatives.\n  In 2002 and 2003 the agencies under the jurisdiction of this bill \nreprogrammed funds to study privatization. I repeat what the House \ncommittee report on the Interior bill noted: The massive privatization \ninitiative appears to be ``on such a fast track that the Congress and \nthe public are neither able to participate nor understand the costs and \nimplications of the decisions being made'' by the administration. The \ncommittee's required programming guidelines are not being followed by \nthe administration.\n  That is report language from the Republican-controlled House of \nRepresentatives. Shouldn't we go along with them? The answer is yes. \nThis was in the Republican committee report. That is why, in part, the \nHouse Interior Appropriations Subcommittee prohibited the expenditure \nof funds for more studies in 2004. That is precisely what my amendment \ndoes. We agree with the House.\n  Others have argued privatization will save money. The General \nAccounting Office estimated this may or may not be true. Studies of \noutsourcing at the Department of Defense, by contrast, where \noutsourcing is common, have been unable to demonstrate a single penny \nof cost saving. What we do know is that private companies will take \ncare of our parks under their agenda.\n  We should be very proud that since World War II veterans get a \npreference. If you served in the military, you apply for a job, you \ntake a test, and we give you a few extra bonus points because you \nserved our country. The private sector will not have to do that. They \ndo not have to follow the same rules and regulations we have dealing \nwith hiring the handicapped. They have all kinds of ways to cut corners \nin the private sector. It is not going to save money.\n  What I believe, and lots of other people believe, is private \ncompanies will not take care of our parks and forests and other public \nlands with the same motivation the people who are now working there do. \nThis has nothing to do with labor unions. I know there is a letter \ncirculating saying this is an effort by the minority to protect labor \nunions. As I said earlier today, I read into the Record different \nentities which support this amendment: the Wilderness Society, the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation, the National Parks \nConservation Association, the American Federation of Government \nEmployees. There is one union and three public service groups. This has \nnothing to do with unions. It has everything to do with protecting our \nnational treasures.\n  I talked about one contractor who wasted $21,000 on a workable design \nto build courtesy docks on a lake in a park. Of course, the Park \nService employees would have known that in a second. I talked about \ngarbage collection. When the garbage was collected by Federal \nemployees, it cost $150,000. Now it is done in the private sector, and \nit costs over $500,000.\n\n  I talked about public employees at Shenandoah National Park who \nrescued a lost boy. An official at Glacier National Park, who \ncontracted out their janitorial services, said: ``We didn't really save \nanything from a dollars and cents perspective. The costs came in the \nabove and beyond things the Park Service janitors regularly did that \nwere outside their regular job descriptions.''\n  Privatization does not always work. It has not worked in Nevada at \nour two military bases. Privatization can affect the experience \nvisitors have at our parks, as the Director of the Park Service has \nsaid. And I quoted that on two separate occasions just in the last few \nminutes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Although my friend \nfrom Ohio and the two Senators from Wyoming have said privatization \nsaves money for maintenance projects at our parks, in every instance \nthat has proven to be false. These agencies have reprogrammed millions \nof dollars in 2002 and 2003 from maintenance projects to perform these \nunauthorized maintenance studies. These funds were diverted from \nmaintenance projects in our parks.\n  I personally think privatization is a bad idea, but my amendment does \nnot stop current studies. It prevents new ones from starting until \nCongress has more information about the administration's initiative and \nthe effects it is having on our national parks and forests. They have \nalready wasted all that money studying what goes on. Why don't they \nissue a report on that and stop, have a slowdown, a pause, a timeout on \ngoing forward with more study? That is what I have asked for in my \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend, the \nmanager of this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNevada. I must point out I think there are wonderful public servants in \nthis country serving, day and night, the public interest, the public \nneed. I think this simple, easy notion that you can just contract \neverything out and things will be better is really pretty much wrong-\nheaded.\n  Oh, there may be some circumstances where it is appropriate, but I \nwill tell you, you take a look at firefighters, the police officers, go \nback to 9/11 and talk to the folks who responded to the calls on 9/11 \nwhen that terrible tragedy occurred in New York City, the devastating \nattack on this country--and, yes, those were public employees who were \nrushing up those stairs--firefighters, law enforcement men and women, \nrushing up those stairs--losing their lives, as the building was \ncollapsing, trying to save lives. These were public employees. There \nare so many serving in so many different ways--the archaeologists and \nbiologists working in the Park Service and in so many different areas.\n  In this piece of legislation, one of the agencies had spent money \nthey should not have spent studying contracting out when, in fact, they \ndid not have the money for the kind of basic repairs and maintenance \nnecessary to be done in the parks. So instead of doing what they should \nhave done to keep the parks in the kind of shape they should be, they \nwere using money to study: How can we contract these jobs out?\n  Well, there are plenty of examples--my colleague from Nevada has used \nsome of them--where you completely lose control with respect to \ncontracting out. I just think it is important sometimes to stop and \ntake a look at the workforce that belongs to the public sector, and to \nsay that, in many instances--most instances--they do a wonderful job to \nserve this country very well, and there is no substitute--no, not \ncontracting out, and no other substitute I know of--that could replace \nthat group of dedicated public workers who serve this country day after \nday after day. That is why I am happy to support this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the Record to reflect--I have been \nsomewhat impersonal, and I do not want to do that--the Park Service \nDirector now is a woman by the name of Fran Mainella. I want the Record \nto reflect she is the one who has indicated the current plan would \nreduce services to the public, negatively impact the diversity of the \nPark Service workforce, and will not save resources.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Reid. This amendment is \nimportant and it's fitting that we discuss this measure this week, just \ndays after the 10th anniversary of National Public Lands Day.\n  On Saturday, thousands of Americans around the country contributed \ntheir time and labor to help improve our shared national lands. In my \nhome State of Washington, volunteers restored trails, planted trees, \nand improved oyster habitat, to name a few\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\nprojects. I commend everyone who was involved in this effort for their \ncommitment to protecting and preserving our public lands.\n  Today's debate is about the many thousands of federal employees who \ndedicate themselves to this important cause every day. In our national \nparks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and other public \nlands, these men and women work every day of the year to protect and \npreserve these national treasures.\n  An article by Seattle Post-Intelligencer columnist, Joel Connelly, \nquoted Stewart Udall, the Interior Department boss under Presidents \nKennedy and Johnson as saying ``These are the best people in the \ngovernment . . . It's extraordinary they would pick on this Teddy \nRoosevelt agency.''\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has proposed a rule change \nthat would radically alter the management of our public lands. The \nPresident has proposed ``outsourcing'' important stewardship roles to \nfor-profit contractors. Under his proposal, private contractors could \nfill more than 800,000 jobs, including posts in the National Park \nService like at Olympic National Park, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nand U.S. Geological Survey, among other agencies. In my home State of \nWashington, this proposal could affect 10,000 government-wide jobs, \nincluding 348 national park biologists, educators, and maintenance \nstaff.\n  I believe this is the wrong approach. When it comes to our public \nlands, our first concern should be protecting our national treasures by \nensuring the highest level of natural resource stewardship.\n  There are many legitimate questions as to whether this outsourcing \nscheme would even save any money. In June, the General Accounting \nOffice concluded a comprehensive 2-year study on outsourcing and found \nthat ``competitions took longer than projects, costs and resources \nrequired for competitions were underestimated, [and] determining and \nmaintaining reliable estimates of savings was difficult.''\n  Even though the long term ``savings'' are suspect, we know for sure \nthat outsourcing is hurting our national parks. Park Service Director \nMainella estimated that the first round of competitive sourcing would \ncost $3 million, much of which will have to come out of maintenance. \nEven though Mount Rainier was taken off the list of parks subject to \noutsourcing this year, Park Superintendent Dave Uberuaga had to set \naside $335,000 of badly needed money for park maintenance to pay for a \nprivatization study. The cost of simply studying these Park Service \npositions is estimated to begin at $3,000 and go up from there.\n  The Federal workers entrusted with the preservation of our public \nlands can't simply be replaced by private workers. They are dedicated \nprofessionals who know the parks and public lands better than anyone, \nand they are not beholden to private interests who seek to exploit our \npublic lands.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Listen to what 145 former National \nPark Service employees--including four former directors--said in a \nrecent letter to President Bush decrying his proposal:\n  While publicizing glossy reports to convince the public that your \nAdministration cares about this country's national treasures, you are \nstrangling the very core of park stewardship, sidestepping the \nimportant issues that are facing the parks and ignoring the operational \nbudgets of the parks. We are seeing evidence at every turn that when \nprivate for-profit interests vie with resources of the park, the \nprivate interests, and not principle, governs.\n  Even the current Director of the National Park Service, Fran \nMainella, disagrees with the administration's approach. Earlier this \nyear, in an intra-departmental memo, she expressed her concerns about \nthe President's initiative. She noted that because the administration \ndid not seek funding to cover the costs of the thousands of competitive \nsourcing studies it has mandated, those costs must be absorbed by \nreductions in park operations and other worthy activities, which will \nresult in reduced visitor services and the deferment of essential park \nmaintenance.\n  Losing current National Park Service employees will also cause our \nnational parks to lose a great deal of institutional knowledge to \nindividuals who may not have training in these fields. National Park \nService employees, who often live in rural communities surrounding the \nparks, are dedicated public servants committed to preserving our parks \nfor all Americans' enjoyment and benefit now and in the future. They \nare also versatile and provide irreplaceable services during \nemergencies. The same employee that helps maintain park infrastructure, \nis also one of the first firefighters on the scene, providing \ninvaluable information about the parks' terrain.\n  Without this amendment, the Park Service could also lose tens of \nthousands of volunteers. These are dedicated citizens who contribute \ntheir time to help out in some of the most beautiful parts of the \ncountry. I have heard from a number of my constituents that they \nvolunteer because they feel they are sharing their love of the outdoors \nwith others and maintaining our public lands for future generations. \nBut they warned me they would feel very different about giving their \ntime to help support some for-profit contractor.\n  Conservation and protection of our public lands is not a partisan \nissue. The majestic herd of Roosevelt Elk in my home State's Olympic \nNational Park is a fitting reminder that throughout the past century, \nRepublicans and Democrats have been able to come together to preserve \nour Nation's public lands.\n  In that spirit, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto support this amendment, and vote to prevent the ``outsourcing'' of \nthe stewardship of our natural treasures.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced article in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 30, 2003]\n\n  In The Northwest: `Outsourcing' a sweeping attack on national parks\n\n                           (By Joel Connelly)\n\n       National parks are ``the best idea America ever had,'' \n     wrote author Wallace Stegner, an idea that has spread around \n     the globe since Yellowstone became the world's first national \n     park 130 years ago.\n       Lately, the Bush administration has come up with what it \n     believes is a better idea: ``outsourcing'' key work performed \n     by the National Park Service to private contractors.\n       It appears to be an initial step toward privatizing \n     management at the crown jewels of America's natural beauty \n     and historic sites where our country's freedom was won and \n     the Union sustained.\n       A hundred park employees recently signed a protest letter \n     to the president. Mount Rainier National Park has been a \n     center of resistance, so much so that Park Service Director \n     Fran Mainella just visited.\n       Yesterday, two Arizona outdoorsmen and long-serving \n     Interior secretaries, who supervised the park system, broke \n     their silence in a telephone interview with a half-dozen \n     reporters around the country.\n       ``What we are talking about is an attempt to dismantle the \n     National Park Service as we know it today. It turns its back \n     on 100 years, and a national park system that is the envy of \n     the world,'' said Bruce Babbitt, Interior secretary from 1993 \n     to 2001.\n       Added Stewart Udall, Interior's boss under Presidents \n     Kennedy and Johnson, ``These are the best people in the \n     government . . . It's extraordinary they would pick on this \n     Teddy Roosevelt agency.''\n       In an April 4 memo, Mainella disclosed that 900 park jobs \n     across the nation are marked for ``direct conversion'' to \n     private contractors and that an additional 1,323 jobs are to \n     be bid out in the next few months. The first phase of \n     ``outsourcing'' will privatize about 13 percent of the Park \n     Service's permanent work force.\n       The administration is not talking just about big road \n     repairs, or lodging and food services, jobs already performed \n     by private contractors.\n       Quite the contrary. The initial privatization list includes \n     hundreds of park archaeologists, biologists and historians--\n     the very people whose professional judgment is needed to \n     safeguard park resources.\n       As a Mount Rainier climbing ranger, and later \n     superintendent of Virginia's much-visited Shenandoah National \n     Park, Bill Wade learned care in where to put his feet and his \n     choice of words.\n       At a recent U.S. Senate hearing, however, the now-retired \n     second-generation Park Service employee cut loose with a \n     scathing critique.\n       ``Never before have we seen so many simultaneous assaults \n     on the purposes for which the national park system exists,'' \n     said Wade. ``Such assaults are undermining the role of the \n     National Park Service professionals who steward our great \n     natural and cultural legacy. Such assaults are contributing \n     to the failure of the Park Service to carry out its\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\n     intended mission on behalf of America's public.''\n       Why is the administration doing this?\n       After all, candidate George W. Bush spoke at Haskel Slough \n     near Monroe in 2000, pledging a major drive to complete \n     urgently needed maintenance at the national parks. First lady \n     Laura Bush has spent this week hiking with old school friends \n     in Olympic National Park.\n       Due to ``outsourcing'' studies, moreover, the Park Service \n     has warned supervisors in the West that their maintenance-\n     repair budget would be scaled back by more than 25 percent--\n     largely to pay for consultants. Mount Rainier, with a $100 \n     million backlog, has been forced to put off urgently needed \n     projects.\n       An administration management agenda for fiscal year 2002 \n     gives the rationale: ``Competition promotes innovation, \n     efficiency and greater effectiveness. For many activities, \n     citizens do not care whether the private or public sector \n     provides the service or administers the program.''\n       One wonders whether the right-wing ideologue who wrote this \n     has ever visited a national park. He or she would discover:\n       The National Park Service is an agency of legendary esprit \n     de corps, in which people move around the country, frequently \n     work extra hours and endure low pay for love of the job.\n       Park jobs are not compartmentalized and suitable for \n     ``outsourcing.'' Rangers do a range of jobs for rescue to \n     firefighting to interpretation. At Shenandoah, for instance, \n     park maintenance staff--trained as emergency medical \n     technicians--are frequently first to the scene of traffic \n     accidents on the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n       The public trusts rangers, flocks to interpretive programs \n     and expects park resources to be maintained. National parks \n     are not amusement parks.\n       Efficiency is not the end-all of park management. Sure, it \n     would have been more efficient to cut a wide swath of trees \n     to widen state Route 410 in Mount Rainier National Park. It \n     would also have created an eyesore in the midst of a scenic \n     treasure.\n       The protest against ``outsourcing'' has made an impact.\n       While slashing worthy programs such as AmeriCorps and the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund, the House of \n     Representatives has voted to block new privatizing studies.\n       The administration has responded with a hard line: ``If the \n     final version of the (appropriations) bill were to contain \n     such a provision, the president's senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill,'' the Office of Management \n     and Budget said in a statement.\n       Curiously, however, Mainella showered Mount Rainier with \n     reassurances on the eve of her visit, saying that no jobs at \n     the park would be reviewed for private-sector replacement for \n     two years.\n       Can we trust these people? About as far as I can hand-roll \n     a snowplow.\n       Looking at similar moves with the U.S. Forest Service and \n     Bureau of Land Management, what's likely unfolding is a \n     sweeping, below-the-radar-screen attack on public lands and \n     public land managers.\n       As Babbitt put it yesterday, ``The only thing that will \n     stop this radical, reckless effort to take things apart is \n     public opinion.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take just a portion of that. I \nthink we have covered this issue fairly well. I would like to comment \non a couple things that were said on the other side of the aisle. The \nSenator said we are going to contract everything out. That is part of \nthe problem here, making statements like that which are absolutely \nuntrue. It makes it kind of tough to understand what is going on. No \none is talking about contracting everything out. No one is even talking \nabout privatizing. We are talking about competitive competition. So I \nthink we ought to be just a little more careful about that.\n  This idea that this is being done entirely by the executive branch, \nremember, we passed a law in 1998 called the FAIR Act. You know what \nthat was. It authorized what we are doing here now. Circular A-76 has \nbeen on the books from Congress since 1976. Congress passed that. \nSurprising as it may seem, a lot of people in Congress think the \nprivate sector is a good thing, that it does a pretty good job. That is \nkind of what this country is about, the private sector. This idea that \nsomehow you hire people and take away all their benefits--the Service \nAcquisition Act, passed by Congress, ensures that health benefits and \npay are not reduced in Government contracts to the private sector. \nThose are things that are done there.\n  We are not talking about contracting everything. Here are the \npositions being evaluated to give you some idea. From U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, clerical support and appraisers; National Park \nService, maintenance vehicles, lawns, bathrooms, air-conditioners--is \nthat going to change the emotions in the park? I don't think so--Bureau \nof Reclamation, Job Corps centers; Bureau of Land Management, \nmaintenance vehicles, bathrooms, air-conditioners, geographic \ninformation services. These are the kinds of jobs that are done all the \ntime in the private sector, the professionals, many of them in the \nprivate sector.\n  It is too bad we continue to say some of these things that just \naren't the case. I hope we continue to provide, as the Congress has \nsaid, an opportunity to have competition for some of the activities \nwithin Government, and those that can be done better in the private \nsector can be done. Those savings then will go to offset some of the \nbacklog of the Park Service that has existed without any competition. \nThis is kind of where we are.\n  I certainly encourage my fellow Senators to support our second-degree \namendment when it comes to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  I certainly understand some of Senator Reid's concerns about the \ncompetitive sourcing initiative.\n  For one, most of the agencies funded in this bill failed to budget \nadequately for the costs of the competitive sourcing studies. As a \nresult, funds that would have been available for other purposes--such \nas maintenance projects or grazing management--were diverted. \nUltimately, I regard this as a failure of the Office of Management and \nBudget as much as anything.\n  Yes, competitive sourcing in some cases may result in actual savings. \nBut those savings are likely to be over the long term, and the fact \nthat there may be savings doesn't relieve agencies of the need to \nbudget for the implementation costs up front.\n  It is for that very reason that we included language in this bill \nthat made further competitive sourcing work by the Forest Service \ncontingent on approval of a detailed reprogramming request. The Forest \nService is slated to spend more than any other agency in this bill on \nthis initiative.\n  But the question before us now is whether to shut down any and all \ncompetitive sourcing studies by agencies in this bill. This strikes me \nas overkill. Has the administration flawlessly implemented its \ninitiative? Certainly not. We have already discussed its failure to \nadequately budget for the initiative.\n  I would also note that the administration initially proposed quotas \nof positions that each agency was to competitively source. I think this \nwas inappropriate. Competitive sourcing makes more sense in some \nagencies than it does in others. And some agencies have already used \nforms of competitive sourcing to great advantage. There should be some \nrecognition what these agencies have done previously.\n  Finally, I know there is much concern among my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle about the potential impact of competitive sourcing on \nrural areas. I absolutely understand and share this concern. In such \nareas the potential loss of a handful of well-paying Government jobs is \nnot a trivial thing. This is particularly true if there is no guarantee \nthat any jobs that are outsourced will remain in the community. I don't \nthink the administration has fully appreciated this fact. But the root \nof the question raised by this amendment is whether competitive \nsourcing is, in all cases, a bad thing. The answer is clearly no.\n  Competitive sourcing experts can cite numerous examples--and they \nhave been cited in the Chamber--of success in the Department of \nDefense. But even within the Department of the Interior, careful use of \noutsourcing has resulted in both dollar savings and improved \nperformance. The construction program of the National Park Service is \none such example. I have one of those in Great Falls, MT.\n  Proponents of this amendment can certainly cite examples of poor \nperformance or malfeasance by contractors. Without question, there are \ncases of this. But we know well enough that there are at least as many \ninstances of\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\npoor performance by Federal employees. This argument simply doesn't \nfly. Finally, I note that the pending amendment is identical to \nlanguage included in the House bill. The Statement of Administration \nPolicy states that the President's senior advisers will recommend a \nveto of the Interior bill if such language is included. While I am not \ngenerally one to back down in the face of such a threat, I do think we \nshould consider whether we want to take that trip. Wouldn't it be \nbetter to see if we can't go to conference and produce language that \nfurther improves the quality of the competitive sourcing initiative, \nrather than simply throwing what amounts to a legislative tantrum?\n  I vow to my colleagues that I will work hard with the administration \nto see that their concerns are addressed. But do we put an absolute \nstop to a management practice that has been available to agencies in \nthis bill for many years? Or do we instead try to improve the product, \nand increase congressional oversight of competitive sourcing efforts? I \nsimply find it hard to accept that in all cases competitive sourcing is \na bad thing. And I am guessing Federal employees will win more of the \ncompetitions than people think if they're well structured. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the Reid amendment, and to work with me as \nwe go to conference to produce a better solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my friend, \nSenator Thomas, from Wyoming. He has always been so cordial and polite \nto me, as I am sure he is to everyone. He is a real advocate. My point \nis, he is absolutely wrong on this issue. His argument makes our point. \nHe says: We are not privatizing. But that is what they are doing. They \nare studying all these different programs, and the purpose is to \nprivatize.\n  The FAIR legislation: Of course, I understand what that bill was, but \nit also took into consideration that the money was to be appropriated \nto do the studies, not to be scavenged from other operations.\n  I read only one editorial from the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, but there \nare others. Here is one from the Los Angeles Times: ``Keep Pros Who \nLove Parks.''\n  The first paragraph reads:\n\n       In a memo to her bosses at the Department of the Interior, \n     National Park Service Director Fran Mainella said the \n     administrative costs of a plan to contract out some Park \n     Service jobs to private companies could seriously cut the \n     already rock-bottom level of visitor services and seasonal \n     operations. Unfortunately, that would only be one piece of \n     the damage.\n\n  They go on to say that this is a wrongheaded idea and bad for our \nnational treasures:\n\n       The nation's most important natural and historic sites \n     deserve to be protected by workers with expertise, experience \n     and dedication to the parks. They are there now, and in the \n     proud green uniform of the National Park Service.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 26, 2003]\n\n                        Keep Pros Who Love Parks\n\n       Jobs targeted for possible outsourcing--as many as 4 \n     percent of the Park Service total--include firefighters, with \n     40 positions at risk in California alone. Others such as fee \n     collectors and maintenance workers don't sound so bad as \n     candidates for contracting out, through visitors do turn to \n     the collectors for advice as they enter the park.\n       However, the list also covers Park Service scientists and \n     specialists such as archaeologists, museum curators, \n     historians and cartographers. Where will they find competent \n     private experts who will work for the salaries of the current \n     Park Service employees, or less?\n       These scientists are passionate about protecting park \n     resources from the effects of development, whereas the Bush \n     administration often has sided with economic interests.\n       High-level Interior Department officials--up to and \n     including Secretary Gale A. Norton--repeatedly have trashed \n     the scientific work underlying such sound decisions as the \n     2000 Park Service ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone National \n     Park. The ban is being reversed in response to objections \n     from tourist businesses in the region.\n       Similarly, Yosemite-area businesses are campaigning for \n     more parking and reconstruction of campgrounds along the \n     Merced River in Yosemite Valley that were flooded out in \n     1997. They want to sell the additional campers beer, \n     groceries and gasoline. Naturalists correctly argue that the \n     campsites should not be there--that the riverbank should be \n     restored to its natural beauty. The region's congressman, \n     siding with business, is pushing for their return.\n       The nation's most important natural and historic sites \n     deserve to be protected by workers with expertise, experience \n     and dedication to the parks. They are there now, in the proud \n     green uniform of the National Park Service. There they should \n     stay.\n\n  Mr. REID. A small newspaper, smaller than the Las Vegas Sun, one from \nMissoula--of course, Missoula, MT--also talks about how wrong it is. \nThey are so specific, and they know because they live in Glacier \nNational Park. They say outsourcing simply is not good.\n  There are editorials from all over the country that talk about how \nbad an idea this is. Remember, anyone voting for the amendment offered \nby my friend from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, is voting to outsource, to \nprivatize our national treasures. You can say: I really didn't mean to \ndo that; all I did was want studies to be completed.\n  That isn't what we have here. We have agreed that they can complete \nthe studies they have already engaged in, even though they stole the \nmoney from other things that needed to be done within the entities. But \nto vote for the Voinovich amendment is to vote for privatization. To \nvote for the Reid amendment is to vote for a time-out, a pause.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1740\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 10 minutes equally divided on \nthe Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the first 3 minutes of my \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, amendment No. 1740 is straightforward. \nIt would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior, working through the \nPark Service, from issuing any permit allowing a special event on The \nNational Mall unless the permit expressly prohibited the use of \nstructures or signs bearing commercial advertising.\n  The amendment does provide that there can be sponsor recognition of \nspecial events, but it makes clear we intend to have the Park Service \ninterpret that in a way that is consistent with the special nature of \nThe National Mall.\n  We would also require that the lettering or design that identifies \nthe sponsor not be more than a third the size of the lettering \nidentifying what the special event is.\n  I have shown this photograph before. I will show it again so people \nhave an idea of what prompted my amendment. This is a special event \nthat the Park Service approved and issued a permit for a couple of \nweeks ago on The National Mall. This event was a football and music \nfestival entitled ``NFL Kick-off Live From The National Mall Presented \nby Pepsi Vanilla''.\n  This photograph is from the Washington Post. This is an enlarged \nphotograph that was in the Washington Post. You can see that there are \na whole series of banners up and down The Mall. There is one for \nVerizon, and this one is for Pepsi Vanilla, and here is a giant \nfootball with NFL signs on it.\n  It seemed clear to me that this was commercial advertising any way \nyou look at it. The Park Service, unfortunately, takes the position \nthat this was entirely appropriate. No commercial advertising here. \nThis is sponsor recognition. We were giving some recognition to those \nthat were underwriting this important event for a public purpose. You \nmay say, what was the public purpose? Well, it was to take pride in \nAmerica--you can find that phrase way down here--and this is the idea \nthat there is voluntarism, and that was the reason we opened this up \nwith the NFL. It gave them a permit for 17 days, during which time they \ncould block off The Mall, prepare for the festival, have the festival, \nand break down the equipment after the festival and so on.\n  I will show the other photograph. This is another photograph that \nshows the fence that was put around The Mall, with advertisements for \nAOL, Pepsi Vanilla, Coors, and Verizon. This, of course, was blocking \naccess to The Mall for the public. If you wanted to walk or jog on The \nMall, or do anything else, you were prohibited from doing so during \nthis period.\n\n[[Page S11805]]\n\n  We need to clarify what the law is. My amendment will do that. It \nsays we don't want commercial advertisement on The Mall. I always \nthought that was the policy, and, up until now, I think it has \ngenerally been the policy. But it is clearly not recognized that way by \nthe current Secretary of the Interior and the head of the Park Service. \nWe need to clarify that.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. It puts into law a \nprohibition of commercial advertising on The National Mall for the \nfirst time.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the amendment that is \nbefore us. I was concerned when I first talked to the Senator about it. \nI was concerned that it would be difficult to differentiate between \ncommercial signs, advertising, on the one hand, and sponsors, for \ninstance, the Race for the Cure, on the other. However, we talked \ntogether about that. We talked with the Park Service about that, and I \nbelieve the wording of the amendment is such that that kind of emotion, \nthat kind of recognition of the sponsors for voluntary events would be \nallowable.\n  I am chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee and we deal with The \nMall, and we have had several hearings and considerable consideration \nabout what we do on The Mall and how many buildings there are and how \nit is used. So I think it is important to set standards for the use of \nsomething that is very unique and in the national interest.\n  I think the Senator has a worthwhile amendment, and I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 3 minutes 40 \nseconds. The Senator from New Mexico has 41 seconds.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield part of my time to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support and cosponsored the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico. I think it is not only written \nappropriately at this point and has proper safeguards, but I think it \nis also a necessary amendment for the reasons that my colleague from \nNew Mexico has described.\n  I understand my colleague from Wyoming, who is chairman of the \nsubcommittee on these issues, and his statement as well. If we pass \nthis amendment with this particular wording, I think it accomplishes \nsomething important, and I am happy to cosponsor it and support it.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment. A long time ago, I wanted to go much further than this. But \nI think the Senator from New Mexico has hit the nail on the head. So I \nsupport it, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Thomas and \nSenator Burns for their support and, of course, Senator Dorgan, who is \na cosponsor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Akaka, who is the ranking member \non the National Parks Subcommittee in our Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the broad support we are \nreceiving for the amendment, and I hope all Senators will vote in \nfavor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is upon agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 92, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 358 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--92\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bond\n     Campbell\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Dodd\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 1740) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1753\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto a vote on a motion to table the Boxer amendment No. 1753.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, colleagues, I hope Members will vote \nagainst the motion to table my amendment. I am simply trying to strike \nsection 333, which is an anti-environmental rider that singles out 39 \ntimber sales in the Tongass Forest and only allows a 30-day appeals \nprocess for citizens, small businesses, and community groups to act. It \nalso says a judge must act in 180 days, pushing this ahead of other \npending cases.\n  Now, why is it important to all of us? If you can change the rules in \nthe largest temperate rain forest in the world, think about what would \nhappen to you in your States. We have not had any hearings on this \nissue. I don't think this is the right way to legislate.\n  If it is a question of jobs, there are 300 million board feet of \ntimber in the Tongass that could be cut today. There are no lawsuits \npending on those.\n  This is a process question. I hope colleagues would not take away the \nrights of their constituents.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from California, Ms. Boxer, \nhas offered an amendment seeking to strike expedited judicial review of \ntimber sales from U.S. Forest Service Regional X, covering the Tongass \nNational Forest in Alaska.\n  While some use flowery terms to characterized the Tongass National \nForest as the ``last intact temperate rain forest'' or the ``crown \njewel of our national forest system,'' they merely gloss over the \nrealities of our forest. The Sierra Club, the National Wildlife \nFederation, and others use overstated hyperbole meant to shift the \nfocus of the debate from what we truly ought to be looking; that is, \ncreating more jobs in America.\n  For months now Senators from the other party have come to floor to \ndecry job losses in the United States--lost jobs that they somehow \nblame on President Bush.\n  Yet they need only look at the pursuit of their own policies that \nhave led to our increased reliance on foreign natural resources and \nlost economic opportunity.\n  Alaska has the highest unemployment rate in the country, and every \ntime I go back home to see my constituents--which is quite frequently--\nthey ask me how we can create more jobs.\n  In Alaska we used to have thousands of timber and timber-related \njobs. Now\n\n[[Page S11806]]\n\nwe have less than one thousand. That is criminal in a State that boasts \nthe largest single national forest in the country.\n  The Tongass Forest is large enough to set aside land for future \ngenerations while also providing valuable timber for American \nmanufacturing and U.S. jobs. Allow me to put it in perspective. In 2002 \nthere were 110,000 people employed by the timber industry in \nCalifornia. In Alaska just 650 people were employed in the timber \nindustry in 2002--again, in a State with the largest national forest. \nThese are statistics from the American Forest and Paper Association.\n  In 2002, California produced 2.63 billion board feet of timber. \nDuring the same time in Alaska just 30 million board feet were \nproduced. That figure makes California the fourth largest wood producer \nin the U.S. That means during FY 2002 Region X (the largest region in \nthe Forest Service system) produced the least amount of timber--\n(Source: U.S. Forest Service).\n  While the Senator is offering an amendment that she thinks is the \nright thing to do to protect the environment, she must realize that \nthis issue has been debated for literally decades, going back to when \nAlaska was a territory. Just as timber harvests take place in other \nnational forests the Government saw fit to allow some limited, but \nsustainable, timber harvests to take place in the Tongass. \nUnfortunately some misguided and illegal policy changes under the \nClinton administration set back timber jobs in Alaska during the 1990s. \nFortunately the courts and the current administration have seen fit to \nreverse those rulings to follow the law. Unfortunately there are those \nwho want to continue filing lawsuit after lawsuit, clogging up an \nalready overpacked docket to keep Alaskans out of work.\n  I would say to those who continue to criticize job losses in the \nUnited States that one way to overcome them is to allow people to get \nback to work.\n  The problem is we can't get people back to work with the continued \nthreat of frivolous litigation. The Senator's amendment seeks to allow \npeople to further burden our courts under false pretenses of saving \nAlaska from Alaskans. It is an insult to me and my constituents to hear \npeople attack our State.\n  We have a right to good jobs--just like those in California. We have \na right to send our kids to good schools, just like in California. We \nhave a right to have parks and hospitals and all the other \ninfrastructure that is in the towns and cities in California, but our \ntowns in Alaska needs jobs and industry to make them a reality.\n  As a State in this Union we entered to become an equal among equals. \nBut that does not mean that we don't know what is in our best interest \nas a State and as individuals. The amendment my colleague offers seeks \nto provide more opportunities for litigation after we have already \nundergone lawsuit after lawsuit and lengthy administrative processes.\n  The language in the current bill does not cut off access to the \ncourts. It merely requires that any application for judicial review be \nfiled within 30 days after exhaustion of the Forest Service appeals \nprocess. Currently I am told the time limit is 6 years. The language \napplies for Record of Decisions for any timber sales in Region X of the \nForest Service that had a Notice of Intent prepared on or before \nJanuary 1, 2003.\n  The language does not restrict the right of the public to litigate \ntimber sales; it simply speeds up the process by encouraging the court \nto render a decision within 180 days of the application.\n  Since 1990, at least nine timber sales on the Tongass have been \nlitigated. Individual sales have been held up sometimes for years \nduring the litigation process. What the families and the people who \ndepend on the timber industry seek is simply some finality and a \nreasonable time for decisions.\n  According the Alaska Forest Association, my State has lost over 1,400 \njobs in the recent years and the timber industry has ground down to a \nvirtual standstill. Only 650 people remain employed in an industry that \nwas once year round and spread throughout the region. Whole communities \nhave vanished.\n  These people are not threatening the last remaining temperate rain \nforest in the United States, but their ability to provide for their \nfamilies and for their families to have a future is threatened by \nlawyers and protracted litigation. The protracted litigation and the \ntime to resolve that litigation could cost them their livelihoods and \ntheir family owned businesses. The ripple effect extends way beyond the \nindividuals and the employees--it rips into the fabric of the \ncommunities in southeast Alaska. These are the things that the language \nof the appropriations bill seeks to address.\n  I support that language in the bill because I have seen firsthand \nwhat the endless litigation has done to my communities. I oppose the \nBoxer amendment because it seeks to empower more frivolous law suits \nand more delays. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to \nsupport more jobs in Alaska and America.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, this amendment has nothing to do with \nenvironmental concerns. This is a judicial process amendment. These \ncontracts for timber go through a review process involving an EIS, then \npublic hearings, then an opportunity to appeal to the Forest Service, \nand then an opportunity to file, administratively, appeals within the \nForest Service.\n  After a final record of decision, they have 6 years to take it to the \ndistrict court. All we are asking is that be shortened to the normal \nprocess of 30 days and the process for appeal from the administrative \ncourt be 30 days and the court take no longer than 180 days to review \nthat appeal. It does not limit the time for the appeal to the circuit \ncourt but is strictly a judicial process shortening the time.\n  It now takes 3 to 4 years for every contract before we can possibly \ntry to use those contracts to harvest the trees, within 676,000 acres \nout of 17 million acres. We need this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto a vote on the Voinovich amendment No. 1754.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, this second-degree amendment on which we \nwill be voting, the reporting requirement, addresses a number of \nconcerns various Senators have had with competitive sourcing.\n  The second-degree amendment does the following: It requires the \nSecretary of the Interior to annually report on its competitive \nsourcing efforts--including a list of the total number of competitions \ncompleted, a list of the total number of competitions announced and the \nactivities covered, and a list of the total number of full-time \nequivalent Federal employees studied under completed competitions.\n  The second-degree amendment is a responsible measure that will bring \nadditional accountability and transparency to public-private \ncompetitions.\n  Two weeks ago, the House overwhelmingly adopted a similar reporting \nrequirement during consideration of the Treasury/Transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  The Thomas-Voinovich amendment will give Congress additional \noversight of competitive sourcing, unlike the Reid amendment that stops \nit altogether. Competitive sourcing allows tax dollars to be used more \nefficiently, more effectively. It will improve agency efficiency. I \nurge my colleagues to support the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, anyone who supports this amendment is \nsupporting contracting out. All you have to do is read their amendment \nand that is what it says. They say the President will issue reports. He \nhas not done that. That is the only thing it does. It allows \ncontracting out to go forward without authorization of Congress and \nwithout any appropriation for the studies to be taken. Remember what \nthey are doing now is scavenging the money from other work that needs \nto be done within the various public land entities. It is unfair. It is \nwrong. Anyone who supports the Voinovich amendment supports contracting \nout, without question. I urge a ``nay'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Not later than December 31 of each year, the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the competitive sourcing activities on the list required \n     under the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 \n     (Public Law 105-270; 31 U.S.C. 501 note) that were performed \n     for the Department of the Interior during the previous fiscal \n     year by Federal Government sources. The report shall \n     include--\n       (1) the total number of competitions completed;\n       (2) the total number of competitions announced, together \n     with a list of the activities covered by such competitions;\n       (3) the total number of full-time equivalent Federal \n     employees studied --under completed competitions;\n       (4) the total number of full-time equivalent Federal \n     employees being --studied under competitions announced, but \n     not completed;\n       (5) the incremental cost directly attributable to \n     conducting the competitions identified under paragraphs (1) \n     and (2), including costs attributable to paying outside \n     consultants and contractors;\n       (6) an estimate of the total anticipated savings, or a \n     quantifiable --description of improvements in service or \n     performance, derived from completed competitions;\n       (7) actual savings, or a quantifiable description of \n     improvements in --service or performance, derived from the \n     implementation of competitions completed after May 29, 2003;\n       (8) the total projected number of full time equivalent \n     Federal employees covered by competitions scheduled to be \n     announced in the fiscal year covered by the next report \n     required under this section; and\n       (9) a general description of how the competitive sourcing \n     decisionmaking processes of the Department of the Interior \n     are aligned with the strategic workforce plan of that \n     department.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1731\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided on the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone should understand that what has \njust taken place is to allow privatization to continue in our public \nland agencies. Clearly, that is what happened. I hope the Members of \nthis body will approve the Reid amendment and allow this matter to go \nto conference. It appears this last vote was a cover-your-rear-end \nvote. So we probably will lose on this amendment. I think it is a \nshame.\n  I read into the Record how people who work at the agencies feel, \neditorial comments from all over the country, and comments from private \npeople who know how important the parks are. Veterans preference would \nnot be there; disabilities act would not apply. There are so many \nthings that are unfair to the dedicated people working for our public \nland agencies.\n  I hope there will be a ``yea'' vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the amendment that was just adopted \nmakes sense out of competitive sourcing, makes the agencies accountable \nfor competitive sourcing, and makes it part of the shaping of their \nworkforce. It is long overdue.\n  The Reid amendment completely eliminates competitive sourcing period. \nIt leaves it out. If you look at other Federal agencies that have \ncompetitively sourced, for example at the Department of Defense, in \nabout 98 percent of streamlined competitions--and these all have to be \ncommercial functions--98 percent of the time, the Federal workers win \nthe competition. They win because they come together, use quality \nmanagement, and figure out a way to do the job better than they were \ndoing it before.\n  Anyone who supported our amendment should vote no on this amendment \nwhich just eliminates competitive sourcing altogether and is not good \npublic policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1750\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1750 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 1750.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, line 21, insert after ``until expended'' the \n     following:\n\n     : Provided, That the Department of Energy shall develop, with \n     an opportunity for public comment, procedures to obtain oil \n     for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a manner that \n     maximizes the overall domestic supply of crude oil (including \n     amounts stored in private sector inventories) and minimizes \n     the costs to the Department of Interior and the Department of \n     Energy of acquiring such oil (including foregone revenues to \n     the Treasury when oil for the Reserve is obtained through the \n     Royalty-in-Kind program), consistent with national security. \n     Such procedures shall include procedures and criteria for the \n     review of requests for the deferrals of scheduled deliveries. \n     No later than 120 days following the enactment of this Act of \n     Department shall propose and no later than 180 days following \n     the enactment of this Act the Department shall publish and \n     follow such procedures when acquiring oil for the Reserve.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. This amendment establishes a cost-effective program to \nfill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I understand it has been cleared \nby both of the managers.\n  Since late 2001 the Department of Energy--DOE--has been steadily \nadding oil to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, in order to \nfill the reserve to its maximum capacity of 700 million barrels. In \nlate 2001, the reserve held about 560 million barrels of oil; today \nholds nearly 620 million barrels. DOE anticipates that at the current \nfill rate it will reach its goal of 700 million barrels sometime in \n2005.\n  Since early 2002, DOE has been acquiring oil for the SPR without \nregard to the price of oil. Prior to that time, DOE sought to acquire \nmore oil when the price of oil was low, and less oil when the price of \noil was high. In early 2002, however, DOE abandoned this cost-based \napproach and instead adopted the current approach, which does not \nconsider cost when buying oil for the SPR. Since over this period the \nprice of oil has been very high--often over $30 per barrel--and the oil \nmarkets have been tight, this cost-blind approach has increased the \ncosts of the program to the taxpayer and, of great significance, put \nfurther pressure on tight oil markets, thereby helping boost oil and \ngasoline prices to American consumers and businesses.\n  The bipartisan amendment Senator Collins and I are offering today is \nsimple. It would encourage DOE to consider the price and supply of oil \nwhen buying oil for the SPR. It would direct DOE to minimize the \nprogram's cost to the taxpayer while maximizing our energy security.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations spend a year and a half \nlooking at oil markets and the SPR. In March of this year my staff on \nthe subcommittee published the repot of the investigation. In summary \nour investigation found:\n\n       In 2002, DOE began to fill the SPR without regard to the \n     price of oil.\n       Filling the SPR in tight market increased U.S. oil prices \n     and hurt U.S. consumers.\n       Filling the SPR regardless of oil prices increased taxpayer \n     costs.\n       Despite its high cost, filling the SPR [in 2002] did not \n     increase overall U.S. oil supplies.\n\n  The March report also warned that the deliveries that were then \nscheduled for later in 2003 would drive oil prices higher because \nprices were high and inventories were low. Unfortunately, this \nprediction turned out to be accurate.\n  Our Report recommended:\n\n       DOE should defer all SPR deliveries . . . until near-term \n     crude oil prices fall and U.S. commercial inventories \n     increase.\n       DOE should conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the previous \n     SPR fill policy compared to the current policy.\n       DOE should restore its SPR business procedures allowing \n     deferrals of oil deliveries to the SPR when crude oil prices \n     are high or commercial crude oil supplies are tight.\n\n  Both Houses of Congress support the goal of filling the SPR to its \ncapacity. I support this goal, too. This amendment seeks to further \nthis goal and our national energy security at least cost to the \ntaxpayers. For many years the SPR program followed the types of \nprocedures that DOE has recently abandoned. The SPR program office \nitself has recommended the DOE return to using these market-based \nprocedures. Under the amendment DOE would continue to have the \ndiscretion to determine when to buy oil for the SPR, and under which \nprocedures, but DOE would be encouraged to use that discretion in a way \nto minimize costs while maximizing national energy security.\n  Any successful businessperson knows the saying, ``Buy low, sell \nhigh.'' This is as true for oil as it is for pork bellies and stocks. \nIt is as true for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as it is for any \nbusiness involving a commodity. Indeed, in a recent presentation to \nother countries on how to create and manage a strategic reserve, DOE \nitself states: ``The Key To A Successful Strategic Reserve Is Cost \nControl.'' DOE identifies the major cost elements of a strategic \nreserve as capital costs, maintenance costs, and oil acquisition costs. \nOnce constructed, the capital costs and the maintenance costs are \nlargely fixed. The main variable cost, therefore, is the cost of \nacquiring oil\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\nfor the SPR. DOE itself identifies for other countries the ``Lessons \nLearned to Control Oil Acquisition Costs'' as follows:\n\n       Let the markets determine your buying pattern.\n       Buy in weak markets.\n       Delay deliveries during strong markets.\n       Use your acquisition strategy to stabilize markets.\n\n  Prior to early 2002 DOE followed this sensible strategy when \nacquiring oil for the SPR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nexcerpts from this DOE presentation to other countries be entered into \nthe record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Part of this strategy--allowing deliveries to be deferred \nwhen prices were high and supplies tight--was spelled out in the \n``Business Procedures'' for the SPR program issued by DOE in January \n2002. The Business Procedures spell out how scheduled deliveries of oil \nto the SPR can be deferred. Generally, companies will ask for a \ndeferral when the market is tight so they can meet their supply \ncommitments to refiners who have an immediate need for the oil. DOE's \nprocedures provided that a company could be granted a deferral in \nreturn for additional barrels of oil to be delivered at the later date. \nDOE calculated the amount of additional oil that would be delivered by \ncomparing the market prices at the time of delivery was originally \nscheduled and at the time of the deferred delivery.\n  DOE's own documents state that deferrals of oil scheduled to be \ndelivered in 2001 provided an additional 3\\1/2\\ million barrels of oil \nfor the SPR at no additional cost to the Government. Deferrals of \ndeliveries scheduled for 1999 and 2000 had added another 3\\1/2\\ million \nbarrels. At an average cost of $25 per barrel, these deferrals added a \ntotal of 7 million barrels of oil to the Reserve, worth about $175 \nmillion, for no cost to the taxpayer. The SPR program projected:\n\n       The potential for savings to the Treasury if we continue to \n     follow this business model until the Reserve is full is \n     additional hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n  But in April 2002, DOE stopped allowing deferrals of scheduled \ndeliveries. Instead, DOE began to buy oil for the SPR without regard to \nthe cost of oil or the supply of oil, and refused requests for \ndeferrals. DOE has not explained the reason for abandoning its previous \npolicy.\n  In addition to losing the benefits from deferrals, both in terms of \noil gained and dollars saved, the abandonment of the previous policy is \ncosting taxpayers because DOE has been paying top dollar for the oil \nplaced into the SPR. Oil acquired for the SPR at $35 per barrel costs \nthe taxpayers $10 more per barrel than oil acquired at $25 per barrel. \nEven more modest savings per barrel add up to large savings over the \ncourse of the program. In 2002, DOE's SPR program calculated:\n\n       If the SPR can average down the price of oil it injects in \n     the Reserve by $1 per barrel between now and 2005, the U.S. \n     Treasury will be better off by $125 million, a direct \n     benefit.\n\n  But in these times of high gas prices, the DOE shift has another \nhighly negative effect.\n  Filling up the SPR affects the price of oil and gasoline. In a tight \nmarket, filling the SPR reduces the amount of oil in private sector \ninventories, which, because it reduces available supply, will then lead \nto increases in the price of oil and petroleum products, such as \ngasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and home heating oil. When prices are \nhigh and the market is tight, refiners will use up the oil in their \ninventories rather than purchase new oil in an expensive market, and \nwait for prices to fall before buying more oil. In a tight market, \ntherefore, the additional demand for oil created by the SPR program \nwill lead companies to take even more oil out of their own inventories \nto fill Government needs. In a tight market, the net result of the SPR \nprogram will not be any overall increase in domestic oil supplies, \nsince the amounts of oil added to the SPR will come at the expense of \noil in private sector inventories. These private commercial inventories \nare thereby reduced as a result of filling the SPR.\n\n  Oil prices are directly related to the supply of oil. When supplies \nare plentiful, prices fall. When supplies are scarce, prices rise. The \nsupply of oil is determined by the amount of oil produced in oil wells \naround the world and the amount of oil in storage. As either the amount \nof oil produced or the amount of oil in storage decreases, prices will \nincrease. In a tight market, therefore, when supplies are scarce, \nfilling the SPR will lead both to a decrease in private sector \ninventories and a corresponding increase in the price of oil.\n  The Department of Energy's own documents explain this effect as \nfollows:\n\n       If we look at the SPR from the perspective of daily supply \n     and demand, the SPR fill rates are inconsequential. The fill \n     rate is 100-170,000 barrels per day compared to world \n     production and consumption of 75 million barrels per day. \n     However, when OPEC countries are determined to maintain \n     discipline in their export quotas, the cumulative impact of \n     filling the SPR becomes more significant when compared to \n     U.S. and Atlantic basin inventories. Essentially, if the SPR \n     inventory grows, the OPEC does not accommodate that growth by \n     exporting more oil, the increase comes at the expense of \n     commercial inventories. Most analysts agree that oil prices \n     are directly correlated with inventories, and a drop of 20 \n     million barrels over a 6-month period can substantially \n     increase prices.\n\n  Oil companies doing business with the SPR program supported DOE's \nbusiness procedures in place prior to the spring of last year. These \nprocedures afforded the contractors the flexibility to re-schedule \ndeliveries to the SPR in accordance with market conditions. In exchange \nfor providing the oil companies with this flexibility, the U.S. \ngovernment was able to obtain additional barrels of oil for the SPR at \nno additional cost to the taxpayer. This enabled the Reserve to be \nfilled faster and at less cost than if contractors were not allowed to \nreschedule their deliveries. These procedures were a win-win for \ntaxpayers and the SPR.\n  And, of course, any increase in the price of oil will soon lead to an \nincrease in the price of the various petroleum products, including \ngasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, and jet fuel. Hence, the SPR \nprogram affects price of basic oil products for a wide variety of \nAmerican consumers and businesses.\n  The amendment I am offering today would encourage DOE to reinstate \nthese ``win-win'' procedures for filling the SPR.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na recent editorial critical of DOE's cost-blind approach to filling the \nSPR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. The editorial, in the Omaha World Herald, dated August 14, \nreads:\n       In general, we are strong supporters of keeping the \n     nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve at or near capacity in \n     case of a national emergency. However, there is such a thing \n     as bad timing. We believe the administration has been making \n     a mistake by refilling the reserve to the tune of about 11 \n     million barrels since the start of May. Commercial U.S. oil \n     stocks have been low for months. Filling the reserve just now \n     puts upward pressure on prices. . . . Washington should back \n     off until oil prices fall somewhat. Doing otherwise is \n     costing the Treasury unnecessarily and is punishing motorists \n     during summer vacation driving time.\n\n  Under our amendment DOE would retain the complete discretion to \ndetermine the pace and schedule for filling the SPR. However, DOE would \nbe required to issue procedures to guide this discretion, and would be \nrequired to consider how to maximize our national energy security and \nminimize costs to the taxpayers while filling the SPR. If implemented \nproperly, such procedures can promote our national energy security, \nsave taxpayers money, and lower oil and gasoline prices for consumers.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nProceedings of APEC Energy Security Initiative Workshop on Elements of \n  Energy Security Policy in the Context of Petroleum, Amari Watergate \n            Hotel, Bangkok, Thailand, September 14-15, 2001\n\n\n asia-pacific economic cooperation, energy working group, clean fossil \n                         energy experts' group\n\n       Jointly Organized by: Department of Industry, Science and \n     Resource (ISR), Australia; The Institute of Energy Economics, \n     Japan (IEEJ), Japan; Ministry of Commerce, Industry & Energy \n     (MOCIE), Republic of Korea; Ministry of Energy, Mexico; \n     National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), Thailand; and \n     Department of Energy (DOE), United States.\n       Supported by: Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and \n     Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Japan\n\n\n                      strategic petroleum reserve\n\n       APEC Workshop on Energy Security Policy: John Shages.\n\n[[Page S11810]]\n\n      united states policy on responding to oil supply disruptions\n\n       The policy of the United States regarding oil supply \n     disruptions is to rely on market forces to allocate supply, \n     and to ordinarily supplement supply by the early drawdown of \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large volumes and in \n     coordination with our allies and trading partners.\n\n\n                critical elements to justify a drawdown\n\n       A Disruption Event.\n       Evidence of Supply Stress.\n       A Price Spike.\n\n\n       the key to a successful strategic reserve is cost control\n\n       The benefits come with a drawdown--but the number and \n     extent of futures disruptions is unknown.\n       Measuring the degree of damage from a disruption, and the \n     consequent benefits of a petroleum reserve, to an individual \n     economy is an uncertain science.\n       Cost is the easiest aspect to control and has the highest \n     probability of making the Reserve cost beneficial.\n\n\n                          major cost elements\n\n       Capital Costs--Including land, facilities, and logistics \n     systems.\n       Maintenance Costs.\n       Oil Acquisition Costs.\n\n\n                             capital costs\n\n       Dependent on location.\n       Technology and type of storage facilities.\n       Refer to the 1999 APERC Study supported by conceptual \n     designs and cost estimates from PBKBB, Inc.\n\n\n            lessons learned to control oil acquisition costs\n\n       Let the markets determine your buying pattern.\n       Buy in weak markets.\n       Delay deliveries during strong markets.\n       Use your acquisition strategy to stabilize markets.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald, Aug. 14, 2003]\n\n Oil's Not Well--Filling the Strategic Reserve Is a Good Idea--But Not \n                               Right Now.\n\n       In general, we are strong supporters of keeping the \n     nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve at or near capacity in \n     case of a national emergency.

Meanwhile, the strategic \n     reserve is at 84 percent of capacity. This seems to us a \n     comfortable level.\n       Washington should back off until oil prices fall somewhat. \n     Doing otherwise is costing the Treasury unnecessarily and is \n     punishing motorists during summer vacation driving time.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join the ranking member \nof the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator Levin, \nin offering an amendment that would require the U.S. Department of \nEnergy to develop and maintain cost-effective procedures to fill the \nnation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The amendment simply requires the \nDepartment of Energy to publish procedures for obtaining oil for the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve in a manner that maximizes supplies, \nminimizes costs, and is consistent with national security. The \namendment would give the Department of Energy 180 days to publish these \nprocedures and would allow an opportunity for public comment prior to \nfinal publication.\n  Two years ago, Senator Carl Levin, who at the time was chairman of \nthe Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, initiated an \ninvestigation into gas prices in the United States. Part-way through \nthis effort he expanded the investigation to include analysis of \nDepartment of Energy policies with respect to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. Last year, I joined Senator Levin in requesting information \nfrom the Department of Energy on the impacts of filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve on crude oil prices.\n  In March of this year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nreleased a report which described the findings of the investigation. \nAmong other things, the Committee found that inconsistent Department of \nEnergy policies had led to filling the reserve during tight market \nconditions. The Committee found that this action had increased oil \nprices, hurt U.S. consumers, and increased the cost to taxpayers.\n  The Department of Energy should adopt procedures to ensure that oil \npurchases for the SPR minimize the economic impact on consumers. The \nDepartment of Energy needs to take full advantage of techniques such as \ndeferred payments, use of the futures market, and careful cost-benefit \nanalysis in order to lessen the impact of oil purchases on consumers. \nAlthough the Department has used all of these policies on occasion, it \nshould do so consistently.\n  The United States has the ability to partially mitigate dramatic \nspikes in gas prices, if we properly use and maintain our domestic \nreserve. In fact, it is our duty to do so, to ease the economic impact \nthat drastically rising gas prices have on Americans who need to fill \ntheir tanks in order to do their jobs, buy their groceries, and drive \ntheir kids to school.\n  Our amendment would ensure that price and market impact are top \nconsiderations in managing this vital domestic emergency oil supply. It \nwould give the Department of Energy an opportunity to focus increased \nattention on its policies and procedures for filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, with particular regard to the effect of its policies \non gas prices and oil markets. I ask my colleagues to join Senator \nLevin and me in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1750) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk, as I do quite \nfrequently, about the number of unrequested, unauthorized, and \nlocality-specific earmarks contained in this bill. Fortunately, this \nyear's Interior appropriations bill does not contain as many pork \nprojects as the bill the Senate passed last year. This year's bill has \nover $403 million in porkbarrel projects. Last year's had $429 million, \nso I guess there is a $26 million improvement. I guess I should be \ngrateful for this apparent savings, but I do not see this as evidence \nof tremendous fiscal restraint.\n  Citizens Against Government Waste, a nationally recognized, well-\nrespected, nonpartisan government watchdog organization found that in \nfiscal year 2003, the Appropriations Committee stuck 9,362 projects \ninto the 13 annual appropriations bills, an increase of over 12 percent \nfrom the previous year's total of 8,341. A further note: in the last 2 \nyears the total number of projects has increased by some 48 percent.\n  I have compiled a 21-page list of 332 objectionable provisions \ncontained within this bill, totaling $423 million. I will post the full \nlist on my official Senate Web site.\n  Let me just highlight some of the more egregious projects in this \nbill: An earmark for $4 million for the construction, renovation, and \nfurnishing and demolition or removal of buildings at National Energy \nTechnology Laboratory facilities in Morgantown, WV, and Pittsburg, PA; \n$15 million for alcohol control enforcement, prevention, treatment, \nsobriety and wellness, and education in Alaska, distributed in lump sum \npayments to various entities; one of our old favorites, $1 million \nabove the request to continue work at the National Center for \nEcologically-Based Noxious Weed Management at Montana State \nUniversity--they got an extra $1 million; $500,000 for continued \nfunding of the Idaho Sage Grouse Management Plan through the Idaho \nOffice of Species Conservation; $2 million above the budget request of \nthe President for Atlantic salmon recovery activities; $900,000 above \nthe budget request for Eider Duck recovery work by the Alaska SeaLife \nCenter; $1.2 million above the budget request for the Wolf Recovery \nProgram in the State of\n\n[[Page S11811]]\n\nIdaho; $1.4 million for the Washington State Regional Salmon \nEnhancement; $200,000 for bald eagle restoration work performed in \ncooperation with the Vermont National Heritage Partners Program; \n$500,000 for the Native Roadside Vegetation Center at the University of \nNorthern Idaho; $700,000 for invasive species control in Hawaii; \n$500,000 for the Delaware Bay Oyster Revitalization Project in the \nStates of Delaware and New Jersey; $500,000 for salmon restoration work \nin Puget Sound in cooperation with the Seattle Art Museum--the Seattle \nArt Museum is going to work in cooperation with Puget Sound for salmon \nrestoration--$750,000 for ferret reintroduction in the Rosebud Sioux \ntribal lands; $1.5 million for the Bitter Lake, NM, Visitors Center--\nthat is sweet--$1 million for Kenai, AK, for cabins, trails, and \ncampgrounds; $3 million for the Kodiak, AK, Visitors Center--I can tell \nyou that Alaska is doing very well by doing good--$2.1 million for the \nOhio River Islands, WV, Visitors Center and miscellaneous improvements; \n$525,000 for the Okefenokee Concession Facility in Georgia; $300,000 \nfor the Garrison Dam, ND, fishpond improvements; $850,000 for the \nSavannah, GA, Visitors Center--we are big on visitors centers in this \nparticular bill--$2 million for the World Birding Center in Texas; $3 \nmillion for the Abraham Lincoln Library in Illinois; $500,000 to design \na visitors center on Assateague Island in Maryland; $1.1 million to \nrehabilitate off-road vehicle trails in Big Cypress National Park in \nFlorida; $1.7 million to rehabilitate General Grant's tomb in New \nYork--I wonder if we should ascertain whether General Grant is actually \nthere before we rehabilitate his tomb--$3 million for a visitors center \nin the Grand Teton National Park; $7.4 million for rehabilitation of \nthe Horace Albright Training Center in Arizona. I am told that the \nHorace Albright Training Center in Arizona is a place near the bottom \nof the Grand Canyon where park personnel are trained.\n\n  The committee report directs 26 separate unrequested land \nacquisitions under the Fish and Wildlife Service totaling nearly $35 \nmillion.\n  It is the process that I have a problem with. The committee \neffectively usurps the power of the authorizing committee and acts as \none all-powerful funding machine. Projects are often funded with little \nor no background study and are approved simply after being requested by \na fellow Member.\n  As all my colleagues know, the Congressional Budget Office recently \nprojected a potentially debilitating $480 billion deficit for 2004 and \nthe President has asked for additional appropriations of $87 billion \nfor the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and everybody is \nasking: Where is the money coming from? After years of unchecked and \nquestionable spending, we are in the unfortunate position of facing \ncritical budget constraints that will hamper our ability to fully fund \nnecessary programs. Instead, we are cutting deep into the taxpayers' \npockets once again by expecting them to shell out more than $403 \nmillion in porkbarrel spending included in this bill.\n  I think at some point the President of the United States is going to \nhave to veto one of these bills and demand that this unnecessary, \nunwarranted, unauthorized, and unrequested spending be removed because \nwe really are talking about real money.\n  I understand we are going to have a voice vote on final passage of \nthis bill. I would be recorded as voting no if there were a recorded \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1739\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I call for the regular order, and I \nbelieve my amendment is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to speak to this \namendment a couple of times, so I will not belabor it. I know we are \ngetting close to the end of the debate.\n  I compliment the distinguished manager of the bill and ranking member \nfor a job well done on the bill.\n  This amendment recognizes two things. It recognizes, first, when it \ncomes to trust responsibility and the very vexing problems we have had \nin carrying out trust responsibility with all Indian tribes, that we \nare a long way from any implementation of that responsibility today. \nWhat efforts have been made in trying to establish some mechanism for \ncarrying out those responsibilities in a fair and meaningful way are \nyet to be found. In fact, if anything, we are mired more than we have \nbeen in a long time.\n  There is a need to create a better partnership with all tribal \ngovernments, and, as a result of that need for greater partnership, a \nrecognition that until we have meaningful trust responsibility in \npolicy and in law, to put an infrastructure in place which is \nsupposedly designed to implement a policy that doesn't exist is \npremature. In fact, it sends all the wrong messages about what the \nintention of the BIA, the Congress, or this administration is with \nregard to that responsibility in the first place.\n  The National Congress of American Indians has written to Congress \nasking Congress not to fund the implementation of the policy today \nbecause it is premature. Virtually every national Indian organization \nhas pleaded with the Congress to recognize the importance of tribal \nsovereignty and tribal partnership with their government and has asked \nus not to implement the policy.\n  That is the first point I would make with this amendment. The second \npoint is equally as important.\n  We have, as I said this morning, an extraordinary deficiency in \nhealth care. We are underfunded by about $2.9 billion in health care \nfunding on reservations today, with regard to IHS clinical services \nalone. As a result of that underfunding, the per capita commitment to \nIndian health care today is about $1,900. That is half of what our per \ncapita commitment is today for Federal prisoners' health care. In other \nwords, an Indian child on a reservation gets half the commitment \nthrough the Federal Government that a prisoner does regardless of that \nprisoner's crime in the Federal system today.\n  What I simply am proposing with this amendment is that we take part \nof the money allocated for the implementation of this trust \nresponsibility effort that is now underway in the BIA and shift it over \nto where it can do the most good; that is, in health care. We need \nevery dollar we can get in health care, and $79 million--which is what \nthis amendment provides--will go at least a little ways.\n  Since we weren't able to pass the amendment offering $292 million for \nIHS clinical services, $79 million transferred to Indian health care \nfrom the trust fund budget that is within the BIA would at least send \nthe right message to NCAI and to all of the Native American \norganizations that we listen, that we understand, and that this is \nimportant to us as well.\n  Some will argue that to do so would actually prevent us from cutting \nchecks to allottees. If this bill were enacted today, the Office of \nSpecial Trustee would receive $143 million, the same as last year. So \nwe would have the same amount of money for allottees through the Office \nof Special Trustee that we had in the last fiscal year. The system that \ncuts the checks--the Trust Fund Accounting System--would not be \naffected. That costs approximately $14 million. According to the \nPresident's budget request, my amendment would still allow $32 million \nin the Operation and Support Account. In the Operation and Support \nAccount we strike $20 million. We leave $32 million.\n  There is a $6 million reduction in the trust accountability account. \nWe leave $51 million. We take $15 million from field operations and \nstill leave $24 million. We take $38 million from the historical \naccounting fund and we still leave $27 million. The total amount \navailable for the Office of Special Trustee under this amendment is \n$143 million.\n  This is our last opportunity on this bill to do something worthwhile, \nto recognize we have failed to meet our obligations in addressing the \ncrisis we have in health care on reservations in the country today and \nto recognize, as well, the Office of the Special Trustee, as we \nconsider our challenges as well as our responsibilities in carrying out \nthe intent and the spirit of the treaty obligations we have not met and \nthat will not be met under this bill.\n  Let's use this money where it can do the most good. Let's shift it \nout of the Office of Special Trustee and into health care. I hope my \ncolleagues on\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle could support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the United States of America has been struggling to \nstrike the correct Indian policy for literally 200 years. Since the \ndays of the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark exploration, we \nhave attempted to find a policy that was both fair to Native people and \nyet, at the same time, allowed for the expansion and progress of the \nUnited States. That search continues today.\n  From the treaties of the mid-1800s, to the Dawes Act of 1887, which \nsought to break up tribal land, to the Indian Reorganization Act of \n1934, which sought to undo the damage of the Dawes Act, the United \nStates has vacillated on Indian policy. From a policy of termination to \nthe Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, we \nhave struggled. In more recent times, through several administrations \nof both parties, the United States has been committed to honoring its \ntreaty obligations and interacting with Indian tribes on a government-\nto-government basis.\n  Through a government-to-government policy, our goal is to respect the \nintegrity of tribal governments and allow them to function with greater \nautonomy. Tribal governments are administering more and more programs \nand are being looked to for the provision of local services.\n  President Bush, discussing his administration's policy on Indian \naffairs had this to say:\n\n       To enhance our efforts to help Indian nations be self-\n     governing, self-supporting, and self-reliant, my \n     Administration will continue to honor tribal sovereignty by \n     working on a government-to-government basis with American \n     Indians and Alaska Natives. We will honor the rights of \n     Indian tribes and work to protect and enhance tribal \n     resources.\n\n  With that background in mind, the question before the Senate is \nwhether or not we should appropriate money to reorganize the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs when the reorganization plan put forward by the \nDepartment of Interior is opposed by Indian tribes all across the \ncountry. I think that the answer is clearly ``no.''\n  What does the phrase ``government-to-government'' mean if we are \ngoing to ignore the opinion of tribal leaders on a question of unique \nimportance to Indian people? What does it say if we pay no heed to \ntribal leaders on how to organize the Bureau of Indian Affairs? I ask \nmy colleagues who have an Indian reservation in their State, how many \nof you have said you are committed to government-to-government \nrelations between the United States and Indian tribes?\n  The tribal Chairs in South Dakota are against the proposed BIA \nreorganization plan. The senior Chairman in South Dakota, Chairman Mike \nJandreau of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, has been a national leader on \nthis subject. The National Congress of American Indians has written to \nCongress asking us not to fund the reorganization. If a government-to-\ngovernment policy means anything, then Congress should respect these \ntribal leaders, not fund the reorganization, and transfer the proposed \nfunding to higher priorities, health care first and foremost.\n  I am therefore proposing that we transfer $79 million from accounts \nthat would fund a reorganization of the Department of Interior, Bureau \nof Indian Affairs, to increase funding for Indian health programs.\n  The health care statistics on the reservations of South Dakota, and \nthroughout the country, are closer to the statistics of the developing \nThird World than they are to the national statistics for the United \nStates. Infant mortality and diabetes rates on the reservations far \nexceed that of the rest of the Nation; every health barometer calls out \nfor prompt intervention and assistance.\n  There is little disagreement that the Department's stewardship of \nIndian trust funds has been a colossal and longstanding failure. For \nover 100 years, the Department of Interior has served as the trustee \nfor the proceeds from the leasing of oil, gas, land and mineral rights \non Indian land. Many billions of dollars are at stake. Money that is \ndesperately needed to address basic human needs cannot be accounted for \nand distributed.\n  But rather than get directly at the underlying problem, the \nDepartment continues to focus on reorganization in order to demonstrate \nto the tribes, Congress, and the Court that something is happening and \nthat progress is being made. The money in the trust fund belongs to the \ntribes and its enrolled members.\n  Congress should not appropriate one more dollar for reorganization of \nthe BIA until the tribes tell us they support the reorganization plan \nand, most importantly, that the reorganization plan will adequately \naddress the mismanagement of the trust fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we pretty much laid out the facts in this \ndebate. There is no question about the Indian Health Service. I \ncompletely agree with my friend from South Dakota.\n  There are a couple of points I make. If his amendment is successful, \nit has great ramifications regarding the amount of money going to \nindividual Native Americans, to the tribes, and to trust accounts this \nyear. This transfer of funds shuts down the operation of this \nhistorical accounting procedure. This is a problem that has been \nbuilding for the last 10 or 15 years. In fact, it got so bad under the \nlast administration, the court finally held the Department of Interior \nin contempt because they were not forthcoming with the figures. Why? \nBecause there was no way to do it. There was no way to present the \ncourt with any actual figures to settle the litigation.\n  The ramifications, if we shut this down: South Dakota alone has \n35,714 open accounts. Their annual disbursement to those accounts now \nunder present conditions is over $84 million; Oklahoma, $90 million; my \nhome State, $87 million; $101 million, the State of Washington. That \nmoney will not be mailed this year.\n  On this old reorganization--and we have heard a lot of talk about \nwhere is it going, what policy shall we have--the policy is being \ndictated by the courts. Maybe the policy is we should be on historical \naccounting so we know accurately what is owed and what is not.\n  Prior to implementing a major restructuring of the Department's \nIndian trust functions, Interior engaged in the most extensive \nconsultation in history by senior Department officials with the Indian \ntribes. Before the new organization was developed, the Department \nofficials held over 45 meetings with tribal leaders throughout the \nUnited States, testified at several congressional hearings during the \nconsultation process, and obtained the approval of the House and \nconcurrence of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  What we are talking about is a problem being caused mainly because we \nstuck our head in the sand and would not face reality when dealing with \nthis. It could be huge. Some plaintiffs say it could go as high as $176 \nbillion. I don't think we are ready to do that just now.\n  Even if you disagree with the accounting procedure, the Department, \nregardless of those procedures, the court findings, will be required to \nimplement the court decision should it be made. This amendment will \nensure no money is there for implementation.\n\n  Now I will focus on IHS for a moment. We have already been down that \nparticular road. We have added money to IHS the last 5 years. We \ncontinue to do so. Under the leadership of Senator Domenici and also \nSenator Daschle of South Dakota and a lot of Members who live in Indian \ncountry, we have worked very hard to pump up those accounts, \nunderstanding that we have situations on Indian reservations that are \ncharacteristic of their problems.\n  This amendment should not pass. It should not pass. It should allow \nthe process to go forward and settle this problem that has been \ncompletely ignored over the past 10 or 15 years.\n  I hope the Senators will take a look at this. This is the first \nadministration that has stepped up and said we have to do something \nabout it; we have to address it. Not only are we under the cloud of \nlitigation but it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do \nfor our individuals. It is the right thing to do for our tribal \ngovernments, tribes, and for their trust funds. It is the right thing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have great admiration and respect for \nthe\n\n[[Page S11813]]\n\nSenator from Montana. I ask him, if it is the right thing to do, why \ndid we exempt the tribes from Montana from this very provision, this \nvery requirement? Section 134 of the bill exempts certain tribes. All \nof those tribes in Montana are exempt.\n  We are simply saying, if the exemption is good enough for Montana, it \nought to be good enough for the rest of the country, as well. I start \nwith that. It cannot be too good or we would include Montana. But we do \nnot. That is an issue that ought to be clarified.\n  I also simply say, if it is true these allottees are not going to \nreceive income as a result of the passage of this amendment, how is it \npossible that virtually every tribal leader in the country, virtually \nevery Indian organization in the country, has expressed support for the \namendment? Would they not be concerned for the allottees? Would they \nnot be concerned about the economic impact this would have? The fact \nis, they support the amendment. The fact is, they know we have money in \nthis bill with this amendment that allows at least some of these \nresponsibilities to be carried forward.\n  Why would we ever implement a bureaucratic response to a policy that \nis yet to be written, that is yet to be confirmed and acknowledged and \nauthorized by the courts? Why would we put the organization in place \nbefore we know what the responsibilities are? That is what we ask with \nthis amendment.\n  We have debated it now on several occasions. I am not going to \nconvince the Senator from Montana, even though he looks out for his \nState, and I don't blame him for doing so. I want the same opportunity \nto look out for the rest of the country and my State, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the exemption he was talking about for \nMontana, the exemption is the tribes are self-governance tribes. They \nall have clean audits. They are ready. It is those here in Washington \nwho are not. And we cannot stop the process if we are to be fair to \neverybody in Indian country.\n  We have made our points. I am ready to vote if the distinguished \nminority leader is ready to vote. I know one thing, nobody has greater \npassion for this issue and for his State than my good friend from South \nDakota. But I feel we have kept our head in the sand too long. There \nhas to be some finality to it. We cannot short-circuit the system \nbefore it is completed.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), \nthe Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``Yea.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 362 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Dodd\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n  The amendment (No. 1739), as further modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we will have our two managers' packages and \nthen final passage. We will have the packages ready in about 5 or 10 \nminutes. That is the last vote of the evening, I assume. The leader \nwill be here soon. He will make that announcement.\n  In the meantime, I thank my good friend from North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan, for working on this bill because I think we did it in record \ntime this year. We had some issues that had to be dealt with and we \ndealt with them. We had a good, spirited debate. I thank all Senators \nfor their cooperation on this piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, too, thank my colleague, Senator \nBurns. This is a very significant piece of legislation. We have had \nexcellent cooperation. I also thank the staff, if I might: Peter \nKiefhaber, Brooke Livingston, and, of course, the majority staff: Bruce \nEvans, Ginny James, Steve Fonnesbeck, and also Ryan Thomas.\n  The Interior bill has, on occasion, been a bill that has taken a long \ntime to move through the floor in some years. Other years, it has moved \nrather quickly. I think we have had a good discussion on some very \nimportant issues. I appreciate the work of my colleague from Montana. I \nbelieve we have a couple of managers' packages, and then I think we \nwill have an opportunity to voice vote final. There is one additional \namendment as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. First of all, I congratulate the managers. The bill has \nbeen handled perfectly. It allows us to continue on in the \nappropriations process in an orderly manner. It allows adequate and \ngood time for debate and discussion. I congratulate them.\n  As the managers just said, there are a couple of packages being \nworked on now. Then we will have final passage by voice vote. Tonight \nthere will be no more rollcall votes. The exact times will be announced \nlater tonight, but we plan on going to DC appropriations at 10:30 \ntomorrow morning. The specific times in terms of morning business and \nall will be announced later. I congratulate the managers and all our \ncolleagues on making tremendous progress in the overall appropriations \nprocess. I appreciate everybody's cooperation and patience on these \nvery important bills.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have the first package of amendments. \nThey have been agreed to on both sides of the aisle. This is in package \nNo. 1, for identification for my good friend from North Dakota.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we should momentarily come to the floor \nwith the final managers' package and wrap up this bill and I think we \nwill have a voice vote at the end. I did want to make a couple of \ncomments while we were waiting for the final pieces of this \nappropriations bill.\n  Earlier today I visited just a bit about the issue of reconstruction \nin the country of Iraq. Today we were visited in our Democratic caucus \nby Ambassador Bremer who just returned from Iraq. He appeared before \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday, before our caucus today. \nHe talked about the request of $87 billion, both for military \nappropriations for our defense establishment--that is appropriations of \nabout $60 billion necessary for the efforts we are making in the \ncountry of Iraq--and, in addition to that, there is about slightly more \nthan $20 billion for reconstruction in Iraq.\n  I want to make the point that first I think every dollar requested \nfor the military could, should, and I believe will be appropriated \nquickly to support the efforts of our troops. This Congress has to \nunderstand when we ask our sons and daughters to go to war and to \ncommit themselves for the mission this country asks of them, we must \nsupport them with appropriations.\n  The second issue, the reconstruction in Iraq that is necessary, is a \ndifferent and an interesting problem. Should the American taxpayer pay \nfor the reconstruction of Iraq? First of all, we did not target Iraq \ninfrastructure. Shock and Awe was a campaign that began with smart \nbombs and smart weapons. It did not target their electric grid. It did \nnot target their dams. It did not target their roads. It did not target \nthe infrastructure of Iraq. The destruction of the infrastructure of \nIraq has come from a guerrilla insurgent movement inside Iraq, but it \nhas not come from American military force. So the question is, who \nshould provide the $20-plus billion for reconstruction of Iraq?\n\n  Let me make a point about that. Iraq is a country of 24 million \npeople sitting\n\n[[Page S11815]]\n\non sandy soil that contains the second largest reserves of oil in the \nworld, the second largest reserves in the world next to Saudi Arabia. \nIt is estimated that by next July the Iraqi oil wells will be producing \naround 3 million barrels per day. It is also estimated at that level \nthe net export value of Iraqi oil will be about $16 billion a year. So \nover the next 10 years the Iraqi oil revenues should produce about $160 \nbillion.\n  In addition to that, I asked Ambassador Bremer what do you intend to \ndo with respect to the Iraqi oil revenue and what do you intend to do \nwith respect to debts that are owed to other countries from the country \nof Iraq? The reason I ask that question is, I said: Why don't you use \nIraqi oil to reconstruct Iraq? It seems to me logical you would do \nthat.\n  He said, We can't do that because Iraq owes a great deal of money. It \nhas great debt.\n  I said, Who holds the debt?\n  Yesterday during the Appropriations Committee hearing, he said \nRussia--Iraq owes Russia money, it owes France money, and Germany \nmoney.\n  Since yesterday I have gotten more information about that. It turns \nout the largest holders of Iraq debt are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It is \nvery interesting to me: Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the largest holders of \ndebt, according to published reports, from the Iraqi government.\n  So the Iraqi government owes Kuwait and the Saudis perhaps $50 \nbillion. Who is the Iraqi government? Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein \nobligated the Iraqi government, the Iraqi people, to pay certain moneys \nto other countries for the debts incurred. But Saddam Hussein does not \nexist; his government is gone. So who should repay that debt? \nAmbassador Bremer says the American taxpayer should repay that debt. I \ndon't think so. I think what ought to happen is you ought to \ncollateralize or securitize the next 10 years of Iraqi oil. You can \neasily provide the resources for the reconstruction in Iraq from the \noil that will be pumped from the sands of Iraq in the next 10 years. \nIraqi oil ought to be used to pay for the reconstruction in the country \nof Iraq.\n  With respect to the debt Ambassador Bremer says under international \nobligations is owed by the country of Iraq to other countries, it seems \nto me there is a term called debt forgiveness. I don't know how you say \nto the Saudis and the Kuwaitis: You were owed money by Iraq. Go find \nSaddam Hussein and collect it. I don't know quite how you say that, but \nthere must be a way of saying that. Go find Saddam Hussein and try to \ncollect that debt. That is who obligated that debt on behalf of the \nIraqi people.\n  It seems to me, the first thing we ought to do is say this debt that \noverhangs the people of Iraq ought to be negotiated down, first and \nforemost. Second, it seems to me we ought to say we will provide all \nthe money that is requested, first for the military side of the request \nfor the appropriations the President asked for, and second, we will \nprovide the money, because we should, with respect to reconstruction. \nBut it will not be American taxpayers' money. We will provide the \nmechanism by which we monetize or rather collateralize or securitize \nthe oil revenues that we pump from under the sands of Iraq over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Ambassador Bremer says that will be up to 3 million barrels per day \nby next July. At 3 million barrels per day you produce about $20 \nbillion a year, about $4 billion of which is going to be needed for \nIraqi oil needs, the rest of which is available for export. That is $16 \nbillion of export earnings. That is the way you reinvest in Iraq. \nInvest in Iraq infrastructure with oil revenue from Iraq.\n  Ambassador Bremer said one other thing that was interesting to me. He \nsaid, by the way, we have just put together a tax structure in Iraq. I \nmight point out that a nonoil state, that is a nation that doesn't have \noil reserves, and that's a good many nations around the world, they put \ntogether a revenue structure, a tax system by which they raise the \nmoney to build the schools, to build the roads, to maintain the \nelectric grid. They put together a tax system to do that.\n  They have just put together a new tax system in the country of Iraq \nand Ambassador Bremer pointed out yesterday we have a new tax system. \nApparently that is designed to produce the revenue to run the \nGovernment of Iraq. He said the top income tax rate is 15 percent.\n  I am thinking to myself, so those at the highest income levels in \nIraq--and there are some very high income-earners in Iraq--will pay a \n15 percent tax and then American taxpayers at the highest level will \npay a 39 percent tax and we should pay a 39 percent tax so we can send \nmoney to the Government of Iraq so the Government of Iraq can send \nmoney to the Saudis and the Kuwaitis to satisfy past debt \nobligations while the Iraqi citizens at the top of the income level are \npaying 15 percent income tax. I don't think so. That is not a construct \nthat makes much sense to me.\n\n  I am not saying by all of this that we don't have obligations--we \ndo--or that we don't have a priority interest in dealing with the \nmilitary and the nonmilitary needs in Iraq. We do. The question is not \nwhether; it is how.\n  My hope is we will bifurcate this request for appropriations of $87 \nmillion, and take the military side first and pass that. I support all \nof that. We ought to move that through this Congress quickly.\n  Second, we ought to work with Ambassador Bremer and others and \ndescribe to those folks how we want to reconstruct Iraq to rebuild the \ninfrastructure.\n  Let me describe what they are talking about. It is restoring \nmarshland, building seven communities with 3,500 new homes, \nrehabilitating 1,000 schools, developing a telecommunications system. \nNeed I go on?\n  Is the reconstruction of Iraq necessary in which to build a market \nsystem and a healthy economy? Perhaps. Should it be done? Sure. With \nwhose money? Who pays the bill?\n  In this case, it makes no sense to me for us to say the American \ntaxpayer should foot that bill for reconstruction. It makes eminent \ngood sense, in my judgment, for us to say we will help, as we already \nhave, to develop the central banking system of Iraq, develop the \neconomy that is now emerging in Iraq, and through that process \nsecuritize future Iraqi oil revenues. As I see it, that is $320 billion \nin revenues over the next 20 years. It just seems to me that $320 \nbillion in 20 years provides the collateral to easily provide the \nupfront funds--not a grant from the American taxpayer, but a loan in \nthe form of a security document securitizing or collateralizing future \noil production in Iraq.\n  We will have a lot of discussion about this. I suspect some will say \nif you do not believe in every single sentence or every punctuation \nmark in the President's request that somehow you are not thinking \nsquarely. I really believe the piece we ought to describe in some great \ndetail here and the piece we ought to debate is the issue of who should \npay for the reconstruction of Iraq--not the issue of security. We need \nto do that. Not the issue of military needs; we need to do that, and \nnow. But we need to have a good, strong debate here in this Congress \nabout how to provide the funds for the reconstruction that is being \nproposed in Iraq. I for one come down on the side of saying let us have \nIraqi oil produce the revenues to invest in Iraq. That is what makes \ngood sense to me.\n  For the record, let me describe the circumstances with Iraqi debt. \nThe reason I do this is because Ambassador Bremer says that is why they \npropose the American taxpayer pay the money for Iraqi reconstruction \nrather than have Iraqi oil do it. The World Bank Debtor Reporting \nSystem is where you find the evidence of which countries have how much \ndebt. Saddam Hussein's Iraq was one of the few countries that did not \nreport its debt statistics to the World Bank Debtor Reporting System. \nSo you have to rely on other pieces of information.\n  The best we can determine, the biggest lenders to Saddam Hussein were \nFrance, Germany, Gulf states, Japan, Kuwait, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. \nOf those, the largest was Saudi Arabia, then Kuwait, and Russia a close \nthird. All the other Gulf states together were substantial--close to \n$30 billion, France and Germany in the $6 billion range.\n\n  I think it is really important to ask the question. If you are saying \nwe can't use Iraqi oil to reconstruct Iraq because Iraq has all of \nthese debts Saddam Hussein apparently incurred, then\n\n[[Page S11816]]\n\nhow do you tell countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and how do \nyou tell them quickly, by the way, that the debt you have, that paper \nyou hold, is the debt you incurred in negotiations with Saddam Hussein. \nWe are sorry. He doesn't live here anymore. You might want to put that \npiece of paper somewhere where you have other things to collect which \nhave very little worth, then start over understanding that Iraqi oil \ncan be used to reconstruct the urgent needs that exist in the country \nof Iraq.\n  I will have more to say about this at some future point. Because \nAmbassador Bremer is here, I wanted to make that point. Let me also say \nthat I said to Ambassador Bremer we pray for his safety. He has a very \ndifficult job and dangerous job, as do the men and women who wear our \ncountry's uniform and who are in Iraq today and stationed in other \nparts of the world as well. We pray for their safety and thank them for \ntheir services to our country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This happens to be an amendment that \ncovers almost the core of the debate during this piece of legislation. \nThis has moneys which replace the moneys that were borrowed from all \nthe funds to fight fires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself and Mr. \n     Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 1768.\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, this amendment provides for $400 million \nunder consequential emergency conditions. It is not offset. We want to \nthank the administration and the folks down at OMB. We have been \nworking very hard with them. As this moves, we are asking that the \nForest Service and the Department of the Interior get out their pencils \nand give us the number. This number could go up slightly. It could go \ndown by the time the conference is over because that is where it will \nbe settled.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support this amendment. We have reviewed \nit. I am a cosponsor. I asked Senator Burns to include me as a \ncosponsor.\n  This really needs to be done. In fact, we need to do more than this. \nThis is what we can do at this moment and we will continue to work on \nthis in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1768) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might, while we are waiting, on this \nissue of fire and fire suppression, I know Senator Burns has spoken on \nthis floor at some length, and we have had a discussion in the \ncommittee. We have to really stop this process of underfunding these \naccounts at the start of the year. It is not a great surprise that we \nare going to have forest fires. I come from a State that doesn't have a \nlot of trees. But my colleague, Senator Burns, comes from a State that \nis full of trees.\n  In a good many States in this country, we have seen the devastation \nby massive forest fires. They cause a substantial amount of damage. The \namount of money that is required to deal with the issue of forest \nfirefighting and forest fire suppression is a very substantial amount \nof money. We know at the start of the year and in recent years that the \nmoney has not been requested which is going to be necessary. Then we \ncome later on in the year acting wide-eyed and surprised--not my \ncolleague from Montana. He never acts wide-eyed and surprised. But \nthere are some who walk around here acting like they have just been hit \nwith this huge surprise. It is not a surprise to us.\n  At the start of the year we need to ask OMB to request the money that \nis necessary, and we need the Congress to appropriate the money \nnecessary so we are not in this bind every single year.\n  The amendment we have just agreed to, the Burns amendment, is an \namendment that moves us in the direction of restoring the funding that \nhas been taken from other accounts. But it doesn't provide all the \nmoney necessary for that. We have much more to do in conference.\n  Senator Burns has done a remarkably good job in trying to fight with \nthose with whom you have to fight to get the resources. We will \ncontinue this fight in conference.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, you do not do anything by yourself. They \nsay you always like to be like a turtle; a turtle never gets anywhere \nunless he sticks his neck out. Some folks are proud of that. But if you \nfind one on the top of a fence post, he did not get there by himself.\n  I appreciate the support we have had from Senator Dorgan and his side \nof the aisle. It is something that needed doing. We are getting a \ndifferent fire nowadays. It has a different characteristic. It is \nhotter and more damaging. We have to deal with it and we have to pay \nfor it.\n  It is the people's land. It is the people's timber. It is the \npeople's place where they recreate, hunt, and fish. There is a lumber \nindustry that depends on the forest lands. This is a vital resource for \nthis country.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1776, 1725 as \n Modified, 1777, 1737, 1732 as Modified, 1778, 1779, 1743 as Modified, \n                1733, 1780, 1749, 1781 and 1782, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent to send to the desk the managers' \namendments to this bill and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations subcommittee for the fine work he has done \nputting together this bill. The bill includes substantial funding for \nprograms to conserve our Nation's treasured lands and resources, \nincluding $85 million for the forest legacy program; a program that \nmeans so much to my home State of Maine.\n  There is one Maine conservation project, however, that does not \nreceive funds through the Senate bill. It is the Downeast Lakes \nForestry Partnership, the goal of which is the sustainable conservation \nof 342,000 acres in Maine, including 78,800 acres of pristine lakes, \n54,000 acres of productive wetlands, 445 miles of unspoiled shoreline, \nand 342,000 acres of remote forestland. This important project, which \nenjoys widespread support in my State, including the support of the \nGovernor, is at a critical stage. But it requires Federal support in \nthe coming fiscal year to help bring the project to fruition.\n  I would therefore ask the chairman whether he will commit to doing \nall he can to consider funding the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership \nwhen this bill goes to conference?\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Maine for her comments and do \npledge to help find funds in conference for the Downeast Lakes Forestry \nPartnership. The Senator from Maine has been a tireless advocate for \nthis worthy project, and I know that she has suggested that it receive \nfunds from the Forest Service's National Forest System account, or the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Resource Management account. I will \nuse my best efforts to consider funding the Downeast Lakes project as \nthe Senator suggests.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your pledge of support, and \nfor the leadership you consistently demonstrate on conservation issues.\n\n\n                          land remote sensing\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Interior Appropriations bill includes \nfunding for the United States Geological Survey, USGS, to conduct land \nremote sensing. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleagues from Montana and North Dakota regarding this funding in the \nInterior Appropriations bill.\n  It is my understanding that a significant portion of the USGS mapping \nprogram budget comes from the sale of data collected from the Landsat 7 \nsatellite. Over the past several months, that satellite has been \nexperiencing problems that will severely hamper its ability to collect \nscientifically-useful data. Just last week, USGS determined that the \nproblem affecting the Landsat 7 satellite is permanent. While the USGS \nis working to develop a long-term solution to address this situation, \nit is clear that USGS will not be collecting the full amount of income \nfrom data sales originally planned for when the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee reported out the Interior Appropriations bill. As a result, \nUSGS will not be able to operate in accordance with the budget on which \nthis will is based.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Montana and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota if the Interior Subcommittee is aware of this problem and \nwilling to work with the United States Geological Survey to address \nthis issue during the conference with the House?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would respond that, yes, the subcommittee \nis aware of the problem affecting the Landsat 7 satellite, and we are \nwilling to work with USGS and our friend from South Dakota to address \nthis situation in conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I concur. The chairman is correct, and I, \ntoo, want to help ensure this situation is addressed in conference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from North Dakota for their cooperation and their clarification \nregarding this matter.\n\n\n                              national zoo\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President I want to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Interior Subcommittee concerning the \nfunding in this bill for our National Zoo.\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\n  I know that the chairman is very aware of the problems that have \nplagued our National Zoo over this last year. Many of these problems \nsimply relate to deteriorating physical conditions of the zoo. \nBuildings and other animal habitats are literally falling apart.\n  This crown jewel of the Smithsonian is actually at risk of losing its \naccreditation from the American Zoo and Aquarian Association. What a \nterrible message this would send to the American public that its \nnational zoo cannot even meet accreditation standards. We owe it to the \nAmerican people, the thousands of children who visit the zoo annually, \nto visitors from all over the world, and most importantly to the safety \nand protection of these wonderful animals to do all we can to restore \nthe conditions there to a safe and healthy environment.\n  I ask the chairman of the subcommittee, in conference with the House \non this bill will you work to provide a level of funding that will once \nagain restore this wonderful institution to the level befitting of \nbeing a ``national'' zoo and to help maintain its accreditation?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes, I can assure the leader that I am very aware of the \nphysical problems that are now plaguing our National Zoo, and I commit \nto him that I will work in conference to help address the funding needs \nof that institution to help maintain its accreditation. I agree that \nour National Zoo is a symbol of this Capitol City, and more importantly \nof this country, and we must not let it lose that accreditation.\n\n\n                   Little Rock Audubon Nature Center\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I come to the floor today to ask my colleagues to join me \nin supporting Federal funding for the Little Rock Audubon Nature \nCenter. The Little Rock Audubon Nature Center is a collaborative \nprivate-public effort to provide tools and services to historically \nunderserved children. Using the prestige of the Audubon Society's \nreputation, this project will pull together all stakeholders to promote \nnational science and math goals, environmental education, and wildlife \nobservation.\n  This isn't the nature center we grew up with. This is a new concept \nthat creates a place to learn math, science, and other academic \nsubjects in a nurturing environment reinforced by a hands-on, out-of-\ndoors experiences. This is a chance to support what our children learn \nin the classroom and in the textbooks with stimulating reality. This \nmodel of learning will stoke our children's curiosity and provoke them \nto start asking the questions all great thinkers pose: Why does this \nwork? How can that happen? What makes this possible?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I join my friend and colleague in supporting this \nproject. I believe this will be a place that junior high and high \nschool kids will truly enjoy and where they can be engaged. According \nto the Pew Foundation, academic achievement, student engagement, and \nteacher satisfaction all improve significantly when schools link \nacademics with hands-on study of the surrounding environment and \ncommunity and that is exactly what the Little Rock Audubon Nature \nCenter will do.\n  The Nature Center site is just a 15-minute school bus ride from 50 \nschools in southeast Little Rock, giving it the ability to serve as an \noutdoor classroom for thousands of school children.\n  In short, this is a kid-friendly, cost-effective approach to reaching \nthe underserved and teaching science and math. This is the kind of \nproject this body must support to help our kids meet the challenges of \nthe future.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Given current budget constraints, it is more important \nthan even to use scarce resources wisely and I rise today to provide my \ncolleagues with not only the numerous benefits associated with this \ninnovative approach to educating our children, but also the costs. \nSpecifically, I am seeking an appropriation of $1.2 million for the \nproject but $1.2 million that will be leveraged by private funding on a \nbetter than 2 to 1 match. As Senator Lincoln pointed out, this Center \nwill serve thousands of children and I believe that federal investment \nin the Little Rock Audubon Nature Center will produce broad returns \nthat deserve the attention of this body.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would be delighted to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota and our ranking member.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am aware of the Senator's interest in the Little Rock \nAudubon Nature Center, but did the Senator say that the Center will \nsupport national science and math goals?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I did. The Little Rock Audubon Nature Center will assist \nschools in teaching the sciences of ornithology, ecology, biology, \nbotany and environmental health, to name a few; to excite young \npeople's minds and prepare them for careers in the sciences; and to \nhelp improve state science scores. Senator Dorgan, are you aware that \nour childrens' math and science scores in America are continuing to \ndecline throughout the country? As compared to 38 countries around the \nworld the United States ranks 19th in Mathematics Achievement Scores, \naccording to a 1999 Trends in International Mathematics and Science \nStudy. I am particularly concerned about this decline in our students' \nperformance in my home state of Arkansas. We need fresh ideas and new \napproaches to turn this situation around. So, I was very interested to \nlearn of a recent study in Northwest Arkansas showed that nature \neducation can be a very powerful tool for helping to address this \nproblem.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. What we are talking about here is stimulating the minds \nof children and fostering their aspirations to become our next great \nscientists and engineers. The education investments we make now can \nlead our country to the discovery of the next vital scientific finding, \ninvention or cure. This is an opportunity to inspire our children to \nstrive for greatness in science and mathematics and to harvest their \ncreativity, curiosity and knowledge so they may one day help their \nfellow man and society at large.\n  Mr. BURNS. I am aware of the serious problem regarding the decline in \nour children's math and science scores and I am intrigued by the idea \nthat we might address this problem through nature education.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me add to the chairman's remarks that I, too, am \ninterested in investing in programs that support math and science.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I appreciate the comments from the distinguished Chairman \nand Ranking Member and I would like to call to their attention other \nbenefits associated with the Little Rock Audubon Nature Center which \nwould benefit underserved minority communities. In fact, the nature \ncenter is located in a former federal housing site for African American \nveterans from World War II, which has been closed for years. The center \nis located in the Granite Mountain community in my home state of \nArkansas that lies within the boundary of a Federal empowerment zone \nand would serve, in particular, the minority community and school \nchildren of southeast Little Rock.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So this project would not only help to improve math and \nscience scores for all children but in particular help to assist \nunderserved communities? What other benefits would it provide?\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Nature Center also would provide access to a beautiful \n450 acre park that is currently unavailable to the citizens of Arkansas \ndue to inadequate city funds. This park represents one of the most \nunique natural areas in Southeast Arkansas because of its incredible \nbiodiversity and a globally significant geological formation, making \nthis site both ecologically important and of great educational value.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree that this sounds like a very worthwhile project. \nWhat Federal appropriation would be necessary to begin work on it?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am seeking $1.2 million which could be phased in over a \nmulti-year programming plan with a private fund match. I want to point \nout the Audubon Society's great success in my home state of Arkansas in \nleveraging private funding to match federal outlays for conservation \nprojects. For example, the Audubon Society successfully restored \nthousands of acres of Fourche Creek by leveraging private funds to \nmatch federal dollars at a ratio of more than 2-to-1. The track record \nhas been established and the private community has made its pledge to \nallow this Federal\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\nappropriation to be a catalyst for private additional investment in \nthis worthwhile project.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate this thorough report about the benefits of \nthe Little Rock Audubon Nature Center.\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes, I thank the Senators for the clarification. There is \nmore to this project than suggested by its name and I hope that we \nmight give your request every possible consideration.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I appreciate those remarks. I am making a personal request \nthat the Senate give this project the initial funding needed to help it \nbecome a reality for the children of Arkansas. I thank the Senators for \nassistance in this matter.\n\n\n                         fossil energy research\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to engage in a short \ncolloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Interior, Senator Burns. The matter is of great \nimportance to my constituent, Air Products and Chemicals of Allentown, \nPA, and involves two programs in the Fossil Energy Research and \nDevelopment section of the Interior Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. I am glad to discuss this with my colleague.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Air Products and its partners, including the Department \nof Energy, are developing a unique, oxygen-producing technology to use \nin producing oxygen and electric power for the utility, iron/steel, \nnonferrous metals, glass, pulp and paper, cogeneration, and chemicals \nand refining industries. This project, ITM Oxygen, is a cornerstone \nproject in the Department of Energy's Vision-21 Program that has the \npotential to significantly reduce the cost of tonnage oxygen plants for \nIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle, IGCC, systems. The ITM Oxygen \nprogram is entering its final three funding years during which Air \nProducts and its partners plan to demonstrate and test this unique \ntechnology with a pilot unit at a suitable field site. Air Products and \nthe Department of Energy are sharing the cost of this program together \nwith each party responsible for 50 percent. Underfunding this program \nin FY04 will result in slowing the technical process and schedule of \nthis important project, will halt crucial expansion of test platforms \nfor the final demonstration unit, and in the end will add approximately \n$10 million more to the total program cost.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand the Senator's concerns about the ITM Oxygen \nprogram. For this reason I included language in the Committee Report \nencouraging the Department of Energy to fund ITM Oxygen at a level \nhigher than identified in the budget request in order to keep the \nprogram on track for completion. I hope the Department heeds this \nreport language and responds appropriately to avoid unnecessary program \ncosts for the completion of the project.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Chairman for recognizing the \nimportance of the ITM Oxygen program and look forward to working with \nhim and his staff to see that the Department of Energy follows the \nCommittee's intentions.\n  Another project Air Products is involved in with the Department of \nEnergy is the ITM Syngas project, the purpose of which is to develop \nand demonstrate a ceramic membrane reactor able to separate oxygen from \nair in a way that produces hydrogen for use in centralized power \ngeneration or with regional distribution for fuel cell applications. \nThis technology also captures the carbon dioxide in the process leading \nto reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a goal we should all support. The \nbill includes increases in the Transportation fuels section for syngas \nmembrane technology. I would like to ask the Chairman if part of this \nincrease is intended to be used to fully fund the Air Products ITM \nSyngas project.\n  Mr. BURNS. In drafting the Senate Interior Appropriations bill, my \nstaff and I consulted with the Department of Energy to ensure the \namount provided in the bill would fully support the fiscal year needs \nof the ITM syngas membrane technology the Senator just described.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important \nitems with the Chairman today and thank him for his attention to these \ncrucial fossil energy research and development projects.\n\n\n                         fetal alcohol syndrome\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would like to enter into a coloquy with Chairman Burns \nand Senator Dorgan. The Indian Health Service and the University of \nWashington have been conducting research into Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \nwith funds provided in the Interior Appropriations bill. I want to \nthank the Chairman and Senator Dorgan for the Subcommittee's continued \nsupport for these research efforts. I hope to work with the Senators in \nconference related to this on-going research.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate my colleague's interest in the fetal alcohol \nsyndrome research being conducted by the Indian Health Service and the \nUniversity of Washington. I look forward to working with my colleague \non the continued funding for these research efforts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is one of the most pressing health \nissues facing Native Americans and I am committed to helping advance \nour research efforts in this field.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank Chairman Burns and Senator Dorgan.\n\n\n                   USGS binational groundwater study\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have filed an amendment to S. 1391 \nthat would allocate $950,000 from the United States Geological \nSurvey's, USGS, Ground-Water Resources Program to initiate a United \nStates-Mexico binational groundwater study of transboundary aquifers. \nThe parameters of this study have been developed by the USGS in \ncooperation with the Water Resources Research Institutes in Texas, New \nMexico, Arizona, and California, and other interested parties. It is \nvery important that the USGS receive funding to implement its plan. \nDuring the past decade, the United States-Mexico border region \nexperienced significant economic expansion that was accompanied by \nrapid population growth and urban development. It is now anticipated \nthat water quantity and water quality will most likely be the limiting \nfactors that ultimately control future economic development, population \ngrowth, and human health in the border region. The binational program \nfunded by this request will be a scientific partnership between the \nUSGS, the border states, and several key Universities in the region. It \nwill systematically assess priority transboundary aquifers, and will \nprovide a scientific foundation and create sophisticated tools for \nState and local water resource managers to address the challenges \nfacing them in the border region.\n  I have discussed the need for this amendment with the distinguished \nchairman, and he has been very helpful in discussing various options to \nsecure funding to initiate this study. The President's budget requested \n$1.0 million for USGS to begin work on a closely related United States-\nMexico Border Human Health Initiative. The House of Representatives has \nprovided the full amount in its version of the Interior appropriations \nbill, but the Senate has only been able to provide $500,000 for this \neffort. In conference, I have requested that the chairman agree to the \nhigher amount that the House has provided for the Border health \ninitiative but to direct the USGS to use the additional $500,000 to \nbegin the binational groundwater study. I believe this work will \naddress the critical need I just described while also providing \nvaluable data and information that is consistent with the border health \ninitiative.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate that my colleague, Senator Bingaman, is \nwilling to forego offering his amendment and that he will work with me \nto address the issue of funding the USGS to conduct the binational \ngroundwater study. I think this is a worthy program, and I will work \nclosely with my colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives \nto attempt to fully fund the border health initiative at the House \nlevel and to specify that the increased funding above the Senate mark, \n$500,000, be used to initiate the groundwater study consistent with \nSenator Bingaman's suggestion.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nconsideration and his work on this important matter. I look forward to \ncontinue working with him as the Interior appropriations bill goes to \nconference.\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\n                           e85 infrastructure\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, for \nthe committee's recognition of the important environmental and energy \nsecurity benefits of expanding our nation's E85 Infrastructure.\n  E85 is a form of alternative transportation fuel consisting of 85 \npercent Ethanol and 15 percent gasoline developed to address America's \nair quality needs and dependence on foreign oil. Currently, there are \nover 3 million E85-capable vehicles in the National Vehicle Fleet. The \nuse of E85 in these vehicles has the potential to reduce foreign oil \nimports by 34 million barrels a year, while adding $3 billion to total \nfarm income and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  In the fiscal year 2003 Interior bill, in the committee report for \nthe transportation sector, the committee recommended a $2 million \nincrease in technology deployment for the Clean Cities Program. The \nreport language further recognizes the work being done by the National \nEthanol Vehicle Coalition to increase E85 fueling capacity and urges \nthe Department of Energy to give careful consideration to proposals \nthat might be submitted to further this goal. My understanding, is that \nthe Department, consistent with this language, has awarded funds to the \nNEVC and others for the continued development of E85 Infrastructure and \nE85 promotion.\n  On page 69 of the fiscal year 2004 Interior Subcommittee report, \nunder weatherization and intergovernmental activities, it states:\n\n       Within the amount provided for clean cities, the department \n     should continue efforts to expand E85 fueling capacity.\n\n  I ask the distinguished Chairman whether I am correct in my \nunderstanding that the committee intends that a portion of these funds \nbe used by the Department to continue the existing E85 Infrastructure \ndevelopment initiatives that were funded in fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                       Air Products and Chemicals\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to engage in a short \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Interior, Senator Conrad Burns. The matter is of \ngreat importance to my constituent, Air Products and Chemicals of \nAllentown, PA and involves two programs in the Fossil Energy Research \nand Development section of the Interior Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. I am glad to discuss this with my colleague.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Air Products and its partners, including the Department \nof Energy, are developing a unique, oxygen-producing technology to use \nin producing oxygen and electric power for the utility, iron/steel, \nnonferrous metals, glass, pulp and paper, cogeneration, and chemicals \nand refining industries. This project, ITM Oxygen, is a cornerstone \nproject in the Department of Energy's Vision-21 Program that has the \npotential to significantly reduce the cost of tonnage oxygen plants for \nIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle, IGCC, systems. The ITM Oxygen \nprogram is entering its final three funding years during which Air \nProducts and its partners plan to demonstrate and test this unique \ntechnology with a pilot unit at a suitable field site. Air Products and \nthe Department of Energy are sharing the cost of this program together \nwith each party responsible for 50 percent. Underfunding this program \nin Fiscal Year 2004 will result in slowing the technical process and \nschedule of this important project, will halt crucial expansion of test \nplatforms for the final demonstration unit, and in the end will add \napproximately $10 million more to the total program cost.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand your concerns about the ITM Oxygen program. \nFor this reason I included language in the committee report encouraging \nthe Department of Energy to fund ITM Oxygen at a level higher than \nidentified in the budget request in order to keep the program on track \nfor completion. I hope the Department heeds this report language and \nresponds appropriately to avoid unnecessary program costs for the \ncompletion of the project.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished chairman for recognizing the \nimportance of the ITM Oxygen program and look forward to working with \nhim and his staff to see that the Department of Energy follows the \ncommittee's intentions.\n  Another project Air Products is involved in with the Department of \nEnergy is the ITM Syngas project, the purpose of which is to develop \nand demonstrate a ceramic membrane reactor able to separate oxygen from \nair in a way that produces hydrogen for use in centralized power \ngeneration or with regional distribution for fuel cell applications. \nThis technology also captures the carbon dioxide in the process leading \nto reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a goal we should all support. The \nbill includes increases in the Transportation fuels section for syngas \nmembrane technology. I would like to ask the chairman if part of this \nincrease is intended to be used to fully fund the Air Products ITM \nSyngas project.\n  Mr. BURNS. In drafting the Senate Interior Appropriations bill, my \nstaff and I consulted with the Department of Energy to ensure the \namount provided in the bill would fully support the fiscal year needs \nof the ITM syngas membrane technology you just described.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these important \nitems with the chairman today, and thank him for his attention to these \ncrucial fossil energy research and development projects.\n\n\n                     Wind River Irrigation Project\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about a promise the \nFederal Government made to Wyoming's Eastern Shoshone and Northern \nArapaho Tribes nearly 100 years ago. A promise my colleague from \nWyoming and I tried to fulfill this year through the appropriations \nprocess. Unfortunately, due to confusion about the project, we came up \nshort-handed. As a result, I would like to take a few minutes to set \nthe record straight.\n  In 1905, the Federal Government entered into an agreement with the \nWind River Tribes to initiate and complete an irrigation project in \nexchange for the opening of 1.4 million acres of land to the United \nStates. The Tribes lived up to their end of the bargain. The United \nStates, on the other hand, has not. Since 1905, the project, known as \nthe Wind River Irrigation Project has continually battled budgetary \nshortfalls, inadequate maintenance, and bureaucratic red tape.\n  The history of the Project's funding is long and complex. \nConstruction began in the early 1900s and was funded under the Public \nWorks Administration Project's budget. Significant improvements were \nmade to the Project under this funding scheme and the Project grew to \n13 main canals, 94 main laterals, 268 sub-laterals, two feeder canals \nand a couple of drainage canals. However, in the 1950s, new \nconstruction essentially stopped as Congress changed the way it funded \nIndian irrigation projects. When Congress began making lump sum \nappropriations to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for the Construction of \nIndian Irrigation Projects in 1951, funding became even more sporadic \nand unpredictable. Sometimes the system was in fair condition, but most \nof the time it was in poor condition. Finally, in the 1980s, Congress \nstopped appropriating all together for the construction of Indian \nIrrigation projects. As a result, the only significant Federal funds \nthe Wind River Irrigation Project has received in nearly 20 years has \nbeen for the rehabilitation of the Washakie Dam, which was funded using \nmoney from the Safety in Dams program within the BIA.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. BURNS. When my Subcomittee on Interior Appropriations reviewed \nyour request for $3.4 million for the Wind River Irrigation Project, \nthere was some question as to whether or not the BIA is ``legally \nobligated'' to maintain this system. Has the Senator been able to find \nout what the BIA's responsibilities are?\n  Mr. ENZI. It is my understanding that the BIA owns and operates this \nsystem and has been responsible for the collection of the operation and \nmanagement fees since the project was authorized in 1905.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Would my fellow Senator from Wyoming yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n\n[[Page S11823]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is also my understanding that the BIA assessed the \nneed for repairs on several occasions, including a 1968 Completion \nReport that found 74 percent of the irrigation structures and 61 \npercent of the canals needed serious rehabilitation at a cost of $6.6 \nmillion in 1968 dollars or approximately $26.0 million in 1993 dollars.\n  Furthermore, since the BIA's 1968 Completion Report, several \nadditional studies have been conducted, specifically one in 1988 which \nindicates that $50 million would be needed to completely rehabilitate \nthe Wind River Irrigation system. The most recent study completed in \n1994 cited that over 60 percent, or 1200 structures need repair or \nreplacement, and 45 percent, or 190 miles of canals and laterals need \nrepair or reconstruction. Due to the Project's current configuration, \nit has only 66 acres of irrigated land per mile of canal. In \ncomparison, Midvale Irrigation District, which lies adjacent to the \nWind River Reservation, has over 160 acres per mile of canal.\n  Mr. ENZI. Is the Senator aware that as a general guideline, the \nBureau of Reclamation suggests that irrigation projects in the region \nneed at least 140 acres of irrigated land per mile of canal to be \neconomically self sufficient? No wonder the Wind River Irrigation \nProject has been forced into a state of disrepair. It is pretty \ndifficult to collect enough user fees to maintain a system when it is \nonly serving 55 acres of irrigated land per mile of canal.\n  Mr. THOMAS. My colleague is exactly right. This situation has \nresulted in a critical shortage of financial resources to maintain \nProject facilities, causing less efficient use of water, progressively \ndeteriorating crop quality, and an increase in the proportion of income \nwater users' pay in fee assessments.\n  This lack of resources should not continue in the Wind River Basin, \nor catastrophic events like major floods from dam failure and/or severe \ndroughts could occur. The Wind River Irrigation Project needs \nrehabilitation. The water users in the area--folks who have been hit \nhard by region's drought--cannot continue to operate their ranches and \nfarms without addressing the root of the problem. The Wind River \nIrrigation Project is the source of water problems on the Reservation. \nIt affects Indians and non-Indians, and it is recognized by the State \nof Wyoming as the most critical agricultural and economic issue facing \nresidents on and near the Reservation.\n  Mr. ENZI. We are both from the great State of Wyoming and I am \nextremely encouraged by the leadership our State government has shown \nin helping to address the water problems on the Reservation. We both \nreceived letters from our Governor, the Director of the Wyoming Water \nDevelopment Commission, county commissioners from that area and three \nState legislators in full support of the project. We have also heard \nfrom the Mayor of Riverton, which sits adjacent to the Wind River \nReservation, and the three surrounding irrigation districts. While the \nvocal support is helpful, I am even more encouraged by the State's \nwillingness to put its money where its mouth is.\n  Mr. THOMAS. My colleague is correct. I would also like to add that \nduring Wyoming's last legislative session, the Wyoming legislature and \nthe Wyoming Water Development Commission worked closely with the Wind \nRiver Tribes to develop and pass legislation that will enable the \nTribes to act as sponsors of water development projects through the \nWyoming Water Development Program. According to the Director of the \nWyoming Water Commission, funding for the Wyoming Water Development \nProgram is appropriated annually by the legislature for specific \nprojects, like rehabilitating certain parts of the Wind River \nIrrigation Project. Unfortunately, the State does not have the \nfinancial means or the desire to fund a federally owned and operated \nsystem by itself. However, this cooperation highlights that Federal \ndollars spent on the Wind River Irrigation Project would go a long way \ntowards not only its rehabilitation, but would also encourage the State \nof Wyoming to become more involved in addressing the water needs of \nthat area.\n  Mr. BURNS. Senator, we included language in the Interior Subcommittee \nReport that required the BIA, if legally responsible, to formulate a \nplan to address the rehabilitation cost no later than 120 days after \nthe Interior Appropriations bill is enacted. Do you believe the BIA has \nclarified its legal obligation?\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator for the question and yes, according to \ninformation provided by the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs owns the system. Although a portion is managed by the \nTribes under a 638 contract, the BIA clearly owns and operates the Wind \nRiver Irrigation Project.\n  That is why it is so critical that the Federal Government step up and \nhelp fulfill this promise to the Tribes on the Wind River Reservation. \nRehabilitating the Wind River Irrigation Project is the only way \nfarmers, ranchers and other land users can produce their commodities. \nFurthermore, unless we improve the system so that it is a reliable \nwater source, the Tribes cannot attract new and diverse businesses. \nWithout funds to fix this problem, the Reservation cannot move into the \n21st century successfully.\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate the interest my colleagues have shown in the \nBureau of Indian Affairs' irrigation program. As I have discussed with \nthem in the past, I have similar problems in my own home state of \nMontana and hope to address them in the near future. Insufficient fee \ncollections and mismanagement have taken their toll on the irrigation \nsystems and both tribal and non-tribal members are now having their \nlivelihoods placed at risk. Unfortunately, within the current \nSubcommittee allocation we can not even begin to tackle the problem \nwith the current funding levels. I invite my colleagues to work with me \nin next year's budget process to reform this program and work to \nprovide additional funding specifically for Bureau of Indian Affairs \nirrigation projects so the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations has \nthe opportunity to begin addressing the problem.\n  Mr. ENZI. We will have to find a way to fund the Wind River \nIrrigation Project and other similar Indian Irrigation projects in the \nfuture. I hope we can work with our colleagues on the Budget Committee \nand Appropriations Committee next year to address the critical \nshortfall in funding and the lack of planning to address these problems \nwithin the BIA.\n\n\n                 private landowner's incentive program\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Interior appropriations \nsubcommittee, for his leadership in bringing this important spending \nbill to the floor and for helping us establish the spending priorities \nfor our Nation's public lands. Wyoming is greatly impacted by this bill \nand Senator Burns' leadership is very much appreciated. Because of this \ntremendous impact on Wyoming, I would like to ask my colleague if he \nwould join me in a colloquy to discuss one of the programs that is \nfunded in his bill. Specifically, I would like to discuss the \nDepartment of the Interior's Private Landowner's Incentive Program and \nits potential impact on land management planning on private lands \nwithin the U.S. Forest Service's Thunder Basin National Grasslands.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would be glad to join my colleague from Wyoming in a \ndiscussion about this program. The Senate Interior appropriations bill \nis proposing to fund this program at $40 million and should provide \nStates and private landowners some of the dollars they need to protect \nand restore habitats on private lands, to benefit federally listed, \nproposed or candidate species or other species determined to be at-\nrisk, and it provides technical and financial assistance to private \nlandowners for habitat protection and restoration. I agree with my \ncolleague from Wyoming that this is an important program for the West, \nand, if it is implemented properly, it should help States like Wyoming \nand Montana to maximize local habitat restoration efforts by allowing \nthem to target dollars where they are needed most.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to share one example of an effort in Wyoming \nthat has already benefited from this program and which I feel could \ngreatly benefit in the future from its continued participation. Three \nyears ago I met with officials from the Thunder Basin National \nGrasslands Landowners Association, the Department of the Interior and \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture to discuss the role that private\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\nlandowners could play in developing land management plans on western \nnational grasslands. The Landowners Association presented a \nrevolutionary proposal to combine the talent and resources of all local \nlandowners to develop an ecosystem assessment and to enter into a \nseries of ecosystem management strategy and conservation agreements \nwith the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that \nwould integrate a comprehensive, multi-species land management proposal \nfor more than 260,000 acres of Federal and private lands within the \nU.S. Forest Service's Thunder Basin National Grasslands. Their proposal \nwas to first establish a scientific baseline where they catalogued what \nwas on the land and what species existed. Then they proposed to use \nthat baseline to make ecosystem-wide management decisions that would \nmake the land as a whole more vibrant and more sustainable for a number \nof species including the black-tailed prairie dog, the black footed \nferret, and the sage grouse. What they would not do was make management \nplans based on the presence or absence of any one specific species or \nto pit different species' habitat requirements against each other. \nTheir goal was to make the land healthier as a whole so that all \nspecies would be better off.\n  As a result of their efforts the Department of the Interior was able \nto provide an initial grant to the association through the Landowner's \nIncentive Program of $150,000 that allowed them to assemble an advisory \ncommittee made up of national grasslands experts that has helped them \ndevelop scientific research and monitoring protocols that are now being \nused to establish baseline information on area wildlife and ecosystem \nconcerns. In fiscal year 2003, we funded this program at $175,000 which \nallowed the association to continue its monitoring efforts and to host \na symposium in Wyoming on cooperative land use efforts. I would like to \nsee this group funded again in fiscal year 2004 at a minimum of \n$175,000 to ensure that their efforts have not been wasted.\n  I would like to ask my colleague if he has any thoughts on whether or \nnot we should continue funding this program.\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree with my colleague that this appears to be a worthy \nproject whose goals of habitat protection and species restoration are \nconsistent with the expressed goals of the Private Landowner's \nIncentive Program. I believe this is the kind of innovative effort that \nshould be considered for funding by the Department of the Interior and \nI encourage them to apply for a competitive grant through the LIP \nprogram.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my colleague for his thoughts and once again \nexpress my appreciation for his leadership in these important issues. I \nthank the Chair for the opportunity to discuss this program.\n\n\n                            Rebuild America\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman and Senator \nDorgan in a colloquy concerning the Rebuild America Program at the \nDepartment of Energy. The events of August have dramatically shown all \nof us that we need to take immediate steps to increase the reliability \nof our electricity grid. In Vermont, we came very close to being swept \nup in the blackout cascade. Our transmission grid is under increasing \ndemand pressure. Although there are several proposals to upgrade the \ntransmission grid, everyone recognizes that the only action we can take \nimmediately is energy conservation. This is why I strongly support the \nRebuild America Program to help bring emerging technologies to our \nStates to improve energy efficiency in buildings. I would like to work \nwith the chairman and Senator Dorgan to increase funding for this \nprogram to bring it closer to the Fiscal Year 2003 level.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Vermont and also recognize that \nRebuild America can help alleviate the pressure on our transmission \ngrid in the near term. The Department's budget request indicates that \nevery dollar the taxpayer invests in this program gets a return of \nabout $10 in benefits. The program focuses on our schools, hospitals, \nsmall communities, and small businesses. It successfully enables the \nupgrading of millions of square feet per year. I will work with \nSenators Leahy and Dorgan to improve funding for this program in \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the chairman and Senator Dorgan. With the events \nof last month, Vermonters and people across the country need the \ninformation and outreach that this program provides. I strongly urge \nthe chairman to use the conference to return this program to a level \napproaching its Fiscal Year 2003 funding of $12.7 million.\n\n\n                         zero energy buildings\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Energy and \nWater Development Committee and a member of the Interior Committee, I \nrise to express my support for the Zero Energy Buildings program. As a \nresult of the administration's reorganization of the Energy Efficiency \nand Renewable Energy account, this program was shifted from the solar \ntechnologies account to the buildings account. Yet, the administration \nrequested $4 million to fund this program from the Energy and Water \nBill--a position that both the House and Senate subcommittees did not \nsupport.\n  This awkward funding situation, if not fixed, will cause us to lose \nmomentum on this important program. Solar initiatives are generally \nfunded from the Energy and Water development bill. Building initiatives \nare generally funded from Interior. It is my intention to work to \nrestore funding for this program in a manner acceptable to both \nsubcommittees.\n  ZEB boasts some major achievements given its relative youth. The \nUnited States Department of Energy, teaming with homebuilders, energy \nefficiency professionals, and the renewables industry--primarily the \nsolar industry--are responsible for the creation of the next generation \nof homes. These homes are more energy efficient than ever and self-\ngenerate to the point where their progeny are expected to reach net \nzero energy consumption. We need these homes to proliferate so that we \ncan enjoy increased national security through a reduction in imported \nfuels; a cleaner environment; a more reliable grid; and as important as \nany element, cheaper and more predictable energy costs for American \nhomeowners and small businesses.\n  Several of the largest homebuilders in the United States now \nparticipate in this program, including: Pulte Homes, Centex Homes, Shea \nHomes, Pardee/Weyerhauser, Morrison Homes, and Mercedes Homes. Many of \nthese have sent letters of support for the program, and it is my \nunderstanding that about one dozen additional homebuilders are planning \nto join with DOE on this program.\n  The Solar Decathlon held on the Mall in Washington, DC last year, \nwhich attracted over 100,000 visitors, featured Zero Energy Homes \nconstructed by university teams from across the United States.\n  I am proud to say that a Zero Energy Home is now under construction \nin Las Vegas and will serve as the ``show home'' for next year's \nInternational Builders Show hosted by NAHB, which is expected to be \nattended by more than 90,000 building industry representatives.\n  In a strong endorsement letter of the program, Michael Luzier, \npresident of the NAHB Research Center, states:\n\n       I urge you to find funds within DOE's budget so the Zero \n     Energy Home program continuity will not be lost. To lose the \n     momentum toward energy independence that this program has \n     created within the home building industry would be a shame. I \n     fear that without funding in FY '04, we will lose the \n     interest of builders we have been working with and the \n     progress in home energy efficiency we all support.\n\n  For all of the above reasons, I request the chairman's assistance in \nworking with the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee to find \nfunding for this program in a way that compliments and does not harm \nother worthy efforts.\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree that the Zero Energy Buildings program is worthy \nof support, and I pledge to assist in efforts to provide appropriate \nfunding.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1725, as Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today \nwould provide sufficient funding from the underlying bill to enable the \nSecretary of the Interior to submit to Congress a report on the amount \nof goods acquired by that Department in fiscal year 2004 that were made \noverseas.\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\n  I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for working with me to include this important provision in \nthe bill.\n  My amendment requires that this report include the following \ninformation: (a) the dollar value of any articles, materials, or \nsupplies purchased that are manufactured outside of the United States; \n(b) an itemized list of all waivers of the Buy American Act granted \nwith respect to such articles, materials, or supplies, and (c) a \nsummary of total procurement funds spent on goods manufactured in the \nUnited States versus funds spent on goods manufactured outside of the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment also requires that these reports should be made \npublicly available on the Internet.\n  Current law requires that only the Department of Defense report \nannually on its use of waivers of domestic procurement laws. Earlier \nthis year, I introduced legislation to strengthen the Buy American Act \nof 1933, the statute that governs procurement by the Federal \nGovernment. The name of the act accurately and succinctly describes its \npurpose: to ensure that the Federal Government supports domestic \ncompanies and domestic workers by buying American-made goods. One part \nof my bill would require that all Federal Departments and Agencies \nsubmit the annual reports that are currently required only of the \nPentagon. The amendment that I am offering today is based on that \nprovision in my bill. Recently, the Senate adopted a similar amendment \nthat I offered to the fiscal year 2004 Labor-HHS-Education and energy \nand water appropriations bills.\n  The Buy American Act requires that the Federal Government support \ndomestic businesses and domestic workers by buying American-made goods. \nThe underlying bill expresses the sense of the Senate that goods and \nequipment purchased with the funds included in this bill should be \nAmerican-made.\n  It only makes sense that Federal Departments and Agencies be required \nto report to Congress on their compliance with Federal law and with \ncongressional intent regarding this important matter.\n  The Department of Labor reported recently that the United States \neconomy lost 93,000 jobs in the month of August, including 44,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. The stagnant economy and continued loss of high-\npaying manufacturing jobs underscore the need for the Federal \nGovernment to support American workers and businesses by buying \nAmerican-made goods.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee \nfor agreeing to accept my amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \ndisturbing shift in our country's historic support for programs that \nprotect our wildlife refuges, forests and other open spaces. \nParticularly, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, LWCF.\n  The Bush administration's 2004 funding request represents a \nsignificant decrease in support for land acquisition.\n  Yet this direction is the opposite of what then Governor Bush \npromised during his 2000 campaign.\n  Governor Bush issued a campaign paper on September 13, 2000, that \npromised to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund at $900 \nmillion.\n  The fund has been enormously effective over the years and is funded, \nnot by taxpayers but from a portion of fees from oil and gas receipts \nwhich Congress committed in 1965.\n  Yet despite the President's pledge, 1 year later the Administration \ndiverted $456 million of that fund to other purposes.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, for Fiscal Year \n2004, the administration has proposed to decrease Federal land \nacquisition funding to $128 million below the FY2003 funding level, \nwhich will more than offset proposed increases in State grants.\n  I want to commend by colleagues on the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee who have worked very hard under difficult budgetary \nconditions to develop the best bill they could.\n  But the President is playing a funding ``shell game.'' While he \nclaims to support conservation funding, he once again proposes to use \n$246 million of the LWCF to pay for non-conservation programs.\n  Only by counting as many as 15 other programs in its annual budget \nrequest programs NOT authorized for LWCF funding under the original \n1965 law does the President's budget make it appear that the LWCF is \nwell-funded.\n  Turning his back on campaign promises aside, the President's budget \nwould actually cut the fund's core Federal land acquisition programs by \n40 percent from FY03 levels, and fully 60 percent below the authorized \nlevel of $900 million for both the Federal and stateside portions!\n  This direction reverses years of progress in increasing the funding \nwe need to protect our dwindling natural resources. And unfortunately, \nthe funding levels approved by the House are even more abysmal.\n  Today, there is a $10 billion backlog in needed Federal acquisitions, \nand billions of dollars in unmet needs at the State and local levels.\n  This is certainly contrary to the spirit of another Republican \npresident, Theodore Roosevelt, who during his time in the White House \nhad the vision to protect 230 million acres of land.\n  Today, those lands are enjoyed by hikers, vacationing families, \nhunters, and many others.\n  Between 1999 and 2000, the Clinton administration increased funding \nfor the LWCF by 35 percent. President Clinton understood how vital \nthese programs are to preserving our American heritage.\n  This year the U.S. Forest Service reported that even with all of our \nland conservation programs, in one decade between 1990 and 2000--our \nNation's urban and suburban areas grew in size by an astonishing 25 \npercent!\n  This growth has been at the cost of lost forest and farmland all \nacross the Nation and it poses a significant threat to the integrity of \nthese valuable lands.\n  Forest lands that are intact supply timber products, wildlife \nhabitat, soil and watershed protection, and recreation. But when these \nareas fragment and disappear, so do the benefits they provide.\n  Many local governments work hard to guide development away from the \nmost sensitive areas through zoning and other measures.\n  But in New Jersey, and many other States, these measures are simply \nnot enough to fully protect our forests and open spaces.\n  New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the Nation and we \nunderstand that over-development endangers our water supplies and \nplaces severe pressure on all our environmental amenities.\n  Forest Legacy and the Land to Parks Program are examples of the \nFederal Government at its best--working in partnership with States and \nlocal governments to protect environmentally sensitive lands.\n  These programs are entirely voluntary. No landowner is required or \npressured to participate.\n  Forest Legacy encourages the protection of privately owned forest \nlands and helps States develop and carry out their own forest \nconservation plans.\n  Aldo Leopold said, ``Our remnants of wilderness will yield bigger \nvalues to the Nation's character and health than they will to its \npocketbook, and to destroy them will be to admit that the latter are \nthe only values that interest us.''\n  I don't believe that is true for Americans, and I don't believe that \nis true for my colleagues in this body.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate and especially those who will \nrepresent this body in the conference committee to support the highest \nlevels possible for our land acquisition programs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1391, the FY 2004 \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, as reported by the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking Member for \nbringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the \nSubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary \nspending cap for 2004.\n  The pending bill provides $19.6 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority and $19.4 billion in discretionary outlays in FY 2004 for the \nDepartment of the Interior, the Forest Service, Energy conservation and \nresearch, the Smithsonian and the National Endowment for the Arts, and \nNational Endowment for Humanities.\n  The bill is at the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget \nauthority\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\nand $4 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation.

Mr. President, yesterday we had a hearing in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee with Ambassador Bremer, who has just returned \nfrom Iraq and is here for the week to talk about the needs in the \ncountry of Iraq, especially to talk about the requested $87 billion \nthat is the part of the President's request he says is necessary for \nboth the military needs in Iraq, to support the troops stationed in \nIraq and now completing their mission in Iraq, and also $20 billion for \nthe reconstruction of Iraq. I want to make a couple of comments about \nthat because, since our hearing yesterday, I have been doing some \nresearch.\n  At the hearing yesterday I said to the Ambassador: It is quite clear \nto me the Congress will respond affirmatively. First of all, it is \nunthinkable to send America's sons and daughters wearing our military \nuniform to war anywhere in the world and not provide all the support \nthat is necessary and that is requested. The military portion of that \nrequest, in my judgment, will be granted, should be granted completely \nand quickly.\n  Second, on the question of reconstructing Iraq, the $20 billion \nnecessary for the reconstruction of this country, I asked Ambassador \nBremer a number of questions. I want to make a comment about that and \nsome of the research I have done since that time.\n  It is the case that the campaign that was called ``Shock and Awe,'' \nwhich we all saw on the television, of bombing and the ensuing military \naction with smart bombs, smart weapons--that campaign did not target \nIraq's infrastructure. It did not target the electric facilities, did \nnot target the power facilities or dams or roads or bridges. It \ntargeted military targets, palaces, and other items of strategic value, \nbut it specifically did not target infrastructure in Iraq. So the \ndamage to the infrastructure in Iraq is not damage caused by America's \nmilitary action in Iraq. It is caused now, increasingly, by the \ninsurgent movement in Iraq, the terrorists and others who are engaged \nin destruction in Iraq.\n  But the question I was asking the Ambassador about reconstructing \nIraq is, If we did not destroy Iraq's infrastructure, then why should \nthe American taxpayer be paying money to reconstruct the \ninfrastructure? I suggested the infrastructure obviously needs to be \ndealt with, but should not the oil reserves in Iraq be used to pump the \noil and produce the revenue for the reconstruction of this country? \nIraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world. Those oil \nreserves, it seems to me, ought to be used for the reconstruction of \nIraq. Let Iraqi oil pay for the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  Ambassador Bremer said to me: One of the problems with that approach \nis Iraq has a substantial amount of accumulated debt.\n  Since yesterday I began to research what is this debt that Iraq owes \nthe rest of the world. My guess is it is the Saddam Hussein government \nthat owes the rest of the world. That government does not exist. He is \nin hiding somewhere. The government doesn't exist any longer.\n  Here are the countries that Saddam Hussein presumably owes money to: \nKuwait, probably somewhere around $20 billion; Saudi Arabia, $25 \nbillion; the other gulf states, probably $25 billion; Russia, $10 \nbillion; France, $6 billion. These are not specific amounts that are \ntied down very well because the World Bank Debtor Reporter System tells \nus there are no collated figures available from Iraq because Iraq is \none of the few countries which did not report its debt statistics.\n  So no documents exist in the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. None of it \nhas yet emerged. They may well have been lost in the chaos. But would \nit be ironic if the American taxpayer is told that they must use their \nmoney to reconstruct Iraq and the Iraqi oil wells will pump oil, the \nproceeds of which will be used to pay Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for debts \nincurred while Saddam Hussein ran the Iraqi Government? You talk about \na Byzantine result, that is it.\n  I believe reconstruction is necessary. But I also believe that \nreconstruction\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\nought to be paid for with Iraqi oil. The Ambassador will say, Well, \nthere is not enough money left for the operation of the Iraqi \nGovernment, but the Ambassador also said yesterday with some \nsatisfaction that they just put a new tax system in the country of \nIraq. He said with some satisfaction that the top income tax rate is 15 \npercent.\n  So we are going to ask the Americans who will pay a top rate of 39-\npercent income tax to send reconstruction money to Iraq whose economy \nis generating an income tax against that with respect to its wealthiest \ncitizens at a rate of a 15-percent tax rate. I don't think that makes \nmuch sense.\n  My only point is this: Of the $20 billion, $5 billion is for \nsecurity. So there is $15 billion for security and reconstruction above \nthe military needs. I believe that what we ought to do is have the \nAmbassador and the administration work very hard to resolve these \ndebts. It seems to me one might well tell the Saudis and the Kuwaitis: \nYou loaned the money to the Saddam Hussein regime. You know that debt \nis owed to you by Saddam Hussein. Go find him and go collect it. If you \nthink you can find him, tell us where he is. But go find him and \ncollect it. That ought not be a burden on the country of Iraq. The \ngovernment with which you engaged in this credit transaction no longer \nexists.\n  Following that, it seems to me that it would be reasonable to \nsecuritize or collateralize Iraqi oil. We know they will by next June \nor July be pumping 3 million barrels per day. The amount that is not \nneeded in Iraq but that is available for export will yield revenues of \nabout $16 billion a year. That is $160 billion in 10 years, or $320 \nbillion in 20 years, this for a country of 24 million people. If you \ncan't securitize or collateralize $320 billion over 10 years to pay for \na $20 billion reconstruction of Iraq, then there is something wrong \nwith all the financiers and all the tall thinkers who are working on \nthis.\n  I believe the money requested is necessary. But I believe the \nconstruct of the reconstruction in Iraq and the payment for that \nreconstruction should not be a burden on the shoulders of the American \ntaxpayer--not taxpayers who are paying more than double the rate the \ntop taxpayers in Iraq will be asked to bear and not taxpayers who \nshould pay taxes so Iraqi oil wells can pump oil to send money to Saudi \nArabia and Kuwait. What a perverse result that would be.\n  We are going to have a lot of discussion about that, and we should \nhave. The President has made a request and said the money is necessary. \nHe is right. The money is necessary. The question is not whether it is \nnecessary on the military side because we ought to appropriate that \nmoney. We ought to do it now, and we ought not delay.\n  On the reconstruction side, let us understand the money is necessary \nbut it ought to come from the resources from Iraqi oil. By my \ncalculation, those resources would be $320 billion conservatively in \nthe next 20 years. It is easy to collateralize or securitize that with \nthe private sector. Or, for that matter, if you do not want the private \nsector with the IMF or the World Bank in order not to impose this \nburden on the American taxpayer but instead rely on Iraqi oil, once \nagain the second largest reserves of oil in the world under the sands \nof Iraq, a country with 24 million people, they surely can afford to \nconstruct a plan--that is, the Iraqi council, and also the allies that \nare involved, including this country--can surely construct a plan by \nwhich we use that resource to reconstruct and reinvest in that country. \nIt is Iraq's resource. It is Iraq's oil. It ought not be an obligation \nof the American taxpayer to pay for that portion of the emergency \nrequest.\n\n  My hope is, as we begin these discussions in the coming days, that \ntwo things will emerge: No. 1, the President and others will understand \nthat Congress is going to respond and respond affirmatively to the \nneeds that exist, especially for our soldiers but also with respect to \nreconstruction, and, No. 2, that Congress does not, should not, and \nwill not respond by imposing a burden on the taxpayers of this country \nfor the reconstruction needs that should be financed with Iraqi oil. \nThat is a debate that we must have.\n  I hope the result will be positive for the American taxpayer and \npositive for the people of Iraq, for that matter, because they have \nsubstantial resources with which to reconstruct the infrastructure of \nIraq, which, by the way, was not destroyed by this country. That \ninfrastructure in Iraq was not destroyed by this country's military \ncampaign. This country's military campaign removed a brutal dictator. \nWe are now opening football-field-size graves containing 10,000 and \n12,000 skeletons.\n  That campaign, however, while removing the Saddam Hussein government, \ndid not destroy their country's infrastructure, and there are plenty of \nresources under the sands of Iraq to produce oil with which to produce \nrevenue to reinvest in that infrastructure and in the future without \nhaving the American people bear that burden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11827-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11827-S11828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NOMINATION OF GOVERNOR MIKE LEAVITT TO HEAD THE EPA\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to commend President Bush for \nnominating Gov. Mike Leavitt to be head of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Governor Leavitt's hearing was this morning and, from all \naccounts, he performed admirably, as I would expect. He is a \ndistinguished public servant who has worked diligently to address the \nenvironmental problems in Utah and the Western States.\n  I believe the President has found the right person for the job of \nleading the EPA. The EPA Administrator must establish realistic \nregulations that often require compromise and balance. In my \nexperience, almost all of the issues that deal with our environment \nrequire a good sense of balance because there are so many competing \ninterests. Governor Leavitt has demonstrated his ability to work with \nall groups affected by environmental regulation. He pulled together, \nfor example, Governors, tribal leaders, industrial leaders, and \nenvironmental activists to get behind a comprehensive plan to clear the \nhaze obscuring the scenic views in the West, including the Grand \nCanyon.\n  For nearly 11 years, Governor Leavitt managed to bring together a \ndiverse group of State and tribal officials, industrial leaders, and \nenvironmental activists who focused on developing a plan which led to \naction that is clearing the air in the West.\n  I hope that a similar plan can be developed to clear the haze in the \ngreat Smoky Mountain National Park, which is about 2 miles from where I \nlive. It is the Nation's most visited national park, and it also has \nearned the unwelcome distinction of becoming the most polluted national \npark in America.\n  We welcome the help of Governor Leavitt as head of the EPA in coming \nup and working with our Governor and Federal delegation and our \ncommunities in Tennessee, who are very concerned about this, to help \nget on a long-term path that would clear the haze in the Smokies and \nrestore its natural beauty.\n  This will require cooperation among local, State, and Federal \nGovernments and industry and environmental activists. I believe \nGovernor Leavitt is the right person to help lead that effort. He has \ndemonstrated he can do this by getting collaboration among groups \ninstead of polarization.\n  As Governor, Mike Leavitt has encouraged results-oriented \nenvironmental action. I strongly support his views that policy should \nencourage outside-the-box thinking in solving problems rather than just \ncomplying with Federal programs.\n  Our environmental problems are complex. They require examination of \nmany strategies to achieve our Nation's goals. The EPA Administrator \nplays a crucial role in balancing our desire to protect the environment \nand our desire for jobs and prosperity.\n  I believe we can have good jobs and strong industry and clean air and \nclean energy. The solutions are not easy, and in most cases--many \ncases--require new technology. However, with Governor Leavitt's \nleadership, I believe we will be able to develop the solutions and \npartnership to meet realistic environmental goals.\n  The job of protecting the environment is a difficult one, one in \nwhich I take a great personal interest. The President of the United \nStates--this President--has distinguished himself by making a number of \nsuperb appointments. He has made another such nomination, and I look \nforward to the\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\nchance to vote for Mike Leavitt as EPA Administrator.\n  May I add just a personal note, Mr. President? I was elected Governor \nfirst in 1978 in Tennessee. Since then, I have known more than 200 \nGovernors, probably served with 80 or 100. Only a handful of those \nGovernors, some on each side of the aisle--Democratic and Republican--\nhave really understood the job, have used that office to set a clear \nagenda to develop a strategy to meet the agenda, and then persuade at \nleast half the people they are right. All three of those elements are \nbeing part of being a good Governor. Those Governors have transformed \ntheir States.\n  Mike Leavitt is one of those Governors. Because of that, he was \nelected to be the chair of the National Governors' Association. He \nwould not have been elected, and he would not have succeeded in the job \nif he had not been able to work with both Democratic and Republican \nGovernors. He has earned and shares the respect of all who have known \nand worked with him. He is one of the outstanding State leaders of the \nlast quarter of a century. He has a great sense of balance. He has an \nimaginative sense of what is possible, and he has an excellent ability \nto persuade half that he is right, which is a very important part of \ndoing that job.\n  I am very pleased to see him coming to Washington, and I am delighted \nwith President Bush's appointment. I wanted to be among the first to \nwelcome him here. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11828-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CEASAR SALICCHI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1970, a young man in Elko, NV spent $365 \nto run for the position of Elko County Treasurer.\n  That was the last time Ceasar Salicchi ever had to spend a dime in a \npolitical campaign . . . and the last time he had an opponent.\n  Since then, Salicchi has won eight additional terms as county \ntreasurer. Overall, his career in public service to the people of Elko \nCounty has spanned five different decades . . . almost 42 years.\n  For those who have never had the fortune of visiting northeast \nNevada, it is in the opinion of many the most beautiful part of the \nSilver State. Elko County boasts majestic mountains, and unlike most \nother parts of our state, gets enough rain to provide good range for \nlivestock. So Elko is a prime area for ranching--a place, it would \nseem, where many beautiful scenes in cowboy movies could have been \nfilmed.\n  Salicchi is the son of local ranchers Cesare and Nella Salicchi, \nItalian immigrants who are now deceased. Ceasar served in the Army in \n1945 and '46, and returned home to start ranching with his father and \nhis brother, Alfred. He married his first wife, Jeanine, in 1950, and \nthey started a family and settled into life on the ranch.\n  I am sure Ceasar expected to spend his life as a rancher, as so many \nin that part of the country do. But on December 15, 1952, at age 25, he \nwas stricken with polio. After his recovery, he faced living with \ndisabilities that required him to walk with crutches.\n  Salicchi vowed that he wouldn't let his disabilities keep him down . \n. . and they certainly did not. Since ranching was no longer a viable \nway for him to support a young family, he went to the Reno Business \nCollege, earned a degree in business administration, and set out to \nforge a new career.\n  His exceptional skills in organization and fiscal management not only \nallowed him to succeed in that endeavor, but also benefited the people \nof Elko County.\n  In 1962, Ceasar was working in the local hardware store on Commercial \nStreet in downtown Elko. A man named Al Haber, the accountant for the \ncounty-owned Elko General Hospital, offered him a job as the hospital's \nbusiness manager.\n  Ceasar immediately started making positive changes in the hospital's \noperations. For example, he is credited with bringing the first \ncomputer to the hospital, an IBM Model 3. As he continued to look for \nways to make things run better, he developed a reputation as a good \nsteward of the public's money.\n  He decided to run for county treasurer in 1970, promising to \nmodernize operations in the same way he had done at the hospital. The \npeople of Elko County had faith in him, and he won the election. Since \nthen, he has been re-elected eight times without opposition.\n  Salicchi is a life-long Democrat, and he reminisces with razor-sharp \nclarity about voting for President Harry Truman after he returned home \nfrom his Army tour in 1948.\n  But the secret to his political success is a personal approach to the \njob, not ideology.\n  ``I enjoy this job,'' he says. ``Serving the public and friends \nprovides me with personal satisfaction, and service is my main \nobjective.''\n  He has provided tremendous service. At the time Ceasar took office, \nall of the financial operations at the Elko courthouse were still \nperformed by hand. About 9,000 tax bills were processed by hand, and \nkept on the treasurer's office counter for people to walk in and pay.\n  Salicchi's efforts to modernize the office began in 1976 with the \ninstallation of the first computer system, and modernization has \ncontinued to this day. Earlier this year, following approval from the \ncounty commission, the treasurer's office successfully began auctioning \ndelinquent property on the Internet.\n  Today, Ceasar's office processes more than 37,000 tax bills each \nyear. He also oversees the management and investment of public money. \nThe portfolio for Elko County runs from $19 million to $23 million, and \nthe interest and dividends are distributed to the local school district \nand other public funds.\n  In the 1970s, when national efforts to protect the rights of persons \nwith disabilities were just beginning, Salicchi served on several \nGovernor-appointed committees to implement those policies in Nevada. \nThat was around the same time I first met Ceasar, when I was running \nfor Lieutenant Governor.\n  Since then, it has always been a delight to visit Elko and see \nCeasar. I was there just a few weeks ago, and I asked him if he was \nplanning to retire anytime soon.\n  He responded with that familiar twinkle in his eye and sly grin: \n``Maybe.''\n  But his wife Darlene, who is also his biggest supporter, said, \n``We'll see about that.''\n  While Ceasar has faithfully served the people of Elko County, his \nfirst love has always been his family.\n  His first wife, Jeanine, passed away on October 23, 1969. In 1984 he \nmarried Darlene, whom he had met when they both worked at the county \nhospital. Their children include Judy Trotter and Chet Gilbert, both of \nElko; Tina Snow of Anchorage, Alaska; Dee Dee Kelsey of Aldrich, \nMinnesota; and Paul Gilbert of Los Angeles. Two sons, Ceasar Raymond \nSalicchi and Doug Shatto, are deceased.\n  Ceasar Salicchi has been a fixture in the public life of Elko, NV \nsince 1962. The city of Elko, Elko County, and the State of Nevada are \nall better places because of a man who doesn't know the meaning of \ndefeat--Ceasar Salicchi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11828-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11828-S11829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GREG MADDUX\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a great Nevadan, a \ngreat human being and a great athlete . . . my friend, Greg Maddux.\n  Mr. Maddux pitches for the Atlanta Braves baseball club. Since he \nwent to Atlanta almost 11 years ago,the Braves have won their division \nevery single season.\n  This is no coincidence. Greg Maddux has been the heart and soul of \nthe Atlanta Braves and the key to their remarkable string of success.\n  From 1992 through 1995, he won the Cy Young award as the best pitcher \nin baseball--4 years in a row. No other pitcher has ever accomplished \nthat--and I doubt anyone else ever will.\n  He finished the 1990s with a 2.54 earned run average for the decade. \nOnly two pitchers had posted a better ERA over a decade since 1910--\nHoyt Wilhelm and Sandy Koufax. That's pretty good company. And in 1995, \nMaddux became the first pitcher to log back-to-back seasons with an ERA \nunder 1.80.\n  From 1990 through 2001--12 consecutive years--Greg won the National \nLeague Gold Glove as the league's best-fielding pitcher.\n  He pitched nine scoreless innings in game one of the 1995 World \nSeries, leading the Braves over the Cleveland Indians.\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\n  Greg could have retired years ago, and he would still be assured of \nentering the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first day he is eligible.\n  But he keeps pitching, and he keeps setting a new standard of \nexcellence.\n  Sunday, he broke a record that had been held by the great Cy Young \nhimself, winning at least 15 games for the 16th consecutive season.\n  For a major league pitcher, winning 15 games in a season is a feat \nthat only the best will ever accomplish. To do it for 16 straight years \nis almost unthinkable.\n  They say records are made to be broken. Well, I think this one will \nstand for a long, long time.\n  The success of Greg Maddux is even more amazing when you consider \nthat he doesn't have overwhelming speed. In an era of 100 mph \nfastballs, his clock in the mid-80s. He doesn't try to overpower \nhitters . . . he just outsmarts them.\n  Maddux is an unsurpassed student of the game who relies on his \npinpoint control and his unyielding determination. He never gives in to \nhitters. He makes them swing at his pitches.\n  After he defeated the Florida Marlins to break Cy Young's record, 72-\nyear-old Florida manager Jack McKeon said, ``He doesn't get you out--he \nmakes you get yourself out.''\n  Anybod who is a baseball fan, as I am, would be proud to know Greg \nMaddux. But he is more than a great athlete . . . he's a great person.\n  He is a devoted family man, married to a wonderful wife Kathy. They \nhave a daughter Amanda Paige and a son Chase Alan.\n  Obviously, the Maddux family could live anywhere they want to. I am \nproud that they have chosen to live in Las Vegas, where Greg grew up \nand graduated from Valley High School.\n  Greg doesn't endorse commercial products, and he has no interest in \nthe glamorous life of a celebrity. Instead, he and his family live \nquietly, giving generously of their time and money for causes that \nbenefit our community.\n  Kathy and Greg lead the Maddux Foundation, which is involved in \nseveral charitable activities in Las Vegas and Atlanta. The Foundation \nsupports children's homes, domestic crisis shelters, and boys and girls \nclubs.\n  In recent years, the Madduxes have expanded their philanthropic \nefforts, and his brother Mike also has a foundation that helps \nchildren.\n  Baseball fans all over America know Greg Maddux as one of the \ngreatest pitchers in the history of the game.\n  In southern Nevada, we know him as a devoted family man, a positive \nrole model for kids, and a great neighbor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11829-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nHagerstown, IN. Staff Sergeant Frederick L. Miller, Jr., 27 years old, \nwas killed in Ar Ramadi on September 20, 2003 when an explosive device \nhit his vehicle while he was on security patrol. Frederick joined the \nArmy with his entire life before him. He chose to risk everything to \nfight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  Frederick was the sixteenth Hoosier soldier to be killed while \nserving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He leaves behind his \nparents, Ann and Frederick Miller, his wife, Jamie, and two daughters, \nHaley and Sierra. Jamie is pregnant with the couple's third child, a \nboy. Today, I join Frederick's family, his friends, and the entire \nHagerstown community in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear \nour sorrow over his death, we can also take pride in the example he \nset, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is this \ncourage and strength of character that people will remember when they \nthink of Frederick, a memory that will burn brightly during these \ncontinuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Frederick L. Miller, Jr., joined the Army after graduating from \nRichmond High School in 1994 and would have marked his eighth year of \nmilitary service next month. He commanded a Bradley Fighting Vehicle in \nTroop K in the 3rd Squadron of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. Before \nIraq, he served in combat zones in Kosovo, Yugoslavia and Bosnia. \nFrederick was discharged after his first tour of duty, but chose to re-\nenlist after the September 11 attacks. His family remembers him as a \ntrue American hero, who returned to the Army during our Nation's most \ntrying time because he felt bound by duty, and today, we honor the \nsacrifice he made while serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Frederick L. Miller, \nJr.'s sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he \naddressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We \ncannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow his ground. The \nbrave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far \nabove our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor \nlong remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did \nthere.'' This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 \nyears ago, as I am certain that the impact of Frederick's actions will \nlive on far longer than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Frederick L. Miller, Jr. in \nthe official record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Frederick's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11829-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11829-S11830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONFIRMATION OF GLEN EDWARD CONRAD\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, on October 11, TreePeople will \ncelebrate the 30th anniversary of its founding. Few organizations have \nhad such an impact, have energized so many volunteers or have so \ntransformed a community as has TreePeople. I applaud them and thank \nthem for their wonderful work over the past 30 years.\n  TreePeople, much like the trees it plants, started as a tiny seed \nbefore blossoming into the powerful organization it is today. \nTreePeople was founded by a then-15-year-old summer camper, Andy \nLipkis. Andy, like many foresters, understood that substantial tree die \noffs in the local mountains were the consequence of Los Angeles' smog, \nand wanted to do something about it. Andy organized his fellow campers, \nand together they ripped up a parking lot and planted a meadow. But he \nwas not finished. Andy next obtained 8,000 seedlings from the \nCalifornia Department of Forestry's surplus stock and started the \nCalifornia Conservation Project, later renamed ``TreePeople.''\n  Since its founding, TreePeople has been committed to planting trees \nmillions of trees. They began by planting 50,000 trees with 50,000 \nstudent volunteers in environmental programs at Coldwater Canyon Park. \nSeveral years later, after the City of Los Angeles estimated that it \nwould take 20 years to plant a million trees in order to comply with \nthe Clean Air Act, TreePeople took on the project and did it in three \nyears. Later, TreePeople helped launch the Los Angeles Conservation \nCorps, and Kate and Andy Lipkis were elected to the United Nations \nEnvironmental Programme's Global 500 Honor Roll. TreePeople's work has \nextended across international boundaries with thousands of fruit trees \nbeing shipped to foreign lands to avert hunger and starvation.\n  TreePeople has also focused on environmental education programs and \nplayed an important part in getting 60,000 elementary school children \nto work toward the City's goal of mandatory recycling. In the 1990s, \nTreePeople launched the Campus Forestry Program, now boasting the \nparticipation of more than one million children and teenagers. \nTreePeople has also developed the Trans-Agency Resources for \nEnvironment and Economic Sustainability, or T.R.E.E.S., program to \npromote better watershed management practices.\n  Today, TreePeople continues to work tirelessly to make Los Angeles a \nbetter and healthier place to live. TreePeople started modestly as one \nperson with a dream. With steadfast determination and passion, his \ndream became a reality. Andy Lipkis is living proof that one person, \nwith a corps of countless volunteers, can make a big difference. I \ncommend his vision, and I applaud him and all those who helped make his \nvision tangible. TreePeople's greatest strength is in its ability to \nattract volunteers who are willing to work for a better community. I \nthank them for their great work.\n  I extend my congratulations to everyone involved with TreePeople on \nthis special anniversary and wish them all many more years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11830-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11830-S11831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING ROBERT G.

MacEachran will retire after 16 years as \nSuperintendent of the Suttons Bay Public Schools. Mr. MacEachran's \ndedication to his students and lifelong commitment to maintaining a \nstandard of excellence for the Suttons Bay Public Schools has made a \ngreat difference in the lives of many residents of northern Michigan.\n  Mr. MacEachran began his work in public education as a junior high \nschool math teacher in the Battle Creek School District. He then moved \nto the East Grand Rapids School District and taught high school math \nfor several years. With many years of teaching under his belt, he \ndecided to pursue his longtime goal of becoming an educational \nadministrator to ensure that schools maintained an environment that \nencouraged learning by stimulating the minds of all students. Mr. \nMacEachran moved to the Comstock Park Schools where he served as \nAssistant Principal, Athletic Director, and Director of Community \nService.\n  After 22 years of service as an educator, Mr. MacEachran moved to \nnorthern Michigan and took the position of Superintendent for the \nSuttons Bay public school system. In this position, he has stressed the \nimportance of using the newest technology to ensure that students have \nall the resources needed to enrich their learning experience. Mr. \nMacEachran has also made great\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\nstrides in developing new relationships between private and public \nschools. He developed a partnership between the local Montessori school \nand Suttons Bay Public Schools that incorporates the Montessori \neducators and their techniques into the public school curriculum. He \nwas also pivotal in the construction of a new high school. This new \nbuilding allowed all K-12 grades to be moved to new classrooms.\n  The dedication and innovation that Robert MacEachran has brought to \nthe Suttons Bay Public Schools during his 16-year tenure as \nSuperintendent and 38 years within the Michigan public school community \nis exceptional. He has demonstrated unwavering support for the \neducation of Michigan's youth. The legacy that he has left within the \nSuttons Bay public school system will endure after his retirement. \nFuture generations will greatly benefit from his commitment to the \neducation and development of all children. I am confident my colleagues \nwill join me in offering our heartfelt thanks and appreciation to \nRobert G. MacEachran and in wishing him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11831-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING TONY AUTORE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to recognize Tony \nAutore for his outstanding commitment to community service in my home \nState of Michigan. On September 26, 2003, the Chippewa-Luce-Mackinac \nCommunity Action Agency will honor Tony for his exemplary service to \nthe Eastern Upper Peninsula and to the Community Action Agency.\n  Tony began his service to the community in 1952, when he entered the \nUnited States Army and served until he was honorably discharged in \n1954. After his two years in the Army, Tony moved to Cedarville, MI, \nwith his wife Ethel and began a successful local business. Tony's \nservice continued as he became a member of the Les Cheneaux Chamber of \nCommerce. The Chamber recently hosted the Michigan Outdoor Writers' \nwinter and summer conventions, bringing over 300 writers to the area to \ndiscuss and celebrate the conservation and preservation of the state of \nMichigan's natural resources.\n  Tony has also served his community on the Clark Township volunteer \nfire department and the Les Cheneaux Community Foundation Board and was \ninstrumental in establishing a Boy Scout Troop in the area. Along with \nthese activities, Tony has devoted his time and talent improving his \ncommunity for others as a member of the planning commission, the \nMackinac County Housing Commission, and the economic development \ncorporation. Tony has also been involved with other local \norganizations. He is a member of the Lions Club, the Knights of \nColumbus, and the Christopher Columbus Association.\n  For the past 18 years, Tony has served on the Board of the Chippewa-\nLuce-Mackinac Community Action Agency. He is currently the treasurer of \nthe group, which strives to address poverty by helping to enable people \nto become self-sufficient members of society. The counsel and advice he \nhas given the Agency Director and staff have been invaluable. During \nhis time with the agency he has helped provide a truck and driver free \nof charge to help with the periodic distribution of food commodities in \nthe area. Additionally, through his ties to the local community, Tony \nhelped the agency secure use of the town hall for senior congregate \nmeals. Tony also assisted the Community Action Agency in the \ndevelopment of a Head Start Center in Cedarville. Appropriately, this \ncenter will be dedicated as the ``Autore Center, Community Action \nAgency Head Start''.\n  I am confident that my colleagues in the Senate will join with me in \nthanking Tony Autore for his outstanding service to his community and \ncongratulate him on receiving this high honor from the Community Action \nAgency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11831-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   KEN FERGESON, CHAIRMAN OF THE ABA\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I rise to honor an Oklahoman \nwho has climbed to the top of his profession. Today, Ken Fergeson, from \nAltus, OK, is being installed as the American Bankers Association \nchairman. He is also the chairman of National Bank Commerce in Altus.\n  Ken has been active in the ABA for many years. He has chaired its \nGovernment Relations Council, Community Bankers Council, a joint trade \nassociation Credit Union Steering Committee and Minbanc Capital Corp., \nin addition to serving on the board of the Corporation for American \nBanking. He also served on the ABA Communications Council, Education \nFoundation and Professional Development Council, and chaired the \nOklahoma Banker's Association.\n  After graduating from college Ken began his career at Liberty Bank in \nOklahoma City. A native Texan, Ken had interviewed and considered a \nbetter job offer from a Houston Bank, but he decided to go with the \nLiberty job in part because, as he joked, it had cheaper parking.\n  It was at Liberty that Ken first became involved in the ABA and the \nOklahoma Bankers Association as well as numerous charitable \norganizations, trade groups and civic organizations.\n  After leaving Liberty, Ken went on to purchase National Bank Commerce \nin Altus. At the time of the purchase the 38-year-old father of two \ndidn't have the money to buy the bank, but he knew if he could somehow \nfind it he could make the venture work. So he decided to take some \nrisks that he admits were ``stupid'' in retrospect: he got the biggest \nloan he could get, sold his house, withdrew his kid's college funds, \nand issued debentures and subordinated notes. His risk was rewarded as \nhe expanded the bank's markets and customer base.\n  Ken's success has grown over the decades, and for good reason. He \nconducts business with one concern in mind: What is best for the \ncustomer? He understands that a bank that conducts business in this \nmanner will retain customers for life. Ken tells his employees not to \n``sell anything you wouldn't sell your mother.'' Many today will see \nthis mentality as old fashioned, but you can't argue with success.\n  When Ken was approached by his daughter about her desire to be a \nforeign missionary, his response was telling of his view of his \nbusiness. He encouraged her to come to work for the bank. Ken noted \nthat there is no greater mission field than the ``ministry of \nbanking.'' In his own words he explains that the banking industry helps \npeople ``plan for their children's education, or buy their first home, \nor plan for retirement, or expand a business. If those outcomes are not \na ministry, I don't know what is.''\n  The next chairman of the ABA will bring this experience and worldview \nto bear upon his new post.

A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nlimit the number of packer-owned swine that certain packers may \nslaughter in any calendar year; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwill set a ceiling on vertical integration in the pork industry. \nSpecifically, this bill will make it unlawful for any packer with an \nannual slaughter capacity of more than 20 million swine to slaughter \nmore than 10 million packer-owned swine in any calendar year.\n  I am offering this because I believe the pork industry is at a \ncritical juncture due to the impending sale of Farmland's pork \ndivision.\n  Either we stop the trend toward vertical integration, or we prepare \nfor the inevitable ``chicken-ization'' of the pork industry.\n  It is vital that we sustain a place in the market for the independent \npork producer. This legislation will at least limit the cancerous \ngrowth of vertical integration until we can pass a cure.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1644\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the adjustment of status of certain \nforeign agricultural workers, to amend the Immigration and Nationality \nAct to reform the H-2A worker program under that Act, to provide a \nstable, legal agricultural workforce, to extend basic legal protections \nand better working conditions to more workers, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today the \nintroduction of bipartisan farmworker reform legislation with a \nbipartisan group of Members in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. Our leading sponsors include Senator Ted Kennedy, \nCongressman Howard Berman, and Congressman Chris Cannon.\n  The name of the bill says it all--``AgJOBS.'' That stands for the \n``Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2003.'' \nWe are introducing this bill today because Members of Congress realize \nour Nation is facing a growing crisis--for farm workers, growers, and \nthe wider public. We want and need a stable, predictable, legal work \nforce in American agriculture.\n  Willing American workers deserve a system that puts them first in \nline for available jobs with fair market wages. We want all workers to \nreceive decent treatment and protection of fundamental legal rights. \nConsumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. American \ncitizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders and a government that \nworks.\n  Yet Americans are being threatened on all these counts, because \nagriculture, more than any other sector of the economy, has become \ndependent for its existence on the labor of immigrants who are here \nwithout legal documentation. The only program currently in place to \nrespond to a lack of legal domestic workers, the H-2A Guest Workers \nProgram, is profoundly broken. Outside of H-2A, farm employers have no \neffective, reliable assurance that their employees are legal. Our own \ngovernment has estimated that half of the total 1.6 million \nagricultural work force are not legally authorized to work in this \ncountry, based, astoundingly, on self-disclosure in worker surveys. \nResponsible private estimates run to 85 percent.\n  Several more times in recent months, we have read of the senseless \nand inhuman deaths of farmworkers being smuggled illegally into the \nUnited States. Those who survive to work in the fields are among the \nmost vulnerable persons in this country, unable to assert the most \nbasic legal rights and protections. This situation never was \nacceptable. It has become intolerable. Immigrants not legally \nauthorized to work in this country know they must work in hiding. They \nhave been known to pay ``coyotes''--labor smugglers--thousands of \ndollars to be smuggled into this country. They cannot even claim basic \nlegal rights and protections. They are vulnerable to predation and \nexploitation. They sometimes have been stuffed inhumanly into \ndangerously enclosed truck trailers and car trunks, in order to be \ntransported, hidden from the view of the law. We heard with horror of \nthe young girl who died this summer when a labor smuggler abandoned her \nentire family in the desert in the Southwest.\n\n  In contrast, legal workers have legal protections. They can assert \nwage, safety, and other legal protections. They can bargain openly and \njoin unions. H-2A workers, in fact, are guaranteed housing and \ntransportation. Time is running out for American agriculture, \nfarmworkers, and consumers. What was a problem years ago is a crisis \ntoday and will be a catastrophe if we do not act immediately. A growing \nnumber of family farms simply are going out of business as growers try \nto, but cannot, secure a legal work force. All Americans face the \ndanger of losing more and more of our safe, domestic food supply to \nimports.\n  Many farmers have seen recently hired workers scattered unpredictably \nby a government letter or random raid. As enforcement of our \nimmigration and employment documentation laws has been stepped up--\nsporadically and haphazardly--workers are rarely deported,\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\nbut the workplace is frequently and widely disrupted. Between \ncomputerized checking by the Social Security Administration and audits \nand raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, more and more \nemployers have discovered they have undocumented employees. More and \nmore workers here illegally are being discovered and evicted from their \njobs. The larger the so-called ``underground economy,'' the harder it \nis to knowledgeably and effectively provide for our homeland security \nneeds.\n  The H-2A status quo is complicated and legalistic. The Department of \nLabor's compliance manual alone is more than 300 pages long. A General \nAccounting Office study found that DOL missed deadlines in processing \nH-2A applications 40 percent of the time. For workers and growers \nalike, the H-2A status quo is slow, bureaucratic, and inflexible. It \ndoes nothing to recognize the uncertainties farmers face, from changes \nin the weather to global market demands. The current H-2A process is so \nhard to use, it will place only about 40,000 legal guest workers this \nyear--2 to 3 percent of the total agricultural work force.\n  The answer is AgJOBS. This farmworker reform legislation builds upon \nsome six years of discussion and ideas from among growers, farmworker \nadvocates, Latino and immigration issue groups, Members of both parties \nin both Houses of Congress, and others. The coming together of all \nthese diverse viewpoints and interests makes AgJOBS truly an historic \npiece of legislation. Our AgJOBS bill offers a thoughtful, two-step \nsolution. On a one-time basis, experienced, trusted workers with a \nsignificant work history in American agriculture would be allowed to \nstay here legally and earn adjustment to legal status. For workers and \ngrowers using the H-2A legal guest worker program, that program would \nbe overhauled and made more streamlined, practical, and secure. AgJOBS \ntakes a win-win-win approach for our nation, workers, and farmers.\n  AgJOBS may be no one's idea of perfect labor and immigration \nlegislation in an ideal world. However, for the imperfect world we live \nin, it is a balanced, practical, and achievable approach to resolving \nurgent problems that require immediate attention. The broad bipartism \nsupport for this approach is reflected already in the cosponsorship of \na number of our colleagues. Among others, I am happy we are joined by \nSenators Gordon Smith and Bob Graham as original cosponsors, both of \nwhom have invested years of work in this issue. Supporters of this \nlegislation include the United Farm Workers of America, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, and the AFL-CIO, all of whom participated in a \npress conference the principal sponsors held earlier today, as well as \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This bill has overwhelming support in the \nagriculture community, including the National Council of Agricultural \nEmployers, the American Nursery and Landscape Association, and the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list from the \nAgriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform that includes a large \nnumber of agricultural groups around the country who support this bill. \nI also ask unanimous consent to print a technical summary of the bill; \na side-by-side comparison with current law; an open letter to Congress \nfrom our former Secretary of Agriculture, Ambassador Clayton Yeutter; \nand the next of the AgJOBS bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform\n\n\n                           national co-chairs\n\n       American Nursery & Landscape Association;

Eligible applicants would be granted temporary \n     resident status. If the farmworker performs at least 360 work \n     days of agricultural employment during the 6-year period \n     ending on August 31, 2009, including at least 240 work days \n     during the first 3 years following adjustment, and at least \n     75 days of agricultural work during each of three 12-month \n     periods in the 6-years following adjustment to temporary \n     resident status, the farmworker may apply for permanent \n     resident status.\n       During the period of temporary resident status the \n     farmworker is employment authorized, and can travel abroad \n     and re-enter the United States. Workers adjusting to \n     temporary resident status may work in non-agricultural \n     occupations, as long as their agricultural work requirements \n     are met. While in temporary resident status, workers may \n     select their employers and may switch employers. During the \n     period of temporary resident status, the farmworker's spouse \n     and minor children who are residing in the United States may \n     remain in the United States, but are not employment \n     authorized. The spouse and minor children may adjust to \n     permanent resident status once the farmworker adjusts to \n     permanent resident status. Unauthorized workers who do not \n     apply or are not qualified for adjustment to temporary \n     resident status are subject to removal. Temporary residents \n     under this program who do not fulfill the agricultural work \n     requirement or are inadmissible under immigration law or \n     commit a felony or three or more misdemeanors as temporary \n     residents are denied adjustment to permanent resident status \n     and are subject to removal. The adjustment program is funded \n     through application fees.\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\n     titles ii and iii--reform of the h-2a temporary and seasonal \n                      agricultural worker program\n\n       This section modifies the existing H-2A temporary and \n     seasonal foreign agricultural worker program. Employers \n     desiring to employ H-2A foreign workers in seasonal jobs (10 \n     months or less) will file an application and a job offer with \n     the Secretary of Labor. If the application and job offer \n     meets the requirements of the program and there are no \n     obvious deficiencies the Secretary must approve the \n     application. Employers must seek to employ qualified U.S. \n     workers prior to the arrival of H-2A foreign workers by \n     filing a job order with a local job service office at least \n     28 days prior to date of need and also authorizing the \n     posting of the job on an electronic job registry.\n       All workers in job opportunities covered by an H-2A \n     application must be provided with workers' compensation \n     insurance, and no job may be filled by an H-2A worker that is \n     vacant because the previous occupant is on strike or involved \n     in a labor dispute. If the job is covered by a collective \n     bargaining agreement, the employer must also notify the \n     bargaining agent of the filing of the application. If the \n     job opportunity is not covered by a collective bargaining \n     agreement, the employer is required to provide additional \n     benefits, as follows. The employer must provide housing at \n     no cost, or a monetary housing allowance where the \n     governor of a State has determined that there is \n     sufficient migrant housing available, to workers whose \n     place of residence is beyond normal commuting distance. \n     The employer must also reimburse inbound and return \n     transportation costs to workers who meet employment \n     requirements and who travel more than 100 miles to come to \n     work for the employer. The employer must also guarantee \n     employment for at least three quarters of the period of \n     employment, and assure at least the highest of the \n     applicable statutory minimum wage, the prevailing wage in \n     the occupation and area of intended employment, or a \n     reformed Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR). If the AEWR \n     applies, it will not be higher than that existing on 1/01/\n     03 and if Congress fails to enact a new wage rate within 3 \n     years, the AEWR will be indexed to the change in the \n     consumer price index, capped at 4 percent per year \n     beginning December 1, 2006. Employers must meet specific \n     motor vehicle safety standards.\n       H-2A foreign workers are admitted for the duration of the \n     initial job, not to exceed 10 months, and may extend their \n     stay if recruited for additional seasonal jobs, to a maximum \n     continuous stay of 3 years, after which the H-2A foreign \n     worker must depart the United States. H-2A foreign workers \n     are authorized to be employed only in the job opportunity and \n     by the employer for which they were admitted. Workers who \n     abandon their employment or are terminated for cause must be \n     reported by the employer, and are subject to removal. H-2A \n     foreign workers are provided with a counterfeit resistant \n     identity and employment authorization document.\n       The Secretary of Labor is required to provide a process for \n     filing, investigating and disposing of complaints, and may \n     order back wages and civil money penalties for program \n     violators. The Secretary of Homeland Security may order \n     debarment of violators for up to 2 years. H-2A workers are \n     provided with a limited Federal private right of action to \n     enforce the requirements of housing, transportation, wages, \n     the employment guarantee, motor vehicle safety, retaliation \n     and any other written promises in the employer's job offer. \n     Either party may request mediation after the filing of the \n     complaint. State contract claims seeking to enforce terms of \n     the H-2A program are preempted by the limited Federal right \n     of action. No other State law rights are preempted or \n     restricted.\n       The administration of the H-2A program is funded through a \n     user fee paid by agricultural employers.\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH23SE6.008\n\n\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\n Text of Open Letter to Congress on Agricultural Labor Reform, August, \n                                  2003\n\n       The recent tragic truck-trailer deaths of Mexican workers \n     seeking illegal entry to the U.S. have raised once again the \n     wisdom and feasibility of our immigration policies at the \n     U.S./Mexico border. This is an issue that many of us in \n     American agriculture have tried to address over the years, \n     but few have listened. Perhaps our views can now be heard.\n       Many of the workers entering the U.S. from Mexico are \n     hoping for jobs on farms or in nurseries. As you know, such \n     jobs often await them, for thousands of American farmers \n     wonder every year whether they'll have dependable help at \n     harvest time. This is especially critical for our fruit and \n     vegetable industries, where the ``open window'' for harvest \n     can be very short-lived. But similar concerns are now \n     emerging in many other farm enterprises, ranging from dairy \n     to poultry to greenhouse crops to beef to Christmas trees. \n     This has become a national problem, and a recurring nightmare \n     for our agricultural employers nationwide.\n       Government statistics and other evidence suggest that at \n     least 50% and perhaps 70% of the current agricultural \n     workforce is not in this country legally. The immediate \n     reaction of some is to say that these workers have broken the \n     law and should be deported, and that U.S. farmers and other \n     employers have brought this problem on themselves by not \n     doing a better job of detecting fraudulent documents.\n       That ``easy'' answer ignores the reality that few Americans \n     are drawn to highly seasonal and physically demanding work in \n     agriculture. At chaotic harvest times, a stable, dependable \n     workforce is essential. Instead, American farmers are in a \n     ``damned if you do, damned if you don't'' situation where \n     they're required by law to be policemen, immigration \n     officials, and security experts while simultaneously trying \n     to get their crops harvested before they spoil.\n       My experience over many years tells me that agricultural \n     employers do not want to hire illegal immigrants. What they \n     want is a stable, viable program with integrity that will \n     meet their labor force needs in a timely, effective way. What \n     they do not want is a program with major shortcomings, for \n     which they will inevitably be blamed. Unfortunately, that is \n     what our laws have imposed upon them.\n       As a nation, we can and must do better--for agricultural \n     employers and for immigrant workers. Many of these workers \n     have come to the U.S. on a regular basis. Many have lived \n     here for years doing our toughest jobs, and some would like \n     to earn the privilege of living here permanently. Why not \n     permit them to do so, over a specified timeframe, thereby \n     keeping the best workers here? That has the additional \n     advantage of permitting our government to better focus its \n     limited monitoring/enforcement resources, particularly where \n     security may be a concern. Let's use entry/exit tracking, \n     tamper proof documentation, biometric identification, etc. \n     where it will truly pay security dividends, and let's stop \n     painting all immigrants with the same brush.\n       A limited, earned legalization for agriculture is nothing \n     like an amnesty program. It would apply only to immigrants \n     who are at work, paying taxes, and are willing to earn their \n     way to citizenship so that they can share in the American \n     dream. These workers form the foundation of much of our \n     nation's agricultural workforce. We need them!\n       Agricultural employers need an updated guest work program \n     to replace the antiquated ``H2A'' temporary worker system, \n     which is too expensive and too bureaucratic to be of \n     practical use. Necessary reforms include fair and stronger \n     security and identification measures, market-based wage \n     rates, and comprehensive application procedures.\n       The reform program I have outlined already has broad \n     bipartisan support, thanks to the good work and leadership of \n     Sens. Larry Craig, Gordon Smith, Ted Kennedy, and Bob Graham, \n     among others, and a bipartisan group of House colleagues. \n     Their work product deserves immediate and serious \n     consideration by the Congress. The status quo is simply \n     unacceptable. It puts both American employers and immigrant \n     workers in an untenable situation--with a high cost in \n     economic efficiency, respect for the law, and sometimes even \n     in human life. The reforms now being proposed are a practical \n     solution to a serious problem that is evolving into a \n     national crisis.\n       As President Bush has stated, we can and must do better to \n     match a willing and hardworking immigrant worker with \n     producers who are in desperate need of a lawful workforce. It \n     is time, and in our great country's interest, to enact these \n     reforms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Clayton Yeutter\n     (Former Agriculture Secretary and U.S. Trade Representative).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

No proceeding shall be conducted under \n     this subparagraph with respect to a termination unless the \n     Secretary determines that the complaint was filed not later \n     than 6 months after the date of the termination.\n       (ii) Initiation of arbitration.--If the Secretary finds \n     that a complaint has been filed in accordance with clause (i) \n     and there is reasonable cause to believe that the complainant \n     was terminated without just cause, the Secretary shall \n     initiate binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the \n     Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to appoint a \n     mutually agreeable arbitrator from the roster of arbitrators \n     maintained by such Service for the geographical area in which \n     the employer is located. The procedures and rules of such \n     Service shall be applicable to the selection of such \n     arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Secretary \n     shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.\n       (iii) Arbitration proceedings.--The arbitrator shall \n     conduct the proceeding in accordance with the policies and \n     procedures promulgated by the American Arbitration \n     Association applicable to private arbitration of employment \n     disputes. The arbitrator shall make findings respecting \n     whether the termination was for just cause. The arbitrator \n     may not find that the termination was for just cause unless \n     the employer so demonstrates by a preponderance of the \n     evidence. If the arbitrator finds that the termination was \n     not for just cause, the arbitrator shall make a specific \n     finding of the number of days or hours of work lost by the \n     employee as a result of the termination. The arbitrator shall \n     have no authority to order any other remedy, including, but \n     not limited to, reinstatement, back pay, or front pay to the \n     affected employee.

fees.--The parties shall bear \n     the cost of their own attorney's fees involved in the \n     litigation of the complaint.\n       (vi) Nonexclusive remedy.--The complaint process provided \n     for in this subparagraph is in addition to any other rights \n     an employee may have in accordance with applicable law.\n       (vii) Effect on other actions or proceedings.--Any finding \n     of fact or law, judgment, conclusion, or final order made by \n     an arbitrator in the proceeding before the Secretary shall \n     not be conclusive or binding in any separate or subsequent \n     action or proceeding between the employee and the employee's \n     current or prior employer brought before an arbitrator, \n     administrative agency, court, or judge of any State or the \n     United States, regardless of whether the prior action was \n     between the same or related parties or involved the same \n     facts, except that the arbitrator's specific finding of the \n     number of days or hours of work lost by the employee as a \n     result of the employment termination may be referred to the \n     Secretary pursuant to clause (iv).\n       (C) Civil penalties.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Secretary finds, after notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that an employer of an alien \n     granted temporary resident status under subsection (a) has \n     failed to provide the record of employment required under \n     subsection (a)(5) or has provided a false statement of \n     material fact in such a record, the employer shall be subject \n     to a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 \n     per violation.\n       (ii) Limitation.--The penalty applicable under clause (i) \n     for failure to provide records shall not apply unless the \n     alien has provided the employer with evidence of employment \n     authorization granted under this section.\n       (c) Adjustment to Permanent Residence.--\n       (1) Agricultural workers.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     the Secretary shall adjust the status of an alien granted \n     lawful temporary resident status under subsection (a) to that \n     of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the \n     Secretary determines that the following requirements are \n     satisfied:\n       (i) Qualifying employment.--The alien has performed at \n     least 2,060 hours or 360 work days, whichever is less, of \n     agricultural employment in the United States, during the \n     period beginning on September 1, 2003, and ending on August \n     31, 2009.\n       (ii) Qualifying years.--The alien has performed at least \n     430 hours or 75 work days, whichever is less, of agricultural \n     employment in the United States in at least 3 nonoverlapping \n     periods of 12 consecutive months during the period beginning \n     on September 1, 2003, and ending on August 31, 2009. \n     Qualifying periods under this clause may include \n     nonconsecutive 12-month periods.\n       (iii) Qualifying work in first 3 years.--The alien has \n     performed at least 1,380 hours or 240 work days, whichever is \n     less, of agricultural employment during the period beginning \n     on September 1, 2003, and ending on August 31, 2006.\n       (iv) Application period.--The alien applies for adjustment \n     of status not later than August 31, 2010.\n       (v) Proof.--In meeting the requirements of clauses (i), \n     (ii), and (iii), an alien may submit the record of employment \n     described in subsection (a)(5) or such documentation as may \n     be submitted under subsection (d)(3).\n       (vi) Disability.--In determining whether an alien has met \n     the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the \n     Secretary shall credit the alien with any work days lost \n     because the alien was unable to work in agricultural \n     employment due to injury or disease arising out of and in the \n     course of the alien's agricultural employment, if the alien \n     can establish such disabling injury or disease through \n     medical records.\n       (B) Grounds for denial of adjustment of status.--The \n     Secretary may deny an alien adjustment to permanent resident \n     status, and provide for termination of the temporary resident \n     status granted such alien under subsection (a), if--\n       (i) the Secretary finds by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that the adjustment to temporary resident status was the \n     result of fraud or willful misrepresentation, as described in \n     section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)); or\n       (ii) the alien--\n\n       (I) commits an act that makes the alien inadmissible to the \n     United States under section 212 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182), except as provided under \n     subsection (e)(2); or\n       (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors \n     committed in the United States.\n\n       (C) Grounds for removal.--Any alien granted temporary \n     resident status under subsection (a) who does not apply for \n     adjustment of status under this subsection before the \n     expiration of the application period described in \n     subparagraph (A)(iv), or who fails to meet the other \n     requirements of subparagraph (A) by the end of the applicable \n     period, is deportable and may be removed under section 240 of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a). The \n     Secretary shall issue regulations establishing grounds to \n     waive subparagraph (A)(iii) with respect to an alien who has \n     completed at least 200 days of the work requirement specified \n     in such subparagraph in the event of a natural disaster which \n     substantially limits the availability of agricultural \n     employment or a personal emergency that prevents compliance \n     with such subparagraph.\n       (2) Spouses and minor children.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary shall confer the status of lawful \n     permanent resident on the spouse and minor child of an alien \n     granted status under paragraph (1), including any individual \n     who was a minor child on the date such alien was granted \n     temporary resident status, if the spouse or minor child \n     applies for such status, or if the principal alien includes \n     the spouse or minor child in an application for adjustment of \n     status to that of a lawful permanent resident.\n       (B) Treatment of spouses and minor children prior to \n     adjustment of status.--A spouse and minor child of an alien \n     granted temporary resident status under subsection (a) may \n     not be--\n       (i) removed while such alien maintains such status; and\n       (ii) granted authorization to engage in employment in the \n     United States or be provided an ``employment authorized'' \n     endorsement or other work permit, unless such employment \n     authorization is granted under another provision of law.\n       (d) Applications.--\n       (1) To whom may be made.--\n       (A) Within the united states.--The Secretary shall provide \n     that--\n       (i) applications for temporary resident status under \n     subsection (a) may be filed--\n\n       (I) with the Secretary, but only if the applicant is \n     represented by an attorney; or\n       (II) with a qualified designated entity (designated under \n     paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the \n     forwarding of the application to the Secretary; and\n\n       (ii) applications for adjustment of status under subsection \n     (c) shall be filed directly with the Secretary.\n       (B) Outside the united states.--The Secretary, in \n     cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall establish a \n     procedure whereby an alien may apply for temporary resident \n     status under subsection (a) at an appropriate consular office \n     outside the United States.\n       (C) Preliminary applications.--\n       (i) In general.--During the application period described in \n     subsection (a)(1)(B), the Secretary may grant admission to \n     the United States as a temporary resident and provide an \n     ``employment authorized'' endorsement or other appropriate \n     work permit to any alien who presents a preliminary \n     application for such status under subsection (a) at a \n     designated port of entry on the southern\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n     land border of the United States.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and \nSecurity Act.\n  The treatment of immigrant farm workers, dating back to the Bracero \nprogram, represents a shameful chapter in our history. The decades of \nexploitation these workers have endured continues to this day. Large \nnumbers of men and women employed in agriculture today are \nindispensable workers who also happen to be undocumented. As a result, \nthey are easily exploited by unscrupulous employers, who get away with \npaying them very low wages and forcing them to work in dangerous \nconditions. Inevitably, that means lower wages for legal farm workers.\n  We have been struggling for decades to find a solution to this \nemotional heart-wrenching problem. This legislation--a historic and \nfar-reaching agreement between the United Farm Workers of America and \nthe representatives of agricultural industries--provides a common sense \nsolution to this long-standing problem. It will provide farm workers \nand their families with dignity and justice and give agricultural \nindustries with a legal workforce.\n  We need an agriculture policy grounded in reality, a policy that \nrecognizes their contributions and respects and rewards their work. \nThis legislation will improve the wages and working conditions of all \nfarm workers, and provide a way for foreign-born workers to become \npermanent residents.\n  Under this bill, 500,000 farm workers currently working the United \nStates will be able to legalize their status. These changes will \nbenefit both workers and growers. The legislation will improve the \nwages and working conditions of all farm workers, and provide a way for \nforeign-born workers to become permanent residents.\n  Agriculture is a unique industry. Growers must have an immediate and \nreliable workforce at harvest time. Everyone is harmed when crops rot \nin the field because the workers are not available. With these changes, \ngrowers will have greater access to dependable, hard-working employees, \nand a workforce that is no longer subject to sudden immigration raids.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this needed legislation. These \nreforms are long overdue, to improve the lives and working conditions \nof all farm workers, and it is long past time for Congress to act.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts and Senator Craig of Idaho, in \nintroducing the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act \nof 2003. For the last six years, I have been working closely with \nseveral of my colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives, \nincluding the Senators from Massachusetts and Idaho, to enact \nlegislation that would provide a balanced approach to reforming our \nagricultural guest worker program.\n  There is one thing I believe we can all agree on--the status quo of \nagricultural guest workers in America is unacceptable. Under the status \nquo, we have created an underground society and pushed many of our \nNation's hardest workers into the shadows. This is unfair treatment for \nworkers who play such a vital part in our Nation's economic health.\n  Recently, the Miami Herald published a series documenting the \nhorrible working and living conditions of agricultural workers in \nFlorida. I have attached parts of that series for the Record. This \nseries substantiates what we have all known anecdotally for years. Farm \nworkers in our country--those who are legal citizens or residents of \nthe United States as well as those who are undocumented--live in \nuninhabitable housing, are transported in vehicles that do not meet \nbasic safety standards, and are subject to predatory lending practices \nthat require payment of as much as 100 percent interest on accumulated \ndebt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the series be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the series was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Aug. 31, 2003]\n\n Fields of Despair--Florida Farmhands Reap a Harvest of Poverty, Pain \n                            and Exploitation\n\n                           (By Ronnie Green)\n\n                          First of three parts\n\n       Jacksonville.--The recruiters come rolling through in roomy \n     vans, searching for a fresh crop of farmworkers from the \n     homeless shelters, haggard parks and soup kitchens dotting \n     North Florida's urban hubs.\n       They target the addicted, the vulnerable, the desperate \n     with promises of good pay, cash upfront, cold beer. Some talk \n     of crack cocaine and ready sex.\n       Step inside that van, say those who have, and journey \n     straight to hell.\n       Florida is America's second-richest agricultural state. But \n     for the farmhands who labor along the lowest rung of the food \n     chain, the riches are a mirage.\n       Their world is filled with sweatshop hours, slum housing, \n     poverty pay and criminal abuse. At its extreme, it includes \n     modern-day slavery in a state where oranges adorn license \n     plates and tourists pull in for a free cup of juice when they \n     cross the border.\n       The brutality in North Florida has an unusual, bitter \n     twist, a Herald examination has found. While most farmworkers \n     in Florida and nationwide are undocumented Mexicans who have \n     trekked through the desert in search of fortune, the laborers \n     who toil unnoticed in hamlets like East Palatka and Hastings \n     are mostly poor black Americans.\n       They are recruited by crew-chief contractors who serve as \n     middlemen between the farmers who grow crops and the laborers \n     who pick, package and sort them. These bosses can control \n     nearly every aspect of the workers' lives: their housing, \n     their food, their transportation and even their paycheck.\n       In interviews with The Herald, farmworkers told harrowing \n     stories of life in a hot stretch of North Florida farm \n     country that welcomes passersby with signs saying ``Jesus is \n     Lord, Welcome to Hastings'' and ``Florida's Potato Capital.''\n       Many were recruited from gathering spots for the homeless--\n     soup kitchens, parks and shelters in Jacksonville, Orlando, \n     Tampa. They say they were lured with vows of good pay, \n     sprinkled with promises of partying and $15 in cash when they \n     reached the farm.\n       What they didn't know: They would live in slum housing, \n     work long hours for scant pay, and, in several cases, have to \n     pay back $1 of interest for most every $1 loaned to them to \n     buy food--including the $15 that first lured them into the \n     van.\n       Poor, isolated, without transportation, these men said they \n     became slaves to the\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\n     boss and their debts. One said he was beaten about the face \n     this year when he couldn't repay his ``debt.'' Two nights \n     later, he slipped away at midnight and walked for hours to \n     escape.\n\n\n                           cases investigated\n\n           Focus is on recruitment by farm labor contractors\n\n       Federal prosecutors are now examining cases in which North \n     Florida farm labor contractors recruited from homeless \n     shelters--only to exploit the laborers who stepped into those \n     vans. Investigators confirmed the inquiry, but would not \n     elaborate.\n       ``We've been contacted about this situation,'' Douglas \n     Molloy, managing assistant U.S. attorney in Fort Myers, said \n     last week.\n       One former worker, Angelo Jennings, said a Hastings crew \n     boss lured him from a scraggly lot across from the Clara \n     White Mission in Jacksonville, a lot where birds snip at \n     dirty bread and shopping carts and beer cans cover the \n     grounds.\n       ``This is when he catches you at your lowest point,'' said \n     Jennings, a recovering drug addict working to reform his \n     ways. ``If you have any good sense, he doesn't want you. He \n     wants you where he can use you.\n       ``If you're tired and hungry, they'll go out and buy some \n     food and a six-pack, and put it on ice.''\n       Then, almost as an afterthought, he said: ``Just like a rat \n     trying to get some cheese.''\n       The mission's chief executive officer, Ju'Coby Pittman, \n     said: ``They go from shelter to shelter and prey on them''\n       Such tactics became so routine, and the promises so hollow, \n     that Pittman once posted a sign: ``Do not get in the van.''\n       But the vans still roll through here, through Tampa, \n     through Orlando, on the road to farm country.\n\n\n                            a big farm state\n\n         Abuse is an unseen element in Florida's No. 2 industry\n\n       Agriculture is a huge business in Florida. The state \n     produces three-fourths of the citrus harvested across the \n     United States each year, and it leads the world in production \n     of grapefruit. In 2000, the top 10 vegetable growers in the \n     Southeastern United States were based in Florida. Across the \n     country, only California boasts a richer agricultural crop.\n       Yet behind the sunny image of Florida's No. 2 industry, \n     abuse abounds, and it is not limited to one rough boss or one \n     patch of hard-luck laborers.\n       ``It's incredibly widespread,'' said prosecutor Molloy, who \n     has previously sent bosses away for enslaving farmworkers. \n     ``There is someone who has been making money off the misery--\n     and off the hopes and dreams--of other people.''\n       At the bottom rung of the system are the 200,000 seasonal \n     farmworkers who harvest crops from outside the State's urban \n     hubs to its dusty corridors.\n       ``You've made a job so bad that the only people who are \n     going to do farm work are undocumented aliens or crack \n     addicts,'' said Gregory S. Schell, a Lake Worth lawyer with \n     the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project of Florida Legal \n     Services. ``That's a tremendous indictment of the \n     agricultural industry.''\n       His criticism is not of the workers who harvest Florida's \n     bountiful crops, but of the industry enriched by their sweat \n     labor.\n       Most pickers in Florida and nationwide are undocumented \n     foreign workers, and many native farmhands have had run-ins \n     with the law. There is a reason for that worker profile, \n     advocates say: Crew bosses hire the vulnerable because they \n     can exploit them. The laborers, hungry for a fresh start, are \n     quick to take the job.\n       Florida is home to more crew-chief contractors than any \n     State in the Nation, with more than one in three--3,027 of \n     8,832--based in the State. Florida also leads the Nation in \n     the number of crew-chief contractors and assistants currently \n     stripped of licenses to work because of labor violations, \n     with 43 percent of the total, The Herald has found. They have \n     relegated workers to shabby housing, cheated them of pay or \n     otherwise skirted Federal migrant worker laws.\n       For a glimpse inside this world, follow Lisa Butler, a \n     Florida Rural Legal Services attorney representing workers \n     who fled their contractors' employ in far North Florida.\n       Butler does her legwork at night and in potentially \n     dangerous environs, visiting housing camps to pass out fliers \n     letting workers know their rights. More than once, she has \n     been confronted by crew chiefs or their workers.\n       ``There is a pattern up here of severe violations,'' Butler \n     said as she wheeled through Hastings and Spuds and East \n     Palatka, on her way to the next cramped housing camp. ``It's \n     a function of how this industry lets crew leaders control the \n     pay.''\n       The picture she sees evokes images of America's darkest \n     days.\n       ``I felt like being a slave, just working to support his \n     family,'' farmworker Isiah Brown, 43, a native of South \n     Carolina, said of the boss who controlled him.\n       That boss, Ronald M. Jones, is a six-foot-four, 250-pound \n     homegrown son who spins through town in a muscular Cadillac \n     Escalade and flashes cash he gets from Florida farmers to \n     employ laborers at the lowest, dirtiest rung of the chain. He \n     did not respond to multiple interview requests.\n\n\n                           start of a journey\n\n          Promise of work and pay is irresistible--and elusive\n\n       Brown's journey to Jones began on a Sunday in Orlando, when \n     another farm recruiter approached him as he lounged in a \n     park. There's work up north, the man said. Honest day, honest \n     pay.\n       Brown hopped in, traveling 100 miles to Hastings and \n     neighboring East Palatka, where he ultimately lived in a \n     squalid, illegal hellhole for farmworkers operated by Jones \n     and stood for long hours sorting potatoes for a few dollars' \n     pay.\n       Brown came to the job poor and said boss Jones made him \n     poorer, fronting him cash for food and supplies, but demand \n     $1 in interest for most ever $1 loaned. With no car and \n     little cash, he was captive to the debts--struggling to work \n     enough hours to pay back the 100 percent interest.\n       Five former workers said in interviews that Jones forced \n     the same arrangement on them.\n       ``It was the only way I could eat,'' Brown said. ``This \n     farm thing, you put in the work, but the money just don't \n     match the work.''\n       In East Palatka, he slept in a decrepit trailer along with \n     nine other farmworkers in a trashy compound that housed up to \n     two dozen workers. His trailer had no running water and no \n     air conditioning.\n       When workers returned to the camp after long days, area \n     drug dealers and bootleggers showed up, Brown said, the \n     bootleggers selling 65-cent beer for $1.25.\n       ``Everybody makes money off farmworkers,'' he said at a \n     nearby park days after fleeing. ``It seems like when \n     farmworkers come to town, everything goes up 20 percent.''\n\n\n                          hiring of farmhands\n\n         Homeless people in park described as ``easy targets''\n\n       Crew leader Jones was employed by Bulls-Hit Ranch & Farm, \n     maker of gourmet potato chips, to provide farm laborers like \n     Brown.\n       William Oglesby, 50, a one-time truck driver, also worked \n     at Bulls-Hit under Jones and lived in the same compound.\n       Like Brown, he had been recruited where the homeless \n     congregate, at Confederate Park in Jacksonville. ``Most of \n     them were easy targets,'' Oglesby said.\n       He said he wasn't homeless but needed work. ``They told me \n     I could go with them today and work,'' he said ``And they \n     said I could make some money. But money, I haven't seen.''\n       One week, Oglesby calculated, he should have earned $300 by \n     sorting potatoes and packing them into trucks, rising at 5:30 \n     a.m. and sometimes not returning to the camp until 10 p.m.\n       His pay stub from Jones showed $154.51. Bug Oglesby--like \n     Brown--said even the pay stub did not reflect what actually \n     went into his pocket. To understand how that could happen, \n     follow the money.\n       Bulls-Hit President Thomas R. Lee said he would write Jones \n     a check each week to cover the work completed. But then the \n     boss, not the farmer, was responsible for paying workers from \n     that bounty.\n       ``He pays them, I don't,'' Lee said. ``He has a daily \n     record of what he pays the crew.''\n       Lee said he told Jones not to make any loans at Bulls-Hit, \n     since such transactions on farm property could reflect upon \n     the farmer. ``I told him that whatever he did off my \n     property was his business,'' Lee said.\n       Critics say this arrangement is ripe for abuse. When crew \n     bosses control the cash, they are more apt to cheat the \n     workers below them. Simply put, every $1 they skimp from \n     workers is an extra $1 in their pocket. Jones' former workers \n     say they were cheated of thousands.\n       Contrary to the figure on his pay stub, Oglesby said he got \n     $35 in cash stuffed into an envelope at week's end. Brown \n     said he pocketed $32.06 one week.\n       The men say Jones did not pay them for all the hours they \n     worked. They say he also docked from their pay the loans and \n     interest he charged them, and billed $30 a week to live in \n     the slum complex.\n       ``They've got a way to make sure you stay in their debt,'' \n     Oglesby said. ``You don't think straight when you're tired \n     and hungry.''\n       Jones, 40, is known in these parts as ``Too Tall.'' He did \n     not reply to written questions delivered to his house in \n     Hastings, nor did he respond to three requests for an \n     interview placed with his wife, Sylvia.\n       Jennings, the Jacksonville man recruited near a homeless \n     shelter, said he lived at another Jones compound in Palatka \n     and also sorted potatoes at Bulls-Hit. He said Jones zeroed \n     in on his weakness at that scraggly Jacksonville lot, luring \n     him and four others.\n       ``I've got a deal for you, and y'all can make a lot of \n     money,'' he quoted Jones as saying. ``If you smoke crack, \n     that's the place to be.''\n       Once he was in Palatka, Jennings said, prostitutes were \n     ready visitors to the housing camp--at a cost. ``They would \n     come there and smoke crack,'' he said.\n       Jennings is working to get straight at the Trinity Rescue \n     Ministries in Jacksonville. The program supervisor, Cornell \n     Robinson, said: ``They find your weakness and they force this \n     on you.''\n       The city is a ready target for farm recruiters. The \n     Jacksonville/Duval County hub is home to nearly 15,000 \n     homeless people a year, according to a recent study by the \n     Emergency Services and Homeless Coalition of Jacksonville.\n       For the homeless who turn to farm work, the cycle can \n     become brutal. Many become fearful of talking publicly.\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\n       In late May, The Herald encountered a Jones worker at \n     another of Jones' properties, a house in Hastings. With an \n     elderly man sitting on a porch chair that day, the worker \n     said he had no complaints.\n       Later that day, the worker was carrying a sack of potatoes \n     back to the house, out of sight of the man in the chair. \n     ``That housing is unfit,'' he said, saying he was billed $30 \n     a week to live there.\n       Two months later, by chance, The Herald ran into the worker \n     outside a Jacksonville feeding line. Now free of the boss, he \n     said that ``Too Tall'' had recruited him at a soup kitchen \n     with the same tired promises: good pay, nice housing, \n     plentiful food.\n       ``Nothing was true,'' he said. ``It's a death trap. You \n     can't get out of there.''\n       He said that Jones loaned him money each day, and that a \n     Jones associate loaned him cash each afternoon. Both demanded \n     100 percent interest. The debts got so heavy, he said, \n     that one week he pocketed $1.08 for six days of work.\n       ``It keeps you in a hole you can never get out of,'' said \n     the worker, who asked that his name not be used.\n       He said the Jones associate beat him when he didn't have \n     money to repay the debt, hitting him in the face two or three \n     times and knocking him to the ground. ``He told me I better \n     have his money or I'll be in trouble.'' Two days later, he \n     made his midnight exit.\n       Misery in North Florida isn't limited to Jones' camps, and \n     poverty pay and slum housing are not the only abuses. Many \n     workers, struggling when they start their farm duty, quickly \n     find themselves in dangerous conditions. Injuries, or worse, \n     become part of the trade.\n       In January, a migrant worker at the nearby Uzzles Labor \n     Camp in Elkton was stabbed to death with a butcher knife \n     after a dispute with another laborer.\n       Three months later, attorney Butler went to the camp to \n     hand out fliers letting workers know their rights. She was \n     not well received, nor were journalists who accompanied her \n     for this report.\n       Ron Uzzle, the burly crew boss, became angry when a \n     photographer started snapping pictures. He had little \n     patience for Butler either. ``Does anyone want to talk to \n     these people?'' Uzzle bellowed.\n       ``Hell no!'' came the reply. Some of his crew members \n     refused to accept fliers from Butler as Uzzle watched. Uzzle \n     refused a request for an interview.\n       Another nearby complex housed a catalog of pain. To one \n     side of that squat blue building, Butler inspected farmworker \n     William Durham, who pulled up his shirt to expose a stomach \n     covered by an unsightly, itchy white rash.\n       Durham feared that the rash came from pesticides. ``It did \n     happen on the job,'' he told Butler. She took his story and \n     his picture.\n       Nearby, Richard Williams, 53, a picker for nine years, \n     worked without a right forefinger.\n       Wearing a T-shirt that said ``Nature Can't Be Restocked,'' \n     Williams said he thinks pesticides got under his fingernail \n     as he picked winter cabbage in North Carolina in 2001.\n       ``By the time I got here, it was too late,'' he said. The \n     finger was amputated.\n       Butler took his information. Another potential case at a \n     camp oozing booze and misery.\n       William Anderson said he heard the promises at a Tampa \n     Salvation Army shelter and went to a camp run by Ronald \n     Evans, a veteran East Palatka contractor. Evans did not reply \n     to four interview requests, nor did he respond to written \n     questions.\n       ``A van rolled around,'' Anderson recounted. ``They said, \n     `Are you looking for work? . . . We've got a swimming pool,' \n     When we got there, it was more like a slave camp. After he \n     gets you there, he's got you.''\n       At night at the camp, next to the dinner line, more goods \n     were for sale. ``You get your cigarettes, your beer and your \n     drugs. Everything was there on the camp,'' Anderson said from \n     an upstate shelter, to which he turned after leaving.\n       ``A couple of guys said they owed $10,000. You might as \n     well owe them your soul, because where can you go?\n       ``I'm not going to sugarcoat it. We were doing what \n     everyone else was doing. You do your beer, your cigarettes \n     and your drugs.''\n       After four months of work, he left with $90 in his pocket, \n     he said. ``I've been down and out. Right now, I'm sleeping \n     wherever I can.''\n       Tammy Byrer, executive director of the St. Francis House \n     shelter in St. Augustine, which provides a roof and job \n     counseling for displaced workers like Anderson, said \n     Florida's farmers surely know what's going on.\n       ``Don't ask, don't tell,'' was how she described the \n     prevailing attitude, as volunteers prepared 600 sandwiches \n     delivered daily to area farmworkers.\n       ``Somebody needs to come up to the plate.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Farm Camp ``Unsafe for Human Occupancy''\n\n                           (By Ronnie Greene)\n\n       East Palatka.--When inspectors showed up at Ronald Jones' \n     farmworker housing camp here, they found a place unfit for \n     humans.\n       Within a day in early May, the multicolored buildings were \n     condemned, with bright red ``Danger'' signs on each door: \n     ``This building is deemed unsafe for human occupancy.''\n       Inspectors found five open septic systems; bad plumbing; \n     substandard floors, roofs and ceilings--and ``evidence of \n     occupancy of the cabins'' even though the complex didn't have \n     the proper permits to house migrant workers.\n       As dragonflies buzzed overhead one May day, an exposed \n     septic tank was filled with sewage. A 32-ounce Schlitz Malt \n     Liquor bottle lay nearby.\n       ``It just was miserable living there. And I just wanted out \n     of that filth,'' farmworker Earnest Louis Mitchell, 57, said \n     in a telephone interview from a homeless shelter.\n       ``The commode wouldn't flush, you smelled all through the \n     house at night, and water was all on the floor. You could get \n     electrocuted when you went into the bathroom.''\n       He doesn't intend to go back. ``I'm just going to bum the \n     street--no more farm work.''\n       Mitchell had walked away from Jones' employ and called the \n     number on a Legal Services flier. Lisa Butler, a Florida \n     Rural Legal Services attorney, notified the state Department \n     of Health, which investigated along with the Putnam County \n     code enforcement division.\n       Jones, who owns several farm housing camps in the area, did \n     not reply to written questions. But later that May day, his \n     wife happened to stop by the housing camp.\n       ``A lot of things we didn't know about,'' said Sylvia \n     Jones, who said she co-owns the property with her husband. \n     ``It was like this when we got it.''\n       The Jones camp is just one of many around the state where \n     workers live in squalor. Yet little is done to help them--\n     unless someone complains.\n       ``Migrant workers aren't one to complain too much,'' said \n     John Salmons, the Putnam County code enforcement supervisor, \n     who examined the buildings with Code Officer Dina K. Trull.\n       ``I think they're afraid for whatever reason. If they're \n     illegal aliens or just happy to be working, we don't get a \n     lot of calls on migrant labor camps.''\n                                  ____\n\n\nThe Face of Florida's Farmworkers--Driven by Harsh Conditions in Their \n     Homelands, Laborers Travel Far, Only To See New Hardships Here\n\n                           (By Ronnie Greene)\n\n       Immokalee.--At dawn, the migrant workers huddle around the \n     red-and-blue buses that deliver them to Florida's rich farm \n     fields. One by one, they pile into the rickety carriers, \n     their fingers dirty with Florida soil, their faces weathered \n     from sun-soaked labor.\n       This is farm country, Immokalee, Florida. Just 100 short \n     miles from South Florida's urban shuffle, Immokalee feels a \n     century away. The streets are dusty, the traffic slow--\n     farmhands trudging or riding bikes, cars a luxury beyond the \n     reach of most.\n       By day, they pluck the tomatoes and oranges that are the \n     lifeblood of Florida's agriculture economy. By night, they \n     return to their modest camps, where they turn on fans to shoo \n     the heat and tally the earnings they will send back home.\n       In Immokalee, you will find the face of Florida's \n     farmworkers. While some pockets of the Sunshine State include \n     American men recruited from homeless camps to harvest crops, \n     Immokalee's workforce, mirroring the farmworker profile \n     across the nation, is largely Mexican-born.\n       The men, women and some children laboring here paid steep \n     fees for the privilege. Many walked through the desert to \n     touch U.S. soil in Arizona, then paid $1,000 or more to be \n     smuggled to Florida on the back floor of furtive vans.\n       And, like farmworkers nationwide, they struggle. Certainly, \n     the long hours under the sun provide more pay than most ever \n     earned back home.\n       But this prosperity is relative. Most farmworkers \n     nationwide earn less than poverty pay. And in Florida, some \n     have been criminally abused. Immokalee and the farm beyond it \n     have been home to three of the five farmworkers slavery \n     prosecutions brought against Florida farm contractors and \n     smugglers since 1996.\n       In 2000, the U.S. Department of Labor issued A Demographic \n     and Employment Profile of U.S. Farmworkers, which was based \n     on interviews with 4,199 farmworkers in 85 counties from 1996 \n     to 1998.\n       The study found that:\n       61 percent of U.S. farmworkers had income below the poverty \n     level.\n       The median income was less than $7,500 a year.\n       14 percent of farmworkers owned or were buying a home in \n     1997-98. Three years earlier, the ratio had been one in \n     three.\n       77 percent of U.S. farmworkers were Mexican-born.\n       More than half of America's farmworkers--52 of every 100--\n     were unauthorized workers.\n       In Immokalee, these numbers have faces.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Advocates Don't Feel Labor Department is Ally\n\n                           (By Ronnie Greene)\n\n       Farmworker advocates say the federal government does little \n     to protect the laborers whose sweat brings fruit and \n     vegetables to the state's tables.\n       Now they fear even less protection. The head of the agency \n     overseeing farm work conditions recently told Florida growers \n     that she wants to work with--not against--them.\n       ``If you have an issue with an investigator [who cites \n     you], you shouldn't just pay the money. Go up the chain of \n     command and\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\n     complain. You will get fair treatment from us,'' Tammy \n     McCutchen, the U.S. Department of Labor's wage and hour \n     administrator, told growers in Orlando last year, according \n     to an industry publication.\n       Her comments were viewed by many growers as ``the most \n     encouraging they had heard from a Department of Labor \n     administrator in years,'' Gempler's Alert newsletter said. \n     Her remarks came at a time when the department faced \n     dwindling investigative staffing.\n       In an interview with The Herald, McCutchen said critics are \n     mistaken if they accuse her office of lax supervision.\n       She said her approach is to work with companies that act in \n     ``good faith'' and if farmers don't work to fix flaws, ``we \n     will hit them hard with enforcement.''\n       ``If you can get employers to voluntarily comply early on, \n     you can do a lot better job for the workers. Instead of \n     waiting two or three years for litigation, you are able to \n     fix the problem in a few weeks or a few months.''\n       Statistics from wage and hour show the division collected \n     30 percent more in back wages for agriculture workers last \n     year than a year earlier.\n       In fiscal year 2002, it assessed $230,600 in civil \n     penalties against growers and contractors in the Southeast.\n       ``Defending one of our lawsuits cost [growers] that much,'' \n     said Rob Williams, director of the Migrant Farmworker Justice \n     Project of Florida Legal Services, which has tangled with \n     growers over wage and other inequities.\n       He believes McCutchen's message means that enforcement will \n     be rarer still.\n       McCutchen had also told growers that a checklist used to \n     inspect migrant housing would be significantly pared down, to \n     weed out minor items in order to focus on major housing \n     concerns. She said her own inspectors would undergo \n     ``professional conduct'' training to improve relations with \n     growers they inspect.\n       Other numbers support critics' concerns. The wage and hour \n     division had 945 investigators to examine agriculture and \n     other industries at the end of fiscal year 2001, but 862 as \n     of March. In Florida, the number dipped from 77 to 73 in \n     January 2003. ``I'm very proud of our enforcement efforts, no \n     matter what the raw numbers show,'' McCutchen said.\n       Last year, the Labor Department conducted an informal study \n     to see how many growers and contractors were in compliance \n     with the four main provisions of the Migrant and Seasonal \n     Agricultural Worker Protection Act. It found:\n       Thirty-nine percent did not comply with the law's \n     disclosure rules, which require employers to inform workers \n     of their rights.\n       Twenty-six percent did not comply with housing safety and \n     health rules.\n       Ten percent to 15 percent did not comply with various \n     transportation requirements.\n       Nine percent did not comply with wage laws.\n       Although the federal agency is more apt to punish labor \n     contractors, it sometimes goes after farmers.\n       In August 2002, it fined West Coast Tomato $3,650 for \n     operating a Manatee County camp in squalid condition.\n       Former Manatee County Commissioner Daniel P. McClure is \n     president of West Coast, the ninth-largest vegetable grower \n     in the Southeast.\n       At 6747 Prospect Rd. in Bradenton, inspectors found the \n     roof rotting and leaking. The garage was used as a sleeping \n     room, four beds on the floor. Gas tanks had been installed \n     without a permit.\n       McClure, who lives in a Bradenton mansion with a $1.6 \n     million market value, had blamed the camp conditions on a \n     former crew boss.\n       ``That's past history, fella,'' McClure said, declining \n     interview requests. ``Sounds like you're looking for some way \n     to sensationalize the news. If you want to talk about the \n     past, don't come.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Hard-working, law-abiding farmers and growers \nalso suffer under the current system. They continue to be at legal risk \nfor hiring undocumented workers who frequently present fraudulent \ndocuments that appear to be credible. The current agricultural guest \nworker program also fails to provide for unforeseen labor shortages.\n  The bill before us provides an essential balance. It establishes a \nlegal system that ensures basic rights and protections for workers who \nmake significant contributions to our nation's economy. It also ensures \nthe development of an efficient agricultural guest worker program that \nimproves farmer and grower access to legal agricultural workers.\n  Agricultural workers do extremely grueling work, work that puts \nfruits, vegetables and flowers on the tables of many American \nhouseholds. Dedicated, experienced farm workers deserve the dignity, \nempowerment and improved quality of life that come with earning legal \nstatus. Farmers that play by the rules should have a modern, \nstreamlined program that provides easier access to legal agricultural \nworkers.\n  Congress has not focused on farm worker issues since the mid-1980s. \nReform of our agricultural guest worker program is long overdue, and I \nam hopeful that we will move beyond our status quo and address this \nimportant issue this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1646. A bill to provide a 5-month extension of highway safety \nprograms funded out of the Highway Trust Fund pending enactment of a \nlaw reauthorizing the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senator Hollings in \nintroducing legislation to provide a short-term extension of the safety \nprograms administered by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration (FMCSA), the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA), and the boating safety program administered by \nthe Coast Guard. It is our expectation that this measure will be joined \nwith broader legislation to extend the highway and transit programs for \nfive months.\n  I take pride in the fact that the Senate Commerce Committee completed \nwork last June on a 6-year reauthorization of the safety programs under \nits jurisdiction. The bipartisan bill is designed to meet the level of \ncommitment to safety needed to achieve aggressive goals for reducing \naccidents and fatalities on the nation's roadways. This short-term \nextension is consistent with our Committee's longer-term \nreauthorization proposal. It is also consistent with the President's \nbudget request for fiscal year 2004 and with the appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2004 that has been reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues to approve the \nextension to ensure the continuity of these important safety programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DAVIS \n (UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS, RETIRED) AND EXPRESSING THE APPRECIATION \nAND ADMIRATION OF THE SENATE FOR THE UNWAVERING COMMITMENT DEMONSTRATED \n    BY GENERAL DAVIS TO HIS FAMILY, THE MARINE CORPS, AND THE NATION\n\n  Mr. MILLER (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Corzine) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 232\n\n       Whereas General Raymond Gilbert Davis (United States Marine \n     Corps, retired) of Stockbridge, Georgia, an American hero who \n     represented the supreme ideals of an American and a Marine, \n     died on Wednesday, September 3, 2003, at the age of 88;\n       Whereas Raymond Gilbert Davis, born on January 13, 1915, in \n     Fitzgerald, Georgia, was commissioned as a second lieutenant \n     in the United States Marine Corps in 1938 following \n     graduation from the Georgia School of Technology;\n       Whereas during World War II, he participated in the \n     Guadalcanal Tulagi landings, the capture and defense of \n     Guadalcanal, the Eastern New Guinea and Cape Gloucester \n     campaigns, and the Peleliu operation;\n       Whereas during the fighting on Peleliu, although wounded \n     during the first hour of the landing, he refused evacuation \n     to remain with his men and, on one occasion, when heavy \n     Marine casualties and the enemy's point-blank cannon fire had \n     enabled the Japanese to break through, he personally rallied \n     and led his men in fighting to reestablish defense positions;\n       Whereas his actions while commanding the 1st Battalion of \n     the 1st Marines at Peleliu in September 1944 earned him the \n     Navy Cross and the Purple Heart and a promotion to lieutenant \n     colonel;\n       Whereas returning to the United States in November 1944, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Davis was assigned to the Quantico Marine \n     Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, as Tactical Inspector, Marine \n     Corps Schools, and was named chief of the Infantry Section, \n     Marine Air-Infantry School, Quantico, in May 1945, and served \n     in that post for two years before returning to the Pacific \n     area in July 1947 to serve with the 1st Provisional Marine \n     Brigade on Guam;\n       Whereas following other peace-time duties, in August 1950 \n     he embarked for Korea to command the 1st Battalion, 7th \n     Marines, 1st Marine Division, in the Korean conflict and, in \n     that capacity, heroically enabled the historic breakout of \n     the 1st Marine Division from an entrapment by overwhelming \n     numbers of Chinese soldiers at the Chosin Reservoir in North \n     Korea;\n       Whereas on the night before the breakout then Lieutenant \n     Colonel Davis led his battalion in an epic across-country \n     fight against vastly superior numbers of entrenched enemy \n     soldiers, across ice- and snow-covered terrain, in subzero \n     temperatures to save a beleaguered rifle company and seize a \n     critical mountain pass that enabled the escape of two Marine \n     regiments, arriving three days later at the port of Hagaru-ri \n     with every one of his wounded Marines;\n       Whereas as a result of his actions in Korea, Lieutenant \n     Colonel Davis was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions \n     in the Chosin Reservoir, twice earned the Silver Star Medal \n     by exposing himself to heavy enemy\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\n     fire while leading and encouraging his men in the face of \n     strong enemy opposition, received the Legion of Merit with \n     Combat ``V'' for exceptionally meritorious conduct and \n     professional skill in welding the 1st Battalion into a highly \n     effective combat team, and earned the Bronze Star Medal with \n     Combat ``V'' for his part in rebuilding the regiment after \n     the Chosin Reservoir campaign;\n       Whereas following service in the Korean conflict, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Davis served in a series of increasingly \n     responsible staff and training positions, while being \n     promoted to colonel in October 1953 and brigadier general in \n     July 1963;\n       Whereas his first assignment as a general officer was in \n     the Far East where he served as Assistant Division Commander, \n     3d Marine Division, on Okinawa, from October 1963 to November \n     1964;\n       Whereas he was assigned to Headquarters, Marine Corps, from \n     December 1964 until March 1968 and during that service was \n     awarded a second Legion of Merit and was promoted to major \n     general;\n       Whereas when ordered to the Republic of Vietnam in March \n     1968, Major General Davis served briefly as Deputy Commanding \n     General, Provisional Corps, and then became Commanding \n     General, 3d Marine Division where he was awarded the \n     Distinguished Service Medal and three personal decorations by \n     the Vietnamese Government for service in the latter capacity \n     from May 2, 1968 until April 14, 1969;\n       Whereas upon his return to the United States in May 1969, \n     he was assigned duty as Deputy for Education with additional \n     duty as Director, Education Center, Marine Corps Development \n     and Education Command, Quantico, Virginia, and upon his \n     promotion to lieutenant general on July 1, 1970, he was \n     assigned as Commanding General, Marine Corps Development and \n     Education Command;\n       Whereas on February 23, 1971, President Nixon nominated \n     General Davis for appointment to the grade of general and \n     assignment to the position of Assistant Commandant of the \n     Marine Corps and, after confirmation by the Senate for \n     service in that position, he received his fourth star upon \n     assuming those duties on March 12, 1971;\n       Whereas upon his retirement on March 31,1972, after more \n     than 33 years of active commissioned service, he ended his \n     military career as Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, \n     the second highest ranking Marine;\n       Whereas General Davis' decorations include the Medal of \n     Honor, the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal with \n     Gold Star in lieu of a second award, the Silver Star Medal \n     with Gold Star in lieu of a second award, the Legion of Merit \n     with Combat ``V'' and Gold Star in lieu of a second award, \n     the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'', the Purple Heart, \n     the Presidential Unit Citation with four bronze stars \n     indicative of second through fifth awards, the Navy Unit \n     Commendation, numerous campaign and service medals, and \n     numerous foreign decorations;\n       Whereas following retirement from his beloved Corps, \n     General Davis directed the Georgia Chamber of Commerce for \n     several years and later took on the challenge of design, \n     funding, and dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial \n     in Washington, DC;\n       Whereas General Davis continued to work in support of \n     issues concerning the national interest, including a visit to \n     North Korea in an effort to persuade that government to allow \n     more travel and to become more active in identifying missing \n     American soldiers; and\n       Whereas General Raymond G. Davis is survived by his wife of \n     61 years, Knox Heafner Davis, two sons Raymond Gil Davis Jr. \n     of Covington, Georgia, and Gordon Miles Davis of Seminole, \n     Alabama, a daughter Willa Kerr of Stockbridge, Georgia, seven \n     grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENIOR OLYMPICS.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 220506(a) of title 36, United \n     States Code, the National Senior Games Association of Baton \n     Rouge, Louisiana, is authorized to use the words ``Senior \n     Olympics'' to promote national athletic competition among \n     senior citizens.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The amendment to the United States Olympic Committee \nReform Act of 2003, S. 1404, being offered by Senator Campbell permits \nthe new USOC board, together with the new USOC assembly, to determine \nthe location of the organization's headquarters. This amendment is \nconsistent with what is already in the USOC's Federal charter, which \ncurrently allows the USOC to determine where in the United States the \norganization's headquarters should be maintained.\n  To move the headquarters, the newly constituted board would first \ndetermine whether it is in the best interest of the USOC to relocate \nthe headquarters. A unanimous vote by the board would be required to \nrefer the matter to the assembly for consideration, and then, only by a \nthree-fifths majority of the assembly could the USOC headquarters be \nrelocated.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank Senators McCain and Campbell for \ntheir work on this important issue. My work on the Olympic Sports Act \nbegan in the 1970s. I believe the reforms in our bill today are \nnecessary adjustments that will return the focus of the United States \nOlympic Committee to our original intent--our American athletes!\n  The USOC Internal Taskforce and the Senate appointed Independent \nCommission did excellent jobs in reviewing the problems and offering \nsolutions to the recent problems that have plagued the USOC. I thank \nthe USOC Taskforce and the Independent Commission on the United States \nOlympic Committee for their hard work. S. 1404 includes many of the \nsuggested changes from both groups.\n  This is a good bill and I support all but one aspect of it. I cannot \nsupport and will work to remove the section that gives special \nconsideration to the Senior Olympics. The only fundraising tool that \nCongress gave the USOC was the exclusive rights to the name, seals, \nemblems and badges of the USOC. The language that allows the Senior \nOlympics to use the Olympic symbols without the USOC permission will \nlead to the destruction of the fundraising ability of the USOC. Above \nall, the use of these symbols should not be subject to being ``licensed \nout'' by any entity but the USOC. I would have opposed this language in \ncommittee but unfortunately I was chairing a Defense Appropriations \nhearing when the language was offered. I will not hold up the passage \nof this important legislation but will work to remove the language \ncreating a death knell to the USOC's ability to raise the funds \nnecessary to meet the objectives of our Nation ion international \ncompetitions.\n  This is an important agreement on the location of the USOC \nheadquarters. Now this bill can go to conference, after which, with the \nPresident's approval, it will become law and our American athletes can \nfocus all of their efforts on the 2004 Olympic Games.\n  I thank Senator McCain's Commerce staff for their hard work on this \nissue. Especially Ken Nahigian and also Brian Feintech of Senator \nCampbell's staff. Their hard work along with that of George Lowe on my \nstaff have insured that this important legislation is ready to move \nforward.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his patience \nand understanding in this matter and ask to be an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  The USOC was crying out for reform. There was the mismanagement of \nfunds, poor judgments, and frequent turnover of management. I would \nlike to recognize the USOC's internal efforts for reform. Reform has \nbeen long overdue.\n  My opposition to this legislation was to protect not only my \nconstituents, but the USOC employees and athletes training in Colorado \nSprings, CO, as well. Again and again, I have heard rumblings about \nmoving the headquarters of the USOC to another city, possibly New York \nCity. This would be a terrible mistake and I cannot and will not allow \nthis to happen.\n  The moving expenses would far outweigh the benefits of moving the \nheadquarters and I do not want another dime wasted on the governance \nand management of the USOC. I cannot, and I do not think that we can \nmake it clear enough: the money raised is first and foremost for the \nbenefit and training of athletes, not for extra cushions on the chairs \nof those sitting in offices with pretty views of skylines.\n  The costs to the State of Colorado must be recognized too. The \npresence\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nof the USOC in Colorado Springs generates over $300 million per year in \nrevenue. My State cannot afford taking a hit like that now. To be \nexact, the USOC generates $315.9 million a year for the Pikes Peak \nRegion; employs over 500 fund-raising staff; is home to 250 Olympic \nhopefuls, resident athletes in various sports; provides about 4,800 \njobs in the Colorado Springs area, directly and indirectly; and serves \nabout 38,000 tourists each year.\n  I would like to point out Colorado's own commitment to the United \nStates Olympic Committee. The Colorado State legislature passed law \nallowing out-of-State doctors to practice medicine at the center \nwithout having to pass a Colorado test for a medical license; passed a \nlaw allowing out-of-State athletes at the training center to pay \ninstate college tuition so they could continue their education while \ntraining; and created a check-off box on State income tax returns \nallowing taxpayers to donate $1, which initially raised about $200,000 \na year.\n  The argument that moving to a major metropolitan area to have better \naccess to marketing and mass media is completely invalid. NBC agreed to \npay $2.2 billion for U.S. television rights to the 2010 Winter Olympic \nGames and the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. That deal includes a \nsponsorship by NBC parent company, General Electric, which is based in \nConnecticut. San Francisco-based VISA continues to support the Olympic \nmovement as does Bank of America, based in Charlotte, NC. Obviously, \nthe USOC is not having any problem securing media coverage or \nsponsorships.\n  Lastly, I would like to point out Section 834 of Public Law 99-167, \npassed during the 1st Session of the 99th Congress, in 1985. The \ncurrent home of the USOC used to be part of Ent Air Force Base in \nColorado Springs. Section 834 conveyed land that the USOC had been \nleasing from the U.S. Air Force to the USOC under the conditions that \nthe property be used by the USOC solely for USOC activities and if it \nis not used for that purpose, the property shall be repossessed by the \nGovernment. This did not imply that the USOC could use it for a while \nor use it only in part. If the USOC is not going to use it, then the \nproperty should be given back to us.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to, the Campbell amendment be agreed to, the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENIOR OLYMPICS.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 220506(a) of title 36, United \n     States Code, the National Senior Games Association of Baton \n     Rouge, Louisiana, is authorized to use the words ``Senior \n     Olympics'' to promote national athletic competition among \n     senior citizens.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed S. \n1404, the United States Olympic Committee Reform Act of 2003. I thank \nthe cosponsors of this important legislation, Senators Stevens and \nCampbell, for their passion for the Olympic movement and their \ncontribution to the reform of the United States Olympic Committee, \nUSOC. S. 1404 is intended to make significant improvements to the \ngovernance structure of the USOC by vastly reducing the size of the \ncurrent board of directors and by creating an assembly of USOC \nstakeholders. The bill is intended to allow the USOC to operate more \neffectively within a more streamlined and transparent structure.\n  S. 1404 is the product of three Commerce Committee hearings held this \nyear in response to a series of embarrassing leadership and ethics \nscandals that have plagued the USOC and distracted the organization \nfrom its mission. The new board of directors, which would be the \nprimary governing body of the organization, would appoint a chief \nexecutive officer to carry out the board's policies and run the \norganization's day-to-day business operations. The board would defer to \nthe judgment of the assembly on matters relating specifically to the \nOlympic Games.\n  While maintaining the representation and voting authority of athletes \nand national governing bodies, this legislation also would provide \nincreased financial transparency to the USOC and establish whistle-\nblower protection for its employees. The bill is designed to streamline \nthe USOC to allow a larger percentage of the revenue generated by the \norganization to be allocated to support amateur athletes.\n  In addition, we have worked to make this bill comply with the charter \nof the International Olympic Committee, IOC, and will continue to do \nthis. It is important to note that corporate governance in the United \nStates has changed dramatically over the past year, and these changes \nare leading this country's private and public sectors to adopt higher \nstandards of responsibility and accountability. These same standards \nshould be applied to the USOC to ensure that the narrow agendas of \nindividual USOC constituencies are no longer paramount to the common \nobjectives of the organization. To accomplish this objective, we \npropose that the USOC adhere to best corporate governance practices, \nsuch as requiring that the newly constituted USOC board have at least a \nmajority of independent directors. In the end, the\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nnewly reformed board would govern the day-to-day operations of the \nUSOC, and would be able to work with the IOC to address any concerns \nthat it might have regarding the USOC's operations.\n  The fast-approaching Olympic Games in Athens next summer, as well as \nthe ongoing bid by New York City to host the games in 2012, lend \nurgency to this legislation, and I look forward quickly to resolving \nany differences between the Senate and House measures. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this very important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/23/senate-section/article/S11873-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY \n                        DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 232\n\n       Whereas General Raymond Gilbert Davis (United States Marine \n     Corps, retired) of Stockbridge, Georgia, an American hero who \n     represented the supreme ideals of an American and a Marine, \n     died on Wednesday, September 3, 2003, at the age of 88;\n       Whereas Raymond Gilbert Davis, born on January 13, 1915, in \n     Fitzgerald, Georgia, was commissioned as a second lieutenant \n     in the United States Marine Corps in 1938 following \n     graduation from the Georgia School of Technology;\n       Whereas during World War II, he participated in the \n     Guadalcanal Tulagi landings, the capture and defense of \n     Guadalcanal, the Eastern New Guinea and Cape Gloucester \n     campaigns, and the Peleliu operation;\n       Whereas during the fighting on Peleliu, although wounded \n     during the first hour of the landing, he refused evacuation \n     to remain with his men and, on one occasion, when heavy \n     Marine casualties and the enemy's point-blank cannon fire had \n     enabled the Japanese to break through, he personally rallied \n     and led his men in fighting to reestablish defense positions;\n       Whereas his actions while commanding the 1st Battalion of \n     the 1st Marines at Peleliu in September 1944 earned him the \n     Navy Cross and the Purple Heart and a promotion to lieutenant \n     colonel;\n       Whereas returning to the United States in November 1944, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Davis was assigned to the Quantico Marine \n     Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, as Tactical Inspector, Marine \n     Corps Schools, and was named chief of the Infantry Section, \n     Marine Air-Infantry School, Quantico, in May 1945, and served \n     in that post for two years before returning to the Pacific \n     area in July 1947 to serve with the 1st Provisional Marine \n     Brigade on Guam;\n       Whereas following other peace-time duties, in August 1950 \n     he embarked for Korea to command the 1st Battalion, 7th \n     Marines, 1st Marine Division, in the Korean conflict and, in \n     that capacity, heroically enabled the historic breakout of \n     the 1st Marine Division from an entrapment by overwhelming \n     numbers of Chinese soldiers at the Chosin Reservoir in North \n     Korea;\n       Whereas on the night before the breakout then Lieutenant \n     Colonel Davis led his battalion in an epic across-country \n     fight against vastly superior numbers of entrenched enemy \n     soldiers, across ice- and snow-covered terrain, in subzero \n     temperatures to save a beleaguered rifle company and seize a \n     critical mountain pass that enabled the escape of two Marine \n     regiments, arriving three days later at the port of Hagaru-ri \n     with every one of his wounded Marines;\n       Whereas as a result of his actions in Korea, Lieutenant \n     Colonel Davis was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions \n     in the Chosin Reservoir, twice earned the Silver Star Medal \n     by exposing himself to heavy enemy fire while leading and \n     encouraging his men in the face of strong enemy opposition, \n     received the Legion of Merit with Combat ``V'' for \n     exceptionally meritorious conduct and professional skill in \n     welding the 1st Battalion into a highly effective combat \n     team, and earned the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'' for \n     his part in rebuilding the regiment after the Chosin \n     Reservoir campaign;\n       Whereas following service in the Korean conflict, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Davis served in a series of increasingly \n     responsible staff and training positions, while being \n     promoted to colonel in October 1953 and brigadier general in \n     July 1963;\n       Whereas his first assignment as a general officer was in \n     the Far East where he served as Assistant Division Commander, \n     3d Marine Division, on Okinawa, from October 1963 to November \n     1964;\n       Whereas he was assigned to Headquarters, Marine Corps, from \n     December 1964 until March 1968 and during that service was \n     awarded a second Legion of Merit and was promoted to major \n     general;\n       Whereas when ordered to the Republic of Vietnam in March \n     1968, Major General Davis served briefly as Deputy Commanding \n     General, Provisional Corps, and then became Commanding \n     General, 3d Marine Division where he was awarded the \n     Distinguished Service Medal and three personal decorations by \n     the Vietnamese Government for\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\n     service in the latter capacity from May 2, 1968 until April \n     14, 1969;\n       Whereas upon his return to the United States in May 1969, \n     he was assigned duty as Deputy for Education with additional \n     duty as Director, Education Center, Marine Corps Development \n     and Education Command, Quantico, Virginia, and upon his \n     promotion to lieutenant general on July 1, 1970, he was \n     assigned as Commanding General, Marine Corps Development and \n     Education Command;\n       Whereas on February 23, 1971, President Nixon nominated \n     General Davis for appointment to the grade of general and \n     assignment to the position of Assistant Commandant of the \n     Marine Corps and, after confirmation by the Senate for \n     service in that position, he received his fourth star upon \n     assuming those duties on March 12, 1971;\n       Whereas upon his retirement on March 31, 1972, after more \n     than 33 years of active commissioned service, he ended his \n     military career as Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, \n     the second highest ranking Marine;\n       Whereas General Davis' decorations include the Medal of \n     Honor, the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal with \n     Gold Star in lieu of a second award, the Silver Star Medal \n     with Gold Star in lieu of a second award, the Legion of Merit \n     with Combat ``V'' and Gold Star in lieu of a second award, \n     the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V'', the Purple Heart, \n     the Presidential Unit Citation with four bronze stars \n     indicative of second through fifth awards, the Navy Unit \n     Commendation, numerous campaign and service medals, and \n     numerous foreign decorations;\n       Whereas following retirement from his beloved Corps, \n     General Davis directed the Georgia Chamber of Commerce for \n     several years and later took on the challenge of design, \n     funding, and dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial \n     in Washington, DC;\n       Whereas General Davis continued to work in support of \n     issues concerning the national interest, including a visit to \n     North Korea in an effort to persuade that government to allow \n     more travel and to become more active in identifying missing \n     American soldiers; and\n       Whereas General Raymond G. Davis is survived by his wife of \n     61 years, Knox Heafner Davis, two sons Raymond Gil Davis Jr. \n     of Covington, Georgia, and Gordon Miles Davis of Seminole, \n     Alabama, a daughter Willa Kerr of Stockbridge, Georgia, seven \n     grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.
