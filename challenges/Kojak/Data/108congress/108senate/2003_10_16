Mr. President, I want to make just a few comments on the \nprogress that has been made--and it has been real progress over the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ weeks--on the emergency request for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  While we will have much more debate over the course of the day and \nlikely tomorrow morning, and discussion on the amendments, I predict \nthis bill will pass with very strong bipartisan support either late \ntonight or tomorrow. There has been a general understanding in this \nbody that, indeed, we are at war against terrorists in Afghanistan and \nIraq and the assistance we are debating--the urgent supplemental \nrequest--is absolutely vital and integral to victory and to the safe \nreturn of our soldiers.\n  Replacing the defeated regime of Saddam Hussein with a democratic \nIraq is an essential turning point in bringing freedom to a part of the \nworld that has been governed by extremism and by terrorism now for \ndecades.\n  As General John Abizaid said before the Armed Services Committee, our \nservice men and women are very clear when asked about their commitment \nto victory in Iraq. He said: ``We can fight them there or we can fight \nthem here.''\n  What we are doing now very directly affects the security of the \nAmerican people.\n  Iraq is a country, as we all know, that is deeply in debt because of \nSaddam Hussein's many excesses in over more than 20 years. In order to \nhelp Iraq, we must absolutely bring a basic level of stability to that \ncountry. Although we will discuss it over the course of the day, I \nbelieve strongly that loans will not do it. Loans do not\n\n[[Page S12636]]\n\naccomplish that. Piling more debt on top of a crushing burden that is \nalready in place will simply compound Iraq's problems, and I believe \nundermine that goal of stability there.\n  Our allies clearly must be generous with their assistance as well, \nand they must be prepared to write off debts from bad loans to Saddam \nHussein in the past. We are working very hard as a country on this, and \nI am confident that by our example we will encourage that kind of \ninternational cooperation.\n  We have a strategy for success in Iraq. In recent months, we have \nmade steady progress toward our objectives. We just began over the last \nseveral days and weeks to hear about those successes. Essential \nservices are being restored, security is improving, and political \ntransformation is underway. Importantly, as we will see in the United \nNations in the next several hours, we are reaching out to expand \ninternational participation in the rebuilding of Iraq.\n  America must continue to build on this progress. We simply cannot \nafford to fail, and indeed we will not fail. If freedom and progress \nfalter in Iraq, terrorists will be emboldened around the world, in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere, threatening innocent lives around the world \nand America. With success, a free Iraq will send a clear message to the \npeople of the Middle East and beyond that freedom and democracy--not \nviolence, not terrorism--are the best paths for the future.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12636-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  THE PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will say a few words about the \nsupplemental appropriation which the leader just addressed a moment ago \nand we are addressing all week and also about the ongoing search for \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  I was in a Senate Armed Services Committee briefing when Dr. David \nKay, one of the leaders of the Iraqi Survey Group, briefed me, and \nlater briefed Congress as a whole, on the ongoing search for weapons of \nmass destruction. In that briefing and in the published statement he \nmade that is now on the CIA Web site, he says:\n\n       In searching for retained stocks of chemical munitions, the \n     ISG [Iraqi survey group] has had to contend with an almost \n     unbelievable scale of Iraq's conventional weapons armory, \n     which dwarfs by orders of magnitude the physical size of any \n     conceivable stock of chemical weapons. For example, there are \n     approximately 130 known Iraqi Ammunition Storage Points, many \n     of which exceed 50 square miles--\n\n  I had to doublecheck that quote to make sure it was accurate because \nit boggles the mind.\n  Continuing--\n\n     50 square miles in size and hold an estimated 600,000 tons of \n     artillery shells, rockets, aviation bombs and other ordnance. \n     Of these 130 ASP's, approximately 120 remain unexamined. As \n     Iraqi practice was not to mark much of their chemical \n     ordnance and to store it the same as they would conventional \n     weapons, the size of the required search effort is enormous.\n\n  Dr. Kay has a gift for understatement. Having only in this time since \nthe fall of Saddam Hussein been able to examine 10 out of a possible \n130 ammunition sites gives an idea of the tremendous task ahead. \nPerhaps the critics should give some pause about the ongoing search for \nweapons of mass destruction and the likelihood--indeed, I would say the \nprobability--that we will find those weapons of mass destruction in the \nend.\n  The search is ongoing, but we know for certain that 17 U.N. \nresolutions and numerous inspection missions by the U.N. weapons \ninspection team from 1991 to 2003 were not sufficient to stop Saddam \nHussein. Even though we have not yet found the degree of weapons we \nanticipated, it is clear Saddam Hussein lied to the world about his \narsenal despite all the steps taken by the international community. \nThere have also been significant finds that indicate we have only \ngrazed the surface of Iraq's weapons capabilities.\n  According to the same report I quoted a moment ago:\n\n       The home of an Iraqi scientist brought the discovery of \n     strains of biological organisms, one of which can be used to \n     produce biological weapons. The team found new research on \n     [Biological Weapons]-applicable agents, Brucella and Congo \n     Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), and continuing work on \n     ricin and aflatoxin, none of which were made known to the \n     U.N.\n\n  It will be many months before we will have a clear picture of the \nnature and extent of Saddam's weaponry, but already some things are \ncrystal clear.\n  There are some in this body who have opposed the conflict in Iraq \nfrom the beginning. I disagree with them, but they have a right to \ntheir views. I am sad to say there are also those who have come close--\ntoo close--to exploiting for political gain the hardships we have \nencountered following Saddam's fall, hardships experienced in serving \nthe cause of freedom. I believe that is wrong and should be repudiated \nin the strongest terms.\n  We all know Congress voted overwhelmingly to authorize the President \nto use necessary force to remove Saddam's regime in Iraq. Subsequent \nevents, including Dr. Kay's report on behalf of the Iraqi Survey Group, \nhave vindicated that decision. I am also glad to see that today France, \nGermany, and Russia are planning to support the resolution concerning \nour efforts in Iraq before the U.N. Security Council. I would only hope \nthe administration's critics in this body would express such strong \nsupport as well.\n\n  We all know that the great efforts and sacrifices made by our brave \nmen in the coalition forces who ignored the beltway echo chamber and \nsuggestions from the outset of quagmire, the cynical prognosticators \nwho claim that our forces were on the brink of collapse, and the \nhandwringing doubters who said Operation Iraqi Freedom was nothing but \na pipe dream--we know these critics were wrong. The dedicated men and \nwomen of our coalition forces acted as true professionals. They were \ninterested in actions and not words. We all know they liberated Baghdad \nin a mere 21 days.\n  Even in the face of that success, there still are naysayers who \nrefuse to acknowledge the tremendous and dramatic accomplishments we \nhave made as well as the necessity that we finish the task ahead. They \nare urging in so many words that we abandon Iraq, leaving behind an \nunstable nation still trying desperately to crawl up from under the \nrubble of destruction by Saddam's ruthless regime. That is a dangerous \nand an unwise suggestion.\n  This mission must end when we complete the task of stabilizing Iraq \nand we are able to hand power over to leaders who are elected by a free \nIraqi people--not before. While we all want to return Iraq to the Iraqi \npeople as soon as possible, and at the same time get our troops back \nhome as soon as possible, these well-intentioned desires should not \nblind us to our duty to finish the job we started. There is no doubt \nthat the enemies of democracy in Iraq, both inside and outside of that \ncountry, will exploit any short-lived commitment.\n  Indeed, I believe the evidence is overwhelming that the events of \nSeptember 11 were largely caused by the apparent lack of American \nresolve to defeat terrorism, and what we are doing today--maintaining \nour strong resolve and finishing the job that we started in the war \nagainst terror in Afghanistan and Iraq--is absolutely essential to our \nsuccess.\n  If we leave Iraq prematurely, we will play into the hands of the \nterrorists and Baathist remnants. They are counting on the resolve of \nthe coalition to falter, freeing them to seek to regain control of this \nfledgling nation. We must not cut and run and, in so doing, leave the \nIraqi people as they are, undefended, or we risk the possibility that \nthe sacrifices that have been made by this Nation, and particularly our \nmilitary and other coalition forces, will all be for naught.\n\n[[Page S12637]]\n\n  Today in Iraq there is religious freedom and human rights unlike \nanything seen during Saddam's regime. The Iraqi people now have hope \nwhere there was formerly only despair. They have hope for a future that \nmust have seemed like only a dream a few short months ago.\n  The ``blame America first'' gang is grasping for anything they can to \nprop up the illusion they were right all along. But the absence, so \nfar, of weapons of mass destruction and stockpiles of biological agents \ndoes not mean Saddam's Iraq was some kind of sunny paradise or a \nthriving garden dictatorship, one long springtime for Saddam. Nothing--\nnothing--could be further from the truth.\n  We have not yet found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but let me \nremind all of us what we have found. We have found torture chambers. We \nhave found execution sites. We have found prisons where children were \nheld in order to coerce their parents to bend to Saddam's will. We have \nfound a legacy of fear and terror, the vestiges of years of tyranny and \ncruelty. We have found as many as 300,000 people--maybe more--buried in \nmass graves throughout Iraq in nearly 100 reported sites. They stretch \nfrom Basrah to Baghdad, from Najaf to Kirkuk. These stand as silent \nmonuments of Saddam's ruthlessness left behind for all to see.\n  For the Iraqi people living under Saddam, peace--if you can call it \nthat--was far more bloody than the current war.\n  To those who continue to doubt our mission in Iraq, I say this: Peace \nis a good thing but at what price is it purchased? By turning our backs \non suffering, genocide, and evil? By tolerating those who defy the \ncivilized world and encourage, facilitate, and promote international \nterrorism?\n  If the 20th century has taught us anything, it is that if America is \nto fulfill its role as the guardian of the free world, a beacon of \nlight shining in the darkness, we cannot allow bloodthirsty tyrants \nsuch as Saddam Hussein to act with impunity.\n  Clearly, there are obstacles to overcome in Iraq, and there will be \nsetbacks along the way. Yet we cannot allow the politics of the moment \nor the upcoming Presidential election to undermine the war on terror \nand American resolve.\n  I believe the task that falls to us at this moment in history is \nspreading the blessings of liberty and bringing the light of freedom to \na nation that has, for too long, been imprisoned by darkness.\n  We must not falter in our efforts. We must not play political games \nwhile the world turns inward. We must fulfill our duty to defend \nAmerica's interests abroad and ensure that the tragedies of September \n11 are never repeated.\n  In the end, if there is one thing certain, it is this: In Iraq the \nmass murder has stopped. And we stopped it. The Iraqi people and the \nAmerican people and all the people of the civilized world are better \noff for it.\n  Those who would play political games with our mission in Iraq, even \nwhile our brave men and women labor to secure and stabilize this \nfledging nation, risk dishonoring the memories of those who sacrificed \nall in opposing this bloodthirsty regime.\n  No, Mr. President, we must not cut and run, leaving the Iraqi people \nwith a promise unfulfilled. Success in Iraq depends enormously on our \nwillingness to stay the course and finishing the job we started, and \nthrough it all, we owe our men and women in uniform our unequivocal \nsupport as they labor in a dangerous place for an honorable cause.\n  In summary, America needs from this body and from its leaders less \nbabble and more backbone.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12637-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12637-S12638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to share some of my \nthoughts on the administration's request for additional funding for \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  The majority of our attention has been focused on the situation in \nIraq. Certainly this topic merits the attention it has received not \nonly this morning but every morning it has received during morning \nbusiness. In all of this, however, I would like to ensure that we do \nnot overlook another very important aspect of this bill, which is \nincreased assistance for Afghanistan.\n  The supplemental includes $11 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom: \nover $1 billion for training of the Afghan National Army and the \nconstruction of roads, schools, and health clinics.\n  Too often, as we focus on what is transpiring around the world--\nwhether it is events in Iraq, the happenings in North Korea, the \nsituation in Liberia--the news coming out of Afghanistan goes \nunnoticed: the cooperation between U.S. and Afghan forces in tracking \ndown elements of the Taliban and al-Qaida; the progress USAID is making \nin strengthening the government; vaccinating Afghan children for \nmeasles; expanding educational opportunities for women and girls; and \nwe must also remember the rehabilitation of numerous roads, bridges, \ntunnels, and related infrastructure.\n  There is also bad news as to what is happening in Afghanistan: \nreports of the resurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaida, increased poppy \ncultivation for opium production, and a yet uncertain relationship \nbetween the central and the provincial governments.\n  Our support for the progress in Afghanistan must continue. Many talk \nof the need to succeed in Iraq. The high price associated with that, if \nwe fail, will be incredible. And I agree. The same holds true with \nAfghanistan. So I am pleased this supplemental is not just about Iraq \nbut includes Afghanistan as well.\n  This past May, during his commencement address at the University of \nSouth Carolina, the President spoke to what the biggest accomplishment \nour presence in these two nations--Iraq and Afghanistan--can be, and \nthat is the opportunity to replace old hatreds with new hope.\n  As the President said, when citizens have hope--when they feel as if \nthey are invested in the future--then the extreme ideologies of \nterrorists hold no sway. But if there is no hope, if individuals think \nthe future holds nothing for them or their families, the appeal of \nextremism is great.\n  That is the fight the United States faces today. What does the future \nof Iraq and Afghanistan hold for their citizens?\n  We have all heard of the recent Gallup poll taken in Iraq, which \nshowed that 67 percent of Iraqis surveyed thought their lives would be \nbetter off in 5 years as a result of the U.S.-led invasion. Only 8 \npercent said their lives would be worse off. The hope for the future is \nthere.\n  The Iraqi people are not willing to give in to the evil of terrorism, \nbut if the United States fails in its task, if we do not deliver on our \npromises to get the job done, we have perhaps opened the door to even \nfurther terrorism.\n  Make no mistake about it, if we go about our task in a halfhearted \nmanner and do not provide the resources that are needed, then we are \nonly sentencing our troops to continued danger and longer deployments. \nThe fact is, the sooner we complete the job, the sooner our troops come \nhome.\n  Despite what may be portrayed in the media, progress is being made. \nWe see that on a daily basis. Towns and municipal councils have been \nset up.\n  Fifty-six thousand Iraqis have been trained and armed for the \nsecurity of their nation. More Iraqis are being trained to serve in the \nIraqi Army and the police force. Electricity has been restored to \nprewar levels. A new Iraqi currency was introduced just this week.\n  On the education side, on October 1, just a couple weeks ago, the \nchildren of Iraq returned to school. And with the assistance of the \nCoalition Provincial Authority and USAID, nearly 1,600 schools in Iraq \nhave been renovated. Over 5.6 million math and science books, free of \nSaddam's propaganda, are being printed and will soon be delivered. U.S. \nuniversities are partnering with Iraqi universities. This is \nsignificant because over 40 percent of Iraq's population is under the \nage of 15. These are kids who have known nothing but life under Saddam \nHussein. These children are Iraq's future. Ensuring access to \neducational opportunities for both boys and girls is key. This will \ngive the Iraqis the chance to develop the skills they need for their \nown personal advancement, to diversify Iraq's\n\n[[Page S12638]]\n\neconomic development, and to provide for the future of their nation and \na future with hope, which is what we are all working toward.\n  I see the good Senator from Missouri is here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is recognized \nfor 8 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it was not really my intention to come \ndown on this particular debate and speak. I would like to give a \nbroader statement on the war at some point. But I thought I would come \nfor a few minutes today because I have been watching from time to time \nour friends on the Democratic side, particularly the Presidential \ncandidates who seem to be vying with each other to show their base, to \nshow the left how much they are against the war. They are trying to \nappeal to the left, which is certainly understandable given that they \nare running in a primary.\n  That has distressed me because I think the growing opposition to the \nwar on the left is a tremendous historical mistake. People in that \nmovement will view it that way 20 or 30 years from now. I say with all \ngood faith to my friends in that movement that this is not the 1960s. \nIraq is not Vietnam. Saddam Hussein is not Ho Chi Minh. The terrorists \nare not some kind of utopian movement that wants to create a workers \nparadise around the world. The terrorists stand for everything that \nthis country hates, and in particular, everything the left in this \ncountry has always stood against. They are bloodthirsty cutthroats. \nThey don't believe in diversity. They are racial and religious bigots. \nThey are sexists. They hate the idea of international law. They have no \nrespect for international norms. We should all be opposing them.\n  This is a war in which we should all be involved. We should all get \nin the same boat and row. I know it is hard to support a war which is \nled by a President you do not support. I was in that situation when we \nwere involved in Bosnia. We are still there. It is hard to support a \nwar led by a President whose very election you question. I understand \nwhat it is like to lose a contested election and, in fact, to lose one, \nthe outcome of which is disputed. I was in that situation when I ran \nfor Governor in 2000.\n\n  I believe very strongly that this is an American war. This action in \nIraq is part of it. There is a tremendous strategic aspect of this war. \nWe can and will win it, if we pull together, if we get in the same boat \nand row. There is no reason we should not. I urge both parties and all \ndifferent parts of the philosophical spectrum to do that.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about this package, and in \nparticular the need for reconstruction. There are three reasons this is \nvery important, why it is in America's interest to spend this money and \nreconstruct Iraq.\n  First, we have to get the lights on there so that we can do the job \nwe have set out to do. It is very difficult to hunt people down, hunt \nthe terrorists down, if you can't turn on the lights. We need this \ninfrastructure in order to do our job. Second, we have to create a \nbasic infrastructure in Iraq so that the country can have the stability \nthat will allow us to leave honorably. None of us want to be there. But \nwe have engaged in this war for our interests, and it is now our \nresponsibility to make sure the country is stable enough so there is \nnot chaos when we leave. To do that, they have to have an electricity \ngrid, among other things.\n  The third point was made powerfully by Prime Minister Blair in the \nHouse Chamber. Part of what we have to do in this war is not just \ndefeat the terrorists but vindicate our values against which they \nstand. It is not enough just to curse the darkness. We have to light a \ncandle.\n  One of the terrorists' goals is to spread their philosophy and their \nideals all throughout the Islamic world, from Morocco to Indonesia. We \nneed to show that the ideals of our democracy--dignity, freedom, the \nrights of the individual--are not just for us; they are for everybody. \nThey don't just work for us; they will work for everybody. That is why \nthe creation of a stable, benign Iraqi democracy is so crucial an \naspect of this war. It would be an enormous strategic victory for us if \nwe could create such a democracy there. I believe we can. I believe we \nare. We can and will win, if we don't quit.\n  I don't believe the people are going to quit. I don't believe this \nCongress is going to quit. This money we are spending today is in our \ninterest to spend. That bears on the loan versus grant problem. \nCertainly I hope we get this money back. I would love to get this money \nback. We all should do what we can to enhance the Treasury and FSC and \nthe American taxpayer. But if it is in our interest to do it, we should \ndo it the same way we do everything else that is in our interest--we \njust spend the money. If it is not in our interest, we should not loan \nit to them either. I don't want to loan money to a country just to help \nthem. I am representing Missouri and the United States of America. We \nspend money. We loan money to advance America's interests. If it is in \nour interest, and we believe that, we ought to be willing to give it to \nthem in the form of a grant, especially since everybody knows, if we \ngive this money in a loan, eventually we will forgive it. We will not \nget the money back anyway. We are going to urge everybody around the \nworld to forgive it.\n  This is in America's interest. We can light a candle. We can defeat \nthese terrorists. We can win this war. We ought to do it. I hope we \nwill all pull together in the debate on this bill and get it done.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would the Chair inform the body as to the amount of time \nremaining on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes 13 seconds remaining on \nthe Republican side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I do not know if anybody on the other \nside wishes to use that time, but in the interim, perhaps I might use \nleader time to make a statement on another matter.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Daschle and Mr. Leahy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1740 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, nearly 6 months have elapsed since \nPresident Bush flew out to the aircraft carrier and declared ``mission \naccomplished'' in Iraq. Today, we all know all too well that the war is \nnot over: The war goes on; the mission is not accomplished. An \nunnecessary war, based on unreliable and inaccurate intelligence, has \nnot brought an end to danger. Instead, it has brought new dangers, \nimposed new costs, and taken more and more American lives each week.\n  We all agree that Saddam Hussein was a murderous tyrant, and his \nbrutal regime was an affront to basic human decency. But Iraq was not a \nbreeding ground for terrorism. Our invasion has made it one.\n  The trumped-up reasons for going to war have collapsed. All the \nadministration's rationalizations as we prepared to go to war now stand \nrevealed as ``double-talk.'' The American people were told Saddam \nHussein was building nuclear weapons. He was not. We were told he had \nstockpiles of other weapons of mass destruction. He did not. We were \ntold he was involved in 9/11. He was not. We were told Iraq was \nattracting terrorists from al-Qaida. It was not. We were told our \nsoldiers would be viewed as liberators. They are not. We were told Iraq \ncould pay for its own reconstruction. It cannot. We were told the war \nwould make America safer. It has not.\n  Before the war, week after week after week after week, we were told \nlie after lie after lie after lie.\n  And now, despite the increasingly restless Iraqi population, despite \nthe continuing talk of sabotage, despite the foreign terrorists \ncrossing thousands of miles of border to attack U.S. service men and \nwomen in Iraq, the administration still refuses to face the truth or \ntell the truth. Instead the White House responds by covering up its \nfailures and trying to sell its rosy\n\n[[Page S12639]]\n\nversion of events by repeating it with maximum frequency and volume, \nand minimum regard for realities on the ground.\n  No PR campaign by the increasingly desperate White House can redress \nthe painful loss of a young American soldier almost every day. Instead \nof greater stability and order, the forces arrayed against us are \nsteadily increasing the intensity and sophistication of their assaults \non our troops. Bombs that were once set off by trip wires are now being \nset off by remote control. The threat of shoulder fired missiles makes \nit unsafe for civilian planes to land at Baghdad Airport.\n  No foreign policy in our free society can succeed for long unless it \nis supported by our people. Our men and women in uniform fought bravely \nand brilliantly, but the President's war has been revealed as mindless, \nneedless, senseless, and reckless. The American people know all this. \nOur allies know it. Our soldiers know it. We should never have gone to \nwar in Iraq when we did, in the way we did, for the false reasons we \nwere given. But now that we are there, two imperatives are absolutely \nclear: America cannot withdraw now, leaving Iraq to chaos or civil war, \nbecoming a danger to us far greater than it did before. The misguided \npolicy of the past is no excuse for a misguided policy for the future.\n  We need a realistic and specific plan to bring stability to Iraq, to \nbring genuine self-government to Iraq, to bring our soldiers home with \ndignity and honor.\n  Until the administration genuinely changes course, I cannot in good \nconscience vote to fund a failed policy that endangers our troops in \nthe field and our strategic objectives in the world instead of \nprotecting them. The greatest mistake we can make in Congress as the \npeople's elected representatives is to support and finance a ``go-it-\nalone, do-it-because-I-say-so'' policy that leaves young Americans \nincreasingly at risk in Iraq.\n  So when the roll is called on this $87 billion legislation, which \nprovides no effective conditions for genuine international \nparticipation and a clear change in policy in Iraq, I intend to vote \nno. A no vote is not a vote against supporting our troops. It is a vote \nto send the administration back to the drawing board. It is a vote for \na new policy--policy worthy of the sacrifice our soldiers are making, a \npolicy that restores America as a respected member of the family of \nnations, a policy that will make it easier, not far more difficult, to \nwin the war against terrorism.\n  The amount of money is huge.\n  It is 87 times what the Federal Government spends annually on \nafterschool programs.\n  It is 7 times what President Bush proposed to spend on education for \nlow-income schools in 2004.\n  It is 9 times what the Federal Government spends on special education \neach year.\n  It is 8 times what the Government spends to help middle and low-\nincome students go to college.\n  It is 15 times what the Government spends on cancer research.\n  It is 27 times what the Government spends on substance abuse and \nmental health treatment.\n  It is 58 times what the Government spends on community health \ncenters.\n  If our Iraq policy is to be successful, it must take into account \nwhat history teaches us about the use of military power to solve \npolitically inspired violence. A new policy must provide the security \nthat is essential for any nation-building effort. A new policy must \ngenuinely internationalize the reconstruction of Iraq and end our \noccupation. And a successful new policy must give ownership to Iraqis \nfor their political future.\n  Surely, in this day and age, at the beginning of the 21st century, we \ndo not have to re-learn the lesson that every colonial power in history \nhas learned. We do not want to be--we cannot afford to be--either in \nterms of character or in terms of cost, an occupier of other lands. We \nmust not become the next failed empire in the world.\n  The administration seeks to write a new history that defies the \nlessons of history. The most basic of those lessons is that we cannot \nrely primarily on military means as a solution to politically-inspired \nviolence. In those circumstances, the tide of history rises squarely \nagainst military occupation.\n  The British learned that lesson in Northern Ireland. The French \nlearned it in Algeria. The Russians learned it in Afghanistan and are \nre-learning it every day in Chechnya. America learned it in Vietnam, \nand we must not re-learn it in Iraq.\n  Our men and women in uniform are the finest in world, and all \nAmericans admire and honor their ability and their courage. In Iraq, \nthey are now being forced to do an extraordinary job they were never \ntrained for, and they are doing it under extreme and unpredictable \ncircumstances.\n  Even with the best forces in the history of the world, our military \ncannot succeed if the mission is not achievable, if they are viewed as \noccupiers, and if we do not have a clearly defined and realistic \nstrategy.\n  In recent weeks, in Massachusetts, at Fort Stewart in Georgia, and at \nWalter Reed Hospital, I have met with American troops who fought in \nIraq. I am profoundly moved by the price they pay to serve our country, \nand profoundly impressed by their professionalism and commitment. They \nare willing to endure great hardship and great danger in Iraq to \ncomplete their mission. But they want to know when their mission will \nbe complete, and when they will be able to come home.\n  They are resourceful and strong. But more and more they are \nfrustrated--especially by the faceless nature of the threat. \nIndividuals intent on killing Americans are firing from behind the \ncover of crowds, to provoke our soldiers into firing back on civilians. \nMany of our troops say they were never trained to be police officers or \nto fight a guerrilla war.\n  They want to help the Iraqi people. But the increasing casualties \nmake them feel unsafe. They want to respond militarily to attacks. But \nthey often don't know who the attacker is.\n  They tell me that at first, their convoys were welcomed. But after \ntime, children began to throw rocks at them, and then came the bullets. \nThey tell me that far too many in Iraq believe we are there to take \ntheir oil, and that we will stay forever.\n  They have no clear sense about their post-war mission. Some see it as \nwinning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. Some believe it is \nsecurity. Some feel it is to obtain intelligence about opposition \nforces and weapons caches. Others think it is to prevent sabotage of \nthe oil pipelines and other vital infrastructure. Still others say it \nis to build sidewalks and soccer fields and schools and hospitals, and \nother local facilities. Not one of the soldiers told me their mission \nwas to achieve Iraq's transition to democracy.\n  We read today in the Washington Post about a survey of our troops. \nTheir morale is low. They believe their mission lacks clear definition. \nThey are getting worn down.\n  The ongoing occupation of Iraq has imposed a heavy burden on our \nforces and created a crisis for the military. It is now stretched \nprecariously thin. We do not have enough active duty soldiers to \nsustain their presence in Iraq and also meet security needs in \nAfghanistan and other parts of the world.\n  The crisis is coming to a head now. Two of our divisions are \nscheduled to return from Iraq in the spring. If the administration is \nunsuccessful in recruiting forces from other nations, it will have to \nsend in at least another division of American troops--and we don't have \nenough active duty forces to do the job. That means even more call-ups \nfrom the National Guard and Reserves. In fact, if international troops \naren't coming, the administration must notify reservists by the end of \nthis very month to guarantee that they will be available by spring.\n  Already, close to half our troops in Iraq are members of the Guard or \nReserves; 13,000 have been on active duty for at least a year. Others \nhave recently returned home from deployments, only to turn around and \nhead overseas for another tour.\n  One reservist I recently spoke to had only 17 days off between tours \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The average reservist now spends 13 times \nlonger on active duty today than during the 1990s. Many cannot go home \nwhen their scheduled time is finished, and are repeatedly sent instead \non new deployments overseas.\n  In Iraq, our reservists are being pressed into duty as the first line \nof defense. They need 120 to 150 days to\n\n[[Page S12640]]\n\ntrain before being sent to Iraq. The Army needs to let them know now to \nbegin this crucial training. It typically takes 8 years under the \ncurrent peacetime system for a Reserve combat unit to reach the level \nof readiness of an active unit. But we don't have 8 years. They are \nneeded in Iraq this spring.\n  Even worse, reservists are being sent into combat with inferior \nequipment. They have told me they had to rely on Vietnam-era night \nvision goggles that obscure more than they reveal, even though the \nlatest technology is used by the regular military. They told me they \nhad to use outdated and less-effective flak jackets, not the latest \nmodels with bulletproof ceramic inserts. They told me they had to wait \nthree months for other current gear. Many units did not have armored \nHumvees. Instead, they had to hang flak jackets in the windows to \nprotect themselves from attack.\n  I visited some of our wounded soldiers last week at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center. More than 1,800 American service men and women have \nbeen wounded in this war, and an average of 7 new patients arrive at \nWalter Reed from Iraq each day. Many were ambushed driving along a \nroad. Many lost limbs because their Humvees did not have the armor to \nprotect them from the blast of a rocket-propelled grenade or a booby \ntrap in the road.\n  Their families feel the strain of their deployment both emotionally \nand financially. Many members of the Guard or Reserves give up higher \ncivilian salaries when they go on active duty. Even though the law \nprohibits discrimination against reservists, increasingly, they are \nunwilling to tell possible employers about their military obligation, \nfor fear they will not be hired or kept on the job. It is a sad day for \npatriotism when service to our Nation is a negative factor in civilian \nemployment.\n  Far more American soldiers and marines have been killed since the end \nof major combat operations in May than during the 3-week war itself. \nThese are not just statistics. Each name on the list has many who \nmourn, whether parents, spouses, children, brothers or sisters.\n  We cannot go on this way. We should have known that military victory \nwould be quick, and that winning the peace would be the challenge.\n  I support our troops. It is the administration's policy that has \nfailed them. Their perceptions demonstrate the wider failure of our \npolicy and the need for the administration to move in a decisively \ndifferent direction.\n  The administration ignores the lesson of history that nation building \ncannot succeed in a cauldron of insecurity. Iraq is America's sixth \nmajor nation-building challenge in the past 10 years--Somalia, Haiti, \nBosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and now Iraq.\n  Security was indispensable to nation building in each case. But in \nIraq, we seem incapable of meeting the basic security needs of our own \nArmed Forces, let alone the Iraqi people.\n  When America intervened in Haiti in 1994, large numbers of \ninternational armed police were brought in to support our military and \nachieve a greater measure of safety for the Haitian people. The first \ntask was to establish security in a country that did not even have a \ncivilian police force. We responded by recruiting a large multinational \npolice force from 20 different countries.\n  When America intervened in Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo in 1998 we \nunderstood that security for local citizens was essential for resuming \neconomic growth and reaching our nation-building goals. In Kosovo, our \nallies offered highly trained police, including some heavily armed, \nwhich were critical to minimizing violence after the conflict ended and \nenabling reconstruction and political progress to be made.\n  In Kosovo, our soldiers were given training in controlling crowds, \nestablishing security cordons, and searching vehicles. But when I \nvisited the soldiers of the Third Infantry Division last week, they \ntold me they did not receive such training, even though it would have \nserved them well in the cities of Iraq.\n  The Pentagon assumed we would be able to draw on thousands of \nSaddam's police officers to provide security, but in the critical early \nweeks that followed the war, they were nowhere to be found, and too \nmany of them were thugs and torturers.\n  Six months later, there is still confusion. At the end of August, the \nformer New York City Police Commissioner in charge of police training \nprogram in Iraq announced that he had reached an agreement to train \n28,000 Iraqi police in a camp in Hungary. Within a week, the Prime \nMinister of Hungary announced that he knew of no such agreement. He \nsaid that Hungary had no appropriate training facility, and that \nsomeone should inform his government of what was going on. Now, we hear \nthat the administration has organized a training camp in Jordan.\n\n  The Pentagon also assumed that the bulk of the Iraqi armed forces \ncould be used to supplement our forces. But soon after the war began, \nthe Iraqi army melted away. Its members went home, and the army was \nformally disbanded by our Government before they were screened and \nbefore they were disarmed. We lost the decent ones who could have \nhelped provide security, and we let Hussein's true believers get away \nwith their weapons.\n  Countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Argentina, the European \nUnion, or Spain could provide well-trained police to prevent saboteurs \nfrom undermining the extensive reconstruction effort and to advance our \nbroader nation-building objectives. But so far, we have been unable to \npersuade additional nations to share the burden and the cost.\n  The Bush administration's continuing arrogance in Iraq has forced the \nbest-trained military in the world to act as police officers in a \nshooting gallery, to carry out police functions for which they are ill-\nprepared and ill-equipped. For Iraq now and for future crises \nelsewhere, we need to build support in the international community for \na reserve police identified and trained for post-conflict deployments.\n  It is shocking that the White House is only now beginning to \ncoordinate which agency should be responsible for various tasks. This \nshould not have waited 6 months. It should have been standard operating \nprocedure from the outset to outline an integrated strategy that meets \nour military needs, the needs for local policing and reconstruction, \nand the need for progress in achieving a free and legitimate Iraqi \ngovernment. They go hand-in-hand. But none can succeed unless basic \nsecurity is guaranteed.\n  The administration's policy of rushing to put large multibillion-\ndollar contracts in the hands of American firms ignores not only the \nlesson of history but also the lesson of human nature--the Iraqi people \nneed to be the real partners in the reconstruction effort.\n  The administration is wrongly working from the top down, rather than \nthe bottom up, to rebuild Iraq. A new Iraq will emerge neighborhood by \nneighborhood, town by town, province by province. How can any \nRepublican President of the United States disagree that government must \nbe of the people, by the people, and for the people?\n  We need closer alignment between military units working on \nreconstruction and the civilians working at the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. Our soldiers in the field are surveying the damage and \nidentifying priorities for repair. They need local counterparts. We \ncannot solve every problem from Saddam's palace in Baghdad.\n  Why not scale back the lavish resources being provided to U.S. \ncontractors and consultants and provide larger sums directly to the \nIraqi people? We could do so in many cases by developing ties between \nlocal councils and the Iraqi Governing Council. We could work more with \nlocal non-governmental organizations and local businesses. In all \ncases, we need to insist on transparency in the process, so we know \nwhere the funding is going.\n  It is the Iraqi people's country. They have the greatest stake in the \nsuccess of the reconstruction, and involving them now will enhance the \nprospects for success.\n  In some areas of Iraq, we already have been able to achieve \nimpressive results with small amounts of money. In one case, we funded \nthe building of a cement factory for less than $100,000, when the bid \nby an American contractor for the same project was in the millions. Why \nnot do more of this with schools, medical clinics, roads and countless \nother projects?\n  Iraq has many of the best-trained petroleum engineers in the world. \nWhy\n\n[[Page S12641]]\n\nnot give them--rather than American companies--a larger role in \nrebuilding the industry? Why not create jobs for Iraqis and give them \nownership of their reconstruction?\n  If we insist on saying Halliburton rules, because to the victor \nbelong the spoils, we won't be the victor for very long.\n  The administration's policy in Iraq ignores the indisputable lesson \nof history that building democracy is complex and difficult.\n  When the British accepted responsibility for the new nation of Iraq \nafter the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, they \nencountered enormous difficulties in creating a stable government \nacross Sunni, Shia, Kurd and other ethnic and religious groups. Many \nKurds wanted their own state--and still do. Tensions have existed \nbetween Sunni and Shia for 13 centuries. Iraq had no history of unity.\n  In the words of one tribal chieftain, ``History did not die; the \ntribes and notables who emerged in 1920 and created our modern state in \n1921 are here to stay with all the others who came into being \nthereafter.''\n  Instead of learning from this painful history, we condemned ourselves \nto repeat it. Instead of anticipating the obviously similar and \npredictable divisions and demands when Saddam's regime fell, the Bush \nadministration believed that a few favored Iraqi exile leaders, many of \nthem in exile for years, could return to Iraq, rally the population and \nlead the new government. That was another failure. The Iraqi people \nrejected them from the start and resisted their domination.\n  The administration believed that once a few hundred top advisers to \nSaddam were removed from power, large numbers of local officials would \nremain to run the government. Instead the collapse of government in \nBaghdad rippled across the country.\n  If history is any guide, America will not be able to impose our \nvision of democracy on the Iraqi people on our current terms and our \ntimetable. Our overarching interest is the development of a government \nthat has legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens, so that the longer \nprocess of building durable democratic institutions can proceed \neffectively in the years to come. This process will not be finished \nswiftly, or easily, and it will not take place according to our will.\n  Iraq is a society where, for the full 30 years of Saddam's rule, \npolitics ruled from the top. It will take time for the Iraqi people to \nadjust to the new decentralization of power and to understand how the \nmultiple levels of a working democratic government can function \neffectively.\n  The administration clings to the hope that the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil--25 people, many of whom have never worked together before--can \nadopt a constitution in time to hold successful elections next year.\n  On July 23, Ambassador Bremer said that it ``should be possible'' to \nhave elections next year.\n  On September 26, Secretary of State Powell gave the Iraqis 6 months \nto write a constitution.\n  In Bosnia, the United States pressed for national elections the first \nyear, before viable local democratic political institutions were \ndeveloped, and it made the development of democracy more difficult. \nBased on the historical precedents, a recent RAND publication suggests \nholding national elections roughly 2 years after reconstruction begins. \nThe International Crisis Group also reached the conclusion that it \ncould take 2 years before national elections should be held.\n  The lesson is clear. We cannot rush. It is not surprising that our \ninsistence on such speed is alienating the many Iraqis who know the \nprocess needs more time. The date of their national election should not \nbe determined by the date of ours.\n  Imposing our will and our timetable on the Iraqi people will \nundermine our all-important long-term goal of achieving a legitimate \nIraqi government committed to remaining on the path to democracy. \nAlready, the Interim Governing Council lacks credibility in the eyes of \nmany Iraqis. On paper, it has broad power, but that fools no one. It is \ncontrolled by the United States, and it lacks sufficient power to meet \nthe Iraqi people's needs.\n  The administration needs to give greater priority to restoring \nsovereignty and help lay the groundwork for approving a constitution \nand holding national elections. In Afghanistan, we obtained the support \nof the international community for an interim government that was not \nunder American occupation. That process can still work in Iraq, \nalthough it would have clearly worked better from the start. As we did \nin Afghanistan, we need a process to transfer sovereignty to the \nIraqis, who in turn, can ask the U.S. and U.N. for assistance.\n  If the United States is seen as controlling the new government in \nBaghdad, it will fail--if not now, then later; if not while our forces \nare still there, then as soon as they are gone. Those who work with \nsuch a government are easily dismissed by the Iraqi people as American \npuppets. We must take the time necessary to give Iraqis the ownership \nof their government, if we expect it to have any credibility and \nstaying power.\n  Whether the Bush administration likes it or not, they need a central \nrole for the United Nations to help accomplish this goal. Before \nbecoming National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice seemed to \nunderstand this.\n  In a January 2000 article in Foreign Affairs, she wrote: ``U.S. \ninterests are served by having strong alliances and can be promoted \nwithin the U.N. and other multilateral organizations . . . ''.\n  She wrote: ``The president must remember that the military is a \nspecial instrument. It is lethal, and it is meant to be. It is not a \ncivilian police force. It is not a political referee, and it is most \ncertainly not designed to build a civilian society.''\n\n  Condi Rice's words indict the administration's own policy now. It is \nessential to involve the international community as an active and equal \npartner in the political transition of Iraq.\n  We need to give the U.N. a central role. The administration's \ndecision to go back to the United Nations is a first step, but it is \nmeaningful only if the administration is genuinely changing its policy. \nThe real test will be whether the administration is now willing to make \nthe compromises necessary to persuade other countries to contribute \ntroops to relieve our soldiers and to bring stability to Iraq. The jury \nis still out on whether the U.N. resolution will mark a real shift by \nthe administration.\n  We know from experience of the past decade in this post-cold war \nworld, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and in other devastated lands, that we can \nenlist the international community in a major way. We can share \nresponsibility and authority, draw on the strengths and the diversity \nof the United Nations, achieve security and reconstruction, and an end \nto the occupation. For many months, the administration has been wrong \nto try to bypass the United Nations by enticing a few receptive nations \nto join us if the price is right.\n  No one doubts that the United States should remain in charge of the \nmilitary operation. But internationalizing the reconstruction is not a \nluxury; it is an imperative. Sharing authority with the United Nations \nto manage the transition to democracy will give the process legitimacy \nand gradually dispel the current stigma of occupation--especially if it \nis accompanied by the creation of a more fully representative interim \ngoverning council to deal with day-to-day administrative \nresponsibilities.\n  As soon as possible, we need to redouble the effort to bring in \nforces with regional faces--especially Muslim faces. Nations such as \nJordan, Pakistan, and Egypt could immediately transform this mission \nwith both their diversity and their expertise. The United Arab Emirates \ncontributed effectively to the effort in Kosovo. Morocco and Albania \nhave worked with us in Bosnia. That strategy can work for us in Iraq \nnow as well.\n  In their joint memoir, ``A World Transformed,'' President George H.W. \nBush and his National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, reflected on \ntheir own experiences with Iraq and the Gulf War in 1991. They had been \ncriticized in some quarters for halting that war after their dramatic \nvictory in Kuwait, instead of going on to Baghdad to depose Saddam \nHussein.\n  Here is what they wrote:\n\n       Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into \n     an occupation of Iraq, would have violated our guideline \n     about not changing objectives in midstream, engaging in\n\n[[Page S12642]]\n\n     `mission creep,' and would have incurred incalculable human \n     and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible \n     . . . We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in \n     effect, rule Iraq. The coalition would instantly have \n     collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in anger and other allies \n     pulling out as well. Under those circumstances, there was no \n     viable `exit strategy' we could see . . . Had we gone the \n     invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be \n     an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land. It would have \n     been a dramatically different--and perhaps barren--outcome.\n\n  They were right.\n  It is time for this administration to admit that it was wrong, and \nturn in a new direction. We need a genuine plan that acknowledges the \nrealities on the ground. We need a plan that gives real authority to \nthe United Nations, so that other nations truly will share the burden. \nWe need to actively engage the Iraqi people in governing and rebuilding \ntheir country. Our soldiers now risking their lives in Iraq deserve no \nless.\n  Here at home, all Americans are being asked to bear the burden, too--\nand they deserve more than a phony summons to support our troops by \npursuing policies that will only condemn them to greater and greater \ndanger. Yes, we must stay the course--but not the wrong course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I understand there are 2 minutes left \nfor morning business on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: At that point, does the schedule \ncall for going to the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 50 seconds remaining on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when we go \nto the bill, I be recognized to speak first on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I object. I say this respectfully: We \nworked very hard last night to get a routine set up here this morning. \nSenators Stevens and Byrd agreed to it. Senator Byrd is coming to speak \nand to offer an amendment. I would be happy to yield our 50 seconds, \nand after the 3 minutes expires, we should call on Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended so that I might speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that would be extended by 7 minutes on \ntheir side; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We will extend it by 7 minutes on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \na vote that will be coming up on the $20 billion in the form of loans \nor grants.\n  Two weeks ago yesterday, on October 1, I spoke at some length in \nfavor of having loans. I believe that is the correct position and focus \non the $20 billion in the context of viewing what is happening in Iraq, \nwhich is essentially a bankrupt country where in general bankruptcy \nproceedings all existing debt would be extinguished and the activities \nof rebuilding Iraq would be a new day; and, in light of the United \nNations resolution in May of this year authorizing the United States \nand the United Kingdom to use Iraqi oil to rebuild Iraq, that is the \nappropriate course with the narrow focus on this $20 billion.\n  In the intervening 2 weeks, I have consulted with my colleagues and \nwith members of the administration and have rethought the issue. It is \nmy view that in a broader context there ought to be a grant instead of \nloans. I have come to that conclusion after having, as I said, talked \nto my colleagues and having met with a group on a bipartisan basis, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who are looking for a structure at least in \npart for loans, and having talked to the President the day before \nyesterday and Secretary of State Powell and other members of the \nadministration.\n  As I am viewing this $20 billion in the much broader context of the \noverall strategy, it is my judgment that we ought to give the President \nleeway to carry out his plan.\n  The day before yesterday, a group of Senators, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, met with President Bush and with Secretary of State Colin \nPowell. I have not seen the President with such fervor and such \ndetermination and such intensity since I saw him 2 days after 9/11 when \nhe called in some Members from the impacted States. One of the planes \nwent down in Pennsylvania. And he had blood in his eye when he said he \nwas not going to send a $1 million missile to an empty tent.\n  The President and the Secretary of State spoke in terms of the \nbroader objectives of the administration beyond this $20 billion. The \nSecretary of State talked about the efforts to get a United Nations \nresolution which would give broader support to the United States' \nposition in an effort to bring in Pakistan, Turkey, and Muslim \ncountries to give the Arabs more confidence. I believe this type of \nmultilateral approach is really necessary.\n  I tried back on October 11 of last year to carry forward the Lugar-\nBiden amendment which would have done more to have a multilateral \napproach before the use of force. But that was yesterday. Today, we are \nlooking at a very different picture.\n  The funds for the rebuilding of Iraq could be necessary far beyond \nthis $20 billion. I believe the narrow focus of using the Iraqi oil as \nauthorized by the United Nations resolution is sound. Ambassador Bremer \nis considering the long-range plan. I think the sentiment which is \nfairly strong in this body for loans as opposed to grants ought to be \ntaken into consideration and, if the President's policy is successful \non having this as a grant, that there is a strong underlying fervor \nthat there ought to be a repayment and a funding of the rebuilding of \nIraq from the Iraqi resources, which is the second biggest pool of oil \nin the world.\n  I am not unmindful of the arguments about how much money will be \nspent by the Federal Government on rebuilding schools in Iowa \ncontrasted to rebuilding schools in Iraq; or how much money will be \nspent in Vermont building hospitals as opposed to spending money in \nBaghdad. I am not unmindful of the role of the Congress and the primacy \nunder the Constitution on the appropriations process. In listening to \nthe President as he outlines his broader strategy, I do believe he \nbears the lion's share of the responsibility.\n  We are going to have the donor's conference in Madrid later this \nmonth. The President is emphatic in his view that we will have a better \nchance to get more donors if we make a grant instead of a loan, that \nthere will be a better chance to have other countries forgive debt and \nthat, as he is setting out to a trip to the Far East, we ought to be in \na position to be supportive as to where he thinks he can best lead the \ncountry.\n  In so doing, I do not relinquish my vote and the authority which I \nhave as a Senator, a Member of Congress, on our appropriations process \nas we will be looking at very substantial funding in the future. When I \nthink about the issue and reflect on it and rethink beyond the narrower \nfocus of the $20 billion to the broader strategy, I think of the \nmetaphor of too many cooks spoil the broth. The President has a very \nheavy responsibility as he moves ahead to the donor's conference \nthrough his representatives and on his trip to the Far East.\n  When I look at the delegation of authority which we have given him on \nappropriations, the defense budget, the foreign operations budget, and \nthe State Department budget, it proximates in excess of $400 billion. \nThis is about 5 percent. As I take a look at our overall Federal budget \nof $2.2 trillion, the $20 billion is less than 1 percent. I believe \nthis vote, which we will cast later today, is a very important vote as \nto how the administration and how Secretary Powell will approach the \nUnited Nations and multilateralisism. We cast a great many votes in \nthis body but relatively few are really important votes. This is an \nimportant vote.\n  That is why I believe the validity of treating this as a loan is \nsolid on the narrow focus for the $20 billion as a loan, but on the \nbroader picture of the strategy which the President is trying to carry \nforward, I am prepared today to defer to him on this and to vote for a \ngrant instead of a loan.\n\n[[Page S12643]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is still on \nthe floor, and I wonder how long he wishes to speak on the bill. \nSenator Byrd is here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his inquiry.\n  During the course of my remarks, I abbreviated them and cut them \nshort. As I have said to the Senator, I do not appear very often to ask \nfor time. I see Senator Byrd approaching.\n  In response to the Senator from Nevada, there was one other line of \ncontention which I had intended to make. I can make it in a moment or \ntwo.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That will do it. When the Senator says a minute or 2--my \nremarks are easily in excess of 4 minutes but I can limit them to 4 \nminutes.\n  The other consideration which I had intended to offer in the course \nof the remarks I have just made, in a broader focus beyond the confines \nof the $20 billion debt, is the issue of what is happening day in and \nday out in Iraq where we are spending, it is estimated, some $4 billion \na month and we are sustaining casualties and fatalities which are very \ndevastating for our country, the men and women in the armed services \nwho are being wounded, suffering fatalities, their relatives and \nfriends.\n  If we move ahead with greater speed, which we will be able to do on a \ngrant instead of a loan, it may well be that we can cut down the time \nwe will be in Iraq, that it will facilitate the starting of electricity \nand the infrastructure of Iraq so we can move out and allow the Iraqi \nGovernment to take over. With the very heavy costs in casualties, \nfatalities and dollars, the speed that these grants can help is another \nfactor in consideration so that on the totality of the matter in the \nbroader picture, I am prepared to defer to the President's judgment on \nthis matter, on this vote.\n  The issue has created enough focus so that the administration will \nknow when the additional funding is to be undertaken that there will be \na very strong sentiment in the Congress that Iraqi resources ought to \npay for the rebuilding of Iraq and that this decision to have grants \ninstead of loans will further support the good faith and bona fides of \nthe United States that we have not gone into Iraq for their oil but \nhave gone into Iraq to liberate the Iraqi people from the despotism of \nSaddam Hussein and to build a democracy in that country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield back our time for morning business \nso we can get to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1689, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1689) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and \n     reconstruction for the fiscal year ending September 30th, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Byrd amendment No. 1818, to impose a limitation on the use \n     of sums appropriated for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n     Fund.\n       Byrd/Durbin amendment No. 1819, to prohibit the use of Iraq \n     Relief and Reconstruction Funds for low priority activities \n     that should not be the responsibility of U.S. taxpayers, and \n     shift $600 million from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n     Fund to Defense Operations and Maintenance, Army, for \n     significantly improving efforts to secure and destroy \n     conventional weapons, such as bombs, bomb materials, small \n     arms, rocket propelled grenades, and shoulder-launched \n     missiles, in Iraq.\n       Bond/Mikulski amendment No. 1825, to provide additional VA \n     Medical Care Funds for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       Dubin amendment No. 1837, to ensure that a Federal employee \n     who takes leave without pay in order to perform certain \n     service as a member of the uniformed services or member of \n     the National Guard shall continue to receive pay in an amount \n     which, when taken together with the pay and allowances such \n     individual is receiving for such service, will be no less \n     than the basic pay such individual would then be receiving if \n     no interruption in employment had occurred.\n       Reed/Hagel amendment No. 1834, to increase the end strength \n     of the Army and to structure the additional forces for \n     constabulary duty.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we urge Senators to contact the \nmanagers of this bill to try to work out a time when their amendments \nmight be considered, and to see if we have any possibility of dealing \nwith the several amendments at one time. We tried to do that last night \nwith regard to reporting requirements, and I stated to the Senate it is \nour hope we can blend all of the reporting requirements along with \nthose that are already in the House bill and work out a logical \nsequence for the reporting and the activities of an inspector general, \nif that is required as far as the Iraq operation is concerned.\n  We will be hopeful that today we can look at--there are additional \namendments being suggested on the list that was approved last night for \nreporting requirements, and I would be pleased to consider taking any \nof those and adding them to the package that is already in the bill for \nreporting requirements and for details regarding the inspector general. \nBut my purpose for seeking the floor right now is to urge Senators to \ncontact the managers of the bill, and let us work out some logical \nsequence in terms of the amendments that are pending or will be \noffered.\n  This is going to be a long day. We still have the commitment that we \nwill do our utmost to finish by tomorrow. I congratulate my good friend \nfrom Nevada, the Democratic assistant leader, for all his efforts in \ngetting us to where we are now in terms of knowing the amendments that \nare possible to be considered.\n  But within the timeframe we have, we cannot consider them all without \nreally a great deal of consideration on both sides in terms of the \namount of time a Senator takes to explain the amendment and \nparticularly in terms of Senators being willing to cooperate with us to \nblend amendments so we can deal with one subject maybe in one or two \namendments. That is possible. I look forward to working with Senator \nReid, who is actively involved in trying to reduce the number of these \namendments, as well as I am, with our joint staffs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1818\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1818.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending under the previous \norder.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S12644]]\n\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He is always on the job. And he is effective. \nHe is characteristically courteous. I commend him on the progress he \nhas made already on the bill.\n  There are several cosponsors of this amendment. I hope they will come \nto the floor and join in the debate concerning the amendment. I need \ntheir voices to blend with my own, mine being the weakest of all. But I \nneed the cosponsors to join and make this supreme effort here to have \nthe Senate adopt this extremely worthwhile amendment.\n  In all the discussion surrounding the President's request for $20.3 \nbillion for reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan--in the \nquestion of whether the funding should be in the form of a grant or a \nloan, in the revelation of a series of frivolous proposed expenditures, \nin the dispute over whether reconstruction funding is a gold-plated \nadd-on or an integral part of the occupation strategy--there is an \noverriding issue that we must not allow to be lost in the noise of the \ndebate.\n  That issue involves the fact that American taxpayers--American \ntaxpayers--are being presented virtually the entire bill for the \nstabilization and reconstruction of Iraq because of decisions that were \nmade by the President before the war began, decisions to embrace an \nunprecedented doctrine of preemption and to invade Iraq without the \nsupport of the United Nations or the international community.\n\n  Those decisions are coming home to haunt us today. The chickens are \ncoming home to roost. Because of the President's obstinance and go-it-\nalone mentality, it is American soldiers who are patrolling the most \ndangerous streets and cities of Iraq, and it is American taxpayers who \nare being asked to foot the bill for the stabilization and \nreconstruction of Iraq--American soldiers and American taxpayers.\n  It appears there is little relief in sight. After seesawing back and \nforth, the United Nations Security Council is now expected to accept a \nrevised U.S. resolution on Iraq, but the resolution on the table is \nlittle more than a fancy fig leaf designed to camouflage an empty \ngesture. The resolution proposed by the United States cedes no \nmeaningful authority to the United Nations and is likely to have little \nimpact on the number of foreign troops or the amount of international \nfinancial assistance the United Nations will provide for the \nstabilization and the reconstruction of Iraq.\n  American troops in Iraq and American taxpayers at home need real help \nfrom the international community. The President needs to reach out to \nthe United Nations, not merely attempt to paper over the glaring lack \nof support from the international community with a resolution that, as \nsome Texans are wont to say, is all hat and no cattle.\n  The administration's reckless misadventure in Iraq is exacting a high \nprice in lost lives, lost respect for our Nation in the world, and lost \nground in the war on terrorism. And yet, in the past week, the only \nvisible response from the President to the continuing chaos in Iraq has \nbeen to reshuffle the chain of command in Washington by creating a new \nentity to consolidate Iraq's reconstruction in the White House instead \nof the Pentagon.\n  The President misses the point. Instead of rearranging the chairs on \nthe deck, the President should be changing direction. Creating a new \nIraq policy shop in the White House will not bring relief to American \nsoldiers on the ground, and it will not save American taxpayers from \nhaving to shoulder, virtually alone, the staggering financial burden of \nrebuilding Iraq.\n  Now, the American people, in the first place, did not buy on to this \nidea that we were going to rebuild Iraq. They were not told that. They \nwere not told we were going to rebuild a nation there. They were not \ntold about the staggering costs of rebuilding Iraq.\n  If there is any shift in the balance of power over the reconstruction \nof Iraq--and there should be--it must be across oceans, not just across \nthe Potomac. It is long past time to bring in the United Nations as a \nfull partner with shared responsibility and shared decisionmaking for \nthe future of Iraq. The President does not need another in-house \ncommittee to advise him on the future of Iraq. He needs to \ninternationalize the stabilization and the reconstruction effort.\n\n  Instead of instituting meaningful change in his Iraq policy, the \nPresident presented a bait-and-switch proposition to the American \npeople: Don't look too closely at the policy, just keep your attention \non the policy shop.\n  We cannot undo what has been done in Iraq. But we can chart a better \ncourse for the future.\n  First and foremost, the Bush administration should drop its stubborn \ninsistence that the world community not have any authority in the \npolitical reconstruction of Iraq. The resolution that will be \nconsidered at the United Nations Security Council this morning makes \nsome progress in promoting cooperation between the United Nations and \nthe Iraqi Governing Council but keeps the United Nations at an arm's \nlength from the Coalition Provisional Authority. It is this authority, \nheaded by Paul Bremer, that exercises total authority in postwar Iraq.\n  If you don't believe what I have said about total authority, just \nlisten. Ambassador Bremer's first regulation as head of the Coalition \nProvisional Authority reads in part as follows:\n\n       The CPA is vested with all executive, legislative, and \n     judicial authority--\n\n  How about that? ``The CPA is vested with all,'' not just an itty-\nbitty part--\n\n       executive, legislative, and judicial authority necessary to \n     achieve its objectives. . . .\n\n  Take a look at the first sentence in article I of the Constitution of \nthe United States which I hold in my hands. The first sentence in this \nConstitution, article I, section 1:\n\n       All legislative Powers granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  What a sweeping investiture of power that first sentence makes--``all \nlegislative power.'' It doesn't say anything about executive or \njudicial power, ``all legislative power.'' But listen to this, \nAmbassador Bremer's first regulation as head of the Coalition \nProvisional Authority:\n\n       The CPA is vested with all executive, legislative, and \n     judicial authority necessary to achieve its objectives, to be \n     exercised under relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, \n     including Resolution 1483 (2003), and the laws and usages of \n     war. This authority shall be exercised by the CPA \n     administrator.\n\n  What an enormous grant of power that is. The new resolution that will \nbe voted on today at the United Nations will not change the supreme \nauthority claimed by Paul Bremer who was installed in his post by the \nPresident without offering his nomination to the U.S. Senate for its \nadvice and consent.\n  There is power--power. Remember the old song: There is power, power, \nwonder working power.\n  Well, if the international community is going to continue to be \nsqueezed out of the political decisionmaking in the Coalition \nProvisional Authority, there is little incentive for the world to \nmobilize to come to the aid of postwar Iraq. The President's ``my way \nor the highway'' approach to the governance of Iraq undermines the \nmission in Iraq and ignores the will of the American people. The United \nNations is willing to help, but only if the administration drops \nits false pride and its bravado.\n\n  ``Bring them on,'' the President said. That is bravado.\n  Before coming into office, then-candidate Bush talked of a humble \napproach to foreign policy. ``Let us reject the blinders of \nisolationism, just as we refuse the crown of empire,'' he said. ``Let \nus not dominate others with our power or betray them with our \nindifference,'' he said. ``And let us have an American foreign policy \nthat reflects American character,'' he said. ``The modesty of true \nstrength, the humility of real greatness,'' the President said.\n  Those were the words of candidate George W. Bush, but they have been \nfar from the practice of President George W. Bush.\n  Similarly, the administration ought to rethink its extreme good-\nversus-evil mantra that seems to be running this Nation's foreign \npolicy into a morass of confusion and danger. The administration's \nobstinance continues to strain America's relationship with other \ncountries and undermines our credibility with other foreign powers.\n  President Bush committed the United States to war without broad \ninternational support. He said: If you don't do it, we will. He said: \nIf the United Nations doesn't do it, we will.\n\n[[Page S12645]]\n\nHe refused to go back to the United Nations prior to launching military \nattacks and continues to stiff-arm the international community even \ntoday, when that help is so vital to the long-term interests of Iraq.\n  Instead, the Bush administration has adopted a go-it-alone mentality \nthat threatens the stability of the Middle East and could spill over \ninto other global areas.\n  The United States needs help in Iraq. The United States needs a plan \nthat will bring relief to our overburdened soldiers by attracting \nsignificantly more foreign troops to Iraq and bring relief to our \noverburdened taxpayers by attracting financial assistance from the \ninternational community for reconstruction.\n  The President's proposal does neither. His $87 billion spending \nrequest places the entire burden of securing and rebuilding Iraq \nsquarely on the shoulders of the American forces and American \ntaxpayers. That burden ought not be carried by the United States \nalone. That is why Senator Kennedy, Senator Leahy, other Senators and I \nhave proposed an alternative.\n\n  What Senator Kennedy, Senator Leahy, and other Senators and I have \noffered is more than an invitation to the international community to \nassume a large and vital role in the reconstruction of Iraq; it is a \ndemand, on behalf of the American people, that the President go to the \nnations of the world and work in partnership with those other nations \nof the world. It is a mandate for a new policy in Iraq, a policy that \nwill bring peace more quickly and stability more assuredly.\n  The amendment, in effect, says: Mr. President, your plan for Iraq has \nnot worked. It is costing lives every day and it is jeopardizing the \nlong-term security of the Middle East. We need to share political power \nin Iraq with the United Nations, and we must be willing to listen to \nthe rest of the world, share the responsibility, attract new partners \nfor peace, and protect our men and women in Iraq.\n  That is what this amendment would require. It is a commonsense \napproach to what is quickly becoming an American quagmire in Iraq. \nThese are dangerous times, Mr. President. These are dangerous times--\ntimes that demand determined, disciplined leadership.\n  The path ahead is not a certain one, but what is certain is that the \nUnited States cannot afford to blaze this path alone. America relied on \nstrong alliances, diplomacy, and, only when necessary, armed force to \nlead the world in the 20th century. But the Bush administration's 21st \ncentury America seems all too ready to focus solely on armed force \nrather than on strong alliances and diplomacy.\n  Simply put, we need a plan that would bring relief to the American \nsoldiers, to help U.S. troops by attracting significantly more foreign \nmilitary troops to Iraq; and we need a plan that will bring relief to \nthe overburdened American taxpayers by attracting meaningful financial \nassistance from the international community for the reconstruction of \nIraq. We need a framework to begin to bring American troops home, \nsupplemented by international forces on the ground--not just on paper--\nin Iraq.\n  Currently, the United States has approximately 120,000 troops in \nIraq. They are augmented by about 20,000 foreign forces, primarily from \nGreat Britain. Another 10,000 troops from Turkey would help, but it \nwould still leave more than 100,000 American troops in Iraq for the \nforeseeable future.\n  In an interview published in the Chicago Tribune on October 5, LTG \nRicardo Sanchez, the head of the coalition forces in Iraq, predicted \nthat it would be years--years--not months, before the United States can \ndraw down its forces from Iraq.\n  The American people were not told that, were they, when we went into \nthis war? No, they were not told that. The men and women in the \nNational Guard and Reserves were not told that, were they--that it \nwould be years, not months, before the United States could draw down \nits forces from Iraq?\n  Until a new Iraqi Army is trained and ready to assume command, the \nonly relief for American soldiers is to build up foreign troop presence \nin Iraq.\n  International financial assistance is equally important. The American \ntaxpayers cannot afford to bear the full cost of the reconstruction of \nIraq. We all know that the $20.3 billion requested by the President in \nthis supplemental is just the beginning, just a downpayment. It is not \nthe alpha and the omega of American taxpayers' dollars that will be \nasked by the administration in this enterprise.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that rebuilding Iraq is \nexpected to cost $56 billion over the next 4 years, according to an \nestimate reached by the World Bank, the United Nations, and the \nCoalition Provisional Authority. So far, other countries have pledged \nless than $2 billion to the effort.\n  The amendment that Senators Kennedy, Leahy, and I are offering would \nrequire the President to reach out to other nations for both military \nand financial support--reach out, reach out to other nations.\n  Our amendment provides that, after April 1, 2004, Iraq relief and \nreconstruction funds can only be obligated if, one, the President \ncertifies to Congress that the U.N. has adopted a new resolution \nauthorizing a multinational security force under U.S. leadership in \nIraq and providing a central role for the U.N. in the political and \neconomic development of Iraq; two, the President certifies that he has \na detailed plan in place for the reconstruction of Iraq, including a \nsignificant commitment of financial assistance from other nations; \nthree, Congress approves the release of the rest of the funds for the \nreconstruction of Iraq in another appropriations bill.\n  As part of his certification to Congress, the President must \nestablish a plan; he must establish a timetable for withdrawing \nAmerican troops from Iraq. This is the way to get the U.N. in and the \nU.S. out. It is a real alternative to the administration's bull-rush \napproach, and it is a significant gesture to the Iraqi people that \nAmerica is not an occupier but a real liberator.\n  The Byrd-Kennedy-Leahy amendment limits the funds for the \nreconstruction of Iraq that may be obligated prior to April 1, 2004, to \nthe $5.1 billion fund for Iraqi security and $5 billion for economic \nreconstruction.\n  Our amendment compels the President to work with the United Nations. \nOur amendment requires Congress to evaluate the progress of the \nreconstruction effort at the halfway mark next year. Most important, \nour amendment changes the course of the Iraq relief and reconstruction \neffort from a unilateral burden to an international obligation.\n  It is important to note that the full $5.1 billion that the \nadministration has requested for the Iraq Defense Corps and for \nimproving the Iraqi national security force is exempted from this \namendment. Only the nonsecurity portion of the reconstruction program \nis subject to a second vote.\n  It seems to me that this is the least we can do to provide relief to \nAmerican soldiers in Iraq--to have a timetable to bring those American \nsoldiers home to once again reunite with their families--and to \nsafeguard the interests of the American taxpayers in the \nadministration's program to finance the rebuilding of Iraq.\n\n  We have a far clearer vision today of the cost of rebuilding Iraq \nthan we did 6 months ago. I think we have a right to assume that we \nwill have an even better assessment--or we certainly should have--6 \nmonths from now.\n  This amendment gives the President 6 months to round up international \nmilitary and financial support for Iraq and gives his administration 6 \nmonths to demonstrate that the reconstruction program is working. Most \nimportantly, the amendment gives the American people--the American \npeople who are bearing the burden in the heat of the day--it gives the \nAmerican people some assurance that Congress is not walking away from \nits responsibility to provide oversight of the hard-earned tax dollars \nthat are going to Iraq.\n  If all goes as planned, Congress can quickly and in good conscience \nrelease the remainder of the money, but if unforeseen problems or \nserious shortfalls in expectations emerge, Congress has an opportunity \nto make a midcourse correction in America's involvement in postwar \nIraq. It is the American taxpayers money, you who are out there in the \nplains, the mountains, and the valleys of America looking through these \nelectronic lenses. It is your money, your money--deserve no less.\n\n[[Page S12646]]\n\n  This is not an anti-reconstruction amendment. It does not affect any \nof the money being appropriated for American military operations in \nIraq. It requires, rather, a progress report and a certification from \nthe President of the United States at the halfway mark, and it provides \nfor a vote--another vote--a vote from the people's representatives in \nCongress on whether the remaining funds for Iraq reconstruction are \nneeded and are justified.\n  This is a simple amendment to interject congressional oversight into \nthe expenditure of United States taxpayer dollars for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. I urge my colleagues to accept the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think we have been here before. This is \nanother amendment--it reminds me of Yogi Berra: It is deja vu all over \nagain. We are looking at the same problem. The problem is the \ndisagreement of the Senator from West Virginia with the President's \naction with regard to Iraq.\n  I read the Constitution, too. The President is Commander in Chief. He \nselected an ambassador who, in fact, has been confirmed by the Senate \nand gave him the powers to execute the actions necessary to move toward \nestablishing a new government in Iraq.\n  I was interested in the editorial in the Washington Post yesterday: \n``Stay Resolute on Rebuilding.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. The editorial starts off by saying:\n\n       This is a critical week for the U.S. mission in Iraq. The \n     test won't be overseas but in the House and the Senate, where \n     lawmakers are to vote on the administration's request for $87 \n     billion in emergency funding. It's imperative that this \n     spending be approved--not only the money required for \n     military operations but the smaller, more controversial, \n     amount for reconstruction aid. We omit an exact dollar figure \n     from the previous sentence because that's a legitimate \n     subject for debate. The Bush administration is asking for \n     $20.3 billion in reconstruction spending; the House \n     Appropriations Committee trimmed $1.7 billion from that \n     amount. What's important is not the precise number but the \n     underlying premise: that reconstruction is in the best \n     interests of both the United States and Iraq.\n\n  The editorial goes on:\n\n       One of the biggest temptations for lawmakers will be to \n     lend the money rather than spend it outright. This approach \n     has particular traction in the Senate, where a number of \n     Republicans are endorsing it. They argue that oil-rich Iraq \n     can pay for its own reconstruction; giving it the money \n     outright will just allow it to pay off existing debt more \n     quickly to countries that shirked the reconstruction task, at \n     U.S. taxpayer expense. This may play well back home, but it's \n     the wrong way to go.\n\n  This amendment will cap reconstruction funds for Iraq at $5 billion \nand require Congress to enact yet another appropriations bill to spend \nthe remainder of the funds. It attempts to sweeten the amendment with \n$5 billion for security-rated activities that is excluded from the cap, \nbut it is still a very bitter pill for those in charge of our troops in \nIraq to swallow.\n  As this editorial I just mentioned stated:\n\n       Paying to improve life for Iraqis will help create a safer \n     environment for U.S. troops and will hasten the day when they \n     can leave. Rebuilding the electricity grid, fixing the water \n     supply, getting the oil flowing, maintaining public safety--\n     all this is central to hopes for stability and representative \n     government.\n\n  In addition to untenable funding restraints, this amendment requires \na Presidential certification that the U.N. Security Council has adopted \na resolution authorizing a multinational force under United States \nleadership for Iraq and that reconstruction efforts are being \nsuccessfully implemented according to a detailed plan before additional \nfunds can be appropriated.\n\n  I know of nothing in the Constitution that says the Commander in \nChief of our Armed Forces has to give Congress a plan. He did give us a \nplan. There is a plan, and it is being executed. But to put it in law \nthat the Commander in Chief cannot spend money for our troops or for \nreconstruction efforts without a detailed plan is going too far.\n  Ambassador Bremer has a plan, and we are funding it. The President \nhas a plan, and we are following it, and he is the Commander in Chief. \nI think it is high time we recognize that the Commander in Chief has \npowers abroad, particularly when we have men and women in the field \nstill under security restraints. There are people over there still \nbeing killed daily, and that bothers me greatly.\n  What I fear most is the loss of momentum in the program being pursued \nby the amendments being offered that will derail the plan, derail the \noperations, and put in restrictions so we cannot go forward. I believe \nthe President has a plan and the Bremer plan will work. If it does not, \nthey will be back, I am sure. But if it does, it will be the first time \nin history where we went from the concept of a victory in the field \nmilitarily to establishing a new government in a country that has \nreally been totally destroyed by its former government, the Saddam \nHussein regime. It will be the first time we went from a military \nvictory to a new government without a long period of occupation.\n  The result of the Byrd amendment is that it will assure we will have \nincreased forces over there occupying Iraq for years and years. I don't \nknow where the Senator got that quote from, but no one told me we are \ngoing to be there years and years. As a matter of fact, our goal is not \nthat. We have already withdrawn some troops. The general the Senator \nquoted has already withdrawn some troops. We are not predicting they \nare going to be there for years and years. There may well be a United \nStates presence there for some time, whether or not the Iraqi people \nask for it. I hope they reach a point where they think they can provide \nfor their own security.\n  We have this ongoing problem in Afghanistan very clearly that is \ngoing to take some time to establish a government there. We do have \nsome international cooperation but not much really in the long run.\n  The Senator from West Virginia mentions the U.N. Just yesterday, the \nSecretary of State told us about the improved circumstance in the U.N. \ntoday.\n  We are pursuing a resolution in the U.N. but to make expenditure of \nour funds conditioned upon the resolution passing in the U.N. is \nabsolutely wrong. This amendment holds reconstruction efforts hostage \nto the passage of other appropriations bills and hostage to action by \nthe U.N.\n  Now, I would hope that Senators will read what I consider to be a \nvery appropriate editorial from the Washington Post that I have just \nplaced in the Record. It says:\n\n       The debate over reconstruction aid has become a means for \n     expressing frustration, much of it legitimate, about the \n     administration's Iraq policy. Why wasn't the administration \n     more honest from the outset about the costs? Why can't it do \n     a better job of getting other countries to help pay? What's \n     the plan for future years? How will it be paid for? Lawmakers \n     are right to use the leverage of debate to seek clearer \n     answers . . .\n\n  But debate is one thing; restrictions in the law is an entirely \ndifferent thing. I do not believe Congress has the power and should not \ntry to exercise the power to put restraints on the Commander in Chief \nwhen we have forces in the field. Our job is to provide the money to \nkeep those men and women safe, and that is what this bill does. Sixty-\nsix-plus billion dollars is to maintain our troops. The balance is one \nof the most distinct things the President has done as a leader, to say \nlet's move forward now. Let's give them a chance to create a new \ngovernment. Let's help them set up their security. Let's help them \nrestore their means of living. Let's help them restore their energy. \nLet's help them restore their oilfields. Let's help them restore safety \nin the streets. Let's work with them so they can take over their own \ngovernment.\n  I received a letter this morning from the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, and I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Ambassador \nBremer be printed in the Record. I will make copies available for every \nSenator.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Coalition Provisional Authority,\n\n                                        Baghdad, October 16, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I want to express my personal \n     appreciation to you for your superb\n\n[[Page S12647]]\n\n     efforts in managing, S. 1689 the President's Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriation. All of us in the Coalition \n     Provisional Authority are especially pleased with the \n     expeditious manner in which the legislation has moved through \n     the Committee and now in the Senate.\n       The Supplemental the President has submitted provides a \n     clear strategy for achieving our goal of an early restoration \n     of full sovereignty to the Iraqi people and for making \n     additional progress in the war on terrorism.\n        I want you and your colleagues to know that we are making \n     every endeavor to operate in a transparent and accountable \n     manner. But any major cuts of specific portions of the \n     President's request will impact the scope and pace of \n     reconstruction efforts, which in turn will delay the return \n     home of the U.S. troops. There is no doubt that these funds \n     will help contribute to the peace and stability of not only \n     Iraq but eventually of the entire region.\n        Likewise efforts to link U.S. restructuring funds to \n     contributions from the International community would be \n     counter productive. Such linkage would send the wrong message \n     to our allies that either they match the U.S. dollar for \n     dollar or America will abandon Iraq.\n        I understand there are various proposals being offered \n     which would convert portions of the funding request to a loan \n     mechanism of some type. Any such proposal would merely add \n     further debt to the already huge debt currently owed by \n     Iraqis. As you know from my testimony three weeks ago, I am \n     concerned that as was the case in the young fragile democracy \n     in Weimar Germany, such a situation could destabilize the \n     young Iraqi democracy before it even gets off the ground. \n     Moreover, if the United States makes its contribution in the \n     form of a loan, we will encourage other nations to follow \n     that example at the Madrid Donors' conference next week, \n     further exacerbating Iraq's debt situation, and I might add, \n     complicating the eventual process of restructuring the \n     country's overall debt burden.\n        The sooner Iraq is stable and headed toward prosperity, \n     the sooner the American troops can return home. The U.S. \n     stands to gain a great deal of moral capital for deposing the \n     tyrannical Saddam Hussein and then helping to create a \n     stable, democratic and prosperous Iraqi state. Such moral \n     capital would be diminished, if not undercut entirely, if the \n     U.S. forced Iraq to pay the U.S. for its work. Further it \n     would lend credence to the view that the U.S. is an occupier \n     and not a liberator.\n        All in the coalition are grateful to you and your Senate \n     colleagues for your efforts and it is our hope that you \n     continue to resist any debilitating amendments which will set \n     back our many successes so far.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   L. Paul Bremer.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. It says:\n\n       The supplemental the President has submitted provides a \n     clear strategy for achieving our goal of an early restoration \n     of full sovereignty to the Iraqi people and for making \n     additional progress on the war on terrorism. I want you and \n     your colleagues to know that we are making every endeavor to \n     operate in a transparent and accountable manner. But any \n     major cuts of specific portions of the President's request \n     will impact the scope and pace of reconstruction efforts, \n     which in turn will delay the return home of the U.S. troops. \n     There is no doubt that these funds will help contribute to \n     the peace and stability of not only Iraq but eventually the \n     entire region.\n\n  That is the dream the Secretary of State explained to us yesterday, \nthat we are moving forward in a region that has had instability for a \ncentury, and what has been needed is a key country such as Iraq turning \ntoward a democracy, turning toward involving people. Just listening to \nthe people who have seen and talked to the young people in school, we \nnow know that young women in Iraq are going to school for the first \ntime because of this country. A whole new generation will not just have \nmen educated but will have men and women, who are going to participate \nin their own government. They want to do that. There has been an \noverwhelming reaction in Iraq toward freedom.\n  We want to hold it back? We want to put up some gates and say you can \ngo just this far, but you have to come back to Congress for more money? \nWhen? In February, and then more money later.\n  The whole idea is to put the money up and let the Iraqi people know \nwe are assisting them to move forward. We are going to assist them.\n  Debate is one thing, but gates, obstruction, is another. This \namendment is obstructionism. It is intended to require a return to this \nfloor before the money the President has requested in the supplemental \ncan be spent. I think that is absolutely wrong, and when the \nappropriate time comes I will move to table this amendment.\n\n                 Exhibit 1--Stay Resolute on Rebuilding\n\n       This is a critical week for the U.S. mission in Iraq. The \n     test won't be overseas but in the House and Senate, where \n     lawmakers are to vote on the administration's request for $87 \n     billion in emergency funding. It's imperative that this \n     spending be approved--not only the money required for \n     military operations but the smaller, more controversial, \n     amount for reconstruction aid. We omit an exact dollar figure \n     from the previous sentence because that's a legitimate \n     subject for debate. The Bush administration is asking for \n     $20.3 billion in reconstruction spending; the House \n     Appropriations Committee trimmed $1.7 billion from that \n     amount. What's important is not the precise number but the \n     underlying premise: that reconstruction is in the interests \n     of both the United States and Iraq.\n       It would be intellectually consistent, though wrong, to \n     argue against both military and reconstruction funding. But \n     to present oneself as a supporter of money ``for our troops'' \n     and an opponent of reconstruction is contradictory and \n     counterproductive. Paying to improve life for Iraqis will \n     help create a safer environment for U.S. troops and will \n     hasten the day when they can leave. Rebuilding the \n     electricity grid, fixing the water supply, getting the oil \n     flowing, maintaining public safety--all this is central to \n     hopes for stability and representative government.\n       One of the biggest temptations for lawmakers will be to \n     lend the money rather than spend it outright. This approach \n     has particular traction in the Senate, where a number of \n     Republicans are endorsing it. They argue that oil-rich Iraq \n     can pay for its own reconstruction; giving it the money \n     outright will just allow it to pay off existing debt more \n     quickly to countries that shirked the reconstruction task, at \n     U.S. taxpayer expense. This may play well back home, but it's \n     the wrong way to go.\n       Iraq is already burdened with about $200 billion in debt. \n     Either much of that will be forgiven, in which case a U.S. \n     reconstruction loan will prove most symbolic, or Iraq will \n     struggle for years under a crushing debt burden, in which \n     case another loan only adds to the misery. To make a loan in \n     these circumstances is like swimming out to a drowning man \n     and handing him a ten-pound weight. As a practical matter, no \n     Iraqi entity has the legal authority to enter into a binding \n     agreement. Lending the money will harm the U.S. effort to \n     persuade other countries to donate. And forcing Iraq to \n     encumber itself with debt to the United States, with U.S. \n     companies reaping the reconstruction profits, plays into the \n     hands of those who suspect U.S. motives.\n       The debate over reconstruction aid has become a means for \n     expressing frustration, much of it legitimate, about the \n     administration's Iraq policy. Why wasn't the administration \n     more honest from the outset about costs? Why can't it do a \n     better job of getting other countries to help pay? What's the \n     plan for future years? How will it be paid for? Lawmakers are \n     right to use the leverage of debate to seek clearer answers \n     and improved performance from the administration. But a \n     failure to obtain satisfaction on these points doesn't \n     justify a vote against needed funding. One of the Democratic \n     presidential candidates who will be called on to vote on the \n     request, Sen. John Edwards (N.C.), said yesterday that he \n     will vote against the aid for this reason, and Sen. John F. \n     Kerry (Mass.) seems inclined to follow this irresponsible \n     course. Former Vermont governor Howard Dean's position--yes, \n     but only if the president comes up with a way to pay for it--\n     is similarly faulty. As much as we would like to see some tax \n     cuts rolled back, that's not going to happen, at least as \n     part of the current debate. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) \n     had it right the other day, saying that, despite misgivings \n     and his desire to undo some of the tax cuts to pay for it: \n     ``We have no choice but to finance this program.''\n       Helping rebuild Iraq is right as a matter of morality and \n     self-interest. Refusing to pay what's needed because the \n     administration's performance has been lacking simply piles \n     error on top of error. Whatever the Bush Administration's \n     failings, it makes no sense to punish the people of Iraq--\n     and, ultimately, of the United States--as a result.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to be courteous to the people on the other side, \nand I will try to see if we cannot find some time limit. It would be \nwithin my right to move to table right now, but I want to be \ncooperative. The Senator from West Virginia has asked for other \nSenators to be allowed to speak, so I will seek to find some way to \ndelineate some time limits. I have spoken for about 8 minutes. I know \nSenator Durbin, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and I believe Senator \nBoxer want to speak. I ask unanimous consent that each be recognized \nfor 10 minutes and that I then be allowed the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I urge my friend to please not put such severe time \nlimits on this because for some of us this is an extremely important \namendment that goes to the heart of how we feel about the issue. I know \nmy friend vehemently objects. Just the way he vehemently objects, I \nvehemently support\n\n[[Page S12648]]\n\nthe Senator. I have not spoken much in this debate thus far and feel \nthat it is extremely important to my constituents, who do not want the \nstatus quo, who want a change, to hear my views.\n  I ask my friend if he could withhold a particular time. My own view \nis I probably need about 15, 20 minutes, max, but I do not know for \nsure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has the right to object, and I have the \nright to move to table. I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object to the 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are going to work out some time limit \non this amendment or I am going to move to table. As a matter of fact, \nright now I believe we have 45 or more amendments remaining. We have an \nagreement of the Senate, a handshake agreement for a change. It was not \na unanimous consent agreement. It was just a handshake between everyone \non the floor that we will finish this bill by tomorrow. We are not \ngoing to finish this if we have people speaking at length on every \namendment.\n  Now, I have been informed we have 58 amendments remaining. This is \nthe first one. I ask the Senator, what is a reasonable limitation on \nthe Senator's comments?\n  Mrs. BOXER. For myself, I would like to speak up to 20 minutes. I may \nonly take 15.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Twenty minutes for the Senator from California, 20 \nminutes for the Senator from Illinois, 20 minutes for the Senator from \nIowa, and 20 minutes for the Senator from Massachusetts, and I assume \nthe Senator from West Virginia wants recognition again. That is more \nthan an hour on 1 out of 58 amendments. I think that is excessive.\n  I am willing to change it to 15 minutes for each Senator. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Durbin, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Boxer, and Senator Byrd be recognized not to exceed 15 minutes \nbefore I retain the floor to make a motion to table.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope my chairman will not press this request at this \ntime. As far as I know, there is no intention on this side of the aisle \nto lengthen the process by which the Senator would consider this \namendment. This is a very important amendment. I hope the distinguished \nSenator would not press for any time limitation on the amendment at \nthis point.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request pending. \nIs there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have reserved the right to object and \nexpressed the hope that the distinguished chairman would not press this \nrequest at this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will be glad to debate a little bit \nwhat is important and what is not important. I have before me 58 \namendments, and I do not know of any Senator who says his or her \namendment is not important. This amendment is important. I think the \namendment of any Senator is important. With 58 amendments pending, we \nhave to find some way to limit debate. The only way I know to limit it \nis by making a motion to table.\n  I again seek the guidance of the Members on the other side. I think \nwe really have eight amendments, other than a reservation of amendments \nto be able to be offered in the second degree. Of the basic amendments \nthat are now here, there are, what, 31?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Without losing the right to the floor, I yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada for a comment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I state to the distinguished manager of the \nbill, Senator Durbin is not going to be able to come. I think if we \njust proceeded with this, it may move more quickly than one would \nthink. Senator Durbin is not going to come. Senator Kennedy will speak. \nSenator Boxer will speak. I think it would move more quickly than one \nwould think.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Leahy now; that's a sixth one. If each one takes \n20 minutes, we are going to be at 2 o'clock before we vote on this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have already taken 15 or 20 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have taken 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has not been alone taking time. I am hoping his \nsweet nature will prevail and allow Senators to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery will remain quiet.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will not press for an agreement this \nearly in the morning. We can move right along. Senators are here. \nSenator Leahy is here; Senator Kennedy is here; Senator Boxer is here. \nWe are prepared to move along. We are not attempting to drag out the \ntime.\n  I hope the Senator will allow Senators to go forward with this \ndebate. We will save time in the long run by so doing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the minority, are they \nwilling to set a firm time for the vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I do really think this will move more quickly. We don't \nneed to allocate 20 minutes on this. If we just go forward, things will \nwork out. You still have the right, after somebody completes a \nstatement, to get the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me try this. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nyield the floor to Senator Boxer to make such remarks as she wishes to \nmake, and when she is finished her remarks, I regain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, he would get the floor, anyway. He is the \nmanager of the bill. I have no objection to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I assure the Senator from Alaska my remarks are really \nnot as long as 20 minutes. I certainly will try to get my points across \nin short order.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to stand with the senior Democratic \nSenator on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and support his \namendment to require the administration to develop a plan for Iraq, to \nshare the burden of Iraqi reconstruction and security, and provide \nCongress with the information it deserves to have, not only as a \ncoequal branch of Government but in behalf of our constituents.\n  I view this amendment as a very strong alternative to the underlying \nbill, an alternative that is better for our troops, that is better for \nour taxpayers, and will finally give us a plan and an exit strategy we \nshould have had a long time ago.\n  The Byrd amendment withholds half of the money requested for \nreconstruction until the President certifies and reports to Congress \nthat the U.N. Security Council has adopted a new resolution authorizing \na multinational force under U.S. leadership. That would result in more \nfunding and more troops from other nations to relieve our heavy burden. \nAnd the burden is, indeed, heavy.\n  I am very happy the U.N. Security Council just passed a resolution. \nBut, if I might say, what that resolution does--and I am glad they \npassed it--is it essentially puts them on record as recognizing the \nUnited States as the transition power in Iraq. But it does not give one \ndollar toward the effort of reconstruction. It does not give even one \nsoldier more from another country.\n  So we have a long way to go. I think in many ways the Senator from \nWest Virginia was prescient, because he put in his amendment not just \nthat the U.N. pass any old resolution, but that the U.N. pass a \nresolution that will in fact relieve the burden on our troops and on \nour taxpayers.\n  Senator Byrd and those of us supporting his amendment also say the \nadministration must certify and report to Congress that our \nreconstruction efforts are being carried out in accordance with a \ndetailed plan that includes\n\n[[Page S12649]]\n\nsignificant financial assistance from other nations. In short, the Byrd \namendment requires leadership from this administration--leadership from \nthis administration--and the American people deserve no less. It is \ntime for leadership.\n  In addition, the Byrd amendment requires reports to the Congress on \nefforts to protect our troops. I made a visit to Walter Reed Hospital \nyesterday. It was a very emotional visit. Our troops are extraordinary. \nThey are incredibly optimistic young people. Each one of them I visited \nsaid had they been in a different type of vehicle, they wouldn't have \nlost their limbs, they wouldn't have lost colleagues. Because, as we \nhave said many times, after the President landed on the aircraft \ncarrier and he said the major hostilities were over, we did not have a \nplan in place and a lot of our people have paid the price of that.\n  So we are essentially demanding, asking, requesting, that the \nPresident report to the Congress on efforts to protect our troops. We \nasked for an estimate of the duration and cost of the military mission \nin Iraq. I might say, for many of us who supported the Levin \nresolution, we have been asking for that since day one and we really \nnever had it.\n  Why do you think the American people took a deep breath when they \nheard $87 billion for Iraq? They don't even realize, most of them, \nbecause it slipped through here with a unanimous vote--and at that time \nI think rightly so--we already gave $70 billion for Iraq in an \nemergency supplemental. So there was $70 billion, now there is $87 \nbillion, and if anyone thinks this is the last of it you are mistaken. \nIf we do not get a grip on this, this is a policy that is not in \nanybody's control. They don't even know who is in control over at the \nWhite House. They sent out a press release that Condi Rice was in \ncharge of reconstruction. Then Rumsfeld got mad. Then she came out and \nsaid, Well, gee, no, that really wasn't so.\n\n  I think Senator Byrd, with all his many years here, his many years \nliving, and his many years witnessing other administrations, has done \nus all a favor by putting together this very important amendment. Many \nof us helped put the finishing touches on it. I am very proud of this \namendment.\n  So we ask the President to send a report to Congress on efforts to \nprotect our troops, an estimate of the duration and cost of the \nmilitary mission in Iraq, an estimated long-term schedule for the \nwithdrawal of U.S. and foreign troops, and a schedule with timetables \nand costs for the establishment of a fully trained and equipped Iraqi \nsecurity force.\n  Why is the Byrd amendment an alternative to be strongly supported? To \nme it is clear. It is time to end a blank-check policy. It is time to \nend a blank-check policy. Again, we gave $70 billion with absolutely no \nstrings attached. We didn't stop it. We didn't say anything. We \nexpected the President at that point would use those dollars and use \nthe trust the Congress placed in him with that $70 billion to come up \nwith a plan. We still don't have it.\n  So clearly we should support this very important amendment as an \nalternative to the underlying bill.\n  Let me give you other reasons. We were misled about post-Saddam Iraq. \nThere is not one person who is civilized and has a heart and a pulse \nthat beat who isn't glad Saddam is out of the picture. That has never \nbeen the issue. That has never been the question. The question is, did \nwe have the right policy so that in the future that part of the world \nwill be more secure, that we will not have a vacuum where terrorists \nmove in, and where the United States is not the only country that is \nbearing the cost of a post-Saddam Iraq?\n  The American people--I know I speak for the people of California who \nhave spoken with me about this and, by the way, I have had well over \n1,000 calls on this and it is heavily against the $87 billion--feel for \nthe Iraqi people, and they want to do their share--underline ``share.'' \nBut they were told the postwar situation would be quite different from \nwhat we are seeing.\n  Let me quote President Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, who was \npress secretary up until recently. This is what he said about \nreconstruction:\n\n       Well, the reconstruction costs remain . . . an issue for \n     the future, and Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy \n     country.\n\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle and my friends on \nthis side of the aisle that the spokesperson for the President of the \nUnited States said:\n\n       . . . unlike Afghanistan, Iraq is a rather wealthy country.\n\n  Still quoting, he said:\n\n       Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi \n     people, and so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to \n     be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own \n     reconstruction.\n\n  My friends, that was this year. Ari Fleischer was speaking for the \nPresident of the United States who is now putting pressure on us not to \nsee this reconstruction money become loans. Ari Fleischer said:\n\n       . . . Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden \n     for their own reconstruction.\n\n  What did Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz say? I sit on the \nForeign Relations Committee. Let us hear what he said. He said:\n\n       There's a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to \n     be U.S. taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the \n     Iraqi people . . . and on a rough recollection, the oil \n     revenues of that country could bring between $50 and $100 \n     billion over the course of the next two or three years.\n\n  Going on, Mr. Wolfowitz, No. 1 in the Defense Department, said:\n\n       We're dealing with a country that can really finance its \n     own reconstruction, and relatively soon.\n\n  What are we being told by the manager of this amendment, Senator \nStevens? He is saying the Byrd amendment is awful; it is terrible; it \nis going to stop everything; it is a terrible thing. If you think the \nByrd amendment is destructive, why not call Paul Wolfowitz and find out \nwhy on March 27, 2003 he said, ``We're dealing with a country that can \nreally finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon''?\n  Why not call up Ari Fleischer, who spoke to the President and said, \n`` . . . unlike Afghanistan, Iraq can pay for its own reconstruction''?\n  But it doesn't stop there. There is Defense Secretary Donald \nRumsfeld. I am quoting him.\n\n       I don't believe that the United States has the \n     responsibility for reconstruction.\n\n  My colleagues, I want to reiterate this. Donald Rumsfeld, No. 1 in \nthe Department of Defense, said in March of this year:\n\n       I don't believe the United States has the responsibility \n     for reconstruction.\n\n  He said:\n\n       [Reconstruction] funds can come from . . . frozen assets, \n     oil revenues and a variety of other things, including the Oil \n     for Food, which has very substantial number of billions of \n     dollars in it.\n\n  I could have quoted 10 other people from this administration, but \nfrom Secretary Rumsfeld who is a key member of this administration, to \nAri Fleischer who spoke for the President, to Paul Wolfowitz, second in \ncommand at the Department of Defense, they all told us and they told \nthe American people Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction.\n  I think the underlying bill is very much another blank check based on \nmore statements and promises from an administration that led a \nbrilliant military campaign but was wrong on the weapons of mass \ndestruction, wrong on what would happen after the war, wrong on what \nthe rebuilding would cost, wrong on how many troops would be needed, \nwrong on oil revenues, and wrong on how much other countries would \ncontribute. That is just a partial list.\n  My constituents are very leery of another blank check, given this \nhistory and given the need here at home.\n  I could not believe this U.S. Senate couldn't walk down the aisle \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, and take a month's worth of money \nfor Iraq and spend it in this country of ours. We weren't asking for \nmuch. The Senator from Michigan wrote a brilliant amendment. In it, she \nsaid, All right, we are spending $5 billion in Iraq. The World Bank \ntells us they can't really absorb all the money we are budgeting now. \nLet us take just 1 month and let us keep our promises to our veterans. \nLet us take just 1 month. That is all--$5 billion. We can take care of \nour veterans' health. We can take care of our school construction \nneeds. We can help some people who need health care here in the United \nStates of America.\n  No. That went down in flames. We can't do that. We can't afford that. \nWe can't afford it. After all, we have a deficit. We had a deficit only \nafter this\n\n[[Page S12650]]\n\nPresident took office. We had a surplus before he took office. Now this \nbody won't even pay for this war. They won't even pay for this war. \nThey make ringing speeches about America, the greatest leader in the \nworld. And I agree with every speech. But every time America led the \nworld, we didn't tell the wealthiest few that we will give you more tax \nbreaks so our sons and daughters can go off.\n  This amendment says to me everything that needs to be said. It puts \nan end to a blank-check mentality. We can't afford another blank check. \nWe have these pressing needs at home with a deficit that is racing out \nof control.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership. I have enjoyed working with \nhim and with his staff, as well as the staff of Senators Leahy and \nKennedy, to put forward an alternative that puts our troops and our \ntaxpayers ahead of a blank-check policy. I hope we will have a strong \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a management problem. I ask \nunanimous consent that the vote on this amendment not occur before 3 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of this \namendment, and I strongly support it. I will not take a great deal of \ntime. But Senator Byrd and Senator Kennedy, two senior Members of the \nSenate--actually the two most senior Members of this Senate--have been \nsuch resolute voices of reason and caution concerning our actions in \nIraq. Senator Kennedy and Senator Byrd have done a thorough job of \nexplaining what this amendment does and why it is important.\n  There is no secret that I did not support the resolution authorizing \nthe use of military force against Iraq. I felt it gave the President \nauthority that should be reserved to the Congress. It was used by the \nPresident to justify abandoning the United Nations prematurely, \nrejecting the recommendation of our allies, and launching a unilateral \npreemptive attack against Iraq with dubious justification.\n  Since then, almost everything the White House and the Pentagon have \nsaid about Iraq has turned out to be wrong. The justification for the \nwar, that Saddam Hussein was on the verge of having nuclear weapons, \nhas evaporated. There was no link between Saddam Hussein and the \nSeptember 11 attacks despite what the President said--until recently. \nWhile the Vice President continues to try to make the connection, at \nleast the President has finally said there is no connection.\n\n  Is Saddam Hussein a bad man? Of course, one of the most evil people I \nhave ever read or heard about. Amazingly enough, it is the same Saddam \nHussein we strongly supported in many ways in previous administrations. \nIs he a tyrant? Certainly. Did he carry out torture and genocide? Of \ncourse he did. He gassed the Kurds. The then Reagan-Bush administration \ncontinued to send military aid. Is he a bad man? Yes, we all agree on \nthat.\n  Did he have nuclear weapons? Of course not. Was he an imminent threat \nto the United States? Of course not. Was he worse than some of \ndictators we actively support around the world today? That is an open \nquestion.\n  Now we have a different question, as the senior Senator from West \nVirginia and the senior Senator from Massachusetts and others have \npointed out: The cost to the United States taxpayers in rebuilding \nIraq. We were told that would be paid with Iraqi oil revenues. But \nsuddenly that cost has skyrocketed. Our troops, we were told, would be \ngreeted as liberators. They are under constant attack and threat of \nattack.\n  I remember when the administration came before the Congress and said \nthe costs of rebuilding would be under a couple billion dollars. They \nassured Members, assured the Appropriations Committee of that. They had \nto know they were not being truthful.\n  Look at what has happened. Hundreds of our service personnel have \nbeen killed, many more have been wounded, something the administration \nprefers not to talk about. The wounded are brought back after midnight, \nmaking sure the press does not see the planes coming in with the \nwounded. They were not talking about wounded. These are not a broken \nwrist or scratched leg. These are terrible wounds--lost limbs, lost \neyesight, lifetime disabilities. I think of the soldier who fought \nbravely for the United States who is back in Walter Reed now finally \ngetting his citizenship. He raised his right hand to take the oath. \nThat was the only limb he could raise. He lost his other arm and both \nlegs, like our former colleague, Senator Cleland, in Vietnam. These are \nterrible wounds.\n  We have lost more of our military since the President said the \nmission was accomplished, the war is over, than we did before. We have \nlost more of our soldiers since the President said: Bring it on. \nUnfortunately, they must have listened because they brought it on and \nmore Americans have died since then than died before.\n  Having said that, I am not one of those who say everything in Iraq is \na failure. I do not say that at all. We are far from that. We are \nmaking progress in Iraq on many fronts. But the situation is dangerous. \nWe are there virtually alone. Contributions of troops and money from \nother nations have been a pittance. But who can blame them? We ignored \nthe words of caution from our allies. We dismissed our allies as \nirrelevant. We called them ``Old Europe,'' and we refused to give them \nany meaningful say in the political development or economic \nreconstruction of Iraq. Now, having insulted them, having ignored them, \nhaving not consulted them, having brushed them aside as irrelevant, we \nexpect them to jump behind a policy they opposed when they find that so \nmany of the things we said to justify our policy turned out not to be \ntrue? It is not surprising they are not hurrying to get in line behind \nus.\n\n  This amendment of Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, myself and others, \nacknowledges what is obvious to everyone except perhaps those in the \nWhite House who are so convinced of their own version of reality that \nthey only see what they want to see. We need help. We need the active \ninvolvement of the international community. In order to get that active \ninvolvement of the international community, we need to give these \nnations a bigger say in rebuilding Iraq and doing so to take the \ntargets off the backs of our soldiers and defray the financial cost to \nthe American taxpayers. We cannot take the attitude that uncle knows \nbest and only uncle knows. We want others to help us if we want to be \nin a position to take our brave young men and women out of the line of \nfire.\n  This is essential, not only for the success of our policy in Iraq but \nfor our ability to work constructively with other nations in all the \nother fights we have in fighting terrorism, in combating poverty, in \nstopping disease, in protecting the environment, in dealing with so \nmany other global problems. We are the wealthiest, most powerful nation \nhistory has ever known. It is almost inconceivable--even when I was \nborn, 1940--that we would have any nation as powerful as we are. But we \nhave responsibilities around the world that go with that. It is not \njust Iraq.\n  There is an AIDS epidemic; there are contagious diseases, including \nebola; there is ignorance, poverty, environmental damage. All of these \nthings need U.S. leadership--not leadership arrogance but U.S. \nleadership. The American people are good people. The American people \nhave the heart and the will to do what is best.\n  The American people do not need to have leaders who show arrogance. \nThat is not the American way. I think of the young people who go in the \nPeace Corps; I think of the young missionaries who go abroad; I think \nof the teachers, of the older retired people going to other parts of \nthe world to help out. They do not go with arrogance, they do not go \nwith simplistic answers; they go with humbleness, respect, and love.\n  This amendment allows half the Iraq reconstruction funds, $10.1 \nbillion, more than can be spent next year, to be made available \nimmediately. In other words, this amendment would get that money out \nthe door with no strings attached. Putting this in perspective, $10.1 \nbillion is equal to more than half the amount of foreign aid we give to\n\n[[Page S12651]]\n\nthe rest of the world, and we will give that amount of money to one \ncountry immediately. The $10.1 billion includes $5.1 billion for \nsecurity, public safety, border enforcement, and justice activities. \nThe balance of the $10 billion will be released after April 1, 2004, if \nthe President certifies that the United Nations adopted a new \nresolution authorizing a multinational military force of the United \nStates command and a central role for the U.N. in the political and \neconomic development of Iraq, but the Congress would have to vote to \nrelease the balance of the funds.\n  Over a quarter of a century ago, I went on the Appropriations \nCommittee because I believed very strongly--and I don't have to tell \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia who has forgotten more about this \nthan all the rest of us would know--I believe very strongly the \nCongress has the power of the purse. It is one of those wonderful, \nbrilliant acts done by our Founders to have these checks and balances--\nour judiciary, executive, our Congress. It has served us in good stead.\n  Has the Congress always been right? Of course not. Has the executive \nor judiciary always been right? No. But generally it stays in balance \nand it works very well. The big mistake would be if we just gave it \naway, if we said that the American people do not have a voice so we \nwould have to vote to release the balance of these funds.\n  This is extremely generous. But the reason I mentioned the power of \nthe purse is that we have a duty to protect the taxpayers' money.\n  In this Senate, there are only 100 of us who have the privilege to \nserve--and it is a privilege--at any given time. We have 270 million \nAmericans. We have a responsibility--a responsibility--not just to \nAmericans from Vermont or West Virginia or anywhere else but to all \nAmericans. It is their money.\n  Now, none of us could predict what is going to happen in Iraq between \nnow and April first. It makes no sense to bundle up this $21 billion \nand toss it out the door, without ever asking questions--whether the \nfunds are being used wisely, whether other nations are contributing, \nand whether it makes sense to release another $10 billion.\n  It is absurd. It is totally unnecessary. It is not only absurd, it is \nunnecessary. This is the thing I cannot understand: Why are we rushing \npell-mell to give away $21 billion lock, stock, and barrel, all at \nonce? Every one of the administration's own people say they cannot \nspend it. They want it, but they cannot spend it. It is like ``give me, \ngive me, give me, and I will make up my mind when I want to spend it.'' \nI would hate to run my household finances that way.\n  We should not run the Nation's finances that way. It is not the way \nit was done with the Marshall plan. Everyone comes up here from the \nadministration and talks about the Marshall plan, the Marshall plan, \nthe Marshall plan. I wish one of them would pick up a history book and \nread about the Marshall plan. The way they describe it, I don't think \nthey could even spell it.\n  There was far more detailed justification for the Marshall plan, far \nmore opportunity for review, far more oversight. Let's learn from \nhistory, especially if we are going to claim to repeat it.\n  I am tired of historical sloganeering by people who obviously have no \nidea what the heck they are talking about. For the Marshall plan, we \nhad hundreds of witnesses. That was several years after the end of \nWorld War II. We had special bipartisan committees that really worked \nat overseeing that plan.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I talked to some of the Members who \nhad been here at that time. They were watching what was going on. They \nknew what was going on. And it was not a blank check. It was not a \nblank check. It was, however, one thing: We worked with other \ncountries. We led the effort, of course. We worked with other \ncountries.\n  I think it is long past time that we should reach out to our friends \nand allies, not with this fig-leaf resolution being discussed at the \nU.N. this week--and that is all it is; it is a PR fig leaf--but in a \nway that builds a genuine coalition that is no longer a unilateral \npolicy.\n  I want to be fair. The U.N. resolution to be voted on today is \nwelcome. It sets the stage. That is what it does. It is a stage-setting \npiece for what should have been months ago, by recognizing the key role \nthat other nations can and should play in Iraq.\n  It would authorize a multinational military force. It would encourage \nother nations to participate and make contributions to the force and to \nthe costs of reconstruction in Iraq.\n  It also makes clear that the Coalition Provisional Authority is \ntemporary. That is something on which I believe all Members of the \nSenate, Republican and Democrat alike, would agree. It has to be \ntemporary.\n  So it is a step in the right direction, but it is basically a \nstatement of good intentions. There is nothing wrong with good \nintentions, but I think some of us who have been here for a few years \nwould like more than just good intentions. We have no idea how it is \ngoing to be interpreted by the White House, which has resisted \nmeaningful input from other nations, nor how it is going to be \nimplemented.\n  Will the multinational force be anything more than a fig leaf for an \nindefinite U.S. military operation involving more than 100,000 troops, \nas it is today--100,000 American troops over there facing the danger of \nbeing killed every single day? Will other nations contribute or will \nU.S. taxpayers continue to shoulder 99 percent of the cost?\n  Mr. President, save me the stories I hear from the administration \nabout 30 countries, 40 countries joining us. I think there is one \ncountry that has sent over two people. Of course, we had to pay their \nway. Others were willing to send a few thousand dollars. But as ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, I know \nwe are going to have to pay more than that in foreign aid they all \nwant. I do not want fig leaves. I do not want rhetoric. I want reality.\n  Right now, the reality is, we are paying 99 percent of the cost. Is \nthe administration going to give us a detailed plan, including \ntimetables and cost? How about an exit strategy for when our troops \nwill come home? That is what I would like to know. We do not know. We \ndo not know what is going to come out of that.\n  It is good to have, at least, a resolution that says nice things. It \ndoes not do an awful lot, but it says a lot of nice things at the \nUnited Nations. But I am not a member of the United Nations. I am not a \ndelegate to the United Nations. I am the senior Senator from the State \nof Vermont. I am here to speak on behalf of the people of the United \nStates in the U.S. Senate. That is my role. I have one vote here out of \n100. I take that very seriously.\n  This amendment is extremely important. It builds on the U.N. \nresolution. It requires tangible results, not just good intentions. If \nthe U.N. resolution accomplishes what it says, the President should \nhave no difficulty making the certifications called for in this \namendment.\n  We need to know if the U.N. resolution represents the \n``internationalization'' of policy long overdue or if it is nothing \nmore than political cover to maintain the status quo, to continue along \nas we are today--alone, with our troops under fire and U.S. taxpayers \npaying through the nose.\n  And then we need to vote on whether to release the remaining $10 \nbillion. There is no reason--there is none--there is not one word in \nall the testimony before the other body or before ours that says they \nneed this other $10 billion right now--not one word that says we should \nnot have another chance to review this policy and vote again in 6 \nmonths. That is the responsible thing to do. Again, they cannot spend \nthe money now.\n  So our amendment steers a middle ground. It releases half of the aid \nup front, but it tells the administration we want a multilateral \napproach. We want other nations involved, and not just nations that can \nonly contribute enough troops for a small town police force or provide \na handful of secondhand jeeps.\n  I admire the political will of some of these small countries in \nsending people over. From my own State of Vermont, we have sheriffs \ndepartments that are bigger than some of the forces they are sending. \nThat does not detract from their political will in doing it. It is a \nnice symbol, but let's not fool anybody.\n\n  I think the administration takes a strange view of Americans if they \nthink we are going to be fooled by this.\n\n[[Page S12652]]\n\nVirtually every American knows who is paying the bill. We Americans \nare.\n  So this amendment is in Iraq's interest. It is certainly in the \ninterest of the American taxpayers, something we should be concerned \nabout.\n  I am very proud of my friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nfor offering the amendment. I have had the privilege of serving with \nhim for 29 years. I have learned as much from him as any one in the \nhundreds of people I have served with in this body, right from the very \nfirst day I met him as a young Senator elect, as a former prosecutor.\n  I think of my good friend from New England, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, a man I first met back when he was a brand-new Senator \nand I was a seminew prosecutor in Vermont.\n  I think what the two Senators have done is go back to history and \nback to reality and set a good course. Our country will actually be \nstronger and better and, ironically, the Iraq reconstruction will be \ndone better, if we follow their course.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in thanking our good friend and \ncosponsor, the Senator from Vermont, for his excellent presentation and \ncompelling argument. And I, once again, thank our leader on this issue, \nand someone who has been such an eloquent voice for sane and \nresponsible foreign policy for so many years, and particularly in the \nwhole debate on Iraq, our friend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  I think it is important at this time to understand exactly what this \namendment is and what it is not.\n  The Byrd amendment is not cutting the $20 billion. There have been \nother amendments that have suggested that and have done so. This \namendment is not doing that. The purpose of this amendment is plain and \nsimple: This is the only amendment that has been offered--and I believe \nwill be offered--that is going to require a change of course in our \npolicy in Iraq and give us the opportunity in 6 months to have a chance \nto review the administration.\n  As pointed out by the Senator from California, otherwise, with this \n$87 billion, we are effectively giving a blank check and a statement \nthat we support the current policy, which I believe is a bankrupt \npolicy, one that is being made up every day. I spoke earlier on it.\n  One of the reasons the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia is \nso responsible and compelling is, first, the World Bank has estimated \nthat Iraq could only use $6 billion over the next year. He is letting \n$10 billion go, $5 billion for security, but the other $5 billion. Over \na 6-month period the World Bank says the most Iraq could use is $6 \nbillion. This is going to let $10 billion go for 6 months. All we are \nsaying is, perhaps after that 6 months, the rest of the money would be \nfreed up as well. But at least we here, as the people's \nrepresentatives, will have a chance to review the bidding at that \nparticular time.\n  I listened to our friend--and he is our friend--from Alaska say we \nought to stay the course. I believe we ought to stay the right course. \nThat is what we are talking about--staying the right course which is in \nthe interest of the security of our troops and of the United States. \nOthers are saying: Why not just give us a blank check?\n  The Senator from West Virginia remembers clearly, as ranking member \non the Appropriations Committee, it was not long ago when \nadministration officials said: We don't need any money at all in terms \nof reconstruction. Iraq is a wealthy country. The oil revenues will be \nable to handle it. Three months ago they said: We think maybe $1.7 \nbillion will be able to handle it over the next year. Now they ask for \n$20 billion and say: Stay the course; why are you trying to interfere \nwith us?\n  They have been moving these numbers all around and failing to give a \nfull plan. Yes, they gave us some working documents from last year and, \nyes, they gave us a budget but not the plan. The wisdom of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is the fact that it is going to require that the \nadministration come back in 6 months and give us an opportunity to \nreview.\n  Finally, as the Senator from Vermont has pointed out, the $20 billion \nfor reconstruction is what the United States provides for economic aid \nfor the rest of the countries all over the world. This is not an \ninsignificant amount. The American people understand that. It is 20 \ntimes what the Federal Government spends annually on afterschool \nprograms, 20 times. This $20 billion is 20 times what we spend on \nafterschool programs that reach hundreds of thousands of children, \nhelping them get the supplementary services which are so important in \nterms of their education, giving them outlets in terms of participation \nin sports. This $20 billion is 20 times that amount.\n  It is also double the amount that this President proposed on \neducation to assist the schools. This $20 billion is effectively twice \nas much as we are providing in K-12 federal spending on the title I \neducation program for disadvantaged children. We know how important \nthat is.\n\n  It is over two times the amount we spend in helping those who have \nspecial needs. It is four times what the Government spends on cancer \nresearch. This is not an insignificant amount of resources.\n  The only thing the Senator from West Virginia is saying is: Let's get \nanother look at it in 6 months. Why should the administration be so \nopposed to that? Doesn't it make sense, in terms of our national \ninterests, to galvanize the country in support of foreign policy? Are \nthe people who are allegedly supporting whatever this policy is so \nuncertain about what is going to happen in 6 months from now, they say, \ndon't do that; you are going to interfere and obstruct our whole effort \nby coming back to the Congress and permitting them to make a judgment \nin 6 months? That is apparently what they are prepared to do.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia. I know from personal \nexperience the amount of time and effort and energy and thought that \nhas gone into this amendment. This is the one amendment that says: We \nare giving you 6 months to move ahead. That is sufficient to meet the \nvital needs at the present time. And we are prepared to give you 6 \nmonths after that, in March-April of next year, when the Congress will \nbe back and prepared to vote. But at that time at least we will know, \nat that time the American people will know that there are going to be \nother nations that will be a part of the team, that are going to be \nsupplying resources, that are going to be supplying additional troops. \nWe will be able to indicate to the American service men and women an \nend strategy, an exit strategy.\n  I was asked a couple of hours ago about mentioning the exit strategy; \ndoesn't this just suggest we are talking about cutting and running? \nThat is not what we are talking about. We are talking about being \nsensible and responsible.\n  Actually the words ``exit strategy'' were included in the foreign \naffairs article that was written by Brent Scowcroft and former \nPresident Bush, Bush 1, to which I referred earlier. He was talking \nabout what the alternatives were at the end of the first gulf war. He \nwas pointing out that this was a world transformed, President George \nH.W. Bush and his National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, in their \njoint memoir on the experiences of the gulf war in 1991.\n\n       There was no viable exit strategy that we could see.\n\n  That was former President Bush 1, ``no viable exit strategy that we \ncould see.''\n  He believed at the time of the first gulf war we ought to have an \nexit strategy that we could see.\n  We haven't got that. It is not in the $87 billion. What the amendment \nof the Senator from West Virginia is saying is, OK, it is not in there. \nOK, it is not in the $20 billion. But let's come back in 6 months and \nwe will have a chance to see where we are.\n  I commend the Senator for offering his amendment. I hope our \ncolleagues will give it strong support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to express appreciation to the other \nSenators who have spoken in support of this amendment: Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Boxer. There are some other cosponsors of the\n\n[[Page S12653]]\n\namendment who may or may not wish to speak on it: Senators Harkin, \nDurbin, Jeffords, and Kerry.\n  The amendment provides that not more than $5 billion may be obligated \nor expended before April 1, 2004, from the total of $20.3 billion.\n  It provides that the excess of the total amount so appropriated over \n$5 billion may not be obligated or expended after April 1, 2004. We are \ntalking about $10 billion of the $20 billion--$10 billion may not be \nobligated or expended after April 1, unless, 1, the President submits \nto Congress in writing certain certifications and unless Congress \nenacts an appropriations law, other than this act, that authorizes the \nexpenditure of such funds.\n  Keep in mind, I say to Senators, the $5.1 billion provided under the \nheading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund for Security,'' including \npublic safety requirements, national security, and justice, which \nincludes funds for Iraqi border enforcement, and so on--keep in mind \nthat these moneys are not affected. They will go forward to Iraq--the \n$5.1 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund for Security. \nThey will go forward immediately, and $5 billion of the remaining $15 \nbillion may be spent before April 1, 2004. The passage of this bill \nwould provide for such expenditures. But the remaining $10 billion \nwould not, could not be obligated before April 1, 2004, and may not be \nobligated or expended after April 1, 2004, unless the President submits \nto Congress in writing certain certifications described in the \namendment and Congress enacts an appropriations law, other than this \nact, that authorizes the obligation and expenditure of the remainder of \nthe fund.\n  Now, the certifications that have to be provided by the President of \nthe United States before the remaining $10 billion may be expended are \nas follows, in brief: a certification that the U.N. Security Council \nhas adopted a resolution that authorizes a multinational security force \nunder United States leadership for post-Saddam Hussein Iraq and \nprovides for a central role for the U.N. in the political and economic \ndevelopment and reconstruction of Iraq; and the President must also \ncertify that there must result a substantially increased contribution \nof military forces and amounts of money by other countries to assist in \nthe restoration of security in Iraq and the reconstruction of Iraq. \nThere must be a certification by the President that the United States \nreconstruction activities in Iraq are being successfully implemented in \naccordance with a detailed plan, which includes fixed timetables and \ncosts and with a significant commitment of financial assistance from \nother countries, so that the American taxpayer does not have to \ncontinue to bear all the burden; a detailed plan that provides for the \nestablishment of economic and political stability in Iraq, including \nprompt restoration of basic services, such as water and electrical \nservices; the adoption of a democratic constitution in Iraq, the \nholding of local and national elections in Iraq, the establishment of a \ndemocratically elected government in Iraq that has broad public \nsupport, and the establishment of Iraqi security and armed forces that \nare fully trained and appropriately equipped and are able to defend \nIraq and carry out other security duties without the involvement of the \nUnited States Armed Forces--so that American men and women who are \nbearing the military burden there today can come home.\n  Additionally, not later than March 1, 2004, the President shall \nsubmit to Congress a report on United States and foreign country \ninvolvement in Iraq that includes the following information:\n  1, the number of military personnel from other countries that are \nsupporting Operation Iraqi Freedom, together with an estimate of the \nnumber of such personnel to be in place in Iraq for that purpose on May \n1, 2004;\n\n  2, the total amounts of financial donations pledged and paid by other \ncountries for the reconstruction of Iraq;\n  3, a description of the economic, political, and military situation \nin Iraq, including the number, the type, and location of attacks on \ncoalition, U.N., and Iraqi military public safety and civilian \npersonnel in the 60 days preceding the date of the report;\n  4, a description of the measures taken to protect United States \nmilitary personnel serving in Iraq;\n  5, a detailed plan containing fixed timetables and costs for \nestablishing civil, economic, and political security in Iraq, including \nrestoration of basic services, such as water and electricity services;\n  6, an estimate of the total number of United States and foreign \nmilitary personnel that are necessary in the short term and in the long \nterm to bring to Iraq stability and security for its reconstruction, \nincluding the prevention of sabotage that impedes the reconstruction \nefforts;\n  7, an estimate of the duration of the United States military presence \nin Iraq and the levels of United States military personnel strength \nthat will be necessary for that presence for each of the future 6-month \nperiods, together with a rotation plan for combat divisions, combat \nsupport units, and combat service support units;\n  8, an estimate of the total cost to the United States of the military \npresence in Iraq that includes, A, the estimated incremental cost of \nthe United States Active-Duty Forces deployed in Iraq and neighboring \ncountries; B, the estimated cost of United States Reserve component \nforces mobilized for service in Iraq and in neighboring countries; C, \nthe estimated cost of replacing United States military equipment being \nused in Iraq; D, the estimated cost of support to be provided by the \nUnited States to foreign troops in Iraq;\n  Furthermore, an estimate of the total financial cost of the \nreconstruction of Iraq together with, A, an estimate of the percentage \nof such costs that would be paid by the United States and a detailed \naccounting specified for major categories of cost and, B, the amounts \nof contributions pledged and paid by other countries, specified in \nmajor categories;\n  10, a strategy for securing significant additional international \nfinancial support for the construction of Iraq, including a discussion \nof the plan for implementing the strategy;\n  11, a schedule including fixed timetables and costs for the \nestablishment of Iraqi security and armed forces that are fully trained \nand appropriately equiped and are able to defend Iraq and carry out \nother security duties without the involvement of the United States \nArmed Forces;\n  12, an estimated schedule for the withdrawal of United States and \nforeign armed forces from Iraq; so here we have a requirement in the \nreport that is to be submitted by the President, an estimated schedule \nfor the withdrawal of United States and foreign armed forces from Iraq;\n  13, an estimated schedule for the adoption of a democratic \nconstitution in Iraq, the holding of democratic local and national \nelections in Iraq, the establishment of a democratically elected \ngovernment in Iraq that has broad public support;\n  And, finally, the timely withdrawal of United States and foreign \narmed forces from Iraq.\n  Every 90 days, after the submission of this report, under subsection \nC, the President shall submit to Congress an update of that report. The \nrequirement for updates under the preceding sentence shall terminate \nupon the withdrawal of the United States Armed Forces other than \ndiplomatic security detachment personnel from Iraq. The report and \nupdates shall be submitted in unclassified form.\n  Here at last is a requirement that the President provide a report to \nthe Congress and to the American people, information the Congress has \nneeded and requested but which has been denied thus far.\n  This amendment would require that the President make these \ncertifications I have mentioned and that he submit a report which \noutlines the various provisions I have read and, in the final analysis, \nhe has to submit a timetable for the withdrawal of American men and \nwomen from Iraq.\n  It is time for the U.N. to get in and the U.S. to get out. That is \nwhat this amendment would require, in essence. The amendment would help \nsave American lives. It would ease the Iraqi fears that America is \nfollowing a policy of compassionate colonialism. This amendment moves \nreconstruction forward. This amendment moves Iraq forward. This \namendment brings the world together in the overall peace effort on \nthose distant sands.\n  This amendment would put in motion a plan--a real plan--that would \nbring\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\npeace more quickly and stability more assuredly, and it would say to \nthe people of Iraq that the United States is your friend, not your \nsovereign.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the pending amendment offered by the \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, Senator Kennedy, myself, and \nothers, I believe is key as to whether this bill includes any real \nmeasure of accountability to Congress and, thus, to the American people \nfor this country's policy in Iraq.\n  This is essentially similar to an amendment I had offered during the \ncommittee markup. We had an excellent substantive debate in the \ncommittee, and we are having I hope again today a debate on \naccountability of this administration.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his tremendous leadership on this issue. I \nthank the chairman of our full committee, Senator Stevens, for \npermitting us again--I know at some point he will want to move to \ntable, but I thank him for allowing us to have this time to have our \nsay and make our points about why we feel so strongly that this \namendment should be adopted.\n  The amendment allows funding for our military needs in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The amendment we are debating allows $10.1 billion for \nIraqi relief and reconstruction over the next 6 months, until April of \n2004; $5.1 billion of that is set aside for police and military \ntraining in Iraq and about $5 billion would be for reconstruction aid. \nI note the $5 billion is the amount of reconstruction aid the World \nBank believes Iraq can absorb over the next full year, let alone in \njust 6 months.\n  Further taxpayer funding for Iraq beyond that $10.1 billion would be \ncontingent on important accountability to Congress and the American \npublic. In order to receive Iraqi relief reconstruction funding beyond \nthe $10.1 billion, the President would have to certify to Congress that \nthe U.N. has adopted a new resolution authorizing a multinational \nmilitary force in Iraq under U.S. command. The President would also \nhave to certify that he has a concrete plan for stabilization and \ndemocracy in Iraq, with fixed timetables and cost estimates, and the \nPresident would have to submit a report to Congress detailing the \ninternational support for our efforts in Iraq, both in terms of money \nand troops, as well as a report indicating troop levels and duration \nfor our involvement in Iraq. In other words, what is our exit strategy?\n\n  Finally, and most important, this amendment would say there must be \nan additional vote taken by Congress before we spend any more money.\n  Again, I have listened to our ranking member, my good friend from \nWest Virginia, many times in this Chamber talk about the Founding \nFathers and how smart they were and how they wanted to balance the \npowers in this country so we did not have a dictator or king or someone \nwho could run amok with the public treasury. That is why the clause in \nthe Constitution that gives us control over the purse strings is so \nimportant.\n  The intention of the Founding Fathers, at least as far as I have come \nto understand and read in my history books, is they did not mean to \ngive us the purse strings so we could open it up and dump money into \nthe White House. They wanted us to be accountable to the American \npeople for every dime that was spent; that we had to keep a tight pull \non those purse strings, parcel that money out in a deliberative manner \nso that no President--Democrat, Republican, Independent, or whatever--\nwould be given a blank check with the taxpayers' dollars.\n  This amendment is in keeping with the best traditions and intentions \nof our Founding Fathers and keeping our faith with the Constitution of \nthe United States in being diligent at controlling the purse strings of \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  I just cannot explain why the administration is so stubborn in \nresisting even this most commonsense accountability. They are insisting \non a blank check. Again, even the World Bank says we cannot spend any \nmore money than that $5 billion in a year. Yet they want $21 billion. \nWhen people like me and the Senator from West Virginia and others raise \nquestions about accountability, the administration, in effect, is \nsaying: Trust me. That is exactly the line we heard before the war in \nIraq.\n  I admit publicly--it is on the record--one year ago I voted for the \nIraq war resolution because I opted to trust the President. I opted to \ngive him the benefit of the doubt. In the lead-up to the war, the \nPresident's approach boiled down to two words: Trust me. Trust me that \nSaddam is in cahoots with al-Qaida because we have that information, he \nsaid.\n  Trust me that Iraq has vast stockpiles of chemical and biological \nweapons and weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.\n  Trust me, said the President, that postwar reconstruction will be \nself-financing because Iraq has fabulous oil wells.\n  Trust me, said the President, that we have a serious plan to manage \npostwar Iraq.\n  And today the administration dares to say one more time: Trust me \nthat this $20 billion for reconstruction is absolutely necessary, and \nthat if you will only give us a blank check, we will spend it wisely.\n  There was a story on the front section of the business section of \ntoday's New York Times which illustrates how this vast amount of \nmoney--if not diligently looked at, if we don't keep a tight rein on \nthose purse strings--can boil down to what in World War I and World War \nII was called war profiteering.\n  The business section of the New York Times this morning showed that \nHalliburton, for example, was making over 66 cents a gallon on fuel \nthat it was selling to the United States government for use in Iraq, \nand we were paying them for it. We are paying them these profits. It \nshowed how much Halliburton was spending, up to $1.70 a gallon for fuel \nwhen they could have gotten the same fuel in the region for basically \n66 cents less a gallon. Where is that money going? We don't know.\n  That is the problem with all of this money floating around: Trust me, \nthe administration says. As the old saying goes, there is no education \nin the second kick of a mule. Quite frankly, I admit publicly I have \nbeen kicked repeatedly by this administration's mule saying, Trust me.\n  A few years ago, the administration pushed through this No Child Left \nBehind bill for education. The President said: Trust me, we will come \nup with the resources to make sure it works. Now we have the mandates \nbut we do not have the resources.\n  Trust me, they said, that we will have the evidence that Saddam \nHussein had weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological \nweapons, the means to deliver them, that he had connections with al-\nQaida. We now know none of this is true.\n  I am basically here today saying, Not this time around; I am not \nwilling to give a blank check; I insist on a measure of basic \naccountability.\n  I recall President Reagan's policy with regard to arms control. \nRemember what he said? He said, Trust but verify, and that is exactly \nthe purpose of this amendment. It allows $10.1 billion for Iraqi \nreconstruction through the end of March 2004. Further funding would be \ncontingent on two things: The President must certify to Congress that \nthe U.N. has adopted a new resolution authorizing a multinational \nmilitary force in Iraq under United States command; and, two, the \nPresident must certify that he has a coherent plan for the \nreconstruction of Iraq, including a significant commitment of financial \nassistance from other nations. In short, trust but verify, no blank \ncheck.\n  The administration will be on notice that additional money for Iraq \nreconstruction will not be automatic. The President first must come \nforward with a coherent plan to internationalize the occupation of \nIraq, to stabilize and democratize Iraq, and then bring our troops home \nas soon as possible.\n  Everyone is talking about ``supporting our troops,'' and certainly we \nwant to do everything we can to support our troops. At issue is, how do \nwe best support the troops?\n  The Stars and Stripes, the newspaper all of us relied upon during our \ntenure in the military, has just released a poll showing that one-half \nof the troops surveyed say their unit's morale is low in Iraq. Almost \n50 percent say it is very unlikely or not likely that they will \nreenlist when their term is up. According\n\n[[Page S12655]]\n\nto Stars and Stripes, a key reason for this dissatisfaction is:\n\n       Uncertainty about when they will be returning home.\n\n  Let me be clear, nothing will be better in terms of support for our \ntroops than to compel this administration at long last to \ninternationalize the reconstruction efforts in Iraq, to \ninternationalize the military involvement in Iraq. As the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia has said many times, it is time to get the \nU.N. in and the U.S. out. That, along with a clear and credible exit \nstrategy from Iraq, is how we best support our troops, who are risking \ntheir lives every day, separated from their friends and their families, \nmany of them not continuing with their education, not knowing when they \nare going to come home, performing duties for which really they were \nnot trained.\n  The Byrd amendment is the amendment that supports our troops, and \nthat is why it should be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1832, 1853, 1865, and 1866\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, both sides have cleared for approval four \namendments that I ask be considered en bloc. The first is amendment No. \n1832 by Senator Feingold. The second is amendment No. 1853. The other \ntwo have not been filed. I send the amendments to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Hollings and Senator Durbin, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthese four amendments be considered en bloc. They are primarily \ntechnical in nature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Hollings, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1865.\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1866.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1832\n\n(Purpose: To require reports on Iraqi oil production and revenues to be \n         made available to the public in English and in Arabic)\n\n       On page 35, line 14, strike ``available,'' and insert \n     ``available in both English and Arabic,''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1853\n\n       On page 6, before the period on line 12, insert the \n     following:\n       : Provided further, not less than $4,000,000 shall be \n     transferred to ``Office of the Inspector General'' for \n     financial and performance audits of funds apportioned to the \n     Department of Defense from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction \n     Fund''\n       On page 24, line 14, insert after $4,000,000 the following:\n\n     ``of which not less than $4,000,000 shall be transferred to \n     and merged with ``Operating Expenses of the United States \n     Agency for International Development Office of Inspector \n     General'' for financial and performance audits of the Iraq \n     Relief and Reconstruction Fund and other assistance to Iraq''\n       On page 38, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2313.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are trying to go back and forth here. \nSenator Warner has an amendment he would like to offer. After that, I \nunderstand Senator Lautenberg has an amendment to offer.\n  At the moment, there is another Senator on the floor. I see that the \ncurrent occupant of the chair might be interested in a comment he \nwishes to make about some Cubs. I asked him if they were little bears, \nbut he said no.\n  I yield 5 minutes of our time to the Senator from Illinois, if he \nwould agree to that amount of time, to talk about the Cubs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The current occupant of the chair may not consent to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do I have a right to object?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that Senator Durbin is going to \nspeak for 5 minutes. We are going to move to set aside for Senator \nWarner and, following that, move to set aside for Senator Lautenberg. \nIs that right?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is right. I do not know if he is going to call up \nhis amendment or just file it, but in any event, yes, we are prepared \nto do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before we go to Senator Durbin, will the Chair approve the \nunanimous consent request that was propounded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from New York \nalso wants to do something.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, I have an amendment which \nI know is not yet in the queue, but after Senator Durbin speaks, I \nwould also like to speak for 5 minutes about the tragedy that happened \nin New York. I was going to ask to do that later but it seems an \nappropriate time, and I ask unanimous consent to be able to do that, \nand only that, for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We would have no objection to a statement about that \nvery serious accident that happened in the Senator's State.\n  It is my understanding it would be 5 minutes for Senator Durbin, 5 \nminutes for Senator Schumer, and then we return to Senator Warner. \nFollowing Senator Warner, we would go to Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing I would like to ask before we \nget started is, does the Senator from Alaska think the Presiding \nOfficer is qualified to speak about baseball?\n\n[[Page S12656]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would say to the Senator from Nevada, I have heard the \ncurrent occupant of the chair talk about some of his experiences in \nbaseball and one of these days we ought to convene the Senate and \nlisten to him for a while.\n  Mr. REID. I would like that very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is some marvelous history we could learn from the \nSenator about baseball, but I am out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the unanimous consent request been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair recount, for the benefit of the Senate, \nthe order that has just been accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order that has just been accepted is \nSenator Durbin has 5 minutes, Senator Schumer has 5 minutes. Then it is \nthe Senator from Virginia's turn to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Followed by the Senator from New Jersey?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Followed by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1867\n\n(Purpose: To increase the Federal share of the cost of disaster relief \nprovided in connection with Hurricane Isabel; and to provide for repair \n   or replacement of Department of Defense infrastructure damaged or \n                     destroyed by Hurricane Isabel)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, and \n     Mr. Allen, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Dole proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1867:\n       On page 39, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3002. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Federal share of the cost of any disaster relief payment made \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) for damage caused by \n     Hurricane Isabel shall be 90 percent.\n       Sec. 3003. Of the funds appropriated by this Act, \n     $500,000,000 shall be available for repair or replacement of \n     Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration infrastructure damaged or destroyed by \n     Hurricane Isabel, related flooding, or other related natural \n     forces.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I purposely desired the clerk to read the \nshort amendment because this affects the interests in 6 States. This \ntragic hurricane struck North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, West \nVirginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia.\n  Those are the States that were declared by the President as Federal \ndisaster areas. The technical decision has been made by the appropriate \nauthorities that these States suffered severe damage.\n  On the 19th of September, the hurricane caused 45 deaths, and \napproximately $1.7 billion of total damages, of which approximately \n$450 million was sustained in Virginia and $410 million in Maryland.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of colleagues in all of those \nStates. I have listed thus far myself, Senator Allen, Senator Sarbanes, \nSenator Mikulski, and Senator Dole. I expect other Senators from those \nStates will desire to add their names at their own initiative.\n  Why on this particular bill should this funding be provided? It is a \nlegitimate question.\n  No. 1, it is taken out of the funds in this bill for the Department \nof Defense. It is not an add-on or an end run. It is straightforward \nfrom the Department of Defense. In consultation with the individual \nmilitary services, it was relayed to me that the functioning of these \nmilitary facilities in the States enumerated is essential to the \ncurrent operations of the United States military.\n  Senator Allen, members of the Virginia delegation, and I, together \nwith the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security went down to \nthese hard-hit communities. We spent at least 1 day with the Secretary \nof Homeland Security looking at the damage in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia; and specifically, to the Langley Air Force Base and NASA \nfacility. It is a relatively modest sum, but the Langley facility has a \ndual purpose. It serves both for the Department of Air Force and the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n  We simply couldn't have the construction and repairs eligible for one \npart of the facility and not the other. Of course, the debate was \nprimarily for the Department of Air Force. That is one very modest and \nminor technical aspect of this.\n  But the Department of Defense is willing to take those funds \nnecessary for NASA from the funds I put in here, the reason being you \nsimply cannot take a water line, for example, for a flood-damaged area \nand stop at the arbitrary line between where NASA operates and where \nthe Department of Air Force operates.\n  I am hopeful colleagues will not look upon that as any significant \ndeparture from the managers' effort to contain this legislation to \nexpenditures related to the military. I really urge colleagues to \nsupport this. Our colleagues from these 6 States support it. I cannot \nspeak for those who are not on here. I intend to visit with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia on this matter in the \ncourse of the day as well as the junior Senator from West Virginia. It \nis my hope this Chamber will accept this amendment.\n  Again, there was a Presidential designation of areas of destruction, \nand here in the Nation's Capital some of our military installations \nsuffered damage.\n  I point out that in the course of my trips--I think I made seven \ntrips back to my State in connection with this very frightful \nhurricane--I worked with FEMA. I commend FEMA. The FEMA people came in, \nas well as the Small Business Administration, and helped tremendously. \nI recall being in Alexandria along with the Small Business \nAdministration people, and we walked in and out of the various places \nof business--small restaurants and shops where water had come up waist \nhigh the previous evening. You can't imagine the despair on the faces \nand in the minds of a shopkeeper who was there amidst all of this mud, \ndebris, foul-smelling effects of the flood; and then also trying to get \nbriefed on the pathogens that could flow from the mold that will come \nforward.\n  But I found the Small Business Administration people, and \nparticularly FEMA, to be very reassuring to those people who were \novercome with emotion and dispair. Senator Allen and myself on this \nparticular day, and FEMA and the Small Business Administration people, \ngave assurance that the Federal Government would give a measure of \nhelp: Here are the forms, here is the instruction book, there will be a \nrepresentative from FEMA and SBA at this location. You can go to that \nentity and seek assistance.\n\n  That all worked quite well in my State. However, SBA or FEMA is not \navailable to provide assistance to the military installations who were \ndamaged. It is left up to the commander of those bases to finance these \ncosts. I spent considerable time with the commander at Langley Air \nForce Base. I commend him. He stayed throughout the storm even though \nthe base was largely evacuated. It was important to get the military \nequipment out of the path of the storm and locate that equipment in a \nremote area so they could continue to function. There was no gap in the \nfulfillment of the military mission. That commander and indeed the \ngeneral officer in charge of that base and others are to be commended.\n  I could recite other bases and installations, including Fort Story, \nthe same thing: The commander and senior officers and enlisted \npersonnel stayed throughout the storm. By and large, they helped save \nproperty and lives, no question about it. Had everyone departed and \ntried to get back--in some instances the roads were severed and\n\n[[Page S12657]]\n\nyou could not get back and more destruction would occur in that passage \nof time.\n  There was considerable bravery from military and civilians on the \nmilitary installations. FEMA cannot by law step in, nor can the Small \nBusiness Administration. Who is to fill the vacuum? The Congress. That \nis why I am asking the support for this amendment.\n  Again, this includes six States. I have an evaluation of the various \ndamages assessed by the military department in the several States. As \nfar as I can determine, they are good, hard substantiated figures. \nThere is no padding that I know of nor would I permit it.\n  For example, in the U.S. Marine Corps, $16.5 million, primarily in \nNorth Carolina and right here below the District of Columbia, Quantico; \nthe U.S. Army, $92 million; the Navy, $185 million; and the Air Force, \n$210 million.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will provide approximately $500 million \nto repair and replace military and NASA facilities along the east coast \nthat were damaged by Hurricane Isabel. These are the facilities in \nwhich our military personnel and their families live and work. The Air \nForce alone suffered approximately $210 million, much of that was the \nresult of flooding at Langley Air Force Base. Damage at Naval \nfacilities is estimated to exceed $180 million, while damage at Army \nand Marine Corps facilities is estimated to exceed $100 million. There \nwas also an estimated $5 million in damage at the NASA facility in \nLangley.\n  Make no mistake, this damage will have to be repaired and unless we \nprovide the funding in this bill, it will come at the expense of \noperations and training.\n  I am hopeful colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I will leave it to the managers of the bill to decide how and when \nthis matter is addressed formally, either by voice or recorded vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be the pending business subject to the \nmanagers, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Warner, which seeks to \naddress the damages at Department of Defense installations in those \nStates impacted by Hurricane Isabel.\n  The State of Maryland was particularly hard hit by Hurricane Isabel \nand the strong winds and flooding that accompanied it. Entire \ncommunities were submerged, power was lost in some areas for a week and \ncountless individuals sustained damage to their homes, businesses and \nproperty. A number of Maryland's military facilities were similarly \naffected.\n  Perhaps the hardest hit was the United States Naval Academy in \nAnnapolis which suffered approximately $39 million in damage. Several \nweeks ago, I met with the Academy's Superintendent, Vice Admiral Rodney \nRempt, who shared with me photographs of the destruction brought on by \nthe hurricane. Hurricane-related swelling of the Chesapeake Bay, the \nSevern River and the Annapolis Harbor resulted in the flooding of \nacademic buildings and laboratories, the submerging of athletic fields \nand the destruction of electrical systems. Our future Naval officers \nare now forced to take classes wherever they can be offered in the \nchapel, on a Navy barge, in administrative offices.\n  Hurricane destruction was not limited to Annapolis alone. Officials \nat the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, Patuxent River Naval Air Station \nand the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division, among \nothers, also report significant amounts totaling in the millions of \ndollars to repair roofs and buildings, replace piers, and clean up \ndebris related to the storms.\n  As you know, Operation and Maintenance funding at our bases is \nroutinely among the most thinly stretched. And that is in years without \na major natural disaster. This amendment provides $500 million to cover \nthe much-needed cost of repair at facilities along the East Coast \nfacilities whose continued operation are vital to our national defense. \nI urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to talk about an amendment \nthat I will be sending to the desk, and that is why I sought \nrecognition. However, I also take just a couple of minutes to commend \nSenator Byrd for his leadership on this issue, for reminding Members we \nhave an obligation to examine the conditions under which we operate to \nmake certain funds that are expended--I served with Senator Byrd in the \nAppropriations Committee for many years, and he is just as diligent on \nthe floor as he is in the committee--to make sure the funds we expend, \nour taxpayer funds, are clearly examined and clearly understood before \nwe make the commitment to send those funds on their way.\n  For the almost 19 years I have served in the Senate, I am always \nimpressed when I hear Senator Byrd stand up and act as the conscience \nof the Senate, reminding all Members of our responsibilities in such \neloquent ways. I am grateful to him for the time he has allowed me to \nspeak today as we discuss the supplemental appropriations bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1868\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration, and I ask the pending amendment be laid aside to \naccommodate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey, [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1868.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for any contract or other \n     financial agreement or arrangement with any entity that pays \n compensation in the form of deferred salary to certain United States \n                         Government officials)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as \n     the ``Ethics in Government Contracting Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Contracts With Certain Entities.--None \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     title may be obligated or expended for any contract, any \n     financial agreement, or any other arrangement between the \n     United States and any entity that--\n       (1) at the time of such obligation or expenditure, is \n     obligated under an agreement or otherwise to pay deferred \n     compensation to any individual who holds a position listed in \n     subsection (c); or\n       (2) has issued to such an individual one or more options \n     for such individual to purchase a total of more than 1,000 \n     shares of stock of such entity.\n       (c) Covered Individuals.--The positions referred to in \n     subsection (b) are--\n       (1) President;\n       (2) Vice President;\n       (3) Secretary of State;\n       (4) Secretary of the Treasury;\n       (5) Secretary of Defense;\n       (6) Attorney General;\n       (7) Secretary of the Interior;\n       (8) Secretary of Agriculture;\n       (9) Secretary of Commerce;\n       (10) Secretary of Labor;\n       (11) Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n       (12) Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (13) Secretary of Transportation;\n       (14) Secretary of Energy;\n       (15) Secretary of Education;\n       (16) Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n       (17) Secretary of Homeland Security;\n       (18) Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n       (19) United States Trade Representative;\n       (20) Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (21) Director of National Drug Control Policy; and\n       (22) Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, along with Senators Schumer and \nCorzine, I offer an amendment to this supplemental called the Ethics in \nGovernment Contracting Act. We must ensure that taxpayer-funded \ncontracts in Iraq are of the highest ethical standards for contracting \nthat we can achieve.\n  The question arises as a result of a contract that is now worth over \n$1.4 billion and was awarded without competitive bidding or public \nnotice. The contract was given to the Halliburton Corporation, a \ncompany in which Vice President Cheney maintains a financial interest. \nThe definition of the ``financial interest'' is confirmed by the\n\n[[Page S12658]]\n\nCongressional Research Service, which is the nonpartisan research arm \nwe turn to when we have questions. They have a great deal of skill and \nability, and they agreed with me that despite the Vice President's \nclaim to the contrary, that he had no financial interest, in fact, the \nconditions under which he is operating in connection with Halliburton \ndo indicate a financial interest.\n\n  Now, there is no accusation here of any wrongdoing. But I have got to \nask, Is the taxpayer best served by the award of a lucrative contract \nto a company formerly headed by the Vice President and from which he \nstill draws compensation?\n  It is well known that the standard for ethics is not just to avoid \nwrongdoing but also to avoid the appearance of impropriety because \npublic perception of insider deals can be just as damaging as a \nwrongdoing itself.\n  Right now we are looking at a stark example of activity that gives \nrise to the appearance of impropriety. To put it simply, the largest \nrecipient of reconstruction contracts in Iraq is currently paying a \nsalary directly to the Vice President of the United States. In \naddition, the Vice President holds hundreds of thousands of unexercised \nstock options in this company.\n  We toppled a corrupt dictatorship to instill democratic principles in \nIraq, but what does it say to the Iraqi people when the largest \nrecipient of United States reconstruction contracts in Iraq is paying \ncompensation to the second highest official in the U.S. Government? I \nsay it sends the wrong message to the people of Iraq and certainly \nsends the wrong message to the people in our country.\n  Also, in an untimely fashion, it sends a message to those who are \nserving in our military in Iraq. Today's Washington Post, on the front \npage, has the result of a poll that was taken by the Stars and Stripes, \nthe bible all of us use when we are serving our country, in which there \nis considerable criticism about the way they are being asked to serve \nand the conditions under which they do it. Many say they do not plan to \nreenlist, and that is a terrible condemnation of what is going on.\n  Now, these are brave souls. These are good, loyal people. And the one \nthing we are not discussing in this $87 billion supplemental is whether \nor not the troops are being supported, because outside of the $20 \nbillion that is under discussion now, there is unanimous support, in my \nview, for just getting those funds out there that can help protect, \nthat can help make our military more efficient, make their living \nconditions better. No question about that.\n  So when those who are serving see that it appears there is an inside \nrelationship, that Halliburton got this fantastically fat contract, \nestimated to be worth a lot less than is now being spent--the American \npeople are already skeptical about the pricetag of this supplemental \nappropriations bill, and if we are going to spend such a massive amount \nof their money, we have to help reassure them we are following the \nhighest ethical standards with these funds.\n  My amendment would make the ethics standards very clear. It says that \nnone of the Iraq reconstruction funds may be used to award a contract \nwith a company that currently pays compensation, including stock \noptions, to the President, Vice President, or any member of the \nPresident's Cabinet.\n  Ideally, there should not be a need for such an amendment, but over \nthe last few weeks it has become clear we need to draw some very \nvisible ethical lines.\n  As I mentioned, the most controversial contract in Iraq is the one \nthat was awarded to the Vice President's former company, Halliburton, \nto repair and maintain oil fields. This contract was negotiated in \nprivate, with no competition from other bidders.\n\n  Last winter, we heard that this no-bid contract with Halliburton \nmight cost $50 million and was there for the exclusive mission of \nputting out oil well fires. Then we were told that the contract was for \nmuch more than putting out fires; that it would be operating and \nmaintaining oil facilities across Iraq. And now this sole source, no-\nbid Halliburton contract is growing at an accelerating rate.\n  Halliburton has been billing taxpayers at a furious pace under this \nno-bid contract. In September, the amount of money billed by \nHalliburton under this contract rose to $1.4 billion. That was \nestimated to be a $50 million contract, done in the dark of night--from \n$50 million up to $1.4 billion.\n  If we just look at this chart, we see what has happened. If you go \nback to January 2003, it was just starting. And these are amounts in \nmillions on the chart. The acceleration, the shape of the curve, tells \nyou just what has happened. Look at where we are on October 1, 2003--10 \nmonths after this contract began--and we are up to $1.4 billion. Look \nat the spike in just September alone. The contract doubled over that 1-\nmonth period.\n  This no-bid, exclusive contract for Halliburton was negotiated in \nprivate and not revealed to the public until Members of Congress \ndemanded information. And now the Army Corps has finally agreed to open \nthis contract for competitive bidding, but it is unclear when the new \ncontract will be effective.\n  Rather than offer reassurance to the American people that the no-bid \nHalliburton contract was above board, the Vice President raised \nsuspicion with his recent comments. On national television, the Vice \nPresident recently said, regarding Halliburton, that he--and I quote--\n``severed all of my ties with the company, gotten rid of all my \nfinancial interest.''\n  He went on to say--and I quote again--``I have no financial interest \nin Halliburton of any kind and haven't had, now, for over three \nyears.''\n  The problem is that the Vice President's own financial disclosure \nreports contradict that claim. His financial disclosures reveal that he \nhas received over $205,000 from Halliburton in deferred salary in \n2001--more than his salary as Vice President. In 2002, he received \n$162,000 in deferred salary from Halliburton. His financial disclosure \nforms indicate that he expects to receive similar compensation this \nyear, and in 2004 and 2005.\n  The Vice President's statements regarding his ties to Halliburton \nwere not correct. And I called on him to correct the record. He did not \ndo that.\n  The Vice President is currently receiving salary payments from \nHalliburton worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, as this \nadministration doles out billions of dollars in contracts to \nHalliburton.\n  In addition, the Vice President holds 433,000 unexercised Halliburton \nstock options. And even though the exercise price is above the current \nmarket price, the options extend to 2009, and any option holder--Mr. \nPresident, I come out of the corporate world--has to hope that the \nstock price surges so the value of the options increase. One way this \ncan happen is to be sure that lucrative contracts keep coming from the \nU.S. Government.\n  Halliburton's stock value has increased 75 percent over the last \nyear, even though the rest of the oil services industry has remained \nrelatively flat. And we know that the biggest boost Halliburton has \ngotten is the multibillion-dollar Government contract in Iraq. This has \nan unwholesome appearance.\n  We want to change the environment in which we are presently \noperating. I offer this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the \nethics in government contracting amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment has more than a whiff of \npolitics in it. If I had the power to do so, I would close the room and \nturn on some fans. This is the most outrageous amendment I have heard \nin my time in the Senate in 35 years. As a practical matter, it is also \nwrong.\n  Contracts were bid. Brown and Root contracts were bid. The December \ncontracts were entered into for Bosnia, Kosovo, by the last \nadministration.\n  The Vice President stated what the Senator from New Jersey said in \npart. He did not say fully what the Vice President said. Let me say \nwhat the Vice President said on September 14:\n\n       I have no financial interest in Halliburton of any kind and \n     haven't had now for over three years. And as Vice President, \n     I have absolutely no influence of, involvement of, knowledge \n     of in any way, shape or form, of contracts let by the Corps \n     of Engineers or anybody else in the federal government . . .\n\n  The Vice President has a deferred compensation obligation from his\n\n[[Page S12659]]\n\nformer employer. He has no financial interest in Halliburton. The \nSenator's amendment cleverly works through a connection to the Vice \nPresident because he does have a deferred compensation concept. He has \na right to receive money that was owed to him by Halliburton before he \nleft that company for work he did before he left that company. The \ndeferred compensation is money the Vice President earned as part of his \nmonthly salary while he was at Halliburton but elected not to receive \nuntil he left the firm. This is done in many cases. It is a fixed \namount that is being paid out over a period of time. The amount is not \ntied to the success or failure of Halliburton in any way. It is money \nowed by Halliburton to the Vice President for the time he was employed \nby the company before he left the company.\n  While employed by Halliburton, the Vice President routinely deferred \na portion of his salary. That was his right to do. And each year he had \nthe option of electing to receive a deferred salary in a lump sum \npayment when he left the firm or in a stream of payments over a period \nof time. In December of 1998, long before he contemplated returning to \npublic life, Vice President Cheney elected to defer a portion of his \n1999 compensation and receive it over a period of years following his \ndeparture from the company. Once he made that election in 1998, it was \nirrevocable.\n  When the Vice President left Halliburton some 2 years later, he was \nnot able to change this election, and Halliburton was required to \ndistribute the 1999 compensation in five annual payments. To avoid even \nthe appearance of a conflict of interest, the Vice President voluntary \ncomplied with the practice then required by the Office of Government \nEthics and purchased an insurance policy to ensure that he had no \nfinancial interest in the future of Halliburton. The Vice President \npurchased this policy out of his own pocket. He paid the premium \nhimself. The insurance policy guarantees the Vice President will \nreceive the deferred compensation owed to him, whether Halliburton is \nsuccessful or goes bankrupt. The insurance policy ensures the Vice \nPresident has no financial interest in the success or failure of this \ncompany.\n  The Vice President eliminated any potential conflict of interest \nrelated to his deferred compensation arrangement and he resolved any \nfinancial interest he had in Halliburton. The Vice President reported \nthe deferred compensation arrangement in his 2001 and 2002 public \nfinancial disclosure forms.\n\n  On January 18, 2001, the Vice President signed an irrevocable \nagreement donating to charity the after-tax proceeds from the exercise \nof his Halliburton stock options. Again, this is something the Senator \nfrom New Jersey could have found very easily.\n  Under the agreement, the Vice President divested himself of all \neconomic benefits of the options and gave them to charity. The three \ncharities named in the agreement are the Capital Partners for \nEducation, the George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates, \nand the University of Wyoming. The Vice President has no control over \nthe remaining stock options. This agreement gave the administrative \nagent the power to exercise the stock options and pay the proceeds to \nthe charities. The administrative agent has total discretion to decide \nwhen to exercise the options without consultation with Mr. Cheney.\n  Under the agreement, the Vice President will owe not a penny more or \na penny less in taxes. The Vice President reported his gift arrangement \non his 2001 and 2002 public financial disclosure forms.\n  If you read this amendment, it covers every official of the executive \nbranch on a senior level. Beyond that, it covers assistants to the \nPresident, the director of national drug policy. I wonder why the \nSenator didn't include every Senator in the United States. I have never \nhad the honor to own 1,000 shares of stock in anything. Some Senators \ndo. I just wonder what is going on here in terms of this concept. We \nalready accepted an amendment that requires any contract entered into \nusing the funds in this bill to be full and open competition. But this \ncontract was full and open. It is competed approximately every 5 years. \nIt is a Brown and Root company to which Halliburton is related.\n  This is a slur against the Vice President of the United States. I \nhave known him now since he was over in the House of Representatives as \nassistant to former President Ford. I have known this man for years and \nyears and years. I know no more honorable man who has served in \ngovernment than Dick Cheney. That is why I am here. I heard about this \namendment.\n  I am sad to say that I am here to respond to it. I never expected \nthis from the Senator from New Jersey. It would unfairly and unwisely \npunish those who have been successful in the private sector and then \nvoluntarily enter into the service of the United States in the \nexecutive branch. It doesn't touch the legislative branch or the \njudicial branch, only executive, and it does so very unfairly.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1868.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the call of the quorum be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nor in relation to the Byrd amendment occur at 3 p.m., without any \namendments being in order to the Byrd amendment. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following the Byrd amendment there be a vote on \nmy motion to table the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, would it be appropriate to have \n2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote on the Lautenberg \namendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is all right with me. I thought we had a standing \norder that there are 2 minutes on either side.\n  Mr. REID. Also, I ask that Senator Byrd have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes on \neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair cannot hear what the Senators are \nsaying. Please talk one at a time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that when we order a vote on \nthis bill, there be 2 minutes of debate on either side on amendments \nprior to a vote.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that it be 1 minute on each side. OK, 2 minutes is \nfine.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have the Warner amendment also. I \nwould like to have scheduled for a vote following the Lautenberg \namendment, the vote on the motion to table.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I think we have come close \nto clearing that amendment on this side. I don't think it will require \na vote. I don't know if we need to waste the time on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will withdraw that. I thought there would be a \nnecessity for a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask also if the second vote--the one on \nthe motion to table the Lautenberg amendment--can be a 10-minute vote. \nI don't see why we cannot speed this up a little.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection to that. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the second vote be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the second vote will be 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Warner amendment is still pending, is it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask it be scheduled for a vote. It may not require a \nvote or the yeas and nays, but I want to dispose of it now before the \nLautenberg amendment.\n\n[[Page S12660]]\n\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to my dear friend, we have a number of \namendments at the desk that are entitled to consideration before that \none. I will do my best to get Warner cleared, but I would rather not \nhave a vote on that because we have some at the desk also that have \nbeen offered and debated. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 1863, 1814, As Modified, and 1855, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have amendments Nos. 1863, 1814, and \n1855. The first amendment is by Senator McConnell, which I will send to \nthe desk. The second is an amendment by Senator Leahy, No. 1814, as \nmodified. The third is No. 1855 by Senator Harkin. I send them to the \ndesk and ask that they be considered en bloc.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I haven't had the opportunity to talk to \nSenator Byrd or his staff.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We rely on our staffs and they have been cleared.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. McConnell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1863.\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1814, as modified.\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1855.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1863\n\n       On page 34, line 1, strike everything after ``proviso,'' \n     through ``Iraq''; on line 5, and insert in lieu thereof:\n       striking the first proviso, and inserting in lieu thereof:\n       Provided, That subject to the determination and \n     notification requirements of this section, exports are \n     authorized to Iraq of lethal military equipment designated by \n     the Secretary of State for use by a reconstituted (or \n     interim) Iraqi military, private security force, other \n     official Iraqi security forces or police forces, or forces \n     from other countries in Iraq that support United States \n     efforts in Iraq:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1814, as modified\n\n  (Purpose: to require the Coalition Provisional Authority to provide \n additional information justifying allocations for capital projects in \n                                 Iraq)\n\n       On page 25, line 21, before the colon, insert the \n     following:\n       : Provided further, That none of the funds appropriated \n     under this heading may be allocated for any capital project, \n     including construction of a prison, hospital, housing \n     community, railroad, or government building, until the \n     Coalition Provisional Authority submits a report to the \n     Committees on Appropriations describing in detail the \n     estimated costs (including the costs of consultants, design, \n     materials, shipping, and labor) on which the request for \n     funds for such project is based: Provided further, That in \n     order to control costs, to the maximum extent practicable \n     Iraqis with the necessary qualifications should be consulted \n     and utilized in the design and implementation of programs, \n     projects, and activities funded under this heading\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1855\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a report by the Comptroller General on certain \n contracts performed in, or relating to, Iraq, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 3002. (a) The Comptroller General shall conduct \n     studies on the effectiveness and efficiency of the \n     administration and performance of contracts in excess of \n     $40,000,000 that are performed or are to be performed in, or \n     relating to, Iraq and are paid out of funds made available \n     under this Act or the Emergency Wartime Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11). The studies \n     shall specifically examine the profits, administrative \n     overhead, management fees, and related expenditures for the \n     management of subcontracts (and further subcontracting) under \n     any such contract. In conducting studies under this section, \n     the Comptroller General shall have access to any information \n     and records created or maintained by the United States, or by \n     any entity receiving funds for contracts studied under this \n     section that the Comptroller General considers appropriate.\n       (b) Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act and again 4 months thereafter, the Comptroller \n     Government shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report that \n     includes--\n       (1) an evaluation of the studies conducted under this \n     section; and\n       (2) any recommendations for the improvement of the \n     contracting process for contracts performed or to be \n     performed in Iraq and for contracts generally, including the \n     selection process, contract content, and oversight of the \n     administration and performance of contracts.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the administration's justification \nmaterials for the $20 billion in reconstruction funds for Iraq, which \nwe received just last week, contains broad categories of projects with \nno supporting details about how the administration arrived at the \nexpected costs of those projects.\n  For example, they want $400 million for two prisons, at a cost of \n$50,000 per bed. How is that possible? Are we going to ship the cement \nover there?\n  They budget $150 million for a tertiary care, pediatric hospital, \nwith no details about how they arrived at that number and no \nexplanation of why this is the best use of these funds in Iraq, versus \nfar less costly public health clinics and immunization programs.\n  They want to spend $100 million for seven housing communities. \nHousing is short in Iraq, but should American taxpayers really pay $100 \nmillion?\n  We simply do not have nearly enough information to justify these \nexorbitant expenditures.\n  My amendment says that before funds are allocated for capital \nprojects like prisons, hospitals, railroads, and government buildings, \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority must submit a report to the \nCommittees on Appropriations describing the estimated cost on which the \nrequest for funds for the project is based.\n\n  The amendment also says, that in order to control costs, to the \nmaximum extent practicable, Iraqis with the necessary qualifications \nshould be consulted and utilized in the design and implementation of \nreconstruction projects. We want to employ Iraqis, not $500 and hour \nconsultants.\n  I don't doubt that Iraq needs new prisons, government buildings, and \nhousing, although I am not yet convinced the American people should pay \nfor these things. This amendment does not prevent any project from \nbeing built.\n  But we hear about spending millions of dollars in Iraq for things--\nfrom vehicles to cement factories--that with a minimum of frugality \ncould be bought or built for a fraction of the price.\n  Before we spend 5 or 10 times more than we need to, let's find out \nwhat we are paying for to be sure it is the best use of the money.\n  That is what my amendment does. It requires the administration to \ngive us the information that justifies these costs, before the funds \nare allocated. The American people deserve to know what their money is \npaying for, before it is spent.\n  I thank the managers for agreeing to this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senate's passage of the \namendment Senator Clinton and I proposed today that requires the \nGeneral Accounting Office to report to the Congress in 6 and 10 months \nabout the contracting and subcontracting process in Iraq. I appreciate \nChairman Stevens' support.\n  The GAO would study the effectiveness and efficiency of those \ncontracts, particularly looking at profit and things like \nadministrative overhead as the contracts turn into subcontracts and \nsubsubcontracts.\n  It calls for the GAO to make recommendations on how to improve the \nprocess. I believe we must do a lot of work to improve how we are doing \nthings before the Congress gets the next large request for funds for \nIraqi reconstruction.\n  I would like to insert into the Record at the end of my remarks a \nletter of support for the amendment from Taxpayers for Common Sense, a \nnonpartisan watchdog group.\n  I fear that there is a lot of very poor performance and clear waste \ngoing around for the grants already let. I fear we may be seeing some \nof the worst taxpayer wastes in decades. That is saying an awful lot.\n  I would note that there are press report that U.S. AID only has 14 \nemployees in Iraq overseeing $3 billion in contracts. That is \nmaladministration.\n\n[[Page S12661]]\n\n  The first Iraqi military battalion has just been trained under a $49 \nmillion contract to Vennel, a subsidiary of Northrup Grumman. The work \ngot subcontracted to something called MPRI. The interesting thing is \nthat first battalion was not detailed to work in areas where there are \ndifficulties in Iraq. Instead of taking a load off of American troops, \nthey have been assigned to the desert to defend against Iran. It smells \nlike nobody trusts the quality of that work and we are hiding the \nresult.\n  It looks like Halliburton is charging the U.S. $1.62 for gasoline \nthat can be bought and transported to Iraq for about 96 cents. Price \ngouging would be a kind way of saying it.\n  The budget documents indicated that $50,000 is being budgeted for the \ncreation of 8,000 new prison cells. I fear contracts will be issued at \nthat level when the real cost of construction in Iraq is far, far less. \nGiven the cost of construction, it makes one wonder why the price is so \nhigh. It is, I believe more than it would cost to build such facilities \nin the United States, where labor costs are far higher.\n  There is a plan for an $800 million Iraqi police training facility. I \nam told there is likely to be a $26 million per month ``management \nfee'' associated with this project.\n  We need to understand what the reality is on expenditures like these. \nWe need to have real examination of what is going on and make sure that \nthe structure is in place that U.S. taxpayers' money is well used and \nnot wasted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Increase Contract Accountability For Iraqi Reconstruction Efforts\n\n                                        Taxpayers for Common $ense\n\n\n                                                       Action,\n\n                                                 October 15, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, a \n     non-partisan budget watchdog group, strongly supports your \n     amendment to require the Comptroller General to conduct a \n     review of the effectiveness and efficiency of all contracts \n     in excess of $40,000,000 that are performed in Iraq and paid \n     out the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n       With a $20 billion pot of available funds, Congress must \n     ensure that federal taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on \n     Iraqi reconstruction efforts. Current oversight of Iraqi \n     reconstruction contracts has been virtually non-existent. We \n     need to reintroduce accountability and transparency into the \n     process to ensure that federal tax dollars are spent \n     judiciously. This is especially true in light of current \n     skyrocketing budget deficits.\n       Your amendment is essential to ensure the American people \n     that the federal government is not improperly wasting Iraqi \n     reconstruction dollars.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jill Lancelot,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed the \nHarkin-Clinton amendment.\n  The Constitution gives the responsibility for appropriating taxpayer \nfunds to the Congress. Thus, Congress has a responsibility to ensure \nthat the taxpayers' money is well spent. However, the size and scope of \nthe administration's $87 billion request makes it harder for Congress \nto exercise its oversight responsibilities.\n  Our amendment ensures that Congress will have the information that it \nneeds to track expenditures and monitor the use of taxpayer funds. It \nwould require the Comptroller General to conduct studies on the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the administration and performance of \ncontracts in excess of $40 million that are paid out of this bill or \nthe previous supplemental. The studies would specifically examine the \nprofits, administrative overhead, management fees, and related \nexpenditures for the management of subcontracts, and further \nsubcontracting, under any such contract. The Comptroller General would \nbe required to submit a report to Congress within 6 months that \nincludes this evaluation and any recommendations for improving the \ncontracting process.\n  Thus, we will know if companies are making reasonable profits or are \nsimply exploiting the situation for huge profits. In almost every major \nwar in our country's history, there have been instances of war \nprofiteering where companies take advantage of the rush to get the job \ndone to gouge the taxpayer. Usually, instances of war profiteering are \ndiscovered after the war is over and the damage has already been done. \nHere is an opportunity to be ahead of the curve and ensure that this \nabuse does not take place at all.\n  With the huge sums being expended in Iraq, we need to ensure that \nthere is a level of accountability. As my colleague Senator Johnson \npointed out, there are literally plane loads of cash being flown into \nIraq. According to a Wall Street Journal story from August, the United \nStates has already sent a billion dollars in cash to Iraq. As the story \nsays, ``the U.S. has improvised a money pipeline that runs from a New \nJersey warehouse, to a Maryland air base, down Baghdad's Ambush Alley, \nand even, at times, underneath the black burkas of two middle-age \nfemale accountants--until it ends up in the pockets of ordinary \nIraqis.'' The story details how the United States is currently flying \nplanes full of cash to Baghdad, and that these banknotes are \n``seeping'' into the economy through cash payments to guards, \npensioners, and other Iraqis.\n  With an additional $87 billion being added to the mix, $20 billion of \nwhich will be spent on Iraq reconstruction, it is critical that we \nunderstand how these funds are being spent. Furthermore, we need to \nknow how much of these taxpayer funds are actually going to rebuilding \nIraq and how much is filling the coffers of U.S. contractors?\n  I certainly hope that the General Accounting Office study called for \nin this amendment will reveal that contractors are not raking in \noutside profits or hiding profits in user and management fees. However, \nif we discover that there are abuses by contractors receiving taxpayer \nfunds, it will be incumbent upon the Congress, which has the \nConstitutional authority to appropriate these funds, to take steps to \nprevent profiteering. This $87 billion appropriation is not the end of \nCongress's responsibilities to safeguard taxpayer funds, it is only the \nbeginning.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting the Harkin-Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1872\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have an amendment I will be offering \nshortly. First, I am going to discuss it for a little bit to inform \ncolleagues about it. The amendment I will offer expresses a sense of \nthe Congress that the Attorney General should appoint a special counsel \nto conduct an independent investigation of the leak of a CIA agent's \nidentity. The bottom line is this--and we have been through this on the \nfloor, so I will not go over the basic facts, other than to say that, \nto me, this act--disclosing the name of an undercover agent--is \ndastardly. It places a gun to the head of that agent; it puts in grave \ndanger operatives that agent may have had while he or she was \nundercover and, of course, perhaps most important of all, it says to \nevery member of our intelligence community who puts themselves on the \nline, just as our soldiers do, if you go seek the truth, report the \ntruth as you see it, and somebody upstairs doesn't like it, you are \nputting yourself or your spouse in real danger.\n  To me, this is something that is not befitting of a great power, not \nbefitting not only because of its immorality--and I believe it is \nimmoral to do such a thing--but also for practical reasons, because \nwhen great powers, as history shows us, lose touch with what is \nactually happening and begin to delude themselves one way or another, \nthey lose power.\n  This country has had as its hallmark truth, open debate, and has had \nas its hallmark, if you disagree, speak out. That, by the way, has been \none of the great things about our intelligence services, certainly \nsince World War II. The CIA, the DIA, and many of the other \nintelligence services are known for reporting the truth. That is why \nthey are somewhat insulated. That is why the CIA was separated and made \nits own agency. The day this country cannot gather the truth, at least \nas seen by the brave men and women representing us in the intelligence \nservices, is the day we begin to decline. Yet that seems to be what has \nhappened here.\n  Ambassador Wilson went to Niger and reported the truth, as he saw it, \non a mission he was asked to undertake, and somebody didn't like what \nhe said. First, they tried to suppress it, and then when they couldn't \nbecause Ambassador Wilson had the courage to go\n\n[[Page S12662]]\n\nforward, it seems that somebody--it seems likely maliciously this was \ndone but perhaps not; we don't know; we don't know all the facts--gave \nto Mr. Novak the name of his wife and identified her as an agent of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency.\n  That, in itself, is a crime. It doesn't matter what the motivation \nis. That is a serious crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. So \nit is a very serious act.\n  Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives--people from every \ncorner of the country--are totally aghast that this happened.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will after I finish my basic outline. I have great \nrespect for my friend from Arizona and will yield for a question at the \nconclusion of what I have to say.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I may be a little while. He might want to take his seat. \nHe is a strong man. He can stand if he likes. I just want to inform \nhim.\n  There was a view that we ought to get to the bottom of this \nsituation. I think, again, that was universally held. Our President \nhimself stated it. However, when we looked at the mechanism to get to \nthe bottom of this, there didn't seem to be a very good one. You \ncouldn't go to the inspector general of either the Justice Department \nor the Defense Department because they can't look at the White House. \nThe independent counsel law had lapsed, and to allow the Justice \nDepartment itself to conduct the investigation seemed to many of us at \nthe outset to pose, at the very least, an apparent conflict of interest \nthat now seems to be a very real conflict of interest given the facts \nthat have come out about the Attorney General's relationship with Karl \nRove and some of the others who, it is bandied about with no backing in \nthe sense there is proof, but there are signs, have said that he was \ninvolved. So many of us called for a special counsel. A special counsel \nis still allowed.\n  Special counsel was the type of law that allowed Archibald Cox and \nLeon Jaworski to get to the bottom of Watergate. A special counsel does \nnot run into the problem that the independent counsel did: that it can \nrun amok and just look at everything under the Sun because it is still \nunder the Attorney General's control ultimately. If that special \ncounsel were to decide to, say, investigate something that went on in \nIndonesia unrelated or something related to the President's campaign \nfinances, the Attorney General could snip it right off. That was the \nmain objection to the independent counsel law.\n  The advantage of the special counsel is very simple, particularly if \nsomeone of some stature and independence is appointed, such as some of \nour previous colleagues--Senator Danforth, Senator Rudman, Senator \nMitchell, or Senator Nunn. Then there is an assurance of some \nindependence and integrity and, at the same time, the day-to-day \noperations of the special counsel are not under the control of the \nAttorney General.\n  The special counsel, if he or she were blocked by the Attorney \nGeneral, would at the end of his or her investigation have to report to \nthe Congress that ``I wish to interview so and so and the Attorney \nGeneral said no.'' Or ``I wish to pursue this lead, and the Attorney \nGeneral said no.''\n\n  We all know the Brandeisian quote: Sunlight is the great disinfectant \nand, therefore, as long as this becomes public, there is almost a \nprophylactic effect. People will be unlikely or be far more reluctant \nto block an avenue of investigation or the interrogation of a certain \nwitness.\n  The investigation has proceeded, and it is very clear that all of the \nthings we worry about--we worry about an apparent conflict of interest. \nThat obviously exists. We worry about a conflict of interest that, too, \nstill exists.\n  By the way, because the Attorney General is a close political friend \nand associate of the President's, all the more reason that a special \ncounsel was then and still is needed.\n  There are two models for appointing Attorneys General in this sense \nanyway. One is to appoint a close friend, confidante, even relative. \nPresident Kennedy appointed his brother. That is reasonable to do, but \nyou lose independence. The other is to appoint someone more \nindependent, the Janet Reno model. But in this case, the President \nchose to appoint someone politically tied to him, someone with a close \nrelationship, so no one even believes there is much independence there. \nWe ask for this special counsel to avoid both apparent conflict and the \nreal conflicts that exist.\n  Those pleas, done certainly by me earnestly--I am just outraged by \nwhat happened, and I think we have to get to the bottom of it no matter \nwhere it leads. I called for this investigation on July 22, long before \nany names such as Rove or some of the others were bandied about because \nI felt so strongly that whoever did this should be punished. It is a \ndespicable act. But as the investigation began to unfold, we saw there \nwas an additional problem, and that is that the investigation was not \nbeing run very well; that by textbook prosecutorial rules and ways of \noperating, this investigation had a number of failures. In fact, our \nleader, Senator Daschle, and my colleagues Senators Biden and Levin, \nand I sent a letter to the President on October 9 that outlined some of \nthese missteps. I thought I would read the parts of the letter that are \nrelevant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2003.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to express our continuing \n     concerns regarding the manner in which your Administration is \n     conducting the investigation into the apparently criminal \n     leaking of a covert CIA operative's identity. You have \n     personally pledged the White House's full cooperation in this \n     investigation and you have stated your desire to see any \n     culprits identified and prosecuted, but the Administration's \n     actions are inconsistent with your words.\n       Already, just fourteen days into this investigation, there \n     have been at least five serious missteps.\n       First, although the Department of Justice commenced its \n     investigation on Friday, September 26, the Justice Department \n     did not ask the White House to order employees to preserve \n     all relevant evidence until Monday, September 29. Every \n     former prosecutor with whom we have spoken, has said the \n     first step in such an investigation would be to ensure all \n     potentially relevant evidence is preserved, yet the Justice \n     Department waited four days before making a formal request \n     for such documents.\n       Second, when the Justice Department finally asked the White \n     House to order employees to preserve documents, White House \n     Counsel Alberto Gonzales asked for permission to delay \n     transmitting the order to preserve evidence until morning. \n     That request for delay was granted. Again, every former \n     prosecutor with whom we have spoken has said that such a \n     delay is a significant departure from standard practice.\n       Third, instead of immediately seeking the preservation of \n     evidence at the two other Executive Branch departments from \n     which the leak might have originated, i.e., State and \n     Defense, such a request was not made until Thursday, October \n     1. Perhaps even more troubling, the request to State and \n     Defense Department employees to preserve evidence was \n     telegraphed in advance not only by the request to White House \n     employees earlier in the week, but also by the October 1st \n     Wall State Journal report that such a request was \n     ``forthcoming'' from the Justice Department. It is, of \n     course, extremely unusual to tip off potential witnesses in \n     this manner that a preservation request is forthcoming.\n       Fourth, on October 7, White House spokesperson Scott \n     McClellan stated that he had personally determined three \n     White House officials, Karl Rove, Lewis Libby and Elliot \n     Abrams, had not disclosed classified information. According \n     to press reports, Mr. McClellan said, ``I've spoken with each \n     of them individually. They were not involved in leaking \n     classified information, nor did they condone it.'' Clearly, a \n     media spokesperson does not have the legal expertise to be \n     questioning possible suspects or evaluating or reaching \n     conclusions about the legality of their conduct. In addition, \n     by making the statement, the White House has now put the \n     Justice Department in the position of having to determine not \n     only what happened, but also whether to contradict the \n     publicly stated position of the White House.\n       Fifth, and perhaps more importantly, the investigation \n     continues to be directly overseen by Attorney General \n     Ashcroft who has well-documented conflicts of interest in any \n     investigation of the White House. Mr. Ashcroft's personal \n     relationship and political alliance with you, his close \n     professional relationships with Karl Rove, and Mr. Gonzales, \n     and his seat on the National Security Council all tie him so \n     tightly to this White House that the results may not be \n     trusted by the American people. Even if the\n\n[[Page S12663]]\n\n     case is being handled in the first instance by professional \n     career prosecutors, the integrity of the inquiry may be \n     called into question if individuals with a vested interest in \n     protecting the White House are still involved in any matter \n     related to the investigation.\n       We are at risk of seeing this investigation so compromised \n     that those responsible for this national security breach will \n     never be identified and prosecuted. Public confidence in the \n     integrity of this investigation would be substantially \n     bolstered by the appointment of a special counsel. The \n     criteria in the Justice Department regulations that created \n     the authority to appoint a Special Counsel have been met in \n     the current case. Namely, there is a criminal investigation \n     that presents a conflict of interest for the Justice \n     Department, and it would be in the public interest to appoint \n     an outside special counsel to assume responsibility for the \n     matter. In the meantime, we urge you to ask Attorney General \n     Ashcroft to recuse himself from this investigation and do \n     everything within your power to ensure the remainder of this \n     investigation is conducted in a way that engenders public \n     confidence.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Joseph R. Biden.\n     Carl Levin.\n     Charles E. Schumer.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. I am going to read these five steps \nthat, again, fly in the face of good prosecutorial practice:\n\n       First, although the Department of Justice commenced its \n     investigation on Friday, September 26, the Justice Department \n     did not ask the White House to order employees to preserve \n     all relevant evidence until Monday, September 29. . . .\n       Second, when the Justice Department finally asked the White \n     House to order employees to preserve documents, White House \n     Counsel Alberto Gonzales asked for permission to delay \n     transmitting the order to preserve evidence until morning and \n     the request for delay was granted.\n\n  In both these instances, every seasoned prosecutor knows that is not \nstandard practice. You don't give those who might--underline \n``might''--want to destroy evidence an opportunity to do so. The first \nthing a good prosecutor does is gather as much evidence quickly and as \nbroadly as possible.\n\n       Third, instead of immediately seeking the preservation of \n     evidence at the two other Executive Branch departments from \n     which the leak might have originated, i.e., State and \n     Defense, such a request was not made until Thursday, October \n     1. Perhaps even more troubling, the request to the State and \n     Defense Department employees to preserve evidence was \n     telegraphed in advance not only by the request to White House \n     employees earlier in the week, but also by the October 1st \n     Wall Street Journal report that such a request was \n     ``forthcoming'' from the Justice Department.\n\n  I have talked to prosecutors who flipped their lid at that one. You \nput in the newspaper that you are going to request evidence of \npotential suspects? Wow. Something is wrong. Is it done nefariously? I \ndo not know. Perhaps not. But it does not matter. Certainly, the \nleaker, whoever he or she is, is under a cloud and worried about \npotential criminal prosecution. Whether this was done by accident or by \ndesign, it does not make a darn bit of difference. It fouls up the \ninvestigation to a fare-thee-well.\n  Fourth, on October 7, going back from the letter, White House \nspokesman Scott McClellan stated that he had personally determined that \nthree White House officials: Karl Rove, Lewis Libby, and Elliott \nAbrams, had not disclosed classified information. According to press \nreports, Mr. McClellan said he had spoken to each of them individually.\n  What is going on? We have the White House press spokesperson on his \nown--or maybe with authorization. Did he get it from Justice? I doubt \nit, but I sure would like to know--goes and interviews the witnesses, \nor potential witnesses?\n  He then came to a conclusion and told it to the Nation: They were not \ninvolved in leaking classified information, nor did they condone it.\n  Again, this comes from prosecution 101. A media spokesperson does not \nhave the legal expertise to be questioning possible suspects or \nevaluating or reaching conclusions about the legality of their conduct.\n  In addition, by making this statement, the White House has now put \nthe Justice Department in the position of having to determine not only \nwhat happened but whether to publicly contradict the White House \nspokesperson.\n  Fifth, and maybe most importantly, the letter goes on to say that the \ninvestigation continues to be directly overseen by Attorney General \nAshcroft, who has well documented conflicts of interest in any \ninvestigation of the White House.\n  So we renewed our plea. Now, let me make two additional points that \nhave not come out since we last spoke about this on the Senate floor. \nFirst, we do not know who is in charge. Who is running this \ninvestigation? Is it, as some newspaper reports have said, the head of \nthe Counterterrorism Division within the FBI, a gentlemen named Mr. \nDion? Is it the head of the FBI, Mr. Mueller? Is it the Attorney \nGeneral? Is it the Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division \nor somebody else? Who is making the decisions? How the heck can there \nbe a prosecution when we do not know who is in charge?\n  Then, of course, we do not know if that person is reporting to \nAttorney General Ashcroft day to day. Is this person available? If the \nWhite House press spokesperson will do his own little investigation and \ntell everyone what happened, how about letting the public at least get \nan idea from who is doing the investigation not to talk publicly about \nthe details but to let them know what is going on because, when one \nlooks at the press reports, it is either Judge Gonzales or a Justice \nDepartment spokesperson or a member of the Justice Department who gets \nup and says this is what is happening. It is unheard of. This \ninvestigation already is so tainted.\n  So many of us ask, if they are not going to go for a special counsel, \nwhich is what should happen, at least Attorney General Ashcroft \nshould publicly recuse himself. He has not even done that. What kind of \nassurance does the public have that we are going to get to the bottom \nof this?\n\n  Then the President says we may never get to the bottom of it. Well, \nmaybe he is just stating what he thinks, maybe he is just stating what \nhe hopes, or maybe he is sending a signal. I do not know which is \nwhich, but he should not have said that. One day he said he wants to \nget to the bottom of it, and we should, and that was great. The next \nday he says, well, we may never know.\n  So this investigation is fraught with mistakes and errors, whether by \ndesign or by accident, that imperil its results, whatever they come to \nbe.\n  I have never quite seen anything like it. I was on the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House of Representatives for 16 years and have now \nbeen in the Senate for 5 years. I am somewhat familiar with how our \nFederal justice agencies work. In all of my years, I have never seen \nwhat happened. We can be sure that if this had happened during the \nClinton years, and these mistakes were being made, what we are saying \nand asking to be done would be mild, would be pablum, compared to what \nsome of my colleagues on the other side would be asking for.\n  One other point before I get to the substance: This morning's New \nYork Times reported the following, and the headline is, ``Senior \nFederal Prosecutors and FBI Officials Fault Ashcroft Over Leaked \nInquiry.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 16, 2003]\n\n  Senior Federal Prosecutors and F.B.I. Officials Fault Ashcroft Over \n                              Leak Inquiry\n\n                 (By David Johnston and Eric Lichtblau)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 15.--Several senior criminal prosecutors \n     at the Justice Department and top F.B.I. officials have \n     privately criticized Attorney General John Ashcroft for \n     failing to recuse himself or appoint a special prosecutor to \n     investigate the leak of a C.I.A. operative's identity.\n       The criticism reflects the first sign of dissension in the \n     department and the F.B.I. as the inquiry nears a critical \n     phase. The attorney general must decide whether to convene a \n     grand jury, which could compel White House officials to \n     testify.\n       The criminal justice officials, who spoke on the condition \n     that they not be identified, represent a cross section of \n     experienced criminal prosecutors and include political \n     supporters of Mr. Ashcroft at the department's headquarters \n     here and at United States attorneys' offices around the \n     country.\n       The officials said they feared Mr. Ashcroft could be \n     damaged by continuing accusations that as an attorney general \n     with a long career in Republican partisan politics, he could \n     not credibly lead a criminal investigation that centered on \n     the aides to a Republican president.\n       Democrats have criticized each step of the inquiry as \n     tainted by Mr. Ashcroft's relationship with the White House.\n\n[[Page S12664]]\n\n       The investigation is trying to determine who told the \n     syndicated columnist Robert Novak, as he wrote in July, that \n     Valerie Plame, the wife of a former ambassador, Joseph C. \n     Wilson IV, was a C.I.A. employee. Mr. Wilson was a critic of \n     the administration's Iraq policies.\n       A senior Justice Department official acknowledged on \n     Tuesday that the question of whether Mr. Ashcroft should step \n     aside had stirred discussion in the department, but said that \n     the dissent was limited and did not reflect the overall \n     thinking of the career lawyers who are in daily control of \n     the leak case. The official said that the option of recusal \n     or referral to a special prosecutor remained ``wide open.''\n       The official said that the question of whether Mr. Ashcroft \n     should step aside had been discussed among Mr. Ashcroft's \n     senior advisers, but that so far none of the career lawyers \n     on the case had recommended that the attorney general remove \n     himself.\n       The official said Mr. Ashcroft had twice gathered his \n     investigative team to urge them to find out who had leaked \n     the identity of the C.I.A. operative and to prosecute that \n     person if possible. ``He's angry about this,'' the official \n     said.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       But Mr. Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller \n     III, operate as major members of Mr. Bush's antiterror team, \n     a closeness that complicates a criminal inquiry at the White \n     House managed by Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Mueller.\n       Several alternative approaches have been suggested both \n     inside and outside the Justice Department, the officials \n     said. In one approach, Mr. Ashcroft would recuse himself from \n     the case once James B. Comey, the federal prosecutor in \n     Manhattan, took over as deputy attorney general in either an \n     acting or permanent basis.\n       Mr. Bush said earlier this month that he intended to \n     appoint Mr. Comey as deputy attorney general. Mr. Comey \n     brings established prosecutorial credentials to the job.\n       If Mr. Comey took charge, it would avoid the time-consuming \n     prospect of appointing a special counsel who would then have \n     semi-independence to investigate the case, but would still be \n     answerable to the attorney general.\n       Mr. Ashcroft is aware of the political sensitivity of the \n     case, and aides said he had worked hard to ensure an \n     aggressive investigation.\n       After a news report indicated that the F.B.I. would move \n     cautiously because of the intense scrutiny, an angry Mr. \n     Ashcroft had an aide call the F.B.I. immediately to let \n     officials there know that that would not be the case, a \n     Justice Department adviser said. ``He wants to make certain \n     we're moving with all appropriate dispatch.''\n       Mr. Ashcroft and Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House \n     counsel, have also been under fire for their initial handling \n     of the case. The Justice Department allowed the White House \n     to wait overnight on Sept. 28 before sending an electronic \n     message ordering White House employees not to destroy records \n     related to the leak.\n       Ashley Snee, a spokesman for Mr. Gonzales, said he believed \n     the delay was acceptable because no one in the White House \n     had any idea there was an investigation. But The New York \n     Times and The Washington Post had reported the day before \n     that the C.I.A. had forwarded the matter to the Justice \n     Department for possible investigation.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So now we are finding that even people within the \nJustice Department mention in the article that political supporters of \nMr. Ashcroft at the Department's headquarters and at the U.S. \nAttorney's Offices around the country object, take issue with the way \nthis investigation has been conducted.\n  Again, this was a serious crime.\n  This is what former President George H. W. Bush says about the \nleaking of names of undercover CIA agents: I have nothing but contempt \nand anger for those who betray the trust by exposing our sources. They \nare, in my view, the most insidious of traitors.\n  Serious stuff, traitors, not in the words of some partisan Democrat \nbut of our present President's father, our former President.\n  Here we are running an investigation that makes one scratch one's \nhead and wonder how serious, how competent, and how careful this \ninvestigation is.\n  I quote a former CIA agent, Mr. Marcinkowski, from an October 7 \nappearance on CNN, where he said:\n\n       As an operations officer on scene in a country, the effects \n     of this--\n\n  The leak--\n\n     are that anyone who knows you or did know you will now look \n     at your mosaic. They will look at the people you've come in \n     contact with. They will suspect those people, be they \n     official contacts or innocent contacts. They will suspect \n     those persons of being intelligence agents. They could be \n     subject to interrogation, imprisonment and even death, \n     depending on the regime that you may be operating under.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       There's also ramifications for CIA morale. I'm not naive \n     enough to say this is having a huge impact, but certainly, it \n     contributes to a decline in morale when you know that your \n     own government can identify you as a clandestine operator. \n     Certainly, there's going to be a reluctance on the part of \n     foreign nationals that may want to help the United States in \n     these trying times. They're going to be reluctant to serve \n     and help us with information, based on the fact that their \n     identification may be revealed by the government.\n\n  So it is more obvious now than when we tried to ask for it several \nweeks ago that at the very minimum we need a special counsel and that \nAttorney General Ashcroft should recuse himself immediately. Yet we get \ncontinued mistakes and continued handling of this case as if someone \ndoes not know how to do it or someone does not care or someone is \nafraid to do it in a full-fledged sense.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, this is not \ngoing to go away. The best thing we could do, not only to serve our \ncountry, which is in a time of war and I have had sympathy for that, \nbut to serve this administration, is to put this out of any question, \nappoint a special counsel of high repute and integrity, and let the \ninvestigation go forward on its own and see wherever it leads.\n  That is why the amendment I will be introducing shortly is so \nimportant to all of us. I am not going to introduce it as of yet \nbecause I know several of my colleagues wish to speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Iowa for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I thank the Senator from New York for his very \nearly and very eloquent statements on this issue, going clear back to \nJuly. It was the Senator from New York who first started alerting this \nbody and the American people as to this disclosure by the Bush \nadministration of an undercover CIA agent's name and the ramifications \nit had. So we owe the Senator from New York a great deal of gratitude \nfor his leadership on this issue because it is a matter of very grave \nnational security importance.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from New York talk about the \nneed for a special counsel and why it is so important for the Attorney \nGeneral to recuse himself from this. But I ask this of the Senator from \nNew York. It seems to me one of the ways we might really get to the \nbottom of this in a hurry would be if those who leaked the information \nto the journalists were to release the journalists from any obligation \nto hide the sources.\n  I ask the Senator, would it not be possible for the President of the \nUnited States to call in all of his senior staff, have them sit down at \na desk and sign a piece of paper releasing Mr. Novak and any other \njournalists from protection of his or her name as a possible source of \nthe leak? Couldn't the President just have all of the senior White \nHouse people, senior administration people sign such a thing? Then \nwouldn't that release the duty or obligation of the journalists to \nprotect their sources? And wouldn't that get to the bottom of it in a \nhurry? I ask the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Iowa for his question, which \nis an interesting question, as well as his dogged pursuit in regard to \nthe truth in this matter. I know this is one of many times he has come \nto the floor.\n  The bottom line is this gets us into the realm of journalists' rights \nand the shield law and other things. I think if the President would ask \nall of those in his office to release journalists from any strictures, \nany compunction about letting it be known--if they believed it \nappropriate--who leaked to them, that would be a very good idea.\n  I hasten to add that the journalists themselves might not do it. They \nhave not done it in previous times. We probably would still need this \ninvestigation. But it certainly--and my colleague from Iowa is right \nand I wouldn't want to compel them and I know he wouldn't either, but \nit certainly would, again, call into good light the desire, professed \ndesire, of those in the White House, including the President himself, \nto get to the bottom of this because obviously it could, and it could \nquickly, provided the journalists who were so released would be willing \nto come forward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from New York, it seems to me if the\n\n[[Page S12665]]\n\nPresident really wants to get to the bottom of this--and I don't really \nknow that he does want to get to the bottom of this--I say to the \nSenator from New York, it seems odd the President has been so \nnonchalant about it, actually joking about it with foreign reporters.\n  Let's say, if I were a senior administration official working for the \nPresident, and the President called me in and said: ``Tom, I want you \nto sign this thing; it just says, `I, Tom Harkin, hereby release any \nand all journalists from any obligation they may have to me to protect \nmy name as any possible source of a leak of this information regarding \nValerie Plame,''' and he'd ask me to sign it, it seems to me if I had \nnothing to hide, I would sign it. If I had something to hide, I might \nnot want to sign it. Then the President would know.\n\n  You are obviously right, you don't want to force anyone, but \nobviously they work for the President.\n  I ask the Senator from New York, doesn't it strike you as odd that \nthe President, who has spoken so forcefully about leaks and national \nsecurity, has been so nonchalant about this? Doesn't it strike the \nSenator as odd?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It does. I thank my colleague. It does strike me as \nstrange. I agree with you. The times there has been joking or bantering \nabout this, it bothered me very much.\n  Another thing that bothers me, along the same line as to what he has \nasked: This President, in my judgment, to his credit, has made it a \npoint that we have to do everything we can to defend our soldiers on \nthe front lines. Whatever one's opinion of the war in Iraq, whatever \none's opinion of our actions in Afghanistan and Kosovo and everywhere \nelse--Korea, where we have soldiers--this President has made it a \nhallmark of defending those troops and doing everything to defend those \ntroops. In fact, we are here in the Chamber defending, of the $87 \nbillion, the vast majority, I guess--over $60 billion--to help defend \nthem in Iraq, something that most of us, myself included, support.\n  Yet when it comes to defending an agent who was on the front lines \nand has been betrayed by, in the words of President George H. W. Bush, \na traitor, we get nonchalance, a joke here and there, ``What's the \nbother? What's the fuss?'' Excuses--``This wasn't an agent, it was an \nanalyst.'' Or, ``This wasn't done by malice''--the effect still being \nthe same. That is serious.\n  I would say one other thing to my colleague. The President could also \ndemand that the culprit turn himself or herself in. I haven't heard \nthat yet. Would you think that would be the case if someone had \nbetrayed some of our soldiers in the field in Iraq?\n  There is sort of a strange dichotomy that my colleague from Iowa is \nabsolutely right to point out. That is, for this betrayal of a soldier, \nif you will, who has been on our front lines, there is a nonchalance, \nan attitude: Well, who cares too much about this?\n  Do you know what it makes the average American think? It makes them \nthink maybe there is something there, because if the President were \ncertain that it might not go to one of his close associates, or the \nPresident were certain in his belief we had to get to the bottom of \nthis, I don't think we would see the kinds of actions we have seen from \nthe White House and even from the prosecution, because the prosecution \nitself, as I said, is not being handled well. Again, maybe not by \ndesign, but just by the structure that the President--the buck stops at \nhis office--has allowed to persist, the structure being investigation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his response.\n  I have one last inquiry I would like to make and have the Senator \naddress. A lot has been focused on the individual, Valerie Plame--whom \nI never met, of course. But a lot has been focused on her as sort of an \nisolated incident, just one person, and that is it.\n  It has occurred to this Senator, as the Senator from New York has so \nplainly stated, there are more than just the uniformed soldiers in Iraq \nfighting the war on terrorism. It is all of our undercover agents, our \nCIA, our information-gathering apparatus around the world to give us \nforewarning of what is going to happen, to get access to that vital \ninformation that we need in this fight against global terrorism.\n  Can the Senator address himself to the kind of chilling effect such a \ndisclosure might have on operatives of ours in the CIA, around the \nglobe today, who may be out there? They are getting their sources of \ninformation. But what if they think at some point in the future they \ncould be outed, their name could be spread out there? What about, not \nonly them personally, but what about all their contacts? Now their \ncontacts are thinking: My gosh, if they are outed, I am outed and my \nlife is at risk.\n  Could the Senator address himself to the broader kind of effects this \nmight have on our fight on global terrorism?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Iowa for his good question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been very patient. It is not a \nquestion. It is a request to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is correct. The \nSenator may only yield time for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield for a rephrased question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator believe that such a disclosure could \nhave a chilling effect on operatives of ours in the field today and who \nin the future may be out there risking their very lives gathering \ninformation that we need on the war on terrorism? Does the Senator \nbelieve this could have a chilling effect?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to answer my colleague. I do indeed. Don't \ntake my word for it. A few minutes before my colleague came to the \nChamber, I quoted former agent Mr. Marcinkowski who said that on CNN. \nIt has been reported by the media all over the place that those who \nhave served in intelligence say exactly that--that perhaps the greatest \ndanger that has occurred here may not have been to the individual \nagent, may not have even been to the group of contacts that agent had \nwhen undercover but, rather, to the morale of the intelligence agency \nand, as importantly, to the effectiveness because agents know they can \nbe ``outed'' because they or someone they are close to says someone \nhigh up may not like it and it could well have a chilling effect.\n  My reports are that the CIA from top to bottom is just furious that \nthis happened for the very reason of my friend's question, and the \nanswer to that which I was just giving.\n  The only way to alleviate it--the only way to restore that \ncredibility--is to get to the bottom of this in a full and thorough \ninvestigation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The question is, Has the investigation been tainted so \nfar? One instance which comes to this Senator's mind is when the \nDepartment of Justice announced an official investigation but they \nwaited for days to notify the White House. I ask the Senator: Is this \nnot an indication that the investigation has already been tainted by \nthe Justice Department?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In answer to my colleague's question, I believe this \ncertainly calls into question the effectiveness of this investigation, \nperhaps the desire to get to the bottom of it, how strong that is and \nhow full that is. In a letter, which I, along with Senator Daschle, \nSenator Levin, and Senator Biden, sent to the President, we raised that \nvery question. We have not yet received an answer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  I know my friend from Alaska is eager to draw this to something of a \nclose and still allow us to have a vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield to answer my question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. For the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator's amendment, if offered, is subject to a \npoint of order. Haven't we been working on something now for 45 minutes \nwhich is not germane to this bill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In answer to my colleague--and let me say I thought \nthere was a gentlemen's agreement between leaders Frist, Daschle, the \nbill managers, yourself, and our colleague from West Virginia that if \nthe minority agreed to help complete work on this important bill by \nFriday the majority would not raise points of order against our \namendments. In fact, as I understand it, a number of amendments have\n\n[[Page S12666]]\n\nbeen allowed to be voted on where points of order might stand.\n  Also, if I might just continue the point----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In 1 minute. I want to finish the answer to the \nquestion. It was indeed a question and not an invitation for a \nstatement. I understand that.\n  But if this agreement was designed to address the fact that the House \nhasn't completed its work yet on the supplemental, it makes it \nimpossible for Senators to defend the germaneness of our amendments \nwithout the text of a House bill to which to refer. We don't know what \nis in the House bill, nor if the House bill has a provision in there \nwhich might make this germane. That is why we came to that agreement.\n  Again, I wish to underscore the fact that my colleague from Alaska \nhas honored the agreement and allowed votes on a number of amendments \nwhich clearly would be not germane. I think our side has honored the \nagreement as well, and we have tried to proceed without undue delay \nwith our own amendments. Yet now we are arguing that this amendment \nmight not be germane.\n  First, I disagree. It is utterly germane to the debate we are now \ninvolved in about supporting our troops overseas. As I mentioned, \nValerie Plame was just as much a soldier in the war on terrorism. She \nwas an expert on weapons of mass destruction, which is the casus belli \nof where we are. It is vital we get to the bottom of it.\n  I think this amendment is quite germane--more germane, in fact, than \nothers. The supplemental includes $600 million to fund further weapons \ninspections. If we are going to spend $600 million, we have to know \nthere is an honest assessment of whatever they may find or not find \nwithout fear of retaliation.\n  I understand that my colleague from Alaska has the right to object to \nthis under germaneness. But I also understand--and I ask the question \nof him: Hasn't there been an agreement to allow nongermane amendments, \nand hasn't my colleague, in keeping that agreement, allowed nongermane \namendments to be called up for a vote on the floor?\n  I yield to him for an answer.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wonder if the Senator realizes he has just yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator asked me a question. But I will not argue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New York \nwill be allowed to yield to the Senator from Alaska for the purpose of \nasking a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A gentlemen's agreement was entered into that we would \nnot raise a point of order under rule XVI for germane amendments. But \nfor those that are not germane, we made no such agreement. This is not \ngermane to this bill. Therefore, I hope the Senator will not offer it. \nAs a matter of fact, I hope he will take into account another answer \nwhich I will give to him about the question of germaneness. This matter \nis now in the counterintelligence section of the Department of Justice. \nThat section has decades of experience and has really enormous \nexperience in working on matters of this type.\n\n  It is my judgment, and I ask the Senator this question: Does he \nrealize that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution has a connotation of \nlack of confidence--no confidence--in the work of the \ncounterintelligence section, a group that has very distinguished career \npeople, and that the legislative liaison for the CIA has indicated to \nme through my staff that they are following the standard procedures of \na series of administrations in handling this matter, and both the CIA \nand the counterintelligence section believe there is no need for a \nspecial counsel at this time? Does the Senator realize that this is not \nsomething which is sought by those professionals experienced in the \narea?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for his question. He underscores my \npoint. I understand what he is saying. But we have no knowledge if the \nCounterintelligence Division is solely in charge of this investigation. \nThey have to report to the Attorney General, or to the head of the FBI, \nor to somebody else at every move they make. Have they been \ncountermanded in where they want to go? We know none of that. In fact, \nthe very statement my friend from Alaska related about his staff \ninquiry is the most information that has been publicly given about how \nthis investigation is being conducted.\n  The problem we are trying to get at here and the reason a special \ncounsel is so needed is very simple; that is, we don't know who is in \ncharge. My colleague from Alaska said, staff to staff, they say it is \ncounterintelligence.\n  May I yield to him for the purpose of a question only and then \nreclaim the floor? I ask my colleague for that permission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator from New \nYork yielding to the Senator from Alaska for the purpose of answering a \nquestion?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the President. I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n  Does my good colleague know if Mr. Dion, head of the \nCounterintelligence Division--I have nothing bad to say about him--is \nrequired to report to anybody about whom he subpoenas, whom he \nquestions, what kind of facts he is allowed to pursue, or can he do \nthis completely on his own?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, from my experience with this section--and \nI do not get involved with this section too often--it is a \ncounterintelligence section of the Department of Justice. They have \ntheir own system of investigation. It has a very broad agenda in terms \nof portfolio. They have the scope of the whole intelligence network to \nwork with.\n\n  I share the Senator's umbrage about the leak. The question is, how to \nhandle that leak. It is in the hands of the people who are trained and \nwho have in the past discovered such leaks. Who will it be reported to? \nI am sure the criminal division of the Department of Justice, if and \nwhen they find who is responsible for the leak, because it is a \nviolation of the criminal statute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for his answer. I simply say that \nin an area such as this, which is so unusual, this is not just the \ntypical leak. The counterintelligence division handles scores of leak \ncases every year. My good colleague from Alaska is correct. However, \nnone, as far as I am aware, have involved the revealing of the name of \nan agent. It is a much more serious situation. It is a crime in itself.\n  The bottom line is very simple: This is so important that we cannot \nleave to conjecture that the counterintelligence division generally \ndoes a good job so we will assume they are doing a good job here. I \nappreciate my colleague being on the floor when I spoke, but there have \nbeen a number of missteps along the way not caused by the \ncounterintelligence division but by others. This is too important to \nleave to supposition. That is why we are seeking a special counsel. We \ncannot just say they generally do a good job, we assume they will do a \ngood job on this. This is a crime, a matter of great importance. I \nwould like to go further than that. That is the purpose of this \namendment which I hope my colleague will allow us to offer and vote on, \ngiven the agreement.\n  I am happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. On what basis does the Senator say this is a unique \ncase? In my experience, I have known several leaks and several \nindividuals who were apprehended for leaks, some prosecuted, some not. \nIs it the Senator's impression this is a case of first impression?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is my impression, in answer to my colleague's \nquestion, this is a question of rare impression. The number of times \nthe name of an agent has been publicly published in the newspaper and \nleaked by somebody not on the other side but rather by somebody who is \n``a high administration official,'' I cannot think of a one. I know \nsome spies leak names. Aldridge Ames leaked names and was punished for \nit, but I don't know of a single instance where someone within the \nadministration leaked the name of an agent.\n  If it is not a first impression, it is a very rare impression, quite \ndifferent than most of the leaks we have had. That is my answer to my \ncolleague's\n\n[[Page S12667]]\n\nquestion. I don't think this is usual or typical. I pray to God it is \nnot.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendments and consider the amendment which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Reid, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Leahy, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Biden, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Edwards, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1872.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress concerning the appointment \n   of a special counsel to conduct a fair, thorough, and independent \n             investigation into a national security breach)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. XX. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF A \n                   SPECIAL COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FAIR, THOROUGH, \n                   AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO A NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY BREACH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the national security of the United States is dependent \n     on our intelligence operatives being able to operate \n     undercover and without fear of having their identities \n     disclosed;\n       (2) recent reports have indicated that administration or \n     White House officials may have deliberately leaked the \n     identity of a covert CIA agent to the media;\n       (3) the unauthorized disclosure of a covert intelligence \n     agent's identity is a Federal felony; and\n       (4) the Attorney General has the power to appoint a special \n     counsel of integrity and stature who may conduct an \n     investigation into the leak without the appearance of any \n     conflict of interest.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Attorney General of the United States should appoint a \n     special counsel of the highest integrity and stature to \n     conduct a fair, independent, and thorough investigation of \n     the leak and ensure that all individuals found to be \n     responsible for this heinous deed are punished to the fullest \n     extent permitted by law.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for yielding the floor. Now, I am \nsorry to say, I make a point of order under rule XVI that this \nlegislation on an appropriations bill is not germane.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't know if that is debatable or not. I do not want \nto lose the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not debatable. The \nSenator has raised a point of order under rule XVI. The amendment does \nnot appear to be germane and the point of order is sustained. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I still have the floor, I say to the Senator from New \nYork, I have background being a U.S. attorney and being deeply involved \nin intelligence matters now for 35 years. I share his umbrage at the \nwhole process. I will do everything I can to get to the bottom of this \nmatter, but I do not think this is the time for a special counsel. \nThere may come a time it will be required.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. You talk legal background, but you did not go to a very \ngood law school, did you?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1873\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have an amendment which is on the list which has been \nannounced, and I would like to send this amendment to the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent it be put in the appropriate place of the queue of \namendments to be considered later on this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be sent to the \ndesk, be set aside, and be scheduled at an appropriate time as agreed \nto on both sides. I would like the remaining 5 minutes before the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My parliamentary inquiry is, may I raise rule XVI at \nthis point?\n  HIV/AIDS is not germane to this bill, either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been reported.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not object to receiving the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1873.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the prevention, treatment, and control \n                     of, and research on HIV/AIDS)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. XX. (a) Global HIV/AIDS Funding.--For necessary \n     expenses to carry out the provisions of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 for the prevention, treatment, and \n     control of, and research on HIV/AIDS, in addition to funds \n     appropriated under the heading ''Global AIDS Initiative'' in \n     the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Act, 2004, $879,700,000 to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That the funds appropriated by this \n     section shall be made available in accordance with the amount \n     authorized in accordance with sections 202(d)(1) and 202 \n     (d)(4)of Public Law 108-25.\n       (b) Offset.--The total amount appropriated under title II \n     under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE--\n     FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT--Iraq Relief and \n     Reconstruction Fund'' (other than the amount appropriated for \n     Iraqi border enforcement and enhanced security communications \n     and the amount appropriated for the establishment of an Iraqi \n     national security force and Iraqi Defense Corps) shall be \n     reduced by $879,700,000.\n       (c) Notification.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall consult with, and \n     provide a written report to, the appropriate committees of \n     Congress, concerning the amount by which each sector, \n     program, and activity is reduced pursuant to subsection (b).\n       (2) Committee procedures.--The report submitted under \n     paragraph (1) shall be subject to the regular notification \n     procedures of the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President it is my understanding this is an \namendment pertaining to HIV/AIDS, and I support all activities \nconcerning that, but it is not germane to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska raises a point of \norder under rule XVI.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, may I address the point of order?\n  Mr. STEVENS. A point of order is not debatable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will entertain debate on the motion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding this $87 billion emergency \nappropriations requested by the administration includes foreign aid \nthat is going to the nation of Iraq as well as Afghanistan. What I am \nsuggesting is this item, some $800 million, in the nature of foreign \naid be sent to fight the global AIDS epidemic. It would seem it is \ngermane to the same issue before the Senate in the pending supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That would be earmarking this money for a matter that is \nnot germane for this bill. It is true that money could be used for that \npurpose, but I do not believe amendments are in order to start \nearmarking this money for items that are not germane to the bill.\n  I am raising that it is legislation on the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Chair address the question of the defense of \ngermaneness if we are not entertaining a bill first passed by the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Restate the question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could the Chair inform me as to the defense of \ngermaneness and whether it applies in this situation\n\n[[Page S12668]]\n\nwhere we are not dealing with a bill already passed by the House and a \nquestion as to whether our amendment is germane to that House-passed \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The defense of germaneness does not apply when \nthe Senate is considering a Senate bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Chair prepared to rule on the germaneness question \nraised by the Senator from Alaska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's understanding is the Senator from \nAlaska has challenged the amendment on the grounds that it is \nlegislating on appropriations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, I thought--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is that debatable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the ruling is not debatable.\n  The point of order is sustained. The Chair rules the amendment \nconstitutes legislating on an appropriations bill. The amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1818\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided on each side on the Byrd amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nByrd, Kennedy, Leahy, Boxer, Harkin, Jeffords, and Kerry.\n  The administration needs to change its course in Iraq. If the United \nStates is ever to work successfully with the international community to \nobtain the contributions of troops and money that are needed to share \nthe heavy burden of postwar Iraq, the White House must take real steps \nto share power with the United Nations.\n  The Byrd-Kennedy-Leahy amendment would push the administration to do \nmore to share power in Iraq. It would also require the President to \nsubmit reports to Congress about the participation of other countries \nin Iraq, as well as a plan for supporting American troops by bringing \nthem home.\n  The amendment gives the President $10.1 billion in reconstruction \nfunds immediately but requires another vote by Congress before the \nother $10.2 billion in reconstruction funds can be spent.\n  It is imperative that Congress review the situation in 6 months to \ndetermine whether the President's efforts at the U.N. have paid off in \nmore foreign contributions to the future of Iraq. Congress should also \nevaluate the President's plan for how to get the U.N. in, and the U.S. \nout of, Iraq. A vote in 6 months' time on whether to release the \nadditional $10.2 billion in reconstruction funding would give Congress \nthe opportunity to make a midcourse correction if our occupation of \nIraq is still going poorly.\n  The Byrd-Kennedy-Leahy amendment is a simple amendment to help \nCongress watch the people's money and to support our troops by getting \nthe international help they need.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senators to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 6 months ago, President Bush took the \ncountry to war with Iraq, without the support of key allies other than \nBritain, without the support of the international community at large. \nWe didn't need international support to win the war. We all knew that \nour brave fighting men and women would defeat Saddam Hussein's forces \neasily. But we did--and we do--need the international community to help \nus win the peace--a painfully obvious truth that this administration \nhas steadfastly refused to accept.\n  As long as Iraqis see us as occupiers rather than liberators, our \ntroops will remain at increased risk and our efforts to rebuild Iraq's \neconomy and political system will be suspect. The process of \nreconstructing Iraq and creating a new Iraqi government must be an \ninternational process--not an American process. Only then will it gain \nfull legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi people and the world.\n  The Bush administration's brazen go-it-alone policy has placed the \nburden and the bill for rebuilding Iraq almost solely on the shoulders \nof the American people. They don't deserve it, and they don't want it. \nWe need an immediate change of course.\n  For months I have been urging the administration to bring the United \nNations and the international community into the process of rebuilding \nIraq's economy and political system. The United Nations must be given a \nclearly defined, central role in the reconstruction of Iraq and in the \nprocess of establishing a new Iraqi government. U.N. Secretary General \nKofi Annan has been very clear: he will not send U.N. personnel back to \nIraq--and risk their lives--without improvements in the security \nsituation and an unambiguous U.N. role with clear lines of authority. \nIn my view, the best way to achieve this is to transfer the authority \nover reconstruction and governance to the United Nations. The United \nNations is not perfect but it has far more experience and capacity in \nthese areas than the Pentagon and the Coalition Provisional Authority. \nFinally, the Iraqi people must be assured that political power and \nresponsibility for reconstruction will be transferred to them quickly.\n  The administration's resolution, which the Security Council passed \ntoday, is long overdue. It will provide a modicum of international \nlegitimacy which is essential to our success in Iraq. And it does \nrequire that the Iraqi Governing Council lay out by December 15 of this \nyear a timetable and program for the drafting of a constitution and \nnational elections. But this resolution does not fundamentally change \nthe lines of authority and responsibility for the reconstruction and \ngovernance of Iraq. It is really more show than substance. The \nresolution will not gain meaningful international support for our \nefforts in Iraq. After months of dismissing and ridiculing the \ninternational community, the Bush administration will not gain tangible \nsupport for our efforts in Iraq--that is, boots on the ground and money \nin the coffers at this month's donor conference--as a result of this \nresolution.\n\n  In simply terms, the Security Council resolution adopted today is not \nthe triumph of diplomacy, but rather the beginning of a much-needed \nprocess to bring real international support to our effort.\n  We in the Congress have a responsibility to push the administration \nto advance the diplomatic effort and not rest content with a fig leaf \nresolution that hides what remains an American occupation in Iraq. The \namendment that Senator Byrd is offering, which I am pleased to \ncosponsor, seeks to do just that. It requires the President to certify \nthat the U.N. resolution provides tangible international contributions, \nincluding substantial troop and financial contributions from other \ncountries. In addition, it requires the administration to certify that \nreconstruction activities are being implemented in accordance with a \nnew detailed plan to be submitted to the Congress no later than March 1 \nof next year.\n  This is a good amendment. It sends a clear message to the \nadministration: You need a real, detailed plan for reconstruction Iraq \nand you need to do the hard work of diplomacy to internationalize the \nmilitary and civilian sides of the operation to reduce the risks to our \nsoldiers on the ground and take some of the financial burden off the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the amendment is an amendment that will \nrequire Congress to enact another appropriations for the balance of the \nreconstruction money. It will cap the reconstruction funds at $5 \nbillion. It puts another road block in the way of the reconstruction \nefforts.\n  I referred earlier to yesterday's editorial in the Washington Post, \nwhich said:\n\n       Paying to improve life for Iraqis will help create a safer \n     environment for U.S. troops and will hasten the day they can \n     leave. Rebuilding the electricity grid, fixing the water \n     supply, getting the oil flowing, maintaining public safety--\n     all this is central to hopes for stability and representative \n     government.\n\n  I think the loss of momentum that will come from requiring another \nbill to be enacted before we get more money for reconstruction will \ndestroy the whole concept of the plan that Ambassador Bremer is working \non.\n  I call to the attention of the Senate, I also put in a letter I \nreceived by fax from Ambassador Bremer just today reaffirming his plea \nto us to pass this bill as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\n  I do not think it is in the best interests of our troops. I do not \nthink it is in the best interests of the Iraqi people. It certainly is \nnot in the best interests of the person in charge of the whole effort, \nAmbassador Bremer, for the Byrd amendment to be approved.\n  For that reason, I move to table the Byrd amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1818.

Under the previous order, there are now 4 \nminutes equally divided on the motion to table the Lautenberg \namendment.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment to correct the situation that \ncame about as a result of Vice President Cheney's statement on ``Meet \nthe Press'' a couple of weeks ago. I wish to quickly respond to some \nthings that were said about my amendment and the Vice President's links \nto Halliburton.\n  First, Halliburton absolutely had a no-bid contract with the Army \nCorps for oil-related services in Iraq, and it has billed American \ntaxpayers $1.4 billion so far. No other company was given the \nopportunity to bid. That contract occasioned a unanimous vote, led by \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that we would not allow \nthat kind of contract to appear again. It is stated on the record by \nSenator Warner from Virginia.\n  Halliburton has other contracts that were bid, but the massive oil \nservices contract was not.\n  Second, I appreciated the reading of the Vice President's comments on \n``Meet the Press'' because even CRS agreed that deferred compensation \nand stock options held by the Vice President are, in fact, financial \ninterests in Halliburton.\n  Third, the other member of the President's Cabinet who came into \nservice after serving as CEO, John Snow, took his deferred compensation \nin a lump sum and got rid of his stock options immediately. That is the \nright thing to do when you are at the top of the executive branch with \nthe direct ability to affect billions of dollars in contracts.\n  I urge my colleagues to attach some ethical guidelines to the Iraq \nreconstruction funds. I urge my colleagues to think it through and send \na picture out to the American public that says: No, no one is on the \ninside enough that they can influence what happened and profit from a \nposition that takes us through the reconstruction of Iraq after the \nwar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who speaks in \nopposition?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, in 2 minutes it is hard \nto respond the way the Vice President deserves to be defended. I tell \nevery Member this: I am preparing a memo on the statement on ``Meet the \nPress'' with the Vice President, his relationship with Halliburton, his \nfinancial disclosure form, what he did in 1998, what he did in 2000, \nand what he did in 2002.\n  Vote however you like. I am going to join sides with most of my \nDemocratic friends in a minute and oppose the Vice President and the \nPresident on something very important to them. This amendment is \npolitical slander. This amendment has as its basis untruth and is \nfactually incorrect. In 1998, the Vice President chose a deferred \ncompensation package that was irrevocable. He couldn't change his mind. \nHe insured that package with a private insurance policy because the \nOffice of Government Ethics told him that is what everybody does, and \nhe was exempt from going to the Office of Government Ethics.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to introduce the Vice President's \nfinancial disclosure form. He went above and beyond the call of duty. \nHe has no financial interest in Halliburton. You are trying to accuse \nhim of being a liar. Your facts are wrong. This is manipulation. This \nis politics at its worse. Please, look at what you are doing before you \nvote here. The Vice President doesn't deserve this, and I am going to \nsend you a memo with what I believe to be the true facts, and we are \ngoing to get to the bottom of this.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Ethics \nCommittee, I take seriously any action which raises questions about the \nintegrity of the Federal Government. I believe firmly that the Federal \ncontracting process in Iraq and elsewhere should be transparent and \naccountable to ensure Federal tax dollars are spent appropriately. Like \nmany of my constituents, I question the circumstances under which \nHalliburton was awarded a contract in Iraq in a process that did not \ninclude soliciting competitive bids from other companies. I believe all \naspects of that transaction should be carefully examined and open to \npublic inspection.\n  While I sympathize with the proponents of the Lautenberg amendment, I \ndo not believe a punitive, absolute statutory prohibition is the \ncorrect approach under the circumstances. Instead, I support efforts to \nensure Federal contracts in Iraq are awarded through a process that is \nsubject to rigorous Congressional oversight and that applies strict \npenalties for any unethical or illegal conduct that is uncovered. \nAdditionally, I believe contracts should be awarded through full and \nfair competition.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I am ethically bound to conduct my official duties \nin a manner that avoids even the appearance of impropriety. I fully \nintend to honor that commitment to my country and my constituents. I \nalso intend to hold the Bush administration to the same standard.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is a very curious amendment. It tries \nto take a stealth approach to the matter, but in fact, its real purpose \nis pretty obvious. I don't think anyone will be fooled by it because we \nall know who it is directed against.\n  Back in my home State of Wyoming, a lot of people who know Dick \nCheney will be surprised to see the Senate using its valuable time in \nwhat some might see as a witch hunt against the\n\n[[Page S12672]]\n\nPresident and Vice President. It's a curious time for such an \nactivity--even if Halloween is rapidly approaching.\n  Now, I'm not standing here to defend the Vice President because he is \nfrom Wyoming. I'm not even defending him because he's a fisherman \neither--though to accept this amendment at face value you have to \nswallow hook, line and sinker some pretty misleading information.\n  In fact, I can tell you, because I've fished with him, that although \nfishermen sometimes have an unjust and unfair reputation for telling \nstories, the only thing fishy about this whole affair is the text of \nthis amendment.\n  First of all, the amendment should be withdrawn because the vice \nPresident has gone out of his way to explain his ties to his old \ncompany and what they mean to him financially. No matter what happens \nin the months to come, nothing will benefit him personally. Still, we \nhave some Members who aren't quite satisfied.\n  Right now a couple of us Senators have blind trusts. It's an \ninteresting thing that this amendment takes such a strong stand against \na Vice President who took the same ethical approach to this issue that \nI did.\n  This whole situation points out the need for a national energy \npolicy. Halliburton has come under attack because there were \nfluctuations in oil and gas prices that forced some mega mergers to \noccur to keep the energy companies competitive. As a result, there were \nonly a few companies that could provide the service that was needed on \nsuch short notice. Still, that isn't a good enough explanation for \nsome.\n  Even if we ignore that piece of the puzzle, however, the important \nthing to note is the Vice President's decision to donate to charity the \nafter-tax proceeds he would receive from the exercise of his \nHallliburton stock options. In other words, even if his options were to \nincrease in value as a result of anything that happened during this \ntime, he still wouldn't receive anything from it.\n  Who would? you might ask.\n  According to the Vice President's signed agreement from January 28, \n2001, there are three charities named. They are the Capital Partners \nfor Education, the George Washington University Medical Facility \nAssociates and the University of Wyoming.\n  I believe it is clear that there is no basis for the allegations or \nconcerns that led to the production of this amendment and it clearly \nshould be withdrawn. It goes against the grain of fairness, it can only \nbe defended by misrepresenting the facts on the Vice President's \nfinancial interests, and it can't be seen as anything but an unfair \ncommentary on the Vice President's and the President's commitment to \nethics.\n  No serious-minded individual who belongs to any political party, \nreally believes this amendment is necessary or needed. It must be \nwithdrawn and an apology extended to both the Vice President and the \nPresident for its promotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has all time expired on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic time has expired. There are 30 \nseconds remaining to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. I advise everyone, this next vote is a 10-minute vote. The \nprior vote was a 15-minute vote and went about 27, 28 minutes. I hope \nwe can have the 10-minute vote in maybe 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point is well taken.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, do I have 30 seconds?\n  If you wonder what he did with the stock options, he assigned them \nall to charities. Look at the facts before you vote because the facts \ndo not sustain these allegations. The allegations are off base. I \npromise you, I will send you a memo. Please look before you vote. I \nmove to table.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has already been made. The \nyeas and nays have already been ordered.

Mr. President, I have been carefully listening to this \ndebate for weeks, and I have tried to keep an open mind to the \nopposition's arguments--insofar as those arguments have been \nsubstantive.\n  I have been dismayed by the deliberate manipulation of statements and \narguments that have been made by members of the other party, such as:\n  Denunciations of the President over the fact that weapons of mass \ndestruction have not been discovered to date, despite the fact that \nreports issued as late as last week indicate the fact that reports \nissued as late as last week indicate that Saddam had clandestine plans \nand activities for systems proscribed by the international community \nunder international law. False assertions that the President claimed an \nimminent threat on the eve of this decision to remove Saddam Hussein \nfrom power, when in fact the President stated in his State of the \nUnion:\n\n       Some have said we must not act until the threat is \n     imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced \n     their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they \n     strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly \n     emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would \n     come to late.\n\n  Some of this rhetoric, we must, regrettably, accept as the level of \ndebate that now occurs. But nothing offends me more than suggestions \nthat members of this administration, particularly my dear friend, the \nVice President, have venal motivations attached to the policy decisions \nthey support.\n  Dick Cheney is an older friend of mine. He has sacrificed for his \ncountry most of his life. He does so today. When the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee responds to the amendment by the Senator from \nNew Jersey by calling it a slur, I have to agree. Dick Cheney has not \nbenefitted from this war, and I find it a profound calumniation that \nanyone would imply that.\n  I ask my colleagues that we return to a dignified level of debate, \nwhere we try to advance, improve on the grave issues of war and peace \nbefore us.\n  I beg my colleagues that we desist from the politics of imputing \nvenality on those who are serving the public trust.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will send up an amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield without losing his \nright to the floor? For the information of Senators, Senator Inouye is \nhere. He is waiting. He has to make a statement. And Senator McConnell \nhas the floor now for his amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nMcConnell amendment, the Senator from Hawaii have 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from \nConnecticut and I wanted to enter into a very short colloquy about an \nunrelated matter. Therefore, if it would be all right with the \nchairman, I ask to amend the consent to allow for a brief colloquy \nbetween Senator Dodd and myself on an entirely different matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection. Just, when Senator McConnell yields \nthe floor, that Senator Inouye get the floor. I did commit we would set \naside some time for him to make a statement. He has not made a \nstatement on the bill yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1874\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1874.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SHORT TITLE.\n\n       SEC.   . (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) That on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure and the \n     capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda;\n       (2) That on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused \n     the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     and the capture of significant international terrorists.\n       (3) That success in those two campaigns in the Global War \n     on Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and their coalition partners;\n       (4) That throughout the proud military history of our \n     nation, we have recognized our brave men and women of the \n     Armed Forces by awarding them service medals for personal \n     bravery and other leadership actions and for their service in \n     military operations abroad and for support operations at home \n     and abroad;\n       (5) That historically the President has relied on senior \n     military officers to recommend the personal and theater \n     campaign medals and that, in keeping with these longstanding \n     traditions, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant \n     commanders, including General Tommy Franks, U.S. Army, former \n     Commander of the United States Central Command, recommended \n     the awards described below in recognition of the worldwide \n     nature of the current conflict;\n       (6) That following the advice of his senior military and \n     civilian defense leaders, President Bush, by Executive Order \n     13289 on March 12, 2003, established the Global War on \n     Terrorism Expeditionary Medal to be awarded to service \n     members who serve in military operations to combat terrorism \n     on or after September 11, 2001, including, but not limited to \n     actions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, in such locations as Afghanistan, Iraq, the Republic \n     of the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southwest Asia, in \n     recognition of the sacrifice and contributions military \n     members make in the global war on terrorism;\n       (7) That eligibility for the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal is predicated on deployment abroad for 30 \n     days or more in support of Global War on Terrorism operations \n     on or after September 11, 2001;\n       (8) That by the same Executive Order, the President \n     established the Global War on Terrorism Service Medical \n     recognizing duty in Operation Noble Eagle and the homeland \n     defense mission against further terrorist attacks, and which \n     recognizes duty in support of military operations performed \n     in areas that do not qualify for the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal; and\n       (9) That implementing regulations for eligibility have not \n     been issued by the Secretary of Defense.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on the Award of Campaign Medal.--It \n     is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should, on an expedited basis, issue the necessary \n     regulations to implement these awards and ensure that any \n     person who renders qualifying service with the Armed Forces \n     in those phases of the Global War on Terrorism including \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and \n     Operation Noble Eagle should promptly receive these awards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12673-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12673-S12725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HELP AMERICA TO VOTE ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut and I \nwanted to address the Senate just for a few moments on another matter. \nI yield the floor and suggest the recognition of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Very briefly, I had intended to offer an amendment at an appropriate \ntime, most reluctantly, because it is unrelated to the subject matter \nat hand. But all my colleagues can relate to this frustration from time \nto time. When there is something you want to get done and you have few \nopportunities to get it done, you pick any vehicle coming along which \nmight help you get it done. Recognizing that this was going to be one \nof the last funding measures to move along this year, I had intended at \nthe appropriate time to offer an amendment that would have provided \nadditional resources for the Help America Vote Act, on which my friend \nfrom Kentucky and Senator Bond and many others played a very critical \nrole almost a year ago when it became the law of the Nation. In fact, \nOctober 29, 2003, will mark the 1-year anniversary of the day the \nPresident signed the legislation into law.\n  I am hopeful we can get the level of funding up to full in a timely \nmanner. As all my colleagues must know, almost every Secretary of \nState, local election official, and legislative officer around the \ncountry are anxious for Congress to meet our obligations. The states \ncan then get their election administration and technology up and \nrunning in the years 2004-2006 in a way that will be in compliance with \nthe efforts made to pass the Help America Vote Act in the first place.\n  But my colleague from Kentucky, as he has done on numerous occasions, \nhas persuaded me there may be a better opportunity and a better place \nto get this job done. So I wanted to take a moment out to express my \nappreciation. I thank him for his willingness to help me try to achieve \nthese results in the coming weeks if at all possible.\n  To reiterate, I was prepared to offer an amendment to fully fund the \nHelp America Vote Act, HAVA. Senators Corzine, Johnson, and Durbin had \nasked to cosponsor that amendment.\n  Why? Because now is the time to make our rhetoric a reality to live \nup to our promise of just 1 year ago to fully fund the new Federal \nrequirements we imposed on the States for conducting Federal elections.\n  The President has recognized that Iraq and Afghanistan have many \nemergency needs, including the ability of those nations to establish \ndemocracies by conducting free and fair elections.\n  As a result, the administration request for the fiscal year 2004 \nSupplemental Appropriations for Iraq, Afghanistan and the Global War on \nTerrorism earmarked at least $35 million for voter registration and \nelections in Afghanistan.\n  I accept that priority. All countries must have the resources to \nestablish and maintain their democracies and to administer and conduct \nelections for their citizens. The voice of the people, exercised at the \npolls, secures the future of any democracy, whether abroad or at home. \nAnd while I remain unconvinced that all of the funding in this bill is \ntruly an emergency--such as for $3,000 computers or $50,000 dump \ntrucks--when it comes to election funding, I will agree with the \nPresident. Funding to ensure the system by which a nation establishes \nand preserves a democracy is an emergency.\n  But if it is an emergency in Afghanistan, it can be no less of an \nemergency in America. The basic premise of a democracy is that every \ncitizen must have an equal voice in the determination of its \ngovernment. In this Nation, that voice is expressed through the equal \nopportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted. If America is to \nbe the example for emerging democracies, whether in Afghanistan, or \nIraq or any other part of the world, then our system of giving our \ncitizens an equal voice--our system of elections--must meet this test.\n  But what we learned in the elections of 2000 was that not all \nAmerican citizens enjoyed an equal voice. In fact,\n\n[[Page S12674]]\n\nsome citizens were denied a voice at all because of malfunctioning or \noutdated voting equipment, inaccurate and incomplete voter registration \nrecords, and allegations of voter intimidation and fraud.\n  A bipartisan group of members came together last Congress to change \nthat and on October 29--almost exactly 1 year ago--President Bush \nsigned into law the Help America Vote Act. At the signing ceremony at \nthe White House, the President proclaimed:\n\n     [w]hen problems arise in the administration of elections, we \n     have a responsibility to fix them.\n\n  But rhetoric alone will not fix the problems. It will take leadership \nand funds, and that is what the Help America Vote Act provides--Federal \nleadership in the form of new minimum requirements that all States must \nmeet in the conduct of Federal elections and $3.8 billion to fund the \nimplementation of these requirements.\n  Some of these requirements must be in place in time for the Federal \nelections next year. But Congress has failed to provide the funds to \nthe States to finance them.\n  All 50 States have begun the process of drafting the required State \nplans outlining how Federal funds will be used to meet the \nrequirements. Many of the States have begun implementation of the new \nrequirements; but, they require full funding of the promised Federal \nfunds to complete implementation of some requirements by next year and \nhave compliant voting equipment in place by the 2006 Federal elections.\n  Federal funding is the most critical key to nationwide implementation \nof this Act and may well govern the success and effectiveness of the \nnew law.\n  Federal funding is crucial. Since the States are in key planning and \nimplementation stages of HAVA, they are relying on Federal funds to \nmake election reform a reality nationwide.\n  To help pay for election reforms and avoid an unfunded mandate on the \nStates, HAVA authorizes a total of $3.9 billion over 3 fiscal years: \n$2.16 billion in fiscal year 2003; $1.04 billion in fiscal year 2004; \nand $660,000 in fiscal year 2005.\n  But in fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated only $1.5 billion. Of \nthat amount, $650 million has been distributed to all 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and \nAmerican Samoa.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support during the fiscal year 2003 \nappropriations process. In particular, I thank my two lead co-sponsors \nof HAVA and both major players in the appropriations process--Senator \nMcConnell who was lead co-sponsor of election reform and Senator Bond \nwho also co-sponsored HAVA and championed the anti-fraud provisions. I \nalso thank Senator Stevens, chair of the Appropriations Committee and \nSenator Byrd, ranking member on Appropriations.\n  But the fact is, the fiscal year 2003 appropriation reflects a \nreality starkly different from our promise. As a result, the States \nhave experienced a shortfall of over $660 million in the first critical \nyear of funding under HAVA. Given the dire financial budget constraints \nfaced by our States and counties, the shortfall in promised Federal \nsupport creates an unfunded mandate that is both unfair and \nunnecessary.\n  While the fiscal year 2004 Transportation, Treasury appropriations \nbill has not been completed in the Senate, I note that both the \nPresident and Congress has earmarked a mere $500 million for HAVA, a \nfunding level that is half of what was authorized and is both \ninadequate and unacceptable.\n  According to the National Governors Association, the current \nfinancial health of State and local governments was at its lowest point \nsince World War II last year and has worsened in the past 10 months.\n  Full Federal funding for HAVA is crucial to ensuring that the reforms \nthat Congress overwhelmingly approved, on a broad bipartisan basis, and \nthe President endorsed with his signature, are implemented. The very \nintegrity of our elections, and consequently our democracy, hangs in \nthe balance.\n  Surely, it cannot be argued that building ``taj mahal'' Iraqi prisons \nand market centers for the private sector in Afghanistan are more of an \nemergency than securing democracy in America.\n  We can do both. We must do both. But it is unacceptable to chose the \nreconstruction needs of Iraq and Afghanistan over the needs of our own \ndemocracy.\n  Full funding of HAVA is critical to our national credibility for \nfairness and accuracy in Federal elections. It is fundamental to the \nintegrity of our democratic process.\n  The problem of Federal funding for HAVA can be solved by Congress \ntoday, now. The problem of Federal funding for HAVA can be solved right \nhere in the context of the fiscal year 2004 Supplemental bill that we \ndebate today.\n  I seek bipartisan support from my colleagues to help me strengthen \ndemocracy both abroad and at home--the same bipartisan support that \nlead 98 members of this Senate and 357 Members of the House to pass \nHAVA just 1 year ago; the same bipartisan support, and need, that \nencouraged President Bush to sign this legislation into law.\n  In order to make election reform a reality, and to live up to the \npromise we made to State and local officials to be a full partner in \nFederal elections, I intend to offer an amendment to this measure which \nwill provide full funding for HAVA in an amount of $1.86 billion. This \namount reflects the total authorization for the Federal partnership.\n  This effort is overwhelmingly supported by a bipartisan and powerful \ncoalition of State and local election officials, in conjunction with \nall the major civil rights, disability, language minority, and other \nvoter interest groups in the United States.\n  I thank each and every one of them for their strong support in \npassing HAVA and their continuing commitment to see that Congress makes \ngood on its promise to be a full partner in Federal elections by fully \nfunding the provisions of HAVA.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter by the \ncoalition, entitled ``Democracy Begins At Home: Fully Fund the Help \nAmerica Vote Act.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Any effort to fully fund HAVA is as much of an emergency as \nthe needs presented in the bill before us for Iraq and Afghanistan and \nI am prepared to ask the Senate to support full funding of HAVA on the \nsame emergency basis.\n  However, there are sufficient funds in the reconstruction portion of \nthis bill which are of questionable emergency status that can be used \nto offset the entire cost of fully funding election reform. For \nexample, $450 million from the public safety, national security and \njustice sector of this bill, including, $400 million in funds to \nconstruct 2 maximum security prisons of 4000 beds each at a cost of \n$50,000 per prison bed; and $50 million for witness protection at a \ncost of $1 million per Iraqi family.\n  There is $1.02 billion from the electrical sector, including $1 \nbillion for the development and construct of thermal power stations--\nwhich are more expensive than other forms of power generation and will \ntake up to 3 years to construct; and $20 million for embedded \nconsultants, building repairs and a master plan for the Iraqi \nElectricity Commission.\n  There is $37 million from the public works section, including funds \nfor waste management that would pay for a portion of the proposed 2,000 \ndump trucks, at a cost of $50,000 per truck.\n  There is $353 million from the private sector development funds, \nincluding $200 million for an American-Iraq Enterprise Fund to be run \nby a private board of directors; $85 million for 5000 computers at a \ncost of $3000 per computer and basic and specialized computer training \nand teaching English as a second language to Iraqis; $25 million to \nmodernize equipment and curriculum in vocational institutes; and $43 \nmillion subsidy to private employers for on the job training of new \nemployees and the improvement of employment centers.\n  I close with a quote from the Coalition's letter:\n\n       No Civil Right Is More Fundamental to America's Democracy \n     than the Right to Vote. As Our Nation Spends Billions of \n     Dollars Helping to Promote Democracies Abroad, Congress \n     Simply Should Not Allow Doubts about the Legitimacy of Our \n     Electoral Process to Continue to Linger Here at Home.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to fulfill our commitment of last year to ensure \nthe integrity of our Federal elections and\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\nthe very foundation of our democracy by fully funding the Help America \nVote Act.\n  I commend Senator McConnell for his commitment to securing additional \nfunds this year, and so I will withhold offering my amendment at this \ntime.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Democracy Begins at Home--Fully Fund the ``Help America Vote Act''\n\n                                               September 29, 2003.\n       Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned organizations, \n     urge you to ensure that full funding for the Help America \n     Vote Act (P.L. 107-252) (``HAVA'') is included in the \n     upcoming supplemental appropriations for reconstruction \n     efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As you know, the Bush \n     administration has requested that Congress provide $21.4 \n     billion for these reconstruction efforts. We ask that \n     Congress provide, at the same time, a mere fraction of that \n     amount for the purpose of strengthening our own democracy \n     here at home.\n       The Help America Vote Act was enacted with overwhelmingly \n     bipartisan support in order to prevent the many problems of \n     the 2000 election from ever happening again. Among its many \n     reforms, it places significant mandates upon states and \n     localities to replace outdated voting equipment, create \n     statewide voter registration lists and provide provisional \n     ballots to ensure that eligible voters are not turned away, \n     and make it easier for people with disabilities to cast \n     private, independent ballots.\n       To help pay for these reforms, HAVA authorizes a total of \n     $3.9 billion over three fiscal years, including $2.16 billion \n     for FY03 and $1.045 billion for FY04. To date, however, the \n     actual funding of HAVA has been woefully inadequate. So far, \n     only $1.5 billion of FY03 funding has been appropriated, and \n     $830 million of that amount has yet to reach the states \n     because the President has not nominated and the Senate has \n     not confirmed the members of the new Election Assistance \n     Commission. Additionally, only $500 million is currently \n     included in pending FY04 appropriations; once again, this is \n     a sum that falls well below what is needed for successful \n     implementation of HAVA. States and localities were assured by \n     Congress that this new law would not evolve into a set of \n     unfunded federal mandates. It is now time for Congress to \n     honor its commitment to the states and to the American public \n     at large.\n       Given the difficult fiscal circumstances facing state and \n     local governments, immediate and full funding of HAVA is now \n     needed in order to make essential progress before Election \n     Day in 2004. Without the strong leadership that HAVA promised \n     at the federal level, states and local governments simply do \n     not have the ability to complete implementation of the \n     important reforms that they are now required to make.\n       No civil right is more fundamental to America's democracy \n     than the right to vote. As our nation spends billions of \n     dollars helping to promote democracies abroad, Congress \n     simply should not allow doubts about the legitimacy of our \n     electoral processes to continue to linger here at home.\n       We thank you for your support of funding for the ``Help \n     America Vote Act,'' and we look forward to working with you \n     on this critical issue.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say to my friend from Connecticut that was a \ngrand quest on which we were mutually engaged over a year ago to enact \nnew election reform legislation, a major piece of civil rights \nlegislation, along with Senator Bond and others. Both of us are \ncommitted to getting it fully funded and both of us agree the current \nsupplemental appropriations is not the place to do it. But we are \ncommitted to trying to achieve that, and to achieve it soon, and at a \nmore appropriate time.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for not offering the amendment \non this measure and pledge to work with him to achieve the goal we both \ndesire.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky. I thank \nSenator Reid as well, the minority whip, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nInouye for interrupting his prepared statement. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I stepped off the floor. Just so I \nunderstand, it is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii, the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense, is going to speak for approximately 20 minutes. Senator \nStevens indicated to me that there were two or three amendments on the \nmajority side that they want to offer, and we have offered several \namendments this morning. They wanted to, in effect, catch up. We want \nto reciprocate with amendments. Following that, we will offer an \namendment. I don't know how many amendments the Senator from Alaska \nwants his side to offer prior to going back to our side. If we just had \nsome idea so we can have our folks lined up here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I had an \namendment with Senator Durbin. Are we ready for that amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to talk to the Senator off camera, so to \nspeak. But we have a plan, if the Senator will approve. I will talk off \ncamera momentarily.\n  Could Senator Stevens give us an idea of how long the work on your \nside is going to take so we can have an amendment lined up after that?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I really can't tell how long it is going \nto be. We haven't put any time limit on amendments today. I won't do it \non this side. They wouldn't take them on the other side. There will be \nno time limit on these amendments: Senator Hollings has an amendment, \nSenator Hutchison has an amendment, and Senator Warner has an \namendment. I think there is an amendment on the list for Senator \nNickles. There are a series of Senators on this side who still have \namendments that could be raised.\n  My understanding is that once we have measured about the same number \nof amendments presented by the other side so far today we would come \nback to our side of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing I would say is that everyone knows we have a \nlot more amendments than the other side. We have at this time I think \nstill 29 or 30 amendments. It doesn't seem fair,\n\n[[Page S12676]]\n\nfor lack of a better word, that the majority is going to get rid of \nbasically all of their amendments leaving us with all of ours when we \nstill have to finish this bill tomorrow. That is looking more remote \nall the time. I don't see how in the world we can do that under the \nguidelines. I apologize to my friend from Alaska for not being able to \nget a time agreement on one of the amendments. That is the only one. On \nthe rest of them, we worked out time agreements.\n  I think, again for lack of a better word, in basic fairness we should \nhave some idea about how long it is going to take on the other side \nuntil we are ready with amendments over here. Otherwise, I would have \nno alternative but just say go ahead with regular order and start \noffering the amendments that are already pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that may be the alternative because I \nhave tried all day to speed up that side in terms of consideration of \namendments--all day long now. I started at 11 o'clock this morning. We \nhave just finished handling five amendments on that side of the aisle. \nWe haven't had one from this side of the aisle yet. I don't think it is \nbeyond fair to say Senators who notified me they want to bring up their \namendments that it is time for us to bring up amendments on this side. \nWe couldn't get any agreement on time over there. I don't know of any \nreason why we should have time agreements over here.\n  If the Senator wants to proceed with regular order, I am all for it. \nThere are 16 amendments. We will be on those until midnight. Some of \nthem may not be called up at all. But we can call them up, if the other \nside wants to do that.\n  I believe, in balance and fairness, we have been compelled to be \nbalanced on this side now for 5 hours. I think we are now going to be \non this side for about 4 or 5 hours.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, everyone here should know that this bill \nwill not be finished tomorrow. Understand that it will not be finished \ntomorrow. If it is going to be 4 or 5 hours on amendments on the \nmajority side when they have just a few amendments, this bill will not \nbe finished tomorrow, period. Take however long they want. We have done \neverything to cooperate. There was one amendment that we didn't get a \ntime agreement on, but we still finished that in a reasonable period of \ntime.\n  I have the greatest affection, respect, and admiration for the \ndistinguished manager of this bill. But to take 4 or 5 hours, that is 9 \no'clock. To think we can finish this bill tomorrow is hallucinating. We \ncan't do that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I remember my good friend from Nevada \nsaying just let things work out this morning at 11 o'clock when I tried \nto get the time; let things work out.\n  I don't know how long these amendments are going to take. I haven't \nseen them, either. I didn't see the ones either from that side this \nmorning. You can't tell how long an amendment is going to take until \nyou look at it and read it.\n  As a practical matter, I am asking the Senator from Nevada to do on \ntheir side exactly what we had to this morning--take the assurance that \nwe are going to move as quickly as we can and turn to some of the \namendments on this side for a while.\n\n  Mr. REID. There is a basic difference. If I may say, there are some \npeople over here who really don't care much about this bill ever \npassing. That is the way the Senate is.\n  Senator Daschle has used his good office because of a gentlemen's \nagreement that he had with the manager of the bill and Senator Frist to \nmove this along as quickly as possible. We are trying to do that. It is \nno one's fault, but one of the Senators had a medical problem that held \nus up for several hours before we were scheduled to vote. It seems \nthere is always some problem here.\n  We have tried as much as we can to be responsible in our ability to \nmove this bill.\n  Four or five hours--I just repeat, we can't finish this bill \ntomorrow. Everyone should understand that. That isn't done with any \nanimosity. It just can't be done.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct in terms of the \nprocess. We still have a lot more than six amendments. We have a whole \nlist of amendments, depending on what amendments are raised on that \nside. All I am asking for is balance and fairness in terms of what we \nallowed the other side to do in handling their amendments until now. If \nthat means we have to go to regular order, I am prepared to call for \nregular order. If that is the case, I am saddened to hear my friend \nfrom Nevada say a gentlemen's agreement was made on the basis that the \nDemocratic side of the aisle is allowed to call up amendments whenever \nthey want and for how long they want but they want time agreements and \nassurances on our side. That isn't the agreement we made. That is not \nthe gentlemen's agreement which I understand we made.\n  If the gentlemen's agreement is broken and we do not finish by \ntomorrow, we should know that right now. If that is the case, then I \ncan assure the Senate that we will be back in session Saturday and we \nwill be here Sunday. We are going to finish this bill this week. That \nword I took as a word of a Senator. All leadership agreed that we would \nfinish this bill tomorrow to the best of our ability. I am still \nrelying on that word.\n  Mr. President, I suggest we proceed with Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the current \nsituation in Iraq and the growing concern that many of my colleagues \nhave expressed regarding our policies in this most volatile and \ndangerous region of the world.\n  Last October, I was one of 23 Members of this Senate who voted \nagainst a resolution to authorize the war in Iraq. Voting on a \nresolution to send our young men and women to war is one of the most \ndifficult issues any politician has to face.\n  I voted against going to war for five main reasons.\n  First and foremost, I did not believe the administration had made a \ncompelling case that attacking Iraq was in our vital national interest.\n  Second, I was not convinced that the classified information presented \nto the Senate offered conclusive evidence that Saddam Hussein provided \na threat to the American people or that he would use weapons of mass \ndestruction if he possessed them.\n  Third, I was not convinced that his regime was aligned with al-Qaida \nterrorists or was in any way involved with the September 11 attack on \nthe United States.\n  Fourth, I did not see that the administration had presented a well-\nthought-out plan for dealing with postwar Iraq.\n  Finally, I believed that attacking Iraq when many of our closest \nallies and virtually all of the Nations in the region were opposed to \nit would cast the United States as the aggressor in this conflict and \ndeal a terrible blow to our international reputation and prestige.\n  I was convinced that going to war under these circumstances would \nalmost certainly sacrifice the almost near universal support and good \nwill this Nation had gained following the terrorist attacks in New York \nand Washington. I regret today I still have many of the same concerns \nabout the policy.\n  Having said that, the majority of my colleagues disagreed with me, \nand Congress approved an attack on Iraq. I know this is not to second-\nguess but only because it sets the stage for where we are today. The \nquestion for the Senate is what should the Congress do at this point? \nOur principal responsibility as Senators is to protect the people of \nthis great Nation. Particularly, it is my belief we must fight for \nthose who defend us. I have often said less than 1 percent of our \npopulation protects all the rest of us by wearing our Nation's uniform. \nI will say once again, I strongly believe it is our sacred duty to \nserve them. We simply must support the men and women willing to serve \nin harm's way.\n  Our forces fought gallantly in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Our military \nstrategy proved to be effective in war even if the rationale for war \nand postwar strategy can be questioned. Our forces proved once again \nthat they are the most effective fighting force in the world.\n  Today, more than 125,000 U.S. military personnel remain in Iraq. \nWhile\n\n[[Page S12677]]\n\nall of us would like to know how long they will stay and how long they \nwill be needed, I am confident each and every one of my colleagues \nagree they deserve our support. To guarantee the support, we must \nensure that we provide sufficient funding for our forces to be equipped \nand ready to meet the challenges they face in Iraq.\n  Many in this body question the administration's policy. They want to \ncriticize the war because we have not yet found weapons of mass \ndestruction. Our debate should not be focused on whether Saddam had \nweapons of mass destruction. Regardless of how we came to be in Iraq, I \nask my colleagues what do we want to do now? Should we punish the \nadministration for putting us in this position? I would only say in \nseeking to mete out punishment on those political leaders with whom we \nmight disagree, we will most likely only punish our sons and daughters \nwho have volunteered to risk their lives. That we cannot let happen.\n  The question we must ask at this moment is, How should we proceed? \nThe cost of the ongoing war on terrorism is staggering. As has been \nmentioned often in the Senate, $87 billion is an enormous amount of \nmoney. Since September 11, the Congress has approved the supplemental \ndefense funding in excess of $100 billion in response to the terrorist \nattacks on our Nation and for the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nMoreover, because of these costs, coupled with the impact of large tax \ncuts, we no longer are running a surplus. Instead, we have a deficit \nestimated to exceed $500 billion.\n\n  I understand my colleagues' frustration and understand why they \ndemand better accountability. In seeking solutions, they have argued we \nshould not have to pay for the reconstruction of Iraq. They want Iraq \nto use its oil reserves to pay for its own infrastructure. I am all for \nIraq paying as much as it can to rebuild its country, but \nrealistically, it is not in any position today to do much of that.\n  So should we wait? I would argue no. Our sons and daughters are in \nIraq and the conditions are not good. The infrastructure to support our \nmilitary and Ambassador Bremer and his staff is not conducive to \ngetting Iraq back on its feet. We cannot turn our backs on our men and \nwomen serving in that theater because we disagree with this war. But \neven more important, we want our forces to come home as soon as \npossible.\n  I can assure my colleagues of one thing: Our forces will be in Iraq a \nlot longer if we refuse to make the investment in that country's \ninfrastructure.\n  Three weeks ago, Hurricane Isabel caused widespread power outage in \nthe Washington, DC, area. For several days, many were without power and \nwe complained. Let me say to my colleagues that was a minor \ninconvenience compared to what our forces face in Iraq. I know we were \nall grateful when we finally saw the Pepco truck in our neighborhoods. \nIt was a real boost to our morale.\n  I can assure you our troops in Iraq are the strongest supporters of \nus putting up $20 billion to help get Iraq reconstruction started. For \nthem, getting this money will be like seeing the Pepco truck finally \nenter their neighborhood.\n  This funding is not charity. The fastest way for us to get our sons \nand daughters home is to get Iraq back up and running. Congress \napproved this war, the Congress agreed it was worth the cost to rid the \ninternational community of Saddam Hussein. In reviewing this request, \nit is not a question of whether Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. \nIt is not really relevant if Saddam was or was not linked to Osama bin \nLaden. It is not a question of whether this war was right or wrong for \nour country. Those issues will be debated next year as the country \ndetermines its next President and its next Congress. It does not matter \nhow we voted last October. This October it is our responsibility to \nsupport the men and women in the military who are doing what we \nrequired of them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the supplemental request to support \nour military forces to help end this conflict quickly and do all we can \nto get our sons and daughters home sooner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1874\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we turn to discussion of the amendment \ncurrently pending before the Senate.\n  Today, we call on the Department of Defense to finalize regulations \nthat will ensure that the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the medal that \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff picked and that the President has authorized \nfor military operations, will be awarded on an expedited basis to the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces of our country who serve in the \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  Recently, on this bill we dealt with an amendment that would have \ncreated a congressionally mandated medal when a medal already \nauthorized by the President and recommended by the military was already \nin the works and awaiting final approval of the necessary regulations. \nThat medal awaiting final approval is the Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal. It can be awarded to all who serve in Operation \nEnduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n  Our victories in the global war on terrorism would not have been \npossible without the dedication, the courage, and the service of the \nmembers of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners.\n  It is entirely appropriate that we recognize these brave men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces by awarding them service medals for personal \nbravery and other leadership actions and for their service in military \noperations abroad and for support operations at home and support \noperations overseas.\n  But the fact is, historically, the President has relied on senior \nmilitary officers to recommend the personal and theater campaign \nmedals.\n  Here, with the Global War on Terrorism Medal, that longstanding \ntradition was preserved with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \ncombatant commanders, including GEN Tommy Franks, U.S. Army, former \nCommander of the U.S. Central Command, recommending the medal to be \nawarded.\n  Taking the advice of his senior military and civilian defense \nleaders, President Bush, by Executive Order 13289, on March 12 of this \nyear, established the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal to be \nawarded to service members who served in military operations to combat \nterrorism on or after September 11, 2001, including, but not limited \nto, actions in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, \nin such locations as Afghanistan, Iraq, the Republic of the \nPhilippines, and elsewhere in Southwest Asia.\n  Now, that Executive Order by the President went beyond our men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces and much further than the recent, other medal \namendment would have. It also established a Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, recognizing duty in Operation Noble Eagle and the \nhomeland defense mission against further terrorist attacks and \nrecognizing duty in support of military operations performed in areas \nthat do not qualify for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary \nMedal.\n  We all know of the fine work that is going on to preserve our \nhomeland security. We know of the efforts to guard our borders, hunt \ndown terrorists, and screen our airports. We recognize those efforts \nwith this amendment and the medal. But we bring focus and attention to \nall of the important support staff. Ask any soldier, ask any sailor, \nask any airman, and each will tell you how important it is to have the \nright staff sending you the right stuff--having the right staff sending \nyou the right stuff. Without a competent, capable, and talented support \nstaff in the global war on terrorism, our men and women in the Armed \nForces would not have the right tools for the job. Their lives would be \nat greater risk and so, too, would the freedom we cherish here at home. \nIt is right that we recognize all that they provide for our soldiers, \nour sailors, and our airmen, as well as what they do for all of us.\n  Yet the implementing regulations for eligibility for both these \nmedals have not been issued by the Secretary of Defense.\n  So today, what we will do, if my amendment is adopted, is we, in the \nSenate, will call upon the Secretary of Defense to complete action as \nsoon as possible on implementing regulations so these awards can go to \nany person who renders qualifying service with the Armed Forces in \nthose phases of the\n\n[[Page S12678]]\n\nglobal war on terrorism, including Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation \nEnduring Freedom, and Operation Noble Eagle.\n  This amendment says the regulations providing for a medal already in \nthe works, designed by soldiers and authorized by the President, should \nbe implemented as soon as possible and, in doing so, should also \nrecognize those who serve in Operation Noble Eagle and in support roles \nfor our military abroad. These are the critical distinctions between \nthe amendment before us now and the amendment that was considered 2 \ndays ago.\n  Mr. President, I know Senator McCain and Senator Warner would also \nlike to speak to my amendment. They are not in the Chamber at the \nmoment but would like to speak. And I believe there is another Senator \non our side of the aisle who would like to speak on this amendment as \nwell.\n  So pending their arrival, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to address the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution on behalf of men and women in the Armed Forces offered by \nour distinguished Senator from Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe listed as a cosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to give strong support to this and \nI want to say against the background--and the other day we had a \nsimilar matter before the Senate and I rose to address that. It was a \ntechnical problem, primarily, with that resolution. This one, which I \nhave read carefully, in a very straightforward manner, recites the \nhistory of personal decorations and theater awards and, in particular, \nhow these matters, throughout the military history of this country, \nhave been actions taken by Presidents upon the recommendation of the \nsenior officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and, \nindeed, the Coast Guard. In this instance, this administration has \nmoved to put in place those recognitions--most deserving, I would say--\nof men and women who have gone to the farflung corners of the globe and \naccepted the risks, together with their families, of going to those \nareas for the cause of freedom and to protect the security interests of \nthe United States of America.\n  That region of Iraq is very much in our hearts and minds every day. I \nhave had the privilege, as have many in this body, to go there and \nvisit with our troops. Likewise, I have had the privilege to go and \nvisit with our forces in Afghanistan. Most recently, I went to Liberia, \nwhere the strike task force--largely composed of U.S. marines but under \nthe control of a very fine Army officer--performed extraordinary duties \non behalf of the people of Liberia, who have suffered a decade-plus of \ncivil war turmoil. I could go on and on, but others are anxious to \naddress this.\n\n  The point I wish to make is these decorations are proudly worn on the \nuniform of the men and women in the Armed Forces. They are coveted \nitems of families for generations. In my office, I have proudly \ndisplayed the decoration earned by my father who volunteered as a young \nArmy doctor in World War I to go to France where he served in the \ntrenches. I remember as a young person of his telling stories to me \nabout life in the trenches, the extraordinary devastation he witnessed, \nthe loss of life, and the carnage. But there on the wall was his World \nWar I Victory Medal. It had on it three bars of the three major \nconflicts. He was proud to wear it on the uniform of the United States \nwhen he saw service.\n  It is a carefully thought through process that we cannot award a \nseparate medal for every conflict. We have to recognize the theater of \noperations. For example, in World War II, it was the European theater \nand it was the Pacific theater. There was a medal given to those in the \ncontinental limits in training commands. There were three basic \ntheaters of operation, and then stars were awarded for the major \nconflicts in the theaters of Europe or the Pacific.\n  It is not a wise course of action to award a separate medal of \ndecoration for each of the many theaters we are engaged in today. \nRather, there should be just the principal decoration which, as we say \nin the final paragraph of this resolution, and I will read that:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should, on an expedited basis, issue the necessary \n     regulations to implement these awards and ensure that any \n     person who renders qualifying service to the Armed Forces in \n     those phases of the Global War on Terrorism, including \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and \n     Operation Noble Eagle should promptly receive these awards.\n\n  That is a category of awards given primarily for Iraq and Afghanistan \nand contiguous areas where the men and women of the Armed Forces are \nserving actually in the front lines or, indeed, in a support phase.\n  I strongly urge the Senate adopt this amendment. I hope there are 100 \nvotes in recognition of this course of action.\n  To those who, with the best of intentions, have recommended specific \ntheaters, specific zones, such as Iraq, we then have to think of \nAfghanistan, we have to think of Liberia, although, fortunately, that \nwas an operation that was successfully performed in a relatively short \nperiod of time. I could go throughout the world.\n  It is better there be theater-of-operations awards and individuals \nsingled out. I know, for example, if I may say, when I was Secretary of \nthe Navy and heavily involved in the subject of awards, I remember so \nmuch working with the father of the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nwho was commander in chief of all military forces in the Pacific, ADM \n``Jumpin'' Jack McCain. I remember him well. I learned a lot from him.\n  The Senator from Arizona will recall from his earlier experience how \ntheater recognition is given and then the star to recognize those \nengagements in which one participated. That is a process carefully \nsupervised by the senior military, primarily the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I am quite interested in the views of the distinguished Senator from \nArizona on this subject. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Virginia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia that \nperhaps we should for a moment discuss what happened yesterday and what \nwe are trying to do under the leadership and initiation of Senator \nMcConnell.\n  Yesterday there was, as part of the $87 billion assistance package to \nIraq, an amendment that was proposed which would have bestowed a \nspecific decoration on those who fought in the Iraqi conflict. There \nwas a provision also that prohibited others, those eligible for that \nmedal, from being eligible for other decorations, as I understood it. \nThen that provision was voluntarily removed by the sponsor of the \namendment. I ask my friend, isn't it a little appropriate to remember \nwhat happened?\n  On March 12, 2003--that was a number of months ago--the President of \nthe United States, by Executive order, which is the proper and accepted \nmethodology for this kind of designation of awards, established the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal to be awarded to service \nmembers who serve in military operations to combat terrorism on or \nafter September 11, 2001, including, but not limited to, actions in \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, in such \nlocations as Afghanistan, Iraq, the Republic of the Philippines, and \nelsewhere in Southwest Asia, in recognition of sacrifice and \ncontribution.\n  In addition to that, in that same Executive order, the President \nestablished the service medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal recognizing service in Operation Noble Eagle and the homeland \ndefense mission against further terrorist attacks--for example, \nmilitary duties here domestically--in providing security and much-\nneeded service here.\n  In other words, isn't it the Senator's understanding there were two \nmedals? That by Executive order, following the advice of senior \nmilitary and civilian defense leaders, President Bush established two \ndifferent medals for men and\n\n[[Page S12679]]\n\nwomen who have engaged in the war on terrorism since September 11?\n  I guess what I see coming from my colleague is, if we are going to \nmake a specific award for Iraq, shouldn't the same award be bestowed in \nAfghanistan? In other words, in other areas? Wouldn't, at least in the \nPresident's Executive order, the expeditionary medal and the service \nmedal cover service literally globally? I think we might have \ndifficulty if you gave a specific medal for Iraq, which was a dangerous \nmission which entailed the loss and injury of brave young Americans, \nbut also Afghanistan is being left out. I think that was the point the \nSenator from Virginia and I were trying to make yesterday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is very correct in the \nrecitation of the facts. I add one other perspective, and that is how \nwell the Senator from Arizona understands with his distinguished career \nthe identification of the families with the serviceperson, and should a \nspecial award be made for Iraq, think of the families of those who \nserved in Afghanistan, particularly who lost life and limb. They would \nthink: Why is not the sacrifice of our family in every respect equal to \nthe sacrifice of the other families in the Iraqi situation?\n  Yesterday, or today, the Senator from Arizona and I took to the floor \ntogether in a similar colloquy to urge colleagues to let the system \nwork because it is working and it is working in the traditions of our \nmilitary.\n  It is working in a manner that is equitably recognizing the \nperformance in this area.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I also point out to my colleague, this was also an \nargument, I think he would agree with me, to allow the executive branch \nto act in what has been, frankly, the executive branch's area of \nresponsibility, and that is the designation of service medals, \nexpeditionary medals, et cetera, including, by the way, higher awards \nwhich would be bestowed for acts of heroism and courage no matter where \nthey fall. This is not the only medal of recognition available for a \nlot of these young men. But when we get into a bill which is \nlegislation that is for the reconstruction of Iraq, and all of a sudden \nwe come up with a great idea to designate a medal, we have to think \nthese things through.\n  The Senator from Virginia is the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. Was this issue ever raised in the Armed Services \nCommittee?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, no. Our committee does have jurisdiction \nover these matters. It was not brought to the attention of myself.\n  I saw momentarily the ranking member. I do not see him at the moment. \nTo the best of my knowledge, he did not have knowledge of it aforehand.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, I know the Senator from Virginia shares my \nadmiration and appreciation for the Senator from New Mexico who \nproposed this amendment. In a good-faith effort, he wanted to recognize \nthe service and sacrifice of those who had served. I appreciate that. \nBut I would also caution my colleagues that it is probably best to \nexplore what has been done and also what should be done by the \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Otherwise, we should not have committees of \njurisdiction; we should all just come to the floor with our ideas as to \nhow best to address issues.\n  I think the Armed Services Committee has a reputation, as one of the \noldest committees in the Senate, of never shirking in its duty to \naddress issues, including ones such as these.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I also add that, very importantly, \none very good development resulted from the debate we had yesterday.\n  I was under the impression that the two declarations to which the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona made mention were actually in being. \nI am perhaps remiss. I thought that by now they were in being, but in \nfact when I went directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, \nand those involved in the process, I found this needed a little \ncongressional incentive. That is the basic reason for this amendment \nthat is laid down today. We have their attention now, and they are \ngoing forward with these decorations.\n  So for that reason, we must say to Senator Bingaman that that was a \nvery fortunate development.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his desire \nand motivation to honor these brave young people.\n  I say to my friend, President Bush signed this Executive order on \nMarch 12. The way I count, that is 7 months ago. I am deeply disturbed \nthat the Secretary of Defense has not acted to implement these \nregulations. I would like to tell my friend from Virginia that I still \nhave people who work over in the Pentagon, who provide me from time to \ntime with information--usually anonymously, for obvious reasons--but I \nhave been told that these regulations have been on Deputy Secretary \nWolfowitz's desk for 3\\1/2\\ weeks. That is not right. I know the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense is busy and I know the Secretary of Defense is \nbusy, but I think we have every right to expect immediate action on \nthis so that these men and women can go about receiving this \nrecognition because they cannot until these papers are signed.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is absolutely correct. As I said, we have \nbrought this matter and the urgency of it to their attention, and that \nis one of the very positive results from the efforts of our colleagues \non the other side and the initiative taken by the distinguished whip on \nthis side in this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I mention to my friend from Virginia, too, as \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, perhaps we should look at \nwhether individual medals should be given for operations in Iraq, and \nperhaps individual decorations should be given for the conflict in \nAfghanistan, as two prime examples. Perhaps it is not sufficient to \njust have an expeditionary medal and a service medal.\n  I had hoped that if we had acted in order to separate those two \nconflicts from others, we would get input from the Secretary of \nDefense, that there would be proper consultation and hearing and \nscrutiny before the Senate Armed Services Committee before we acted.\n  I think the Senator from Virginia pointed out that if we only gave an \nIraqi freedom medal, what about those in Afghanistan? Is there an \nAfghanistan freedom medal, too? No, that was not part of the proposal \nyesterday. That is why these things with noble motivation have to be \nthought through. I hope that with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \nwhich we will all vote on, we will send a message that we are all in \nsupport of the incredible importance of recognizing the service and \nsacrifice of the young men and women of our Armed Forces today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague. I \nhave known the McCain family. I served with the Senator's father and \nhave followed the distinguished Senator's career, and it stands in \nparallel to the finest careers of those who have served in this body in \nyears past, today, and who will serve in the future, who have worn the \nuniform of this country. So I value greatly the views of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I thank him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my good friend he fails to \nmention that I served under the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nwhen he held the position of Secretary of the Navy. I might say I \nserved way under. Given the chain of command, there were probably at \nleast seven or eight individuals who separated the two of us, but I \ncertainly appreciate the honor and pleasure of having served under \nthen-Secretary of the Navy Warner. I have appreciated the relationship \nwe have enjoyed in the intervening 30 years.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not know. I fail to count the number of years. It is \n30 plus. But I thank the Senator for his kind remarks. My career is so \ninconsequential in the U.S. military compared with his. I do believe I \nreceived the good conduct medal. To the best of my knowledge, the \nSenator never received that; did he?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not think I was ever considered for that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not think the Senator was eligible then and he is \nnot eligible now. I think it is likely the Senator will never be \neligible.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. If it was up to a vote of our colleagues, I doubt I would \nbe eligible today.\n\n[[Page S12680]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, maybe we should cease this colloquy at this moment. \nI see others who perhaps would like to speak.\n  Again, we commend the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for his \ninitiative on this matter. I was somewhat saddened yesterday that we \nhad to have a division of views on what I believe was the best of \nintentions by the Senator from New Mexico. I think now this is an \nopportunity for us to shake hands on both sides and move on and resolve \nthis matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of the Senator from New Mexico. I \nhope he was able to hear our remarks concerning our appreciation for \nhis motivation to honor these young men and women who have served and \nsacrificed. We look forward to and anticipate we will continue working \ntogether on this worthy cause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand the majority leader will be coming to the \nfloor shortly to address our current legislative circumstances. I have \nbecome increasingly concerned about our ability to finish this bill. We \nhave noted that concern to the majority leader, as well as to the \nmanager of the bill.\n  Our concern stems from really two issues: One, the unwillingness on \nthe part of some to have votes on the pending amendments. I am told now \nthere are eight or nine amendments that are pending, that have been \noffered and that have been set aside. Tomorrow is Friday. We wanted to \nhave votes on all of those amendments. Yet for whatever reason, we have \nbeen unable to get to the votes.\n\n  The second issue is the issue involving the amendment to be offered \nby the Senators from Indiana and Wyoming, Mr. Bayh and Mr. Ensign. I am \ntold, for whatever reason, many of our colleagues on the other side are \nunwilling to allow that amendment even to be brought up. If that is the \ncase, obviously we are not going to be able to finish this bill. We \ncan't have completion of the consideration of this legislation until \nthat amendment has been offered and we have an opportunity to debate it \nand vote on it.\n  So, for whatever reason, we are stymied this afternoon at 5 o'clock \nwith, I guess, some 30 amendments pending.\n  We had indicated all along we would make our best good-faith effort \nto try to finish this legislation. But I emphasized all the way \nthrough, this is going to take cooperation on both sides. I think we \nhave cooperated in every sense of the word. We have laid down the \namendments. I think most of the amendments that have been offered have \nbeen our amendments. We have laid them down. We have not in any way \nstalled consideration of this legislation.\n  Now we are here Thursday afternoon at 5 o'clock with nine amendments \nwe are told we cannot have votes on, and one of them that cannot even \nbe offered. So we are going to have to come to some understanding about \nhow to proceed. I must say, with each passing hour the likelihood that \nwe will be able to complete our work as we had hoped we could--by the \nend of the day tomorrow--dwindles and diminishes to a point where it \nwill soon be nonexistent.\n  I call these concerns to the attention of my colleagues and ask we \nget some clarification about the schedule and about our ability to deal \nwith these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, the Democratic leader, we agree \nthat the amendment to which you referred is one of the last--I hope the \nlast important amendment to be offered. I don't know whether there are \nother amendments on that side of the aisle that will have a need for \ndebate at some length. But the amendment to which the Democratic leader \nreferred is obviously one a number of people are going to want to speak \nto. I think we will be able to go to it sometime in the early evening \nbecause there are people here who are going to want to speak on that \namendment. I know people on your side are going to want to speak on \nthat amendment.\n  I am still optimistic that we can press on into the evening. It is \nstill our hope to finish the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am gratified to hear the distinguished \nassistant Republican leader is optimistic. I was optimistic. I hope I \ncan have that optimism restored. As I noted just a moment ago, there \nare about 30 amendments pending, but we really believe that a lot of \nthe amendments that are still pending depend on the outcome of the \namendment to be offered by Senators Bayh and Ensign. So it is hard for \nus to move forward on the other amendments until that one has been \nresolved.\n  So we are in a situation where we cannot move forward until our \nRepublican colleagues acknowledge the need to, not only offer the \namendment, but to have it debated and voted upon, so we can clear the \nway for whatever additional amendments along the lines of the subject \nmatter the Bayh-Ensign amendment addresses.\n\n  That is the issue. That is the concern we have. I hope we can clarify \nit soon. But I only raise this concern because I suggest the hour, \nwhile it is not late, is getting later, and we do not have a lot of \ntime to finish all the work that is left.\n  I believe we made our commitment, kept our commitment, and I hope we \ncan accomplish what many of us had hoped we could do 2 weeks ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not to prolong this, because I think we are at \nessential agreement, but it was hard to get anything going during the \nday today, as is often the case around here. This is quite a nocturnal \ninstitution. The Sun goes down and we get busy working. But I certainly \nshare the view of the Democratic leader the amendment to which he \nreferred is a significant amendment. It is certainly our expectation we \nwill be able to go to that amendment sometime early in the evening, \naccommodate those who want to speak, on both sides, move in the \ndirection of completing action on the amendment at some point this \nevening, and move ahead, I hope.\n  I say to my good friend, that doesn't mean we have a whole lot more \namendments coming from that side of the aisle that are going to require \nextensive debate. I heard the Senator from South Dakota and others say \nthat is the last significant amendment. I certainly hope that is the \ncase because then I think we have a chance of wrapping it up sometime \nsoon and moving on to other matters.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope I didn't say that this was the \nlast significant amendment because I know many of my colleagues who \nhave amendments to offer certainly view them as significant. I wouldn't \nwant to characterize their amendments as insignificant. If I led the \nSenator from Kentucky to that conclusion, I want to clarify that was \nnot my intention.\n  But I also reiterate, we have eight or nine amendments pending that \nwould require votes. We are basically in a quorum call with no real \nexpectation of a vote on many of these amendments for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  There are two issues. One is this amendment on loans offered by \nSenators Bayh and Ensign. The other is clearing the logjam of \namendments that have already been offered, including one by this \nSenator, that awaits a vote. So the sooner we can get on with those \nvotes, the sooner we can get on with the consideration of the Bayh \namendment and the sooner we can address the other backlog of amendments \nthat are waiting to be offered.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention to this and hope we hear \nfrom the majority leader sometime soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. I very much appreciate the Democratic leader's observation \nand his patience. We have a number of amendments that we have asked \nMembers to withhold offering because there have been other matters on \nthe Senate floor. During this period of time, we have had virtually no \nquorum calls until the recent episode where there has been movement--\nspeaking only for myself--preventing anything from happening on this \nbill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will in just one second. So we have basically been \nwithout\n\n[[Page S12681]]\n\nquorum calls. And we still have, as the Senator from South Dakota, the \nDemocratic leader, mentioned, about 30 amendments we have to dispose \nof.\n\n  As the leader said, some of these will fall as a result of the vote \non the Bayh-Ensign amendment. But that still leaves at least 15 or 20 \namendments we have to dispose of, and that doesn't count those at the \ndesk. Just basic numbers indicate we have a lot of work to do.\n  I would also say that for my friend, the distinguished majority whip, \nto indicate we haven't been doing anything during the day--we have. \nThere were some concerned about the time Senator Byrd spent on his \namendment. But there was nothing done to stall for time. That time was \ntaken, every minute, by some of the more distinguished Senators who \nspoke in support of Senator Byrd's amendment. He wouldn't agree to any \ntime limit, but there certainly was no effort to stall anything. Then \nwe were waiting to offer other amendments.\n  My point is that just by sheer numbers, if the Senator from Kentucky \nsays it will take several hours of debate when we get to it this \nevening, does that mean we get to it at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock? Are we \ngoing to spend 2 hours on that? That means we finish that debate at 9 \nor 9:30. We have a vote on that, we have 9 matters at the desk to vote \non, and then we still have the amendments that have not even been \noffered.\n  So this is no easy chore we have. I, frankly, in spite of the good \nwill between the distinguished majority whip and our Democratic \nleader--I think it is going to be difficult to do that based upon what \nwe have been told by the majority this afternoon.\n  I am happy to yield for a question from my friend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was going to suggest we vote on this amendment at 20 \nminutes to 6, the pending amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment before us? I would say I haven't had a chance \nto speak to my friend from New Mexico, but is this anything we object \nto?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection to voting \non this, voting at 20 minutes to 6. I would like a chance to speak for \n4 or 5 minutes on the amendment, if I could.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, \nthrough the Chair I say to my friend from New Mexico that it is my \nunderstanding he does not oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, that is correct. I have no opposition to \nthe amendment. I just want to speak to and explain my views on it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is my whole point. There is no reason \nto vote on this amendment. This is the old stall we are getting. That \nis all this is. There is no reason to vote on this amendment. We have \nsubstantive issues, and this is very important. I appreciate the good \nspeeches from the chairman of the committee on this most important \nissue. But everybody is going to vote for it. If we are trying to \nfinish this bill, which obviously we are not at this stage, the stall \nis going on and whatever has to happen to make sure the vote count is \nright on the Bayh amendment.\n  We need to move forward on this legislation. I will vote on it \nanytime we want. But I am just saying that it is a waste of time. I \nhave seen stalls before. This is a stall. That is speaking only for \nmyself.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are prepared to vote now, if that is \nagreeable with the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have the floor. I yield to the \nSenator from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true that we had a 97-to-0 vote on the Byrd \namendment, as I recall?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to respond to the question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada to \nrespond.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it would be totally appropriate to \nhave a vote on this as long as the Senator from New Mexico has 5 \nminutes to speak. This issue brought now by the majority is a result of \nthe very important amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico. I \nhave no problem. My only point is this: There may have been one vote \nthat was 98 to 0. I don't remember that. There certainly could have \nbeen. I assume this will be another one. But I think that will be fine \nafter the Senator from New Mexico speaks, and then vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving my right to the floor, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 10 minutes equally divided between the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from New Mexico and that at the \nend of those 10 minutes, the Senate proceed to a rollcall vote on the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nBayh, No. 1871, be the next amendment in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, as the Senator knows, we \nhad an amendment as lined up to be considered on this side. Senator \nNickles also is not able to be here, but he has given me the \ninformation and I am prepared to offer that amendment for him. This is \nthe first of the three amendments we are going to call up. I would \nbe compelled to object to that setting of the Bayh amendment before we \nhave some consideration of amendments on this side.\n\n  Mr. REID. I then ask unanimous consent that the request be modified \nso the Senator from Indiana may be allowed to offer his amendment \nfollowing the disposal of the Nickles amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will not object to that. I ask unanimous consent to \namend this request so that I may be recognized to present the Nickles \namendment following the vote on the McConnell amendment, and following \nthat Senator Bayh be recognized to present his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak very briefly on the pending \nMcConnell amendment which Senator McConnell, Senator Warner, and \nSenator McCain have offered.\n  First, I congratulate them. I think this is a very constructive \namendment. It gives recognition to the men and women who are serving \noverseas in various locations. It puts the Senate on record, even \nthough it is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, in support of the \nissuance of appropriate medals to these individuals.\n  I believe, as I was arguing the day before yesterday when we had the \nother debate on this issue, that the appropriate course is either on \nthe initiative of the Pentagon or through action by the Congress that \nat some stage fairly soon we authorize combat medals for those who \nserve in Iraq and for those who perhaps serve in Afghanistan. That \nseems to me to me to be consistent with the course we followed \npreviously. We had a medal of that sort for those who served in the \nfirst gulf war. We had a medal of that sort for those who served in \nKosovo. There is ample precedent for that.\n  To lump all military engagements that we have after 9/11 under this \nlarge umbrella of the global war on terrorism and say we are going to \ngive you one medal for whatever military engagements you serve in after \nthat date I think is inadequate. I think the men and women serving in \nIraq today deserve special recognition for that.\n  I have seen the suggestions being considered at the Pentagon for \nputting a star on some designation--on a generic kind of a medal \ndealing with the global war on terrorism, some kind of star indicating \nservices in Iraq. To me, that would not be consistent with what we have \ndone before. I hope we won't go that route.\n  Obviously, this is a step forward. I commend the Senator from \nVirginia, the Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from Kentucky for \nputting forward this amendment. I intend to support it. I hope all \nSenators will support it.\n  But I hope we will find a way or that the Pentagon will find a way to \ndo\n\n[[Page S12682]]\n\nmore to recognize the service of these individuals both in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I say to my colleague from New Mexico, \nwith whom I have had the privilege to serve now for close to two \ndecades in this body, and who was a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and a very valued member, that he has gotten this Senator's \nattention. I appreciate what he is doing to support the pending \namendment, and I urge colleagues to do likewise.\n  If I might say first, while he was not present in the Chamber when I \nbrought to the attention of the Senate that the debate which followed \nhis amendment the other day did bring about this Senator's personal \nattention on the status of several decorations, I found that it was not \nmoving along, in my judgment, in an expeditious and timely manner. That \ndebate the other day served a very important service to the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces who are engaged in these particular theaters.\n  I would like to work with the Senator and with the Department of \nDefense to pursue his thoughts about perhaps additional recognition for \nservice in the theaters of Iraq Afghanistan. I am just not prepared at \nthis time to give a definitive answer.\n  This is the course, as proposed by the amendment which is before the \nSenate, which has been followed for years. So many places in the world \ntoday have often no geographic boundaries and have no identity. Yet \npeople who are on guard wearing our uniform, coalition forces and other \nnations, are subject to loss of life and limb in combating that \nterrorism.\n  I am not able at this point in time to come up with some definitive \nsuggestion. But I certainly would like to associate myself with the \nSenator's remarks that there should be an expression of gratitude to \nthose persons serving in these theaters right now for their service and \nthat given by their families. I thank the Senator.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment numbered 1874. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Idaho \n(Mr. Craig) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Mr. President, I have three amendments that have been \ncleared by both sides: Amendment No. 1869, as modified; amendment No. \n1870; and amendment No. 1857, as modified.

I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments were agreed, as follows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1869, as modified\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to arm, train, or employee \n  individuals under the age of 18 years for the Facilities Protection \n                                Service)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n       Sec. 2313. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act under the heading ``Iraq Relief and \n     Reconstruction Fund'', or under any other heading, may be \n     obligated or expended for the purpose of arming, training, or \n     employing individuals under the age of 18 years for the \n     Facilities Protection Service, to carry out any function \n     similar to the functions performed by the Service, or for any \n     other security force.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1870\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place in the bill:\n       Sec.   . Section 1605 of title 28, United States Code is \n     amended by adding a new subsection (h) as follows:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the Algiers Accords, \n     or any other international agreement, any United States \n     citizen held hostage during the period between 1979 and 1981, \n     and their spouses and children at the time, shall have a \n     claim for money damages against a foreign state for personal \n     injury that was caused by the Foreign State's act of torture \n     or hostage taking.

(a) In the administration of laws and policies on \n     the period for which members of reserve components of the \n     Armed Forces called or ordered to active duty under a \n     provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) of \n     title 10, United States Code, are deployed outside the United \n     States, the deployment shall be considered to have begun on \n     the first day of the active-duty service to which called or \n     ordered and shall be considered to have ended on the last day \n     of the active-duty service to which called or ordered.\n       (b) The Secretary of Defense may waive the requirements of \n     subsection (a) in any case in which the Secretary determines \n     that it is necessary to do so to respond to a national \n     security emergency or to meet dire operational requirements \n     of the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I have offered an amendment to this bill that will \nbring predictability and clarity to our deployment of National Guard \nand Reserve units.\n  I thank my cosponsors, Senators Bond and Leahy, the cochairs of the \nSenate National Guard Caucus, as well as Senators Bingaman, Leahy, \nJohnson, Nelson of Florida, Graham of Florida, Murray, Kennedy, Pryor, \nLautenberg, and Kerry, who are joining me in sending a message that we \nneed to be consistent in how we calculate the deployment times for our \nGuard and Reserve personnel.\n  This amendment will direct the Pentagon to consider the full \nactivation time for Guard and Reserve personnel in considering its \ndeployment policies and also to establish a program to\n\n[[Page S12683]]\n\nmore effectively notify troops and their families of changes in \ndeployment policies and/or extensions in deployment periods.\n  This action will go a long way in ensuring better predictability for \nour military reservists, their families, and employers--they certainly \ndeserve it.\n  I am proud to say that it has been endorsed by the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the Reserve Officers Association and \nthe National Military Families Association.\n  As many in this Chamber know, over 20,000 troops in Iraq were faced \nwith a rude awakening last month when the administration changed a 50-\nyear standard practice in calculating deployment policies--a change the \neffectively extended deployments for these troops by several months in \nmany cases.\n  Prior to last month's decision, the length of deployment was \ncalculated based on the time a reservist was activated--when a member \nof the Guard and Reserve left home. However, last month, the \nadministration changed the method of calculation to time deployed ``in \ntheater.''\n  This is not the way to treat our Reserve component. We are asking \nmore and more from them, and they deserve better. The Guard and Reserve \nare critically important to our national security both at home and \nabroad.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the National Guard has mobilized 210,000 of \nits 350,000 soldiers at one time or another. The Reserve has mobilized \n85,000 of its 205,000 in that same time period.\n  In my own State, with the recent alert of the Army National Guard's \n81st Armored Brigade, 41 percent of Washington State's National Guard--\n4,041 troops--are currently alerted and deployed, as well as 2,100 \nreservists from bases around my State.\n  These are historic levels of sustained mobilization, and we need to \nbe clear that we are asking a lot from these men and women--and we must \ndo everything we can to ensure that the Guard and Reserve continue to \nrecruit and retain skilled and committed personnel.\n  It goes without saying that these men and women definitely signed up \nto serve when their country calls. The reservists in my State do not \ndispute their commitment; they embrace it.\n  However, we need to know that we are asking an extraordinary \ncommitment from our Nation's Guard and reservists, their families and \ntheir employers and we need to recognize the full commitment.\n  This is why I was concerned when the Pentagon announced that it will \ncalculate deployment lengths for the over 20,000 Guard and Reserve \nmembers in Iraq based on the actual time in the theater of operations--\notherwise known as ``boots on the ground.''\n  This change altered a long-standing practice dating back to the \nKorean-war era in which deployment lengths for Guard and Reserve \nofficers were calculated from the moment they were actually activated--\nthat is, when they are called to leave their jobs and families to begin \npre-mobilization preparation time and included post-mobilization time.\n  This preparation time can sometimes take as much as 3 to 6 months.\n  As a result, thousands of troops in the theater of operations who \nwere expecting to go home--literally counting the days to return--were \njust informed that their time would be extended, some by as much as 6 \nmonths.\n  This is just wrong.\n  As Mark Kimmey, an Army reservist, wrote in the New York Times: ``the \nmessage to reservists is unmistakable: the Army no longer takes into \naccount sacrifices made to maintain two career lives.''\n  We absolutely own it to our Guard and reservists to give them \npredictability in the process and to fully recognize that the Guard and \nreservists' lives are serving from the point they are activated.\n  My amendment will direct the Pentagon to revert back to the standard \npractice in considering, for the purposes of deployment announcements, \nmobilization reports and communications, the clock to start ticking \nfrom the point of activation--that is, ``boots out of the house.''\n  If we need our reservists to serve in theater for 1 year and 6 months \nin preparation time, that's fine. But let's be honest, these troops are \nbeing deployed for 18 months--not a year. Troops, families, and \nemployers deserve the respect of our acknowledging the sacrifice.\n  Let me be absolutely clear--this amendment does not, by any means, \nseek to limit the operational use of the Guard and Reserve, nor are we \nseeking to limit the flexibility of their use.\n  This does absolutely nothing to limit the ability of the Pentagon to \nmobilize and use our Guard and Reserve units, nor does it limit the \nlength of time that they can be deployed.\n  Moreover, the amendment's provisions can be waived at any point in \nthe case of dire, unexpected operational needs.\n  We are simply asking the administration to adopt the standard \npractice in effect for decades in calculating deployment times so that \ntroops and their families can know when to start their clocks.\n  Ultimately, this is a very modest amendment. We are asking the \nPentagon to be honest, consistent and predictable in the use of our \nGuard and Reserve. They deserve it; their families deserve it; we owe \nit to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1876\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1876.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that all countries that \n  hold debt from the former Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein should be \n                      urged to forgive their debt)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) When Saddam Hussein came to power in the 1970's Iraq \n     was a prosperous county with no foreign debt and significant \n     foreign cash reserves.\n       (2) Iraq's reserves were exhausted during the Iran-Iraq War \n     in the 1980's and Iraq became a debtor nation.\n       (3) Today, the debts incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime \n     are estimated to be as much as $150,000,000,000.\n       (4) A process has been put in place that will establish a \n     new representative Iraqi government based on a democratic \n     political system with a free market economy. The goal is a \n     prosperous Iraq that is not a threat to its neighbors.\n       (5) For Iraq to be prosperous it must rebuild. In the near \n     term the United States and other donor countries will provide \n     grants to begin the process. In the longer term Iraq must be \n     able to fully participate in the international financial \n     system.\n       (6) It is impossible for Iraq to borrow funds in \n     international financial markets based on its existing debt. \n     Eliminating that debt will make possible Iraq's continued \n     rebuilding toward a prosperous and stable nation. A \n     prosperous nation is less likely to be a threat to its \n     neighbors and to be a breeding ground for terrorists. A \n     prosperous Iraq is more likely to be a positive force in the \n     region and participant in the world economy.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that all countries that \n     hold debt from loans to the former Iraqi regime of Saddam \n     Hussein should be urged to forgive their debt.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nurging the countries that presently hold Iraqi debt to cancel or \nforgive that debt. All of the Iraqi debt was generated after Saddam \nHussein came to power in that country.\n  The history of the Iraqi debt was that, when Saddam Hussein took \ncontrol, it was a very rich country, and it had no debt. Saddam Hussein \nstarted a war with Iran and he incurred a lot of debt. As a matter of \nfact, when he came into power, they had no foreign debt. During Iraq's \nwar with Iran, Iraq incurred debts estimated at about $80 billion. Most \nof that was to finance the war.\n  Iraqi arms purchases during the 1980s were estimated from $52 billion \nto $102 billion. Saddam Hussein used debt to purchase arms. He used \ndebt to build palaces. He used very little debt, if any, to help the \nIraqi people.\n  We asked the Congressional Research Service to give us an analysis of \nwhat countries hold or own Iraqi debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this information in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12684]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 COUNTRIES TO WHICH IRAQ MAY BE INDEBTED\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Low    High\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWestern Countries (G-8)...................................     16     44\n  Canada..................................................      1      1\n  France..................................................      2      8\n  Germany.................................................      2      4\n  Italy...................................................      1      2\n  Japan...................................................      3      7\n  Russia..................................................      3     16\n  United Kingdom..........................................      1      2\n  United States...........................................      2      5\nMiddle East Gulf States...................................     60     82\n  Saudi Arabia............................................     25     25\n  Kuwait..................................................     17     27\n  Other...................................................     18     30\nOther Countries...........................................     16     16\nCommercial (London Club)..................................      3     11\n                                                           -------------\n    Total.................................................     95    153\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Research Service Memorandum.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. There is a significant range. I will go over a few of \nthese countries, but the essence of it is that none of these countries \nhave received payments on Iraqi debt for years. In most cases, for \ndecades payments have not been made. Saddam Hussein incurred a lot of \ndebt. The countries holding that debt may hold it as if it is worth \nsomething, but, frankly, no payments have been made on that debt for \nsome time.\n  Who holds that debt? The range of the total amount of debt according \nto CRS--and I am not talking about war reparations for Saddam Hussein's \nwar with Iran and invasion of Kuwait. There are a lot of claimed \nreparations for damages. That is not covered by this resolution. We are \ntalking about debt incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime, and that was \nestimated by CRS as being a total of $95 billion and $153 billion.\n  Some of the debt ranges are for Western countries and some are for \nMiddle Eastern Gulf States. Some of the Western countries are: Canada \nis estimated to have $1 billion. France, from $2 billion to $8 billion; \nwe are not certain of the exact amount. Germany, from $2 billion to $4 \nbillion. Italy, from $1 billion to $2 billion. Japan, from $3 billion \nto $7 billion. Russia, from $3 billion to $16 billion. The U.K., from \n$1 billion to $2 billion. The United States, from $2 billion to $5 \nbillion. These were debts incurred under the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  The essence of this amendment is to urge these countries to forgive \nor wipe off the debt from the books.\n  For the Middle Eastern Gulf States, it is much more. Saudi Arabia is \nreported to hold $25 billion of Iraqi loans; Kuwait, $17 billion to $27 \nbillion; other Gulf States, from $18 billion to $30 billion.\n  If the Iraqi debt is from $95 billion to $150 billion--let's say it \nis $120 billion--if we were making payments even at 5 percent--that is \n$5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion a year in interest payments--they \ncould not afford to pay that. These interest payments would consume 80 \npercent to 130 percent of Iraq's oil revenues. Clearly, that is not \nsustainable.\n  The Iraqis have a lot of infrastructure needs. They have a lot of \nrebuilding needs. They have a lot of needs that have been ignored by \nthe previous regime, by Saddam Hussein, for decades. If they had to \nmake payments on this existing debt, I think it would only complicate, \nfrankly, their future and their survival.\n  I urge in this sense-of-the-Senate amendment countries that are \nholding debt that was incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime to forgive \nthat debt so Iraq can move forward with a new government without being \nso constrained, so the new government can move forward and rebuild Iraq \nwithout being so tied up with this existing debt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested in the comments by my \ncolleague from Oklahoma. I don't know of anyone here who would object \nor disagree with the contention that those who hold Iraqi debt ought to \nforgive that debt. I have spoken on this subject at some length a \ncouple of times.\n  Ambassador Bremer appeared before our Appropriations Committee and \nindicated that Iraq would be producing about 3 million barrels of oil a \nday beginning in July of next year. I asked the question then about \nusing future proceeds from pumping Iraq oil for the purpose of \nreconstruction. He indicated that would not be possible because of the \nencumbrance that existed with foreign debt.\n  I asked Ambassador Bremer who holds this foreign debt. He said \nRussia, Germany, France, among others. When I did research later, I \ndiscovered exactly what the Senator from Oklahoma discovered. In fact, \nRussia, Germany, and France do hold Iraqi debt, but the larger debt is \nowed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Arab states which, \nincidentally, in combination, equal about the debt that both the Saudis \nand the Kuwaitis hold with Iraq.\n  It occurred to me that if we are concerned that Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait recover the loans they gave to Iraq, maybe we ought to ask the \nSaudis and Kuwaitis to track Saddam Hussein down and present him with a \nbill. The Iraqi government that incurred that debt, the government that \nexisted at that point, was the Saddam Hussein government. It clearly \nwas not a legitimate government.\n  As you know, in the last election of that government, Saddam Hussein \nreceived 100 percent of the vote and those who voted had to walk down \nan aisle, a long gallery of pictures of Saddam Hussein, and hold their \nballot above their head that was clearly marked ``Saddam Hussein.''\n  That is the government we are now told legitimately owes money to the \nSaudis and the Kuwaitis. In my judgment, that government no longer \nexists, and the encumbrance of Saddam Hussein ought not, in my judgment \nat least, obligate the Iraqi citizens to do anything.\n  I know there will be people who are tall thinkers with thick glasses \nwho have some thought about international obligations that I may not \nunderstand. It may be that I don't understand all the nuances, but I do \nunderstand this: That Saddam Hussein has vanished. The Saddam Hussein \ngovernment was a government run by a butcher. We are, in fact, opening \nfootball-field-size graves with 10,000 and 12,000 skeletons in them, \nand we are told the only legacy of that government that ought to remain \nan obligation is the debt Saddam Hussein ran up with other countries.\n  I don't think that debt ought to be considered to be existing debt at \nthis point, with all due respect to those countries. If in the 1980s we \nhad countries that were pals of Saddam Hussein because he was taking on \nthe country of Iran and they were lending Saddam Hussein money, at this \npoint it seems to me they ought to track down Saddam Hussein and \npresent him with a bill.\n  We are told from time to time by intelligence sources that Saddam \nperhaps has a substantial amount of money squirreled away in Swiss \nbanks. They say he stole that country blind. I don't know the facts \nabout that. I suspect that is the case. I suspect Saddam Hussein and \nhis government squirreled away a substantial amount of money. In any \nevent, we can't find him. I suggest to those to whom he owes money or \nto those whom his former government owes money, they ought to track him \ndown and present him with a bill.\n  We have had a long discussion here and will, I guess, again, perhaps \ntonight or tomorrow, about what kind of obligation the American \ntaxpayers should have with respect to the reconstruction of Iraq. It \nwas my belief--and I regret my amendment was not adopted, but I accept \nthe voice of the Senate on that amendment--it was my belief that we \nshould lend the money to Iraq for reconstruction and that Iraq should \nrepay those loans out of the proceeds from oil that it pumps out of the \nground in the future.\n  Once again, we expect, according to the testimony of Ambassador \nBremer, about 3 million barrels of oil a day. In fact, the Iraqi \nGoverning Council--these are the Iraqis who are now in charge, running \nministries and so on--they visited here a couple weeks ago and said \nthey thought it would be 6 million barrels a day.\n  Let's take Ambassador Bremer's number instead, 3 million a day. That \nmeans that country will pump about $20 billion of oil, about $16 \nbillion of which is available for export. So we have $16 billion a year \nof Iraqi oil, beginning next July, available for export. That is $160 \nbillion in 10 years, $320 billion in 20 years. That is a substantial \namount of money for the reconstruction of a country the size of \nCalifornia with 24 million people. It is ample money to do that job.\n\n[[Page S12685]]\n\n  I understand we have already decided that question. My amendment did \nnot pass the Senate. But as we discuss further amendments about grants \nversus loans, I wanted to make a comment following the discussion by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. I believe his numbers are accurate. Those \nare the numbers I discovered with respect to foreign debt owed by Iraq. \nMore properly, I think it is foreign debt owed by Saddam Hussein's \ngovernment, a nonlegitimate government, a brutal dictatorship.\n  In my judgment, the Iraqi people ought not at this point be burdened \nby that debt and I would suggest to creditors, including the Saudis and \nKuwaitis, that the paper for those debts is worth only that which it \nwill produce once Saddam Hussein is found and it is presented to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, and I think perhaps a little discussion about \nthe history of debt and debt repudiation, debts being placed upon \ncountries that have been defeated or liberated, might be in order.\n  In anticipation perhaps of this debate, a member of the staff of the \nJoint Economic Committee, Melanie Mickelson, prepared a memo for me and \nother members of the committee entitled ``Iraqi Debt and \nReconstruction.'' I ask unanimous consent that this memo be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, when we think of forgiveness of debt or \nrepudiation of debt, we think back usually to Germany, to the debt that \nwas placed on Germany at the end of the First World War by the \nVersailles Treaty and the great political hay Adolf Hitler was able to \nmake out of this debt as he told the people of Germany that the \nVersailles Treaty had been a stab in the back and the people who had \nimposed that debt on Germany were the people who were Germany's primary \nenemies.\n  I do not want to make too much out of that aspect of Hitler's rise to \npower, but there was no question but what the enormous debt placed on \nGermany at the end of the First World War was destabilizing on the \ncountry and made it very difficult for Germany to bring itself back as \na viable nation and made Germany potentially vulnerable to the kind of \npolitical appeal Adolf Hitler represented.\n  Let us put this in some perspective with respect to Iraq and what we \nare talking about here. At this time, the debt that was placed upon \nGermany was roughly two times Germany's gross domestic product, or GDP. \nTo put that into perspective for the United States, right now our debt \nis roughly half of America's GDP. If we assume the GDP is running at \n$11 trillion in round figures, we would say the debt Germany faced by \ncomparison would be similar to putting a debt on the United States of \n$22 trillion. That, of course, takes one's breath away when you think \nabout the impact of that on the United States. Twenty-two trillion \ndollars. How in the world, even with as vital and vibrant an economy as \nwe have, would we be able to survive if we had a national debt of $22 \ntrillion? That was the debt that had such significant historic impact \non Germany in the last century.\n  What are we talking about with respect to the debt Iraq currently \nfaces? Is it half their GDP, as it is in the United States? Would it be \nas burdensome as the German debt at two times GDP? No, neither of those \nfigures applies. When we talk about the size of the debt Iraq currently \ncarries compared to their present GDP, we are talking about ten times \nGDP; not two times but ten times current GDP. Again, to translate that \ninto numbers we can compare to America, that would mean that America, \nthe strongest economy in the world, with our present GDP of roughly $11 \ntrillion, would be saddled with a debt in excess of $120 trillion.\n  How prosperous would America be if we were faced with that kind of a \ndebt load? Obviously, it would sink us, even though we have the \nstrongest economy in the world.\n  We have people around here who are worried because our current debt \nis roughly half of GDP, and to talk about ten times GDP is absolutely \nimpossible. So the logical thing to do is for all of the countries to \nrespond to the call that is represented by the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and forgive the debt.\n  Why? Let us go through the reasons. One of them has been raised by \nSenator Dorgan. That is, this debt was incurred on behalf of a brutal \nregime which has been overthrown. Some of the debtor countries might \nsay, when there is a coup in a country and the government is \noverthrown, whoever takes over takes over the obligations. Saddam \nHussein was not overthrown by a coup from the Iraqis. He was overthrown \nby the 82nd Airborne. He was overthrown by the United States of America \nand the marines, by the British troops, the Polish troops, and the \nother coalition members that joined us in overthrowing that government.\n  So while the Iraqi people are very grateful Saddam Hussein has been \noverthrown, while the Iraqi people rejoice that Saddam Hussein has been \noverthrown, the Iraqi people by no means are responsible for the debt \nthat survives because he was overthrown. They were the victims of the \ndebt, not the beneficiaries or perpetrators of the debt. For that \nreason, they should not be held accountable.\n  There are other reasons. There are sound economic reasons. We have a \nprinciple of bankruptcy in this country. When, as a result of \ncircumstances, whether they were caused or just out of somebody's \ncontrol, someone finds himself absolutely incapable of repaying the \ndebt, we go through bankruptcy court and say we are going to give you \nan opportunity for a fresh start. We are going to give you an \nopportunity to wipe the slate clean and move forward. We are going to \ndischarge your debt through bankruptcy.\n  If any country has been reduced to bankruptcy, it is Iraq. The GDP I \ndescribed is substantially below what their potential earning power \nwill be, but they can never realize that earning power if they are not \nfree from their past debts by virtue of a bankruptcy action.\n  What the Senator from Oklahoma is proposing is essentially the \ncountries that hold the debt allow the Iraqis to file bankruptcy; that \nthe countries that hold the debt say, we recognize reality. We \nrecognize we are never, ever going to get this money.\n  There are some who might say, yes, but Iraq has all that oil and \neventually maybe they will be able to give us this money, so let's just \nrestructure the debt. Let's just say okay, no payments for a while, no \npayments on principal, interest is deferred, we will give you a chance \nto get on your feet, and then we will collect the debt.\n  That is not a principle that applies in reality with respect to most \nbankruptcy situations. Even those who have the ability to earn money \nlater on can get everything discharged with bankruptcy if it is clear \nthe existence of the debt as it stands is going to prevent them from \nearning money later on.\n  The most significant return that can come to the countries that are \ncurrently holding Iraqi debt will come from a vibrant Iraqi economy \nwith which they can open meaningful trade relations.\n  Think of what the potential of Iraq is in terms other than oil. We \nheld a hearing on this in the Joint Economic Committee. Of course, the \nprimary focus was on oil revenue, but I was interested to discover that \nIraq has other things besides oil. Iraq is blessed with fertile soil. \nIraq is blessed with water. Iraq has a history, pre-Saddam Hussein, of \nbeing a net exporter of food. In other words, an economically healthy \nIraq, rebuilding its infrastructure, reclaiming its opportunity to move \nwater around the country through canals and pipelines and starting \nirrigation can be an Iraq that can have a vibrant agricultural sector; \nan Iraq that can then create a manufacturing sector to provide the farm \nimplements that are necessary to support its agriculture; an Iraq that \ncan have a middle class that can buy things; that can have a society \nthat is not just based on oil.\n  It can become, properly reconstructed, one of the most vibrant \neconomies in the region. It can outstrip some of the economies around \nit that are dependent solely upon oil and\n\n[[Page S12686]]\n\nthereby become an example of capitalism in the region, from which we \nand others around Iraq can reap enormous benefits. Those benefits, \nproperly reaped, will establish greater economic value than the \ncollection of the debt.\n  This is the prospect you have here. If we wipe out all of the debt, \nif the countries respond to the plea contained in the amendment by the \nSenator from Oklahoma and forgive their debts so a vibrant Iraq can be \nbuilt without the shadow of debt hanging over it, those very countries \nthat currently hold the debt can benefit with the opportunity for trade \nwith a vibrant and vital Iraq.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Oklahoma in proposing his amendment. \nI hope it will pass overwhelmingly as a message to those countries that \ndo hold Iraqi debt, to say to them the United States recognizes the \nimportance of allowing Iraq to declare bankruptcy as if it were, if you \nwill, an American corporation. The United States recognizes that the \nhope of the future will come from allowing all of this to happen, \nallowing these debts to disappear, and allowing Iraq to get on with \ntheir reconstruction.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        Joint Economic Committee\n\n     Memo: Iraqi Debt and Reconstruction.\n     Date: October 9, 2003.\n\n\n                        The ABC's of Iraqi Debt\n\n       Dealing with debt accrued by Saddam Hussein and the Baath \n     party is a lynchpin to Iraqi reconstruction. According to \n     Businessweek, Iraq owes $216 billion. Of that, $32 billion is \n     war reparations, owed mainly to Kuwait. Loans comprise $127 \n     billion of the debt, and contracts agreed to during the past \n     ten years racked up $57 billion. Other estimates of total \n     debt skate from $95 billion to $350 billion (the Bush \n     administration calculates Iraqi debt to be $200 billion, as \n     reported by CRS).\n       The debt's creditors include a long list of nations, as \n     compiled by Jubilee Iraq, an organization of British origin \n     dedicated to the repudiation of Iraqi debts. Table 1 displays \n     the list of nations as well as amounts owed. In addition to \n     these nations and organizations, Iraq also owes the IMF and \n     World Bank a total of $150 million, as reported by \n     Representative Carolyn Maloney at the June 11, 2003 JEC \n     Hearing.\n\n\n                           A Second Germany?\n\n       In American history, precedents of debt repudiation focus \n     on post-war Germany. Following WWI, Germany's economy was \n     shallow with debts amounting to two times German GDP. The \n     Treaty of Versailles pointed out German guilt and obligation \n     to pay war reparation, however the United States renounced \n     all reparations and did not sanction the treaty. Due to \n     German government resistance and inability to collect funds, \n     the Dawes Plan of 1924 reorganized the Reichsbank under \n     Allied supervision and created a tax system to fund \n     reparation payments. Reparations to the European Allied \n     nations made the bulk of their lend-lease payments to the \n     United States. Germany staggered under heavy debt as Europe \n     suffered through the 1920 depression. The Young Plan (1929) \n     reduced the sum Germany owed, delineating a distinct dollar \n     amount as well as how to collect it through budgeting and a \n     transportation tax. In 1931, President Hoover issued a one-\n     year moratorium on all international debts. The Lausanne Pact \n     of 1932 substituted bond issues for reparation debt, but \n     Adolf Hitler repudiated all WWI reparations while in office. \n     Payment resumed in 1953 by West Germany.\n       The debts owed to the U.S. by our WWI allies were defaulted \n     by 1934 excepting Hungary, which did so in 1939, Finland, \n     which paid in full, and Russia. Russia repudiated the debt, \n     owing to its becoming the Union of Soviet Socialist \n     Republics.\n       After WWII, the Allies received German reparations in the \n     form of assets and industrial equipment. Because of \n     disagreements between the USSR and U.S. regarding payments, \n     West and East Germany formed, each paying reparations to \n     their respective political counterpart. The U.S. ended German \n     payments in 1952, the USSR ended payments in 1953. Germany \n     paid reparations to its former allies, against U.S. \n     advisement. The United States collected war reparations from \n     Germany's ally, Japan, through 1949, and renounced all \n     further payments in 1951.\n\n\n                         economic implications\n\n       Iraqi debt differs from German post-war debt in a major \n     way. Germans dealt with a debt twice the size of the \n     country's GDP. Iraq faces debt estimated to be ten times \n     national output (BusinessWeek). The payment of such an amount \n     is near impossible, even with the development and future \n     revenues of oil resources. Placing this burden on a new \n     government cripples Iraq's ability to accumulate capital, \n     expand production, and increase the standard of living. \n     Repudiating this debt also sends the red light to creditors \n     who loan to sketchy governments, in this case, nations whose \n     loans were used to amass Hussein's weaponry and technology. \n     Some argue the new government will have trouble obtaining \n     loans with such history of repudiation. However, no moral \n     hazard issue exists; the loans forgiven belong to Saddam, not \n     the Coalition Provisional Authority or the government that \n     may follow.\n       Those on the opposing bench feel repudiating Saddam's debt \n     will jostle the credit market and create uncertainty now and \n     whenever government turnovers occur. This cannot be the case. \n     Iraq is such a unique situation; few countries, if any, can \n     follow this paradigm.\n       On a side note, Basil Al-Rahim, founder of the Iraq \n     Foundation, Spoke of creating a debt trading system in Iraq. \n     At the June 11, 2003 JEC hearing on transforming Iraq's \n     economy, Al-Rahim spoke of trading debt for points in a \n     system that would use the points in dealings of concessions, \n     licenses, and contracts (see p 20-21 of the JEC transcript).\n\n            TABLE 1.--COUNTRIES TO WHICH IRAQ MAY BE INDEBTED\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               ($bn)       Date       Sources and notes\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAustralia.................  0.5.......  1991......

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator \nBennett, for his comments. He is exactly right. This existing Saddam \nHussein-incurred debt will suffocate Iraq and prevent Iraq from really \nrejoining the world economy, from making significant progress. These \nare countries, including the United States--Canada, Germany, France, \nRussia, and others that have something at stake--sure. But they have \nnever been paid a dime on this debt and, frankly, they will not be. I \nhope they all saddle up and say: We want to have an investment in \nIraq's future. By doing so, we forgive this debt and we will enable \nIraq to start to grow and make some progress.\n  This idea we are going to be debating shortly, that maybe the $20 \nbillion or a portion of the $20 billion should be a loan, that is if \nthis existing debt, is not written off, there is no chance whatsoever \nany additional debt would ever be able to be repaid. We can act as if \nit can be, we can pretend it will be, but it will not be. So this debt \nneeds to be written off.\n  We made a mistake at the conclusion of World War I. The victors \ndidn't write off the debt of the Germans. At the end of World War II, \nwe did write off the debt of the Germans and the Japanese. That was \nsignificant. It was controversial but it was the right thing to do, and \nthis is the right thing, not only for the Western countries, the G8 \ncountries, but also for the Gulf States--for Kuwait, for Saudi Arabia. \nThe Gulf States benefitted greatly because we have eliminated a real \nthreat to them. If it had not been for the U.S. protection, the 1991 \nwar and the war just concluded, their future, their freedom would have \nbeen in jeopardy. So they benefitted probably more than any country and \nthey have every reason, in my opinion, to write off this debt.\n  I hope we will have a unanimous vote, an overwhelming vote from the \nSenate. That would encourage these countries to do the right thing and\n\n[[Page S12688]]\n\nthat would be to write off the debt and not suffocate the Iraqi economy \nfrom being able to rebuild and grow and join the world economy in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Nickles, before he \nyields the floor, would just discuss this with me and answer a couple \nof questions.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the Senator spoke, it dawned on me that none of this \ndebt would be worth 2 cents if the United States had not done what we \ndid.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Where would they get the money, if the United States \nwere not involved in having invaded Iraq, trying to free them and then \ntrying to put their economy back? This debt here would not be worth the \nmatches that it would take to burn it.\n  So I don't think you are just offering a resolution giving some \nkindly advice. It seems to me you are expressing a reality that these \ncountries ought to be very serious before they try to extract from new \nIraq, old Iraq's debt when it would be absolutely useless, based upon \nthe country they lent the money to, and the dictator to whom they lent \nthe money. Right?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to the statement of my friend and colleague, \nhe is exactly right. If one were trying to take this debt or paper on \nthe international market prior to the U.S. liberation of Iraq, it would \nbe worthless because no payments were made on it before. I think it was \ngenerally assumed no payments would be made by the Saddam Hussein \nregime. My colleague from New Mexico is exactly correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So the point of it is that whatever they are having \nthis debtor's conference for, people ought to be thinking about what \nthey are going to be discussing and we ought to be thinking about how \nwe are going to respond.\n  You are offering some kind advice to us, what we ought to be saying, \nright? We ought to be thinking: Well, how long has it been since we \nhave been involved in trying to make this country have some money and \nhave it worthwhile? How many billions have we spent? And that I am for. \nHow many more are we going to spend? And they would have the audacity \nto come to some kind of conference and say, put us on this debtors \nlist; we will take 50 cents on a dollar. Yes, 50 cents on the dollar \nmaybe 30 years from now, or 50, when everything that has gone into \nmaking this country alive again has been taken care of.\n  There are a lot of messages from this simple resolution to these \ncountries. In simplest terms: Forget about it. But in more \nsophisticated terms, the truth is, but for America, what you got is \nworth nothing. That is what I think is important about the resolution. \nI think, rather than just being a typical one that we offer as a \nresolution, I think it is a very important sense of those of us who are \nsharing, with very few countries, the burden of trying to help that \ncountry.\n  Look at all those countries. Where have they been when we have been \ngoing through all this? They have been offering nice words, maybe; call \nthe President and say hello. Maybe they have been sending a little \npostcard. They haven't put up anything yet. Some of them are thinking \nabout it. I hope they keep thinking.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that.\n  You mentioned a couple of these countries. Saudi Arabia has the \nlargest, according to CRS estimates it is $25 billion. They say Kuwait \nmay have $17 billion to $27 billion of Iraqi debt. They are Iraq's \nneighbors. Our liberation of Iraq eliminates a threat to them. I \nbelieve most of that money was lent when Iraq was fighting Iran.\n  Frankly, they should not be insisting on payment. They were never \nrepaid in the past. Nor should U.S. taxpayers or other people who were \nin the process of trying to rebuild Iraq be making contributions \nthinking maybe that will be going to satisfy creditors from the \nprevious regime. That would be a mistake.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand we can get an agreement that \nwe would postpone the vote on the Nickles amendment until we consider \nthe Bayh amendment. By a previous order, that is the next business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the Nickles amendment take \nplace following the debate on the Bayh amendment, and the Bayh \namendment follow that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding staff is preparing a unanimous \nconsent request; is that right?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, we are preparing it, but that will be the \nunderstanding so Members will know there will not be a vote here until \nsometime, at least I would say, 8:30 or 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic leader is here. He has \nagreed, on our side, if we can have the vote at 9 o'clock, and have the \ntime until 9 o'clock equally divided between both sides and at that \ntime have 2 minutes for the amendment of Senator Nickles, equally \ndivided on that amendment, and then 2 minutes prior to the vote on the \nBayh amendment, equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the time would be equally divided between \nnow and 9 o'clock on the Bayh amendment. Is that the proposal?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. There would be no amendments in order to \neither amendment prior to a vote on or in relation to each amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, reserving right to object, could I add \nby unanimous consent that after those two votes I be allowed 30 minutes \nequally divided?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd has been waiting all day for an amendment \nwhich he and Senator Durbin have.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is there a possibility for some time in the morning?\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana that she \nhas been very patient, and she has been here for the last 2 days, and I \nunderstand that. We will do our very best to get her on that as soon as \npossible.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have sent out a hot line for people \nwho want to speak on this amendment. There are 10 Members who want to \nspeak for 5 to 15 minutes. We have really basically 80 minutes left \nbetween now and 9 o'clock. I would suggest we ought to at least make \nthe first vote start at 9:30.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the request I propounded be \nmodified to that effect.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me ask this: I ask unanimous consent that the \npending Nickles amendment be temporarily set aside and Senator Bayh be \nrecognized to offer his amendment; provided further that the time until \n9:30 be equally divided for debate in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 p.m. the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to the Nickles amendment to be followed by a vote \nin relationship to the Bayh amendment with no second-degree amendments \nin order to either amendment, and prior to the votes there be 2 minutes \nequally divided before each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1871\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Ben Nelson, Clinton, \nDorgan, Ensign, Collins, Snowe, Graham of South Carolina, the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh], for himself and Mr. \n     Nelson of Nebraska, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Ensign, Ms. \n     Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Senator \n     Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered 1871.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that funds for reconstruction in Iraq be used for \n                           certain purposes)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Of the amounts appropriated under the \n     subheading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund''--\n       (1) the $5,136,000,000 allocated for security, including \n     public safety requirements, national security, and justice \n     shall be used to rebuild Iraq's security services;\n\n[[Page S12689]]\n\n       (2) $5,168,000,000 shall be available for the purposes, \n     other than security, set out under such subheading; and\n       (3) $10,000,000,000 shall be available to the President to \n     use as loans to Iraq for the purposes, other than security, \n     set out under such subheading until the date on which the \n     President submits the certification described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (b) The President shall submit a notification to Congress \n     if, of the amounts referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of \n     subsection (a), an amount in excess of $250,000,000 is used \n     for any single purpose in Iraq.\n       (c)(1) The certification referred to in subsection (a)(3) \n     is a certification submitted to Congress by the President \n     stating that not less than 90 percent of the total amount of \n     the bilateral debt incurred by the regime of Saddam Hussein \n     has been forgiven by the countries owed such debt.\n       (2) On the date that the President submits the \n     certification described in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) the unobligated balance of the $10,000,000,000 referred \n     to in subsection (a)(3) may be obligated and expended with no \n     requirement that such amount be provided as loans to Iraq; \n     and\n       (B) the President may waive repayment of any amount made as \n     a loan under subsection (a)(3) prior to such date.\n       (d) The head of the Coalition Provisional Authority shall \n     ensure that the amounts appropriated under the subheading \n     ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'', are expended, \n     whether by the United States or by the Governing Counsel in \n     Iraq, for the purposes set out under such subheading and in a \n     manner that the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority \n     does not find objectionable.\n       (e) It is the sense of Congress that each country that is \n     owed bilateral debt by Iraq that was incurred by the regime \n     of Saddam Hussein should--\n       (1) forgive such debt; and\n       (2) provide robust amounts of reconstruction aid to Iraq \n     during the conference of donors scheduled to begin on October \n     23, 2003, in Madrid, Spain and during other conferences of \n     donors of foreign aid.\n       (f) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``amounts appropriated under the subheading \n     `Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund' '' means the amounts \n     appropriated by chapter 2 of this title under the subheading \n     ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'' under the heading \n     ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO \n     THE PRESIDENT''.\n       (2) The term ``Coalition Provisional Authority'' means the \n     entity charged by the President with directing reconstruction \n     efforts in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I also neglected to mention that our \ndistinguished colleague, Byron Dorgan, is an original cosponsor of this \namendment, along with the other distinguished Members I mentioned.\n  Mr. President, the question of Iraq has divided our Nation and this \nSenate for some time now. I count myself in the camp that believes \nremoving Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do. The evidence of \ntorture chambers and mass graves is evidence enough for me. The fact he \ninvaded his neighbors not once but twice and that he would surely have \nthreatened them and the world again which would doubtless require \nAmerican action at some point in the future means to me it is better to \ndeal with him on our terms and at a time of our choosing rather than on \nhis terms and at a time of his choosing.\n  Finally, the fact he previously had and used biological and chemical \nweapons, had a nuclear program, and would almost surely seek to \nreconstitute those programs, even if they had currently been destroyed \nand even if there is a 10-percent chance that weapons of mass death \nwould fall into the hands of suicidal terrorists or would be used by \nregimes like Saddam against a peaceful world, means this is a threat \nbest removed.\n  But regardless of where Members stood on the question of what to do \nabout Iraq toward the war, we are now there. We have no choice but to \nsucceed in our efforts toward reconstituting and rebuilding a more \nstable, a more democratic, and a more secure Iraq. There can be no \nalternative but success.\n  If we are not successful, the southern part of this country will \nprobably reconstitute itself into some sort of radical Shiite state \nclosely aligned with the nation of Iran, the foremost sponsor of terror \nin the world.\n  The northern part of what is currently Iraq would probably be first a \nKurdish entity of some type followed by a Turkish invasion which would \ncreate further chaos in that part of the world.\n  The central part of this troubled land would undoubtedly develop into \nsome chaotic Sunni enclave serving as a base for terror against both \nthe United States and the rest of the peaceful world.\n  We must not let that happen. We must not.\n  I favor, along with my colleagues who have cosponsored this \namendment, aggressive steps to stabilize and create a free, prosperous, \nand diverse Iraq. This means unwavering support for security because we \nunderstand security measures are the essential prerequisite for \ndemocracy, for investments, for commerce, and for the development of \ncivil society in Iraq. It means equally aggressive steps to restart \nIraq's economy and Iraqi society, which is rebuilding schools, \nhospitals, roads, and many other activities.\n  A strong, vibrant Iraqi economy is the foundation which is essential \nto Iraq's stability and our ultimate withdrawal. But if this \nreconstruction is to succeed, it must be conducted on terms that \nmaximize our chances of success in Iraq and terms that are fair and \nequitable to the American people. American perseverance and resolve is \nbeing tested in Iraq today as seldom before, and for that perserverance \nand resolve to be forthcoming we must base our efforts there on \nprinciples of fundamental fairness without which our efforts will be \nimpossible to sustain.\n  Specifically, we have to call upon the other nations of the world to \ndo the right thing with the Iraqi people and for themselves by \nforgiving the loans they extended to Saddam Hussein's tyrannical \nregime, to wipe the slate clean, and to give the Iraqi people a fresh \nstart. It is the moral thing to do.\n\n  Particularly for countries such as France and Germany, which have \npreviously benefited from the rest of the world's largess through the \nMarshall plan, they must now demonstrate similar generosity in the case \nof another country in need--Iraq.\n  If the rest of the world demanded the repayment of Nazi debt or Vichy \ndebt, clearly that would not be tolerable. Neither are the repayments \nof these debts.\n  Second, if you do business by extending loans to dictators, you \nassume the risk of nonrepayment in the event those dictators are \noverthrown. This is truly ``odious debt,'' to use the term employed by \ninternational lawyers. The Iraqi people have a right to repudiate this \ndebt. If they do not, the other nations that incurred it should surely \ndo the right thing by forgiving it.\n  Finally, with regard to the debt forgiveness issue, if Russia, \nFrance, Germany, and the other nations insist upon repayment, then so \nmust we. We can't possibly tolerate a situation where those who propped \nup the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein are repaid their debts but \nthe American people who helped to liberate the country are repaid \nnothing. That would be an outrageous outcome and one our amendment will \nprevent through terms which I will shortly discuss.\n  It also gives us a seat at the table if these other nations are not \nwilling to do the right thing, and it gives us leverage in any further \ndebt restructuring negotiations to insist that they forgive the Iraqi \npeople.\n  Our proposal gives us maximum leverage toward an equitable and fair \noutcome, lower debts for Iraq, a fresh start, but fairness to the \nAmerican people if other nations are not willing to join us in this \ncase.\n  Second, we must also ask the Iraqi people to do what they can to help \nthemselves. This is not a country that is dead broke like some in sub-\nSaharan Africa or Afghanistan. In fact, the nation of Iraq has great \nwealth. It is estimated to be $2.8 trillion to $5.1 trillion. What the \nnation of Iraq has is a cashflow problem, one we should be willing to \nhelp them with. But a temporary cashflow problem is no excuse for not \ndoing what they can to help rebuild themselves to the extent they are \ncapable and, as I have just mentioned, they have great capabilities.\n  This is compounded by the fact that when the Iraqis finally are able \nto sell oil in some quantity on the international markets, they will \nsell it at a price that is not set by a free market but which is \ninstead dictated in large part by a cartel known as OPEC--giving them \nthe ability to reap profits from that not once but twice if our loans \nare given first in the form of monopoly oil payments and, second, if we \njust give them the cash.\n  This is particularly inequitable if other nations do not forgive \ntheir debt and essentially contribute nothing at\n\n[[Page S12690]]\n\nall when the American taxpayers are being asked and the American \nconsumers have been asked and required to contribute not once but \ntwice.\n  Our amendment calls for three steps: First, the immediate provision \nof $5 billion to meet the immediate security needs of the nation of \nIraq because we understand that we should err on the side of being more \naggressive than less when it comes to stabilizing that country, ending \nthe bloodshed and violence, and allowing the Iraqi people to get on \nwith commerce, civil society, free elections, and the other things that \nwill head them in the proper direction.\n  Second, we would propose providing $5 billion in terms of an \nimmediate grant to meet the eminent reconstruction needs. The World \nBank has estimated this would provide almost the entirety of the funds \nto be absorbed by Iraq for reconstruction over the next year. It is our \nproposal to err on the side of being more generous rather than less in \nproviding the Iraqi economy with momentum, an immediate jump-start, \npriming the pump to get things going. The first $10 billion would be $5 \nbillion to meet the immediate security needs of Iraq in the form of a \ngrant, $5 billion to meet the immediate reconstruction needs, those \nthat we envision over the next year in terms of an immediate grant.\n  The third provision would be in the form of a $10 billion loan for \nlong-term reconstruction needs of the Government and the people of Iraq \nto be forgiven whenever the other nations of the world that extended \ndebt to the regime of Saddam Hussein are willing to forgive up to 90 \npercent of those sovereign debts. Again, that will maximize and provide \nan incentive for those nations to do the right thing and give us a seat \nat the table and leverage to insist they do the right thing in the \nevent they are dragging their feet in doing so.\n  Doubtless we have heard several arguments against our approach. Let \nme address them briefly.\n  First, the argument that our amendment should not be adopted because \nwe would merely add to the already burdensome debt facing the people of \nIraq estimated to be between $100 and $130 billion. Let me say clearly \nthat, on the contrary, our approach seeks to eliminate, minimize, do \naway with the outstanding burdens facing the Iraqi people and gives us \na seat at the table and maximum leverage to accomplish the objective to \ndo the right thing, giving the country a free start.\n  Second, we have a recent example in the case of Argentina. There, a \ndemocracy with a freely elected government voluntarily incurred \nunsustainable debt. They chose to default recently upon their debts and \nwere rewarded within 48 hours by a new agreement from the International \nMonetary Fund. Argentines are seeking up to 75-percent reduction from \ntheir creditors of their outstanding debts. In the private sector, it \nwould be known as a cram-down. They threatened to default entirely and \nare now demanding the creditors forgive the loans. Surely what is good \nenough for the people of Argentina, who did not exercise physical \nadequate fiscal control over their affairs, should at least be good \nenough for the people of Iraq who have had the burdens imposed upon \nthem by a tyrannical dictator.\n  Next, it is the principled thing to do. Surely we cannot allow a \nstate of affairs to exist where those who helped sustain the regime of \nSaddam Hussein are repaid, but the American taxpayers who helped to \nliberate the country are not. This would be an outrageous outcome and \none that our amendment seeks to prohibit.\n  The second argument offered against our proposal is that there is no \nIraqi Government currently in power to take on these obligations. \nReally? Can it possibly be argued by others that the obligations of \nSaddam Hussein are more legitimate than the decisions undertaken by the \nnewly empowered Iraqi Council? How can that possibly be? Is it possible \nto say that the obligations of Saddam Hussein should be enforced but \nthose undertaken by the council should not? Obviously not. No one \nelected Saddam Hussein. How can he be given more legitimacy and more \ncredence than the new council of the newly liberated Iraq? Obviously, \nthat is something that cannot be allowed to happen. Our amendment is \nperfectly consistent with not allowing that to happen.\n\n  Finally, the new council is perfectly empowered to apply the freedom \nof the people of Iraq by enforcing its laws against a variety of \ncriminal activities. They are empowered to hold elections. They are \nempowered to draft a constitution. How can it possibly be that they are \nnot allowed to take out a simple loan on behalf of the people of their \ncountry? Obviously, that is an illogical inconsistency to those who \nadhere to the argument there is no Iraqi entity in power to take on the \nobligations.\n  Finally, we hear repeatedly the argument requiring some of these \nobligations to be undertaken in the form of a loan if other countries \nare not willing to forgive their debts. That would feed the perception \nalive in the Middle East and across the Islamic world that our \nactivities in Iraq were solely about the Iraqi oil. This is a slippery \nand dangerous slope. If we begin to tread down that line of argument, \nno telling where we will end up.\n  For starters, this is clearly a lie. We all know it. The American \npeople did not shed their blood in Iraq, we have not spent our treasure \nthere to seize the Iraqi oil. This is a malicious falsehood and one \nthat we cannot possibly allow to influence our deliberations in this \ngreat body.\n  Second, how can someone seriously argue that false opinions in other \ncountries should set the public policy of a great Nation like the \nUnited States of America? What precedent would this set for this body \nand for our people? Should we stop the hunt for Osama bin Laden because \nit is popularly believed in other parts of the world that the attack on \nSeptember 11 was designed as a zionist plot against our country? There \nhave been polls on Al-Jazeera indicating a majority in some nations in \nthat part of that world believe this canard. Should we allow that to \naffect the activities of our country? Obviously no. That would be \noutrageous.\n  Should we end our alliance with the State of Israel and form one with \nthe Palestinians and Yasser Arafat because popular opinion in that part \nof the world would have us do so? Of course we cannot do that. The \npolicies of the United States of America must be based upon the \nprinciples to which our great country has always adhered. We must base \nour policies upon the truth, upon the facts, and not the misguided \nbeliefs of others.\n  We know our intentions in Iraq have always been honorable. This \namendment is perfectly consistent with those intentions. Should we not \ndo the right thing because of the misguided arguments about public \nopinion elsewhere in the world?\n  Finally, this argument is obviously a demonstrable mathematical \nfalsehood. This is in repayment, not a confiscation or an \nappropriation. If I give you $100 and say that I am going to give you \n$50 of it as a grant, and I am even willing to forgive the other $50 \nand make that a grant, if another creditor is willing to forgive $100 \nthat he has also given you, how can that possibly be characterized as a \nconfiscation or expropriation of your property? Obviously, it is not.\n\n  So, in conclusion, let me say our amendment provides for the \naggressive help that the Iraqi people need to meet their pressing \nsecurity needs. Our amendment provides for generous and substantial \nhelp to meet the pressing reconstruction burdens facing that country. \nIt gets them on their feet, provides them with a fresh start, and \nprimes the pump for increased commercial activity there that is \nimportant to the success of our endeavor. But it does so in a way that \nis consistent with the principles of fairness to the American people \nand in a way that maximizes the prospects from the success of these \nmoneys in the nation of Iraq, without which this endeavor, these funds, \nthe blood and treasure that we have expended to date, will have gone \nfor naught. That is something we must avoid. That is something this \namendment will avoid.\n  Therefore, I ask our colleagues' support, and I thank my cosponsors.\n  I am pleased to yield time to others who have so patiently waited to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BAYH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the chief sponsor of the bill. It \nhas been\n\n[[Page S12691]]\n\na pleasure working with him and others in a bipartisan manner on this \nimportant amendment.\n  I understand there are deep feelings on both sides of this amendment. \nThis is a fundamental, legitimate disagreement on policy: What is the \nbest way to go forward for the United States, with the same goals in \nmind--that goal being that we have a stable Iraq in the future--that is \nin the interest of all Americans?\n  It is worth doing the $87 billion investment that the President has \nrequested, the rebuilding of Iraq. All who support this amendment are \nin support of that concept because we think it is important to have a \nstable type of government, whatever that will be in Iraq, democracy or \nwhatever they choose. It is important to have that for the stability of \nthe region and for the spread of freedom and freedom-loving people, \nespecially in that part of the world which up to this point has only \nknown rule under dictatorship.\n  I will make a couple of points about the bill. Of around $20 \nbillion--and I will use the round numbers--$5 billion was recognized \nfor security needs for the Iraqi Government; in other words, money to \ntrain and get security forces and an army in place as quickly as \npossible. Everyone recognized that is in the direct interest of the \nUnited States because every person put in place, every Iraqi put in \nplace, allows an American not to be in harm's way. So there is no \nquestion that everybody agreed that $5 billion should be in the form of \na grant.\n\n  With other sponsors of the bill, we had a little disagreement on the \nnext $5 billion. But basically around $5.2 billion is needed in the \nfirst 12 months. And working together, in a bipartisan fashion, we \nwanted to make sure the President had the maximum flexibility for that \nnext $5 billion, so we decided to make that in a grant as well. We did \nnot want to get caught up in any bureaucracies or any kinds of \nproblems, so that Ambassador Bremer could go ahead, fund what he needs \nto fund right now, get everything started over the next 12 months, and \nget Iraq on the road to recovery.\n  Now, the next $10 billion is the part that we said we think is best \nto do in the form of a loan. First of all, that is not the money that \nis needed right away, so we have some time on that. But another point \non this--and my colleague from Indiana said it well when he talked \nabout we are not trying to undermine the President; we are actually \ntrying to strengthen the President's hand.\n  Let me make a couple comments about the President and the \nadministration in the job they have done in handling the war in Iraq \nand postwar Iraq.\n  I think the President and his administration, the Department of \nDefense, and, obviously, our military have performed in a spectacular \nmanner. Have there been problems? Absolutely. There always are \nproblems, and they have adjusted to the problems. They have handled an \nincredibly difficult situation. And especially the President has shown \ngreat leadership through the entire process. It is incredibly \nchallenging in that part of the world to deal with different cultural \nproblems than we are used to dealing with in this country.\n  So we are trying to strengthen the President's hand. And that is what \nmany of us believe this amendment will do. When we are going out and we \nare asking other countries to put in grants, we are saying: We, the \ntaxpayers of the United States, are putting up $10 billion in grants. \nBut a lot of countries are also owed money, and so is the United States \nright now. We are owed money. We, the sponsors of this amendment, \nbelieve that Iraq would be best off going forward if they had no debt.\n  We believe the best way to ensure they will have no debt is if the \nPresident is able to go forward with a $10 billion loan from the United \nStates and is able to look at those other countries and say: We gave \n$10 billion in grants; We have a $10 billion loan here; and we are \nwilling to forgive that $10 billion loan if you will.\n  But why should the American taxpayer--when the oil starts producing \nrevenue, when people start actually paying their power bills, when \nother things start generating revenues in Iraq, why should the American \ntaxpayer not be paid back if the taxpayer in France, if the taxpayer in \nGermany, if the taxpayer in Russia--countries that were not willing to \nsupport us when we were doing what was right in the world--why should \nthose taxpayers be paid back and not the taxpayers of America?\n  That is really the whole point of this, which is, if we can give the \nPresident the leverage, he can do the best job he can to try to provide \nIraq going forward with as little debt as possible. But if these other \ncountries will not forgive the debt, then the American taxpayer will \nhave a chance to be paid back. And that is what the fundamental purpose \nof the language in the amendment really is.\n\n  I want to make just a couple of comments about some of these other \ncountries in the world that are owed this money. Remember, we are \nloaning this money to a legitimate government in the future in Iraq. \nThis is a legitimate, democratically elected government going forward, \na free people going forward that the loan is going to.\n  Who did France, Germany, Russia, and others loan that money to? An \nillegitimate regime, the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. And the \nargument that they should be paid back for loaning a brutal dictator \nmoney, and the American people not paid back for loaning a legitimate \nfree people money, is just very difficult to justify for this Senator. \nThat is why this Senator is so strongly supportive of this amendment.\n  We hope this amendment is adopted. We think it has a good chance of \nbeing adopted tonight.\n  So I will close by saying that working across the aisle, doing what \nis right--and I have heard people say, you are just trying to pander to \npeople back home. Frankly, I do not know how many people back home are \neven paying attention. On a night like tonight, I think most people are \ngoing to pay attention to the Red Sox and the Yankees and not to what \nwe are doing here.\n  In a bipartisan fashion, we are just doing what we believe is right. \nAnd the people on the other side of this issue believe what they are \ndoing is right. It is OK to fundamentally disagree. What I hope does \nnot happen in this debate tonight is that we impugn each other's \nmotives. There are true, fundamental differences of belief on the way \nwe should go forward.\n  We are presenting one alternative that we believe strongly we should \ngo forward with. So I hope the debate stays on a high ground, and let \nthe votes fall where they may. That is the kind of debate we need in \nthe Senate.\n  I thank the chief sponsor of this bill for yielding me time, and I \nyield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague for his \ncomments and his leadership.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this has been a truly bipartisan \nundertaking by those of us who supported this effort in Iraq from the \nbeginning, members on your side of the aisle and members on my side of \nthe aisle.\n  So I commend my colleague for his leadership and his courage. It is a \npleasure to work with him.\n  I now yield time to our distinguished colleague from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nIndiana for the opportunity to speak in support of this amendment. I \nthank my colleagues who are cosponsoring this amendment: Senators \nEnsign, Collins, Snowe, Lindsey Graham, and the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Chambliss. It is a pleasure to be working with them in a \nbipartisan way on what I think is an important point to the American \npeople and an important point as a message to the world.\n  When the President delivered his address announcing the $87 billion \nhe would ask Congress to approve for postwar military operations and \nconstruction and reconstruction in Iraq, known as the supplemental, \nthere was clearly a collective gasp from the American people. This was \nprimarily because I do not believe the American public was prepared, \nbefore the war, for the cost of reconstruction after the war.\n  Americans clearly want our mission in Iraq to succeed. We cannot \nfail. And\n\n[[Page S12692]]\n\nwe want our young men and women to come home safely. Now our No. 1 \npriority must be that we do everything in our power to make sure that \nhappens in a fiscally responsible way for the United States and Iraq.\n  The American role in the liberation of Iraq planted the seeds for \ndemocracy. The creation of the Coalition Provisional Authority, led by \nAmbassador Bremer, and the interim Iraqi Governing Council, have laid \nthe foundation for what I hope will be a lasting Iraqi Republic.\n  Now is the time to seek greater international support for security, \nperhaps through NATO, as I have previously suggested, and also to seek \nmore international support through the United Nations, to help \ndemocracy and freedom in Iraq by the drafting of a constitution, the \nholding of legitimate elections, and the participation by all Iraqis in \nthe political process.\n  Funds for military operations must not be delayed and should be \nquickly appropriated so that the 140,000 American troops in theater, \nand those supporting them, will have the tools they need to do their \njob.\n  Our soldiers should not be held hostage because of deliberations on \ncontroversial portions of this supplemental.\n  The reconstruction funding the President requested may be the \nappropriate amount to accomplish our goals. However, as we have all \nindicated, we have concerns with the way the funding is being made to \nthe Iraqis. The President's reconstruction request simply gives money \nto Iraq as a grant. It asks the American taxpayer to pick up the entire \ncost for postwar construction with the hope that we will get others to \nbe donors in this process. It asks nothing from the international \ncommunity at the present time, and certainly it asks nothing of Iraq in \nreturn.\n  The United States liberated Iraq, but should reconstruction become \nthe sole responsibility of the American people with the expectation and \nthe hope we might get additional contributions from the donors \nconference? Furthermore, the question can be, Is that the best for \nIraq? I don't think so.\n  The amendment we offer today will ask that the international \ncommunity do more to aid Iraq in their reconstruction, while \nsimultaneously easing the financial burden that Iraq now carries \nbecause of the policies of a brutal tyrant. In contrast to the \nadministration's proposed total direct grant, which does not ask Iraq \nto contribute financially to its own recovery, this amendment is both \ngenerous and fair.\n  As my colleague from Indiana has indicated, the amendment first \nprovides for a grant covering $5 billion for building Iraq's security \nservices. That is a grant. And it provides $5.2 billion in emergency \neconomic assistance. That is a grant. It also asks the administration \nto notify all relevant congressional committees of every $250 million \nobligated out of the $5.2 billion so that there is some transparency \nand accountability on how these dollars are going to be spent.\n  Most importantly, our proposal asks America to negotiate with the \nworld on behalf of Iraq. Iraq, unfortunately, due to the tyrannical \npowers and programs of Saddam Hussein, owes money in reparations to \nKuwait and Saudi Arabia. It also has debts to France and Russia \nprimarily for military purposes. France and Russia are owed $6 billion \nand $6.9 billion, respectively. Saudi Arabia is owed approximately $25 \nbillion. This is debt that was incurred by Iraq as a result of the \ntyrannical forces, powers, and programs of Saddam Hussein.\n  Our colleague from Oklahoma has proposed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which will be voted on later this evening, as will this \namendment. He has asked that we request the countries that own the debt \nto forgive the debt. I think that is a start that is halfway to the \nconclusion that this amendment brings us. But it is only halfway. It is \nasking rather than providing leverage where I think we will absolutely \nhave the opportunity to seek the forgiveness of this debt. So that if \nFrance, Russia, and others can forgive Iraq's debt, the international \ncommunity would consider this as a positive step toward independence. \nThis immense gesture would enable the Iraqi economic engine to become \nenergized, free of a burden most Iraqis never wanted in the first \nplace.\n  It is estimated as well that Iraq's proven oil reserves are worth \n$2.8 trillion and its potential oil reserves might be worth $5.5 \ntrillion. Freeing the Iraqis of their prewar debt would help them use \ntheir oil resources immediately to provide for their people and their \nreconstruction.\n  Our amendment is the only amendment offered that directly addresses \nthe issue of Iraqi debt. Our amendment provides an incentive to those \nnations to forgive Iraq of its Saddam-era debt. It is my hope the \nadministration and the Iraqi Governing Council will be able to \nsatisfactorily and successfully negotiate with the international \ncommunity to eliminate 90 percent of the prewar bilateral Iraqi debt. \nIf those negotiations are indeed successful, this amendment would \nprovide that the remaining $10 billion in reconstruction funding to the \nIraqi people would be in the form of a grant. It will be convertible \nfrom a loan to a grant in exchange for the forgiveness of 90 percent of \nthe prewar bilateral Iraqi debt.\n  If the negotiations are unsuccessful, which we hope they would not \nbe, then the $10 billion will be appropriated as a long-term loan to \nthe Iraqi Governing Council and all prewar debts will be subordinated \nto the U.S. postwar debt of $10 billion. This would allow the Iraqi \npeople to get the same jump-start on rebuilding their country while \ndelaying their payments to us and the world until this Iraqi nation has \nestablished an economy and can meet its responsibilities to the world \ncommunity. The loan would be secured by revenues from Iraqi oil exports \nin the future.\n  There are some who will charge that making reconstruction funds \navailable as a loan is evidence that the United States is after Iraq's \noil. In my estimation, they will hold that contention regardless of \nwhat we do or don't do in regard to funding reconstruction. In fact, \nthe use of the funds to rebuild within Iraq is evidence to the \ncontrary. But even if we can't prove to the rest of the world that we \nare not after the oil, we must pursue a loan approach as we are \nproposing.\n  I can understand that the administration does not want to add to the \ndebt of the Iraqi people. This isn't, as long as the prewar Saddam \nHussein indebtedness is forgiven. We owe it to our taxpayers to be just \nas concerned about growing our budget deficit as we are about Iraq's \ndeficit.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in support of this generous and fair \namendment, recognizing that those who said an entity doesn't exist, \nthat that argument just doesn't wash. If it exists for a grant, it \nexists for a loan. There are those who have said we are loading it up \nwith debt. It is just the opposite. They have even cited post-World War \nI Germany with the debt that was added there. The intent here is to \nclear the debt, to clear it up so we put Iraq on a firm financial \nfooting as it moves forward. All we ask is the help of the other \nnations.\n  This provides leverage to go to the donors conference and say: We are \nprepared to make a grant. We just want to make sure the debt that is \nexisting prior to the war, the Saddam-era debt, is forgiven.\n  I appreciate the opportunity. It is a pleasure to work with my \ncolleagues. I thank my colleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, we are grateful for the leadership and the \neloquence of our colleague from Nebraska. He was a successful \nbusinessman, an outstanding Governor, and now a very wise Member of \nthis body. I thank him for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BAYH. I am pleased to yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I give my remarks, let me thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard to craft \nthis amendment. It has been a great pleasure to work with all of them. \nI believe the proposal we are advancing this evening not only reflects \na great deal of thought and deliberation but is by far the best policy \nwe could pursue.\n  The Senate is engaged in a historic debate: the consideration of the \nmost comprehensive package of military and foreign reconstruction \nassistance since the Marshall plan. The administration has asked the \nCongress to appropriate $87 billion, some of which would go to\n\n[[Page S12693]]\n\nAfghanistan, but the vast majority would go for Iraq.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I visited Iraq \nlast July. I am well aware of the urgent need for additional funding to \nsupport our troops. Rogue elements operating in Iraq, whether it is the \nremnants of the Baathist regime or terrorists from other countries, \nendanger our troops and threaten to undermine our efforts to establish \na prosperous and democratic society. It is imperative that our troops \nhave all the support they need to be as safe and as effective as \npossible. In that regard, it is indeed heartening that the $66 billion \nincluded in this package that will be used to support our troops enjoys \nwidespread support.\n\n  The stakes are very high. We simply cannot fail in Iraq. The \nsacrifices of our young men and women in uniform cannot be in vain. \nThis funding will help to support their efforts and to ensure their \nsuccess.\n  I also recognize that Iraq needs our assistance in constructing a \nmodern infrastructure and rebuilding its security services. There are \n$20 billion included in this bill targeted for those purposes. I note \nthe significance of that amount; it is more than our entire foreign aid \nbudget. So this is a very significant assistance package we are \nconsidering tonight.\n  It is vital that basic services be restored to the Iraqi people as \nsoon as possible so that their hardships do not continue. Without \nreliable electricity and clean water, the Iraqi people cannot rebuild \ntheir lives, their country, and their economy. I believe there are, \nhowever, ways to structure this assistance to provide the Iraqis with \nthe help they need while lessening the impact on the American taxpayer. \nThat is the goal of the bipartisan amendment we have put forth this \nevening.\n  While I fully support the President's overall budget request, we have \nan obligation to explore ways to lessen the burden on the American \ntaxpayer. To accomplish this goal, our amendment proposes that part of \nthis assistance be provided to the Iraqi people in the form of a loan, \nto be repaid at some point in the future when Iraq once again becomes \nthe prosperous nation it has the capacity to be.\n  When I visited Iraq, I was struck by how little damage the war \nactually inflicted on the infrastructure of that nation. I saw \nfirsthand evidence of how our precision weaponry and the care our \ntroops took were successful in targeting installations that posed a \nthreat to our troops or supported the regime of Saddam Hussein while \nsparing the civilian community.\n  I was also struck, however, by the dreadfully poor infrastructure of \ncommunities throughout the nation. Basic elements of a modern nation, \nsuch as the electricity, clean water, schools, hospitals, roads, and \nbridges, were ignored by Saddam Hussein as he looted the country and \nleft it in shambles. In fact, when you think about it, what we are \nreally talking about is construction costs, not reconstruction. Iraq \nlacks many of the elements of a modern and well-functioning \ninfrastructure.\n  I do not believe it is in any way unfair to ask the Iraqi people to \ninvest in their own future by repaying the American taxpayers some of \nthe funding used to construct their infrastructure, particularly when \nthey clearly will have the ability someday to do so, for Iraq is not \nAfghanistan; Iraq has an educated population, abundant natural \nresources and, most notably, the second largest oil reserves in the \nworld.\n  The administration projects that Iraq will be generating $20 billion \nin annual oil revenue within just 2 years. With such economic assets, \nIraq undoubtedly one day will have the financial wherewithal to repay \nthis loan. Moreover, asking the Iraqis to take some responsibility for \nrebuilding their own country will help give them a sense of ownership, \nincreasing the chances that our reconstruction efforts will endure long \nafter our troops have returned home.\n  One of the arguments put forth by opponents of the loan concept is \nthat Iraq is already burdened with an estimated $100 billion to $125 \nbillion in debt from Saddam Hussein's regime. But what is often left \nout is that some of the largest holders of that debt are Saudi Arabia, \nFrance, Germany, and Russia. If it were up to the leaders of three of \nthose nations, the Iraqi people would still be suffering under the \nbrutal and repressive regime of Saddam Hussein.\n\n  The American people will be justifiably outraged if one dime of their \nmoney is sent to France while the American people are pouring millions \nof their hard-earned tax dollars into rebuilding Iraq. France, Germany, \nand Russia should not be paid for the debts incurred by one of the most \ndespicable and violent leaders in decades while the American taxpayer \ninvests billions in the rebuilding and stabilization of Iraq.\n  I also point out that structuring our assistance as loans is not \nwithout precedent. Most of the large-scale infrastructure projects \nundertaken in postconflict Bosnia have been administered through the \nWorld Bank in the form of loans with reasonable repayment conditions. \nIf this approach is not hindering the reconstruction of Bosnia, the \nsame surely should hold true for Iraq, a country with far greater \neconomic resources.\n  That is why we have joined this evening to offer this amendment. This \namendment ensures that the American taxpayer will eventually be \nreimbursed for a portion of our investment in Iraq. Under our proposal, \n$10 billion in our construction assistance will be made available for \nuse as loans while the other $10 billion will be available as grants.\n  So you can see we have taken a very reasonable, moderate approach in \nconstructing this amendment. By making available $5 billion in grants \nfor rebuilding Iraq's security services and yet another $5 billion to \njump start the reconstruction process, our approach ensures that the \nadministration has the funds necessary to address the immediate and \npressing needs.\n  Furthermore, the amendment requires the administration to notify \ncongressional committees after the expenditure of every $250 million of \nthe funds. This provision will help to enhance accountability. The \nPresident is then authorized to use the remaining $10 billion as loans \nto the Iraqi Governing Council or its successor.\n  Here is an important provision of our amendment. We say that if, \nhowever, 90 percent of Iraq's bilateral foreign debt is forgiven, then \nthe remaining assistance will be converted to grants and the loans \nalready obligated will be forgiven. So this is a very generous \nproposal.\n  This provision will encourage other countries to forgive at least a \nportion of their debt and ensure that we are not financing the \nrebuilding of Iraq's infrastructure while nations that loaned money to \nSaddam Hussein are repaid.\n  In addition, the amendment includes a sense-of-the-Senate provision \nencouraging all the nations to forgive their pre-liberation bilateral \ndebt and to provide robust levels of reconstruction aid to postwar Iraq \nat the upcoming donors conference.\n  The American people are very generous. They not only want to give our \ntroops the support they need but they want to provide help to the Iraqi \npeople. The American people understand that Iraq cannot repay this \nmoney immediately. That is not what we are asking. But the American \ntaxpayer does deserve to be repaid eventually for some of our \ninvestment in this country. And Iraq deserves to be treated as a \ncountry that has the enormous economic potential that it clearly has. \nStructuring our reconstruction assistance as a loan is a reasonable \napproach that satisfies both concerns.\n  Again, I acknowledge the hard work of the group of Senators, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, who have worked very hard to come up \nwith what I believe is a commonsense approach to this aid package.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to tell my colleagues who \ndebated on the other side of the issue that I have great respect for \ntheir position. I just happen to disagree with it.\n  I stated some time ago that I had hoped a significant portion of the \n$20\n\n[[Page S12694]]\n\nbillion for reconstruction of Iraq could be in the form of a loan. I \nwould like to see that be the case. I just happen to think, upon \nfurther review, that it is not possible now. It might be possible a \nyear from now, but it is not possible now, at least in my opinion.\n  There is no government in Iraq today. Hopefully, there will be. It is \nour objective to have a democracy in Iraq. It is our objective to have \nIraq run by Iraqis. There is nobody in Iraq who can sign a note and \nsay: We will borrow $10 billion and pay you back. Nobody. I guess one \ncould say Ambassador Bremer could do it.\n  I listened to Ambassador Bremer, and I have great confidence in him. \nI think he has done a great job. This amendment is saying we know \nbetter than he does. He happens to be living in Iraq. He is working \nthere. He is risking his life daily. I don't know how many \nassassination attempts have been made on his life and on the lives of \nthe people working with him. I actually have a former staff member who \nis working in the Iraqi government. She is fluent in Arabic. I happen \nto think they have made a good choice.\n  Maybe in the future loans can be made, but right now there is not an \nIraqi government. There is no one to sign the note. There is no one who \ncan say: We will make payments and pay this back.\n  Frankly, if one looks at their current situation--Iraq is a country \nthat was so ignored by Saddam Hussein, so devastated by his terrible \nplundering of the country for military purposes, that their ability to \npay back debt is nonexistent for some time.\n\n  Iraq has inherited a lot of debt. I have an amendment we will be \nvoting on shortly that says countries that own Saddam Hussein's \nincurred debt should forgive that debt. I hope that amendment will be \nsupported, and I hope that will send a signal to those countries that \nhold some of that paper.\n  That paper is worthless. Saddam Hussein did not make payments on it. \nThere is no way in the world future Iraqis could inherit that debt and \nprosper. So it needs to be written off.\n  If we say, before you write that off, we want to add another $10 \nbillion, even though you don't have a government, we want to add \nanother $10 billion on top of that, and, oh, yes, we want to be paid \nback, but we want you to write off the $100 billion or the $150 billion \nof debt previously owned, I think that complicates that message.\n  Maybe I am wrong, but when we are saying we want to lend $10 billion \nand we want to be paid off, but you other countries who hold a bunch of \nIraqi debt, you should forgive that, I think it will get lost in the \ntranslation. This amendment says $10 billion will be released when and \nif 90 percent of that debt is forgiven. Maybe it is a carrot, maybe it \nis an incentive that $10 billion will never be spent. I do know there \nis not a government that can sign this note. There is not an Iraqi \ngovernment that can make the payment. Maybe it will make people feel \nbetter to say it is a loan, but there is nobody to sign that note. \nThere is nobody who has the authority and who is supported by the Iraqi \npeople who can say: Yes, we will be making these payments.\n  Likewise, it greatly complicates our efforts to get other countries \nthat currently hold worthless Iraqi paper to write off that debt. They \nare going to say: United States, if you are going to take on $10 \nbillion of loans and you expect to be paid, then we expect to be paid. \nI think it will greatly complicate efforts to get other countries to \nwrite off their debt.\n  Let me say this about Ambassador Bremer. He has done a fantastic job. \nDo we support him or not? I asked Secretary Powell yesterday: Is there \na government in Iraq that can pay this note back?\n  He said no.\n  Is there anybody there who can pay this note back?\n  He said no. That is our Secretary of State.\n  I asked basically the same questions of Ambassador Bremer. Is this \npossible?\n  He said no. He was strongly urging us to go the grant approach; give \nthem the flexibility to get this country going, not complicate their \nefforts when they are trying to get other countries to write off some \nof the existing worthless debt.\n  I have confidence in Ambassador Bremer. I have confidence in \nSecretary Powell. I think this amendment is very well intended. Again, \nI have no complaints whatsoever about the authors of this amendment. I \nrespect them greatly as colleagues, but I think they made a mistake, \nand I urge our colleagues to vote no on this amendment when we vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to start off with a quote from Winston \nChurchill and people are going to say: Why on Earth would I be quoting \nWinston Churchill in this regard as to whether or not we will come to \nthe assistance of the Iraqis with a loan or a grant? But I think it has \napplication, and it refers back to what the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana said. I would like to repeat what the Senator from Oklahoma has \nstated. I have nothing but admiration for the work the Senator from \nIndiana and others who have spoken to this amendment have done on this \nissue. Senator Bayh is a very valued member of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Let me get back to my point, and that is, Churchill said on hearing \nabout the attack on Pearl Harbor--if you stop and think about it, 9/11 \nis our modern-day Pearl Harbor, so I think it is an apt quote. He said:\n\n       Silly people, that was the description many gave in \n     discounting the force of the United States. Some said they \n     were soft, others that they would never be united, that they \n     would never come to grips, they would never stand \n     bloodletting, that their system of government and democracy \n     would paralyze their war effort.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n     that their system of government and democracy would paralyze \n     their war effort.\n       Now we will see the weakness of this numerous but remote, \n     wealthy and very talkative people.\n\n  Then Churchill said:\n\n       But, I had studied the American Civil War fought out to the \n     last desperate inch. American blood flowed in my veins. I \n     thought of a remark made to me years before--the United \n     States is like a gigantic boiler. Once the fire of freedom is \n     lighted under it, there is no limit to the power it can \n     generate. It is a matter of resolve.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       It is a matter of resolve.\n\n  Why do I bring up the Churchill quote and the issue of resolve in \nregard to whether or not we apply a grant or a loan to the Iraqi \npeople?\n  I think it is a question of resolve in the eyes of more especially \nthose in the Arab world, more especially the Iraqis. In the last 2 \ndays, I have had visits from three ambassadors. I am not going to go \ninto their names or countries. It was a confidential discussion. \nObviously, they were countries directly involved in this whole effort. \nThey asked me quite frankly about American resolve. They asked me about \nthe whole WMD issue, whether or not the American people still had the \nresolve to see this through.\n  Then they asked me about this loan situation and this grant \nsituation. They were very mindful of the attitude the Senator from \nIndiana already spoke to that there will be those in the Arab world, \nour adversaries, if you will, who will interpret this as a grab that \nthey originally described as to why the United States became involved \nin this conflict--a grab for the oil of Iraq.\n  On April 8, 2003, the President and the Prime Minister of Britain \nsaid in a joint statement regarding the future of Iraq:\n\n       We reaffirm our commitment to protect Iraqi's natural \n     resources, as the patrimony of the people of Iraq, which \n     should be used only for their benefit.\n\n  U.S. interests in Iraq lie solely with the development of a free and \ndemocratic nation. Congress should not now add a condition of our \ninvolvement that suggests the United States had an interest in Iraqi \noil all along. Using the Iraq's oil as collateral for loans would play \nnow into the hands of those who wrongly attributed an oil motive. That \nis in reference to a statement made by both the President and the Prime \nMinister of Britain.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Indiana said that is not true. I \ndo not\n\n[[Page S12695]]\n\nthink it is true either, but I think it is true in the minds of many \nArab leaders. I do not know who is paying attention to this debate \ntonight. There are not many Members present. We are going to have a \nvote later, but most Americans are probably watching the playoffs in \nregard to the World Series, so I doubt if too many people are paying \nattention.\n  I tell my colleagues who will pay attention: Every intelligence \ncommunity and every Arab leader in the world will go over every word of \nwhat we say tonight. I have had three ambassadors come to me wondering \nabout the resolve of the United States and are we reneging in regard to \nour support for the war. Rightly or wrongly, I think that is a real \nproblem.\n  I think we also have a real problem with the timing of this in regard \nto the loan, just as the President goes overseas, goes to the donors \nconference. People say, well, this will allow us a seat at the table. \nMy colleagues, we are the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes. Does he \nrequest more time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I request an additional 30 seconds, if that would be \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. In summing up, I support the amendment that has been \nintroduced by the Senator from Oklahoma and would say it is a matter of \nresolve in the eyes of the Arab world. It is much larger than Iraq and \nmuch larger than a $10 billion loan or $5 billion here or $5 billion \nthere. In fact, it will be viewed in the Arab world, in the Arab \ncommunity, as a test of America's resolve, and I do not want us to fail \nthat test.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, probably by the end of \nthe week, if things stay the way they have been, unfortunately we will \nhave some injured troops and maybe some will lose their lives.\n  There is a resolve by the American people and this body to stay the \ncourse. If anybody has looked at what we have done in a reasonable, \nrational manner--and that is all I ask the world to do--they will see \ngreat resolve on our part. The biggest contribution we have made to the \nIraqi people has nothing to do with money. It is the 350, somewhere in \nthat number, growing by the day, young men and women. That is our \nbiggest contribution. We have spent a lot of money, a billion dollars a \nweek, to try to transform a country from tyranny to civility, and the \nmiddle is chaos. We are making great improvements. That is an honest \nstatement.\n  Having been to Iraq, one can see the resolve in the soldiers' eyes. I \ndare say there may be some men and women in the Armed Forces who are so \ndecent that they would say: Give the Iraqi people money, we do not want \nto be paid back. That is the strength of our country.\n  We are in it for the long haul. There is more dying to come. There is \nmore money to be spent. If we try to build up the infrastructure in the \nnext months to come, chances are it will be attacked because we have \nnot secured the country yet. To expect it to be secured in 6 months is \nimpossible, because the Iraqi Army and all the bad people who are in it \nhave gone into the civilian population.\n  Senator McConnell is right; they are not just killing Americans. They \nare killing people who are trying to transform the country into \ndemocracy.\n  People may say, oh, this loan proves they were over there for our \noil. I cannot tell my colleagues how much it bothers me to hear that \nbecause my colleagues know it is not true and I know it is not true. \nNobody in a rational thought process would send 350 people and climbing \nto their death, spend $70 billion and climbing, to make a $10 billion \nloan that may never be collected.\n  So people can say what they want to say. If our country gives in to \nthat way of thinking, and if we are swayed by people who hate us to \nbegin with and we change our policy based on people who are never going \nto be with us, we will never get this right.\n  My hope is that the Iraqi people who see our soldiers on the ground, \nsee the schools being opened and built, and the hospitals being \nrepaired would be the first to reject this kind of reasoning, because \nGod knows we are not there to take anything they have. We are there to \nhelp them, but we are also there to help us.\n  Why did we go to war? Why did we pick people from South Carolina, \nCalifornia, and all the places in between to go to a foreign land and \nrisk their lives and have some die? To make sure that Saddam Hussein \ncould do no more damage to the region or us than he has already done.\n  President Bush has shown great leadership. He has said that the 21st \ncentury will not be ruled or dictated by terrorists, dictators, and \nmurderers. He is absolutely right. God bless him for his resolve.\n  This amendment puts $10 billion on the table, unencumbered, to spend \nhowever you would like. This chart shows from $95 billion to $153 \nbillion of debt incurred to Saddam Hussein. The reason I am so \npassionate about this, I do not want to give in to a great lie. We \ncannot buy our way out of this problem. We cannot take $10 billion of \ntaxpayer money and people are losing their jobs to buy our way out of a \ngreat lie.\n  It would be terrible if the people of this country, who have \nsacrificed so much, wound up not getting a dime back for doing a good \nthing, and all they invested in Iraq to produce profit and money went \nto pay the people back who kept Saddam Hussein in power. That is \nunacceptable to me, and that is the scenario we are charting. Please do \nnot do that. It would be bad for everyone. It would not make the world \nsafer.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and appreciate his \nleadership in this matter. He has been in this body a long time. He has \nserved his country in the military, and I think he sized up this matter \nquite correctly. We are at war.\n  I was at the Walter Reed Hospital a couple of weeks ago, meeting \nsoldiers who served in Iraq. They have been wounded, some seriously. \nMost who I met were getting better. They were great in spirit and were \nmost impressive young people.\n  We are in a war. We have an $87 billion request, and $67 billion of \nthat is going to be to fund our military at $4 billion a month. Twenty \nbillion dollars is what has been set aside for infrastructure.\n  My goal, and I believe the goal of this country, is to stabilize \nIraq, create a healthy environment as best we can, and to continue to \ndraw down our troops in a rapid way; get out and come home. The $20 \nbillion gives us the best chance to do that. That means we need money \nfor police.\n  When I visited Iraq in August, I went to observe the police training. \nI wanted to do that because I was a Federal prosecutor for a number of \nyears and I wanted to see how they were doing. They are doing very \nwell. They are being targeted now because they are doing so well.\n  We need money to get electricity. Electricity needs to be on in \nBaghdad. When we get the electricity on, that country is going to be \nbetter off. It is going to be more stable and there is going to be less \nviolence. That is what the infrastructure money does.\n\n  I do not see how this President can ask other countries to not try to \ncollect on debts they have to the Saddam Hussein regime if he is asking \nthat the money we put in for this infrastructure be classified as a \ndebt. I just do not believe that is good policy for him. I think it is \ngoing to complicate matters in many different ways. Secretary of State \nColin Powell indicated those ways to us recently. The entire \nadministration, the Vice President, those\n\n[[Page S12696]]\n\nwho dealt with this issue so closely, are passionately of the belief it \nwould be a colossal error for us to try to put a mortgage on Iraq in \norder to get paid back for half, I guess, now of the money we are \nproviding to improve the infrastructure in that country. It does not \nmake good sense to me.\n  I think the right thing to do is for us to step forward as we are \ndoing, be bold and courageous, complete this job, improve the \ninfrastructure, establish a police force that has ability and \nintegrity, a security force that can protect areas of the country that \nare at risk, and bring on an Iraqi Army.\n  I visited the training camps for the Iraqi Army. We have the \npotential to do even more than we are doing, in bringing on those \ntroops even more rapidly than we are doing. If we spend that money for \nthat purpose, I believe this country can be in a position to continue \nto draw down our troops.\n  We had 250,000 troops at the peak of this effort. We are now down to \n138,000. I see no reason that number cannot continue to go down. Whole \nareas of the country are doing very well. We have to be pleased with \nwhat has happened in Mosul in the north, where the 101st and General \nPetraus have done so well; Kirkuk in the south. Basra is doing \nexceedingly well.\n  We have seen reports recently of the economic vitality on the streets \nof the country. I believe it is just a big mistake for us to try to now \ncome in and worry about whether this ought to be a loan.\n  I don't take a back seat to anybody in this Senate on trying to \npreserve the taxpayers' money. In fact, most of the people I hear who \nwant to make this a loan and are so worried about collecting this money \nback have not been counted on a lot of tough votes on spending when we \nhave had some real challenges here, to contain the growth in spending. \nSo it is painful to me to think about $67 billion, $87 billion to be \nspent there. But we made a commitment. This Senate voted over three-\nfourths to support this effort. We had no doubt when we entered this \neffort that it was going to be costly. In fact, we have to be pleased \nthe war went better than we could ever have expected it to go. It went \nfaster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alabama has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and will just conclude by saying I \nbelieve the amendment should not be adopted. We ought to make this a \ngrant. Let's go forward, stabilize this country, and bring our soldiers \nhome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Alaska for yielding the time, \nand I compliment Members on both sides of this issue for the excellent \ndebate, the tone of this debate.\n  It is a very important debate we are engaged in right now. This is \nprobably the most important decision we will make because it is going \nto shape the postwar policy of a reconstruction that will have a \ndramatic impact on the national security of this country. So I think \npeople are taking this vote very seriously and I think they should take \nit seriously because it has incredible ramifications.\n  This is a vote I believe we will look back on as one of the most \nsignificant votes we will cast in the area of foreign policy, certainly \nin the time I have been in the Senate, in Congress. So I am pleased to \nsee there is a good, active debate. The words being exchanged I think \nhave been helpful.\n  A lot of the comments I heard from some of my colleagues who support \nthe Bayh amendment, which I do not, have been reassuring to me. The \nintent of this amendment is not to show a lack of resolve on the part \nof any Member of the Senate that the policy of this administration in \nIraq is being supported by those who may differ with the way the \npackage is put together. Those words are important. Those words matter.\n  My concern with those words is those words do matter, those words are \nimportant, but what matters more and what is more important are \nactions. There are too many people around this world who are not going \nto hear these words, but they are going to see the action. There are \ntoo many people in this world who will ignore the words and focus and \ntake advantage of them to portray America really differently and \nportray this Senate differently than what the words in support of the \nBayh amendment articulate.\n  Yes, words matter. Intent of the offerors of this amendment, \nsupporters of this amendment, matters. But the problem is the action of \nwhat is going to occur matters most. The action here is clear. We are \nsaying to a country that is flat on its back economically, that has \njust gone through a 25-year-plus horrific regime, has just been through \na war, we are saying to them: We came there to liberate you, to create \nfreedom and rebuild your society into one that is peaceful and \ndemocratic, and, oh, by the way--and it is the ``oh, by the way'' this \namendment is all about. The ``oh, by the way'' is we want some of that \nmoney back.\n  Of course, the only way they can pay it back, and this is what the \nworld community will see, this is what the people in the Arab world \nwill see, is through oil revenues.\n  That ``oh, by the way'' action trumps all of the words we heard here \ntonight which are no, we are not after oil, we are not after this. But \nit really doesn't matter what we say because what will be interpreted \nis what we do.\n  The impact of that in this very fragile postwar period is profound, \nthe impact on the donors conference which is coming up, where we are \nasking those around the world to contribute money, not to loan the \nmoney but to give the money. These are people who did not participate, \nin many cases, in supporting the United States action. So we are asking \nthem, for humanitarian purposes, for purposes of promoting stability in \nthe world, to support reconstruction in some cases where they didn't \nsupport the action in the first place. To go there with less than \ngenerous support--although I agree with many of my colleagues, we have \nbeen generous. The American public has been incredibly generous. But to \nhave those strings attached is going to send a message that is not \ngoing to be positive in getting additional contributions from the donor \nnations. That will have a serious impact on the buy-in we need to make \npostwar Iraq successful.\n\n  It was said by someone in the administration yesterday at our \nluncheon that there are now elections being held in Saudi Arabia, local \nelections for the first time as a result of the model that is being set \nin Iraq. The impact of a successful Iraq, a democratic Iraq, on that \nregion of the world is like the MasterCard commercial--it is priceless. \nIt is priceless.\n  Why we, in any small way, would put that in jeopardy or give those \nwho would like to see it not succeed an opportunity to use this vote \nand this action by the Senate to undermine that objective is to me \nsomething that does not make sense.\n  So I hope my colleagues understand, this is an important vote, one we \nwill look back on throughout history, like I believe those in 1948 look \nback on their vote on the Marshall plan. I hope we will get a vote to \ndefeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Georgia 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I say to Senators Bayh, Nelson, Graham, Collins, Snowe, and Ensign \nwhat a pleasure it is to work with all of you on this issue where we \nknow we are doing the right thing for America and the American people \nas well as for the people of Iraq.\n  I start out by saying that nobody, according to my political \nopponents, has been a stronger supporter of this administration and \nthis President than this Senator from Georgia. I continue to support my \nPresident. I support his request for $87 billion in funding for Iraq. \nThe only thing I disagree with the administration about is how we \nstructure that funding. None of us disagrees about the fact that we \nneed the $67 billion for the military operation in Iraq. But to take \nthe remainder of the $20 billion and to put half of it in the form of a \ngrant to tell the people of Iraq we\n\n[[Page S12697]]\n\nare going to give you the money to go in and rebuild your \ninfrastructure is certainly reasonable. To tell them also that we want \nyou to make an investment in Iraq just like we as the American \ntaxpayers are making an investment in Iraq is also reasonable.\n  There are three reasons that I feel so strongly about this issue. \nBefore I talk about those three reasons, I wish to address one issue on \nwhich I know our political enemies in the press, particularly in other \nparts of the world, are going to be attacking us as Members of the \nSenate tomorrow if this amendment does pass. That attack is going to be \ngeared to saying: Here we go, we told you all along that the Americans \ncame into Iraq because they wanted our oil. My friend from Oklahoma has \nalready addressed this issue. What he has said is very clear; that is, \nthe debt that Iraq now owes--it is listed on this chart that has been \nentered into the Record--there is no money left. No money is left to \npay this debt.\n  To say we went into Iraq for oil because we are asking the Iraqi \npeople to make an investment in infrastructure is simply not true. \nThere is no way you can say it is true.\n  Let me get to my three reasons.\n  First of all, should the American taxpayer invest money in Iraq so \nthat the Iraqi people can have their infrastructure rebuilt and have \ntheir economy revitalized so that these debts can be repaid? My friend \nfrom Maine has already addressed this issue, and I think the answer is \nvery clear.\n  Second, if America is to invest in Iraq in rebuilding its \ninfrastructure, is it unreasonable to ask the Iraqi people to share in \nthat investment?\n  What is going to happen when we start investing over there and start \nrebuilding their infrastructure? I can tell you what is going to \nhappen--some of the same things we have already seen happen. We have \nseen pipelines attacked by the terrorist community in that part of the \nworld. We have seen bombs blown up in front of the hotels in Baghdad. \nWe have seen other entities, including Americans, attacked on a regular \nbasis.\n  When we rebuild the infrastructure, we can expect the terrorist \ncommunity, which is alive and well in that part of the world, to \ncontinue to come out and attack those investments we are making.\n  If the Iraqi people share in that investment, are they going to be \nmore likely to help us in preventing those attacks and also in bringing \nthe perpetrators of those attacks to justice? You bet they will. I \nthink there is every reason in the world to ask them to make a joint \ninvestment with us.\n  Third, my goal is that when the American presence in Iraq is gone, \nall of these debts are relieved. How do we best do that? Do we best do \nthat by investing $20 billion and saying: OK, we are going to rebuild \nyour infrastructure? You go out, and because your economy is back up \nand running, you take care of those debts. No. They are not going to \nleave them debt free if we do that.\n  If the President goes to the donors conference next week or calls up \nPresident Putin or any of these other countries and says, Look, my \ncountry is owed $10 billion, we invested $10 billion to rebuild the \ninfrastructure, if you forgive your debt, we will forgive our debt, \ndoes that give a moral leverage in what he would have if he went in and \nsaid, We put $20 billion in there, why don't you forgive your debt? Be \na nice guy and forgive it? The nice guys have already spoken--Germany, \nFrance, and these other countries such as Russia have already spoken. \nThey are not going to be nice guys. We simply can't expect that from \nthem.\n\n  We need to give the President the leverage he can use to go in and \nget these debts forgiven. When that happens--and I sincerely hope it \ndoes happen in the short term--then our $10 billion in the form of a \nloan is going to be converted to a grant, and it won't be repaid.\n  That is what we are here debating tonight--whether or not we are \ngoing to give the President the right kind of leverage he needs to deal \nwith these countries that sit in creditor status with Iraq today.\n  What has been our investment in Iraq? Our investment has been \nwhatever it costs us to this point in time. I don't know how many \nbillions of dollars--maybe $100 billion. I don't know what it is. How \nmuch is it going to cost us in the future? It is going to cost us \nanother $21 billion, or is it another $87 billion? That is going to get \nus through the next year. Next year we will be back here debating on \nanother supplemental on continuing the effort in Iraq.\n  All we are asking the Iraqi people to do is to take part of that $130 \nbillion, $150 billion, or $170 billion--whatever it has been today--and \nshare part of it with us; share $10 billion with us.\n  Second, there is not a country on this chart, outside of the U.K., \nthat has lost one life as a result of the conflict in Iraq and freeing \nand liberating the Iraqi people. As of today, we have lost 332 American \nlives--just as of today. A young soldier from Valdosta, GA, was found \nfloating in a river. He apparently drowned over there. We have lost 332 \nbrave American men and women. These countries, outside of the U.K., \nhave lost none. They have made no investment of life in the freedom of \nIraq.\n  Let me close by answering my friend from Oklahoma, who is truly one \nof my dearest friends and a guy I respect so much. But when he says, \nfrom the standpoint of to whom we are going to lend this money, there \nis nobody to sign a note, what are we going to do with this $21 \nbillion? Are we going to stand in a hotel window and throw it on the \nstreets of Baghdad? Give me a break. There is somebody in place to give \nthe money to. There is somebody in place to lend the money to. All you \nhave to do is think about what we are going to do with the money. We \nare going to rebuild the infrastructure in Iraq. There is somebody who \nowns that infrastructure. I don't care whether it is the former \ngovernment or the Coalition Provisional Authority. There is an entity \nin place that is capable of signing a note. That is simply a very weak \nargument, to say that we don't have the legal capacity to make this \nloan.\n  Again, I am very proud of the fact that we have come together in a \nbipartisan way to do what we think is right for the American people.\n  Again, I am thankful for the leadership of Senator Bayh, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Ensign, who were so instrumental in this.\n  I ask my colleagues to think seriously about this because it is maybe \nthe most important vote we will make. The future of our children and \ngrandchildren, particularly when it comes to rooting out terrorism \naround the world, may rest in this vote. I am very confident that the \nright vote is in support of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAYH. I ask my colleague: The Senator from Michigan has been \nwaiting quite some time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have had the Senator from Washington waiting for a \nsubstantial amount of time, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join my well-meaning \ncolleagues on both sides of this debate in trying too determine the \nbest mechanism for not only our leadership in Iraq and getting the \nIraqi people on their feet, but also in getting other countries to help \nby forgiving Iraqi debt.\n  It is crucial that we in this Chamber send a strong message to the \nIraqi people that we will be the world's most outspoken advocate for \nIraqi reconstruction and that the United States will play a leadership \nrole.\n  Now I don't impugn the motives of other Members who want to qualify \nour assistance through a loan formula.\n  I share my colleagues' concerns that the funding for Iraq \nreconstruction is a serious cost that we need to thoroughly consider \nand oversee.\n  However, I think it is critically important to realize that Americans \nhave already been making a serious investment in this region in order \nto ensure that we are so close to achieving: A stable, peaceful, \ndemocratic Iraq.\n  We spent billions of dollars to expel Hussein out of Kuwait; we spent \nbillions throughout the nineties patrolling a no-fly zone; and we spent \nbillions to liberate Iraq, and we are spending billions to secure and \nstabilize the country.\n  We are now the closest we have ever been to achieving the very goal \nthat we have sacrificed lives and spent billions to achieve.\n\n[[Page S12698]]\n\n  We are very close to taking the Iraqi people off their knees and \nputting them on their feet. Yet, the right way to do this is by helping \nthem build a strong economy not by saddling the Iraqis with further \ndebt.\n  Let's consider what we are saying when we ask the Iraqi people to \ntake on this loan. Think about it. Iraq's annual oil revenues may be \nsomewhere around $15 billion, but we are on the verge of adding to an \nexisting debt level of $200 billion--and expecting them to pay with \ntheir oil revenues.\n  To think that Iraq can pay off a loan by oil revenues when its debt \nis thirteen times its annual oil revenues is ridiculous. A future Iraq \nwould end up spending half of its oil revenues on interest payments \nalone.\n  Is that the message we want to send to the Iraqi people?\n  Is that the message we want to send to the mayor of Kirkuk who I met?\n  To the governor of Basra who doesn't have enough electricity to serve \nhis community?\n  To the members of the Iraqi council, who are not only giving their \ntime to serve their country, but are risking their lives.\n  To the woman of the Iraqi council who spent 16 years in hiding with \nother women only to rejoice when she found out that the United States \nwas coming to give them an opportunity to meet and express their \nopinions in public.\n  These courageous leaders have stepped out to rebuild this country, \nand are willing to give their lives to do so.\n  We need to help these people re-build their country, not pile on \nadditional debt.\n  Now is not the time for the United States to back away form its \nleadership role in nurturing Iraq's future.\n  Make no mistake, I am disappointed like all my colleagues that the \nAmerican economy isn't recovering as well as it should.\n  I am disappointed in our terribly low levels of domestic investment.\n  I have as much concern as anyone over our domestic economy--my home \nstate of Washington is still facing a terribly high 7.5 percent \nunemployment rate.\n  But we cannot tell the American people that we are going to solve \ntheir problem by somehow holding down the Iraqi people to a future debt \nthat will not let them stand on their feet.\n  The United States must play a leadership role in Iraq reconstruction.\n  And it is very hard to play a leadership role when our commitment to \nIraq reconstruction is qualified by the conditions of a loan.\n  We need to say to the rest of the world community that it is time for \nthem to help build Iraq, too.\n  We need to say that if they are serious in their commitments about \nrebuilding Iraq, as the U.N. did in its resolution today, then get \nbehind that message and deliver.\n  But to say that out of the $87 billion that we are talking about, \nthat some-how $10 billion of it ought to be paid back in a loan--only \nif the other countries are not willing to commit to debt forgiveness--\nis not the message of a leader.\n  A leader who believes in the Iraqi people will stand behind them and \ngive them the ability to get their country on their feet. We must be \nthis leader and get them on their feet and get our troops back home.\n  Mr. BAYH. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after that, I yield to Senator Burns 5 \nminutes from our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is requesting that Senator Burns \nfollow Senator Levin.\n  Mr. BAYH. If the Senator from Montana would like to follow the \nSenator from Michigan, I have no problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I first thank the Senators who have been so \ndeeply engaged in coming up with a bipartisan amendment. It is \ncritically important there be a bipartisan amendment relative to issues \nof war, peace, reconstruction, and the aftermath of war. I congratulate \nthem on it. I support this amendment.\n  The administration has requested approximately $20 billion for the \nreconstruction of Iraq and the entire sum is intended to be a grant. We \nare told that Saddam Hussein's debts are so great that we cannot \ncontemplate the new Iraq taking out a loan against their huge resource, \nthe second largest oil reserves in the world, perhaps $1 trillion or \nmore, so that they can become involved in their own reconstruction. \nOnly a grant, we are told, will do, even though this is a country with \na tremendous resource. We are told they cannot contribute to their own \nreconstruction financially.\n  It was just last March Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz said \nthat ``we are dealing with a country that can really finance its own \nreconstruction, and relatively soon.'' And it can. It surely can help \nfinance its own reconstruction and would be far better off if it did \nhelp to finance its own reconstruction.\n  If the Iraqis possessed billions of dollars in gold bullion, I cannot \nimagine anyone talking about granting them $20 billion. They have $1 \ntrillion in liquid goal. Yet the suggestion for us to propose to Iraq \nthat they can stand on their own feet, that they can contribute to \ntheir own reconstruction by a tiny fraction of that asset being used, \nsomehow or other that does not mean we are leading--I reject that. We \nhave led with our lives, almost 350 American lives. Every one of those \nlives shows resolve. Every one of the 1,700 Americans who have been \ninjured show resolve. And we are going to continue to show resolve with \nour lives on the line.\n  To suggest that Iraq, with an asset of $1 trillion, somehow or other \nshould not be part of its own reconstruction financially is portrayed \nhere as a lack of leadership. To me, it is a central element of wisdom \nand recognizing that Iraq has a right to be treated as a country that \nhas great resources, great capabilities and we need to treat them as a \npartner.\n  What is missing from the Bremer plan is a sense of ownership by Iraq \nof its own reconstruction. The money involved in the plan is U.S. money \nbeing appropriated to a U.S. administrator, who is going to spend the \nmoney pretty much as he sees fit. That is not the best way to succeed \nin Iraq. The best way is Iraq having the will to succeed.\n  There has been a suggestion that somehow or other we do not have the \nresolve if we become partners with Iraq. It is quite the opposite. Iraq \nmust have the will to succeed and contribute to its own reconstruction \nwith a tiny fraction of its own resources as a reflection of that will \nto succeed.\n  If Iraqi money were involved, I don't think this plan would have \nproposed new ZIP Codes for Iraq; sending Iraqi students, at huge \nexpense, to business schools; some kind of a big honeypot for U.S. \nconsultants. Is that how the Iraqis would be spending their money? I \ndoubt it. When we talked to the Iraqis who came here, we asked them if \nthey had a role in this plan? We were told, no; this was our plan.\n  This has got to be their plan for their own reconstruction. They have \nto own it. It is their country. We can help them. We can be a partner, \nand God knows we have been. All the blood that we have shed for their \nliberation has surely made us a partner. Nobody is going to be able to \nmisconstrue this as our aiming at their oil resource. No one can \nmisconstrue a grant of $10 billion, and a following loan of another $10 \nbillion if others will contribute, as somehow or other targeting their \nresources. Nobody is going to buy it. There may be an effort made to \nmisconstrue it, but nobody is going to buy that. We shed too much \nblood. We have spent too much money in Iraq for this to be misconstrued \nthis way.\n\n  One other thing: Our simply giving them billions without their \nparticipating, and then our deciding how to spend it, is going to keep \nAmerica as the target of terrorists, not just because of the military \npower that we deploy so visibly, but because of the reconstruction \nprojects that we choose so unilaterally. If an electric power plant is \nbuilt with our money--it's a visible U.S. target for terrorists. If its \nbuilt with Iraqi money--it's less of a lightening rod.\n  The distinction is important in another way. Iraqis will have more \nincentives to protect and to fight what their money builds. For those \nreasons alone, the future of Iraq will be more assured if Iraqis have \nthe financial stake to succeed.\n  This has to be a partnership. We must join with Iraq in the \nreconstruction. We should not dominate. We should not control. We \nshould not determine. Their resources should be\n\n[[Page S12699]]\n\nspent on their own reconstruction, with them, surely in part, choosing \ntheir priorities as to what is important for them.\n  That is what we should all want for Iraq. And our simply saying, here \nis $20 billion, these are the ways we will spend the $20 billion--is \nnot the way to help Iraq get back on its feet. It is the way to signal \nto the world that we control, we dominate, and that is the worst \nmessage that we can send to the world.\n  Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my own preference would have been, instead \nof a direct loan from us, that there be a loan from a third party, \nguaranteed by us. That is my preference because that would have taken \naway any possibility of misconstruing what we are doing, any propaganda \nvalue that might be gained by anybody else by saying somehow or other \nthe United States is going to be a creditor, therefore, we have designs \non Iraq. That could have been avoided if there were a third party \nmaking the loan, with our guarantee. If this amendment were not \nadopted--and I hope it will be--I would offer such a loan guarantee \namendment as a preferable way to go. But this amendment is preferable \nto the grant approach of the administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Indiana yield for a question?\n  Does the Senator have control of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Maryland, if he \nwants to ask a question, I don't see any harm in that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No.\n  Mr. President, does the time then come back to the Senator from \nIndiana?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct. The Senator from Indiana can seek \nrecognition at that time. The Senator from Indiana has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will defer until the Senator \nconcludes, and then I will seek to have an exchange with the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we just got back from Iraq last Saturday. I \njust want to share with you a couple of thoughts that I had while I was \nthere and coming back because once you go and you look and you see and \nyou feel what is going on in that country--I am going to oppose this \namendment, but I am opposing the amendment, and I am opposing the idea, \nbut not because some of my good colleagues, for whom I have the utmost \nrespect, are promoting this.\n  There are as many Iraqis and more dying today than there are \nAmericans. If we lose one American life, it is a tragedy. But their new \npolice department that is on the street is doing a good job, and they \nare paying with their lives also.\n  I am not going to get into whether we can afford it or we can't \nafford it or whether they can afford it or they can't afford it. But \nthis investment, my colleagues, is probably one of the biggest ones we \nwill make. The returns in the next 20 years will be way beyond \nexpectation. We are changing something in the Middle East that has not \neven been touched since the end of World War I.\n  We went into those communities where poverty is rampant, with trash, \ngarbage. Kids are happy. They come up to you. We talked to parents in \nrefurbished schools. And, by the way, we have refurbished 1,500 of \nthem, done by an Iraqi contractor who hired 30,000 Iraqi workmen to do \nit.\n  We talked to parents. I talked to one woman there and asked: Do you \nwant us to go away?\n  She said: No, absolutely not.\n  And I asked her: Give me one reason, one reason.\n  She said: My little girl is going to school.\n  Little girls did not go to school under Saddam Hussein. Think about \nthat impact on that neighborhood. I am talking ground level, folks. \nThis is not the palaces. This is not the CPA or the IGC. These are \npeople who are on the street.\n  What kind of a message is this: ``Well, we will loan you the money, \nbut expect you to pay it back''? And they will say: ``Gee, thanks. The \nlast thing we need is another loan.''\n  We have all been down that street. We loan; we lose control of the \nmoney. Is it spent where it is supposed to be spent? Does it really \nbuild the infrastructure? Or do we see somebody going out and buying a \nMercedes-Benz and putting it in their trunk and saying: ``Well, I have \nhad enough of this''? We have seen that happen, too. That has been \nour experience with some of our foreign aid.\n\n  We control it. But I want to get back to this issue that we are going \nto change some things over there on the success of Iraq. We don't know \nwhether their constitution will be like ours. I daresay it will not. \nBut it will be some form of representative government, which to us is a \nbaby step, but to them it is a giant step.\n  If you throw a map down on the floor and you take a look at all of \nthe Middle East, here is what we have done: We have invested in a \ncorridor that will be the economic road for not only Iraq but for \nJordan, for Egypt, for all the countries that border Iraq because, for \nthe first time, we will have a communications and transportation system \nthat is free and open, and even in the fly zones that run from the \nMediterranean to the Persian Gulf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sorry, I do not have an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will you give me another minute to close?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, if you think, why is King Abdullah of \nJordan so supportive of us? Why is Turkey so supportive of what we are \ntrying to do? It is very simple: because the corridor of freedom is \nbeing opened.\n  Now you tell me if there is not a better investment in this world. \nAnd you have cracked closed societies. Would Saudi Arabia announce they \nare going to have free elections had we not done what we have done?\n  We cannot make it in the form of a loan because we lose control of \nit. Let's help those people. They want to do it. Their will for freedom \nis just as strong as ours. How strong is our will? How strong is ours?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAYH. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to make sure, as I understand the Senator's \namendment, $10 billion of this $87 billion which he proposes as a loan \non the reconstruction side, under the very terms of his amendment would \nbe forgiven if 90 percent of Iraq's outstanding debt were forgiven by \nother countries; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAYH. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to commend the Senator for the wisdom of his \namendment. If we do not adopt this amendment, the United States \npresumably will go to a debtors conference trying to persuade people \nthat they should forgive the debt to Iraq. If your amendment passes, \nthe United States is in a position at that debtors conference to say: \nIf you will forgive your debt, we will forgive this debt. In fact, the \namendment, by its terms, would require that.\n  If we make it all a grant, we will go to the debtors conference and \nwe will say to them: We made a grant. Now you should forgive your debt.\n  They are going to say: Well, that is over and done with. That is \nwater over the dam. That grant has happened. What do you have to give \nus here at this conference?\n  So presumably at that point, we are going to come up with another \nchunk of money, would that be correct?\n  Mr. BAYH. The Senator understands the amendment perfectly. It \nprovides an incentive for the rest of the countries to forgive their \nodious debt they extended to Saddam, and if they do\n\n[[Page S12700]]\n\nnot, it puts our country in a position of maximum leverage to insist \nthat they do in any debtors conference.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAYH. I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as usual the Senator from Maryland has \nput his finger on one of the most important aspects of this amendment. \nIt is one of the reasons I rise to support the Bayh-Nelson-Ensign-\nCollins-Snowe amendment. It is a very sound proposal. It establishes \nseveral important principles relative to the steadfast commitment of \nthis Congress to finish a job that has already been started.\n  As the chief sponsor of this amendment stated in his opening remarks, \nwhether you voted to use force to overthrow this regime or not, the \nfact is, we are there now. We have an important job to complete. This \nis one of the most challenging tasks ever undertaken by the people of \nthe United States. The Bayh amendment outlines a roadmap that might \nactually get us to where we want to go. Words such as freedom, \neducation, prosperity, democracy, vibrancy, a free enterprise economy, \nI have heard my colleagues speak with passion. This amendment is an \nattempt not to undermine those principles but to ensure that we will \nactually get there, to the goal of this whole effort.\n  I am afraid without this amendment, the plan before the Senate, which \nwe are well aware of, will not get us where we want to go.\n  It establishes a couple of important priorities. It says Iraqi \nsecurity is important. It says the Congress, by good faith, will put up \nthe $5 billion which, by the way, dwarfs the contributions of all other \ncountries. And it sets up an incentive, a very important incentive, for \nthe other nations to forgive the debts. It highlights the strength of \nthe resources in Iraq and opens the opportunity to perhaps expand on \nthat by rebuilding with the Iraqi-owned resources, once this plan is \nlaid down.\n\n  The Bush-Bremer plan of billion-dollar grants only, often, and alone \nwill simply not work. Let me repeat: The plan we have before us--not \nthis amendment--the plan that has been presented of billion-dollar \ngrants only, often, and alone will not work. It can't be sustained. The \nAmerican people don't support it now. They will not support it in 30 \ndays. They will not support it in 4 months. They will not support it in \n4 years. The little girl the Senator from Montana spoke so passionately \nabout is in school today. This amendment is about keeping her in school \n2 years from now and 3 years from now and seeing that she graduates \nfrom college.\n  This amendment lays a sustainable roadmap to get us where we want to \ngo. That is why I support it. That is why it is important. The RAND, \nWorld Bank, and Institutes of International Finance have estimated the \ncost will exceed $36 billion, $75 billion over the next not 30 days but \n5 to 7 years. We need this amendment to get us on the right roadmap, \nlaying down the right plan so we can sustain it to complete the task \nahead of us which is very important, very complex and, as I said, one \nof the most challenging.\n  I support the amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Virginia 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager, and I \ncommend the Senate for an excellent debate. I rise today to oppose this \namendment that would use loans for much needed reconstruction, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same. Seldom do we have choices before us \nas fundamental as this one. We can truly help the Iraqi people and \nsecure an important opportunity for change in this part of the world, \nor we can turn our backs and watch this fledging nation drown in a sea \nof debt. The second choice would represent failure. There is no choice. \nFailure is not an option. We must go forward; we must stay the course \nand help the people of Iraq win the peace without conditions.\n  We have achieved extraordinary success, in a relatively short period, \nin Iraq. Saddam Hussein and the threat he posed are gone; the future is \nhopeful for the Iraqi people. We must send a strong message of resolve \nto our fellow countrymen, to our troops, to our coalition partners, and \nto the rest of the world, that we will see this through to completion--\nto win the peace.\n  Over the July 4, recess, I traveled, along with eight colleagues from \nthe Armed Forces and Intelligence Committees, to Iraq. During the 3 \ndays we spent in Iraq, we met with Coalition Provisional Authority \nleaders, military leaders, soldiers, and local Iraqi leaders. Their \ncourage, dedication and determination in a very difficult environment \nwas inspiring. We saw the enormity of the task with our own eyes--the \nantiquated, dilapidated oil infrastructure; the mismanaged irrigation \nsystem; the piles of garbage and open sewers; and the cowed and \nbrutalized, but hopeful people of Iraq. These problems will not be \nfully fixed overnight, or even with this significant infusion of \nresources. But, it is an important step forward. We must quickly build \non the foundation that has been laid by Ambassador Bremer, his \ninternational team, and the Iraqi people, to sustain and accelerate the \nmomentum for building a secure, and economically viable, democracy in \nIraq.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet with \nseveral Iraqi leaders. Recently, I met members of the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil. We noted the tragic absence of Ms. Akila al-Hashimi, a member \nof the Governing Council who was scheduled to travel to the United \nStates this week but was gunned down last week outside her home in \nBaghdad, most likely by remnants of the Ba'athist regime intent on \nintimidating the new Iraqi leaders. She symbolized the courage, hope, \nand determination of many Iraqis to build a new, democratic Iraq, even \nin the face of great personal risk. We mourn her loss, along with the \npeople of Iraq, and we must now renew our pledge to help Iraq establish \nthe security, quality of life, and opportunity to enjoy the liberties \nof a free, democratic nation. Her colleagues on the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil are clearly committed to achieving these goals and deserve our \nsupport.\n  Some have suggested that providing $20.3 billion dollars for Iraqi \nreconstruction is too generous and that full or partial repayment \nshould be formulated. This notion is borne from the belief that Iraq is \na potentially prosperous nation, well-endowed with oil reserves, that \nshould be able to pay for its own reconstruction. I respectfully \ndisagree.\n  The idea of loans for Iraqi reconstruction, instead of grants, would \nbe a terrible mistake. Iraq already has crushing debt, accumulated \nduring Saddam Hussein's brutal, incompetent reign. Estimates of this \ndebt range from $180 billion to almost $400 billion. Additional debt or \nencumbrances on future earnings now would be economically disastrous, \nand send the wrong message to Iraqis and, indeed, the world.\n  General Jay Garner and Ambassador Bremer have both forcefully argued \nthat Iraq must be granted significant debt reduction or forgiveness. \nThe United States will seek to convince the principal holders of Iraqi \nloans--Russia, France, Germany and Saudi Arabia--to foregive some of \nall of these loans. To add additional loans, at the same time we are \nasking others to forgive loans, would be counterproductive and \nhypocritical.\n\n  Later this month, the U.S. will hold a donors' conference in Madrid \nto solicit contributions from the international community for Iraqi \nreconstruction. To ask others to make grants to Iraq after we have \nstructured some or all of our contribution to Iraqi reconstruction as \nloans would undercut our Government's efforts to obtain international \nsupport.\n  In the conversations with Iraqi leaders I mentioned earlier, they \nwere emphatic in their opposition to reconstruction support being \nstructured as loans, especially if these loans were made in the form of \n``liens'' against potential Iraqi oil revenues. They rightfully argued \nthat the Iraqi people and the larger Arab and Islamic world would \nregard such a move negatively\n\n[[Page S12701]]\n\nand conclude that their earlier suspicions that the U.S. was more \ninterested in Iraqi oil than Iraqi liberation were true.\n  We have an opportunity before us to send a message of full commitment \nto Iraq and of a balanced, fair U.S. foreign policy in the larger \nMiddle Easter region, by providing this reconstruction assistance as \ngrants to Iraq. A loan program using Iraqi oil as collateral would be \nviewed as just the opposite, and would be counterproductive to our \nlarger goals and interests in this important region.\n  There is a perception, I fear, that this supplemental will fully fund \nIraq's reconstruction. Nothing could be further from the truth. The \nreconstruction needs of Iraq are enormous--not because of war damage, \nbut because of three-plus decades of neglect, mismanagement and greed \nby Saddam Hussein's regime. The fund included in this supplemental will \nonly begin to address these daunting needs, but adoption of this \npackage will put the Iraqis in a much better position to help \nthemselves in the future. The Iraqi leaders I spoke with want nothing \nmore than to do just that, but they need our help for now, not with \ncrippling conditions attached.\n  Some have compared this supplemental for the reconstruction of Iraq \nand Afghanistan to the Marshall plan that funded the reconstruction of \nEurope following World War II. Most would agree that the investment of \nour Nation in the Marshall plan has been paid back a hundred-fold.\n  Some have correctly pointed out that the Marshall plan included loans \nthat had to be paid back and the requirement for matching funds by the \nbeneficiary nations, in some cases. The bulk of Marshall plan \nassistance, however, was in the form of grants. Students of history, of \nwhich there are many in this chamber, will recall, also, that while the \nMarshall plan began in 1948, it was preceded by a series of programs \nover a number of years, to provide financial support to meet the \nimmediate needs of devastated European nations, including Germany. In \ntoday's dollar, the equivalent of over $100 billion in aid was provided \nby the U.S. to these nations before the Marshall plan went into effect. \nIncluded in this aid was over $35 billion in grants to put these \nnations in a position to help themselves with subsequent assistance.\n  The situation is similar in Iraq today. This is a nation crippled by \nmultiple wars, mismanagement, and neglect. The Iraqis are not yet in a \nposition to help themselves, but they can be with our help.\n  Providing loans to Iraq is an idea that may have merit in the future, \nbut not now. By voting overwhelmingly to authorize the use of force in \nIraq, we accepted the responsibilities and challenges of subsequent \nreconstruction. We must not now shrink from that responsibility. We \nmust first provide the unconditional assistance that will lay the \nfoundation for full reconstruction. That is in Iraq's best interest; it \nis in America's best interest.\n  Let us join together to provide the resources that will meet the \nimmediate needs of the Iraqi people and best serve our interests in \nIraq and the larger Middle East region. I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthis amendment and send a message to the Iraqi people that we are \ncommitted to their liberation and reconstruction unconditionally.\n  I was very deeply influenced and moved by the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell. She hit it. What is the message we send \nforth from this Chamber tonight?\n  I must admit, in the briefings and so forth that took place today \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, I repeatedly heard, we are not \ngetting the message out in that part of the world about what we are \ntrying to do and the successes we have had to date in helping the \npeople. Consequently, a vote that would carry this amendment will just \nspread through that world and be interpreted by that press. It will \nundo so much of what we have been able to achieve thus far in trying to \nconvince that world we are there for their own interests, not for oil, \nnot to profit from a loan or give a loan. It will be misinterpreted as \na consequence of a very small amount of funding in this whole $87 \nbillion.\n  I would like to put a question to my good friend, fellow member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, who is a strong supporter of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, a simple question: Does this amendment make \nthe streets safer for the men and women of the Armed Forces tonight, \ntomorrow tonight, and in the days and weeks to come, together with \ntheir coalition partners? If somehow you can convince me this will \nbring about a greater measure of safety--this is the thing that \nconcerns me above all. The sacrifices being made by the men and women \nof the Armed Forces, their families here at home, people in the \nvillages and towns who watched them march off to take up their stations \nin this battle for freedom. I cannot fairly discern any basis that this \nwill help to make the streets safer for the uniformed people now \nserving in the coalition forces.\n  I ask that most respectfully of my good friend and distinguished \nmember of our committee.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's question. The \ntimekeeper informs me I don't have much time left. I will answer \nsuccinctly if the time is not deducted from our time.\n  Mr. WARNER. It should not take very long.\n  Mr. BAYH. The chairman of the committee, for whom I have the utmost \nrespect with regard to his comments about the message we send, I think \nwould agree that there is no vote we can cast tonight, or no amount of \nmoney that we can spend that could compare possibly to the message our \nbrave men and women are giving to the Iraqi people every day with their \npresence and the heroic efforts they are making to rebuild that nation. \nI think that is eloquent testimony that far surpasses anything we might \ndo.\n  To directly answer your question, my answer would be, yes, we provide \nan immediate $5 billion to meet every security need that has been asked \nfor by the Iraqi government. That is over and above the $67 billion for \nall of the American security costs while we are there. So there is a \ncomplete grant of every security need.\n  With regard to the domestic reconstruction, we provide $5 billion \nimmediately--\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator has answered the question. I believe \nwe just have an honest difference of opinion. I think the press in that \npart of the world will be whipped into a frenzy, with those who will be \nsaying ``we are winning, we are winning.'' That troubles me. I think \nthat will endanger the security of our people in uniform when they are \ntrying to carry out this mission. The press will be whipped up, and \nthis will be the most clear symbolism that those who are against----\n  Mr. BAYH. May I ask the question? The Senator is concerned that those \nwho wish us ill in that part of the world may say they are winning. In \nwhat way will they say they are winning?\n  Mr. WARNER. They will say it is because we are there for oil, and \nthey will say, oh, they are going to make the Iraqis borrow the money. \nThey don't understand the nuances, the technicalities of a loan, and so \nforth.\n  What they will understand is that the Senate did not stand in support \nof the Commander in Chief, and I am fearful that the press will seize \nupon this and it will endanger the safety of our people. I say that as \na friend and most respectfully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, President Harry Truman once said that \n``the only thing new is what we have forgotten about history.'' I am \nreminded of our history when I think about this debate on giving a \nloan. I am thinking of the choices we made when dealing with Germany \nafter World War I, and then after World War II. After World War I, we \nmade a choice that was a grave mistake. We defeated Germany, left them \nin ruins, sent them a bill, and we went home. What was the result? \nAdolf Hitler.\n  As early as 1922, Hitler was railing against the Treaty of \nVersailles, talking about the payments Germany was forced to make. \nEleven years later, in\n\n[[Page S12702]]\n\n1933, he became Chancellor of Germany. He was democratically elected. \nHe, again, blamed the Treaty of Versailles and the payment of those \ndebts for Germany's woes.\n  Under such a debt with a failed reconstruction policy, we can see the \nsame thing happening in Iraq. Our post-World War I policy with Germany \nwas an utter failure. It gave us World War II. After World War II, we \nalmost made the same mistake. We began by making loans. This is a \nsummary of the Marshall plan by the Marshall Foundation. I ask \nunanimous consent that this document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     A Summary of the Marshall Plan\n\n    (From the Marshall Foundation Chart on Funding from USAID, 1975)\n\n       Even now a model for positive economic diplomacy, the \n     Marshall Plan was a rational effort by the United States \n     aimed at reducing the hunger, homelessness, sickness, \n     unemployment, and political restlessness of the 270 million \n     people in sixteen nations in West Europe. Marshall Plan funds \n     were not mainly directed toward feeding individuals or \n     building individual houses, schools, or factories, but at \n     strengthening the economic superstructure (particularly the \n     iron-steel and power industries). The program cost the \n     American taxpayers $11,820,700,000 (plus $1,505,100,000 in \n     loans that were repaid) over four years and worked because it \n     was aimed at aiding a well-educated, industrialized people \n     temporarily down but not out. The Marshall Plan significantly \n     magnified their own efforts and reduced the suffering and \n     time West Europe took to recover from the war. The program--\n     whose official title was ``European Recovery Program''--aimed \n     at: (1) Increasing production; (2) expanding European foreign \n     trade; (3) facilitating European economic cooperation and \n     integration; and (4) controlling inflation, which was the \n     program's chief failure.\n       The idea of massive U.S. loans to individual countries had \n     already been tried (nearly $20 billion--mainly long-term, low \n     interest loans--since the war's end) and had failed to make \n     significant headway against Europe's social and economic \n     problems. The plan that Marshall enunciated at Harvard \n     University on June 5, 1947, was revolutionary in that it \n     required the recipients to organize to produce a rational, \n     multilateral approach to their common economic problems. \n     Another innovative feature was its limited duration: four \n     years maximum, thereby assuring American taxpayers and their \n     representatives that the program would not be an indefinite \n     commitment.\n       The economic problems in 1947-48 included not only the lack \n     of capital to invest, but also the need for Europeans to \n     overcome a U.S. trade surplus with them so massive as to \n     imperil further trade and to encourage unmanageable \n     inflation. Marshall Plan money helped stimulate the revival \n     of European trade with the world and increased trade among \n     European countries.\n       Americans were reluctant to invest in Europe because their \n     profits were available only in local currencies that were \n     little desired by U.S. businesses and investors. The Marshall \n     Plan guaranteed that these investors would be able to convert \n     their profits earned in European currencies into U.S. \n     dollars. Grants and loans in U.S. dollars enabled managers in \n     Europe to purchase in America specialty tools for their new \n     industries. Marshall Plan money also paid for industrial \n     technicians and farmers to visit U.S. industries and farms to \n     study American techniques. Plan funds even paid the postage \n     on privately contributed relief packages.\n       Many people in Washington helped to implement and manage \n     the European Recovery Program that Marshall Plan first \n     outlined at Harvard; this is why, in addition to his normal \n     modesty, Marshall refused to call the idea the ``Marshall \n     Plan.'' He always believed that his greatest contribution to \n     the program was his 1947-48 nationwide campaign to convince \n     the American people--and through them the Congress--of its \n     necessity; he likened his efforts in scope and intensity to a \n     campaign for the presidency.\n       Over its four-year life, the Marshall Plan cost the U.S. \n     2.5 to 5 times the percent of national income as current \n     foreign aid programs. One would need to multiply the \n     program's $13.3 billion cost by 10 or perhaps even 20 times \n     to have the same impact on the U.S. economy now as \n     the Marshall Plan had between 1948 and 1952. (Most of the \n     money was spent between 1948 and the beginning of the \n     Korean War (June 25, 1950); after June 30, 1951, the \n     remaining aid was folded into the Mutual Defense \n     Assistance Program.)\n       On December 10, 1953, George C. Marshall received the Nobel \n     Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway. He accepted it, not as his \n     individual triumph, but as the representative of the American \n     people, whose efforts and money had made the program a \n     success.\n\n MARSHALL PLAN EXPENDITURES--ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, APRIL 3, 1948 TO JUNE\n                                30, 1952\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Country                   Total      Grants       Loans\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal for all countries.............   $13,325.8   $11,820.7    $1,505.1\n                                     -----------------------------------\nAustria.............................       677.8       677.8  ..........\nBelgium-Luxembourg..................       559.3       491.3    \\1\\ 68.0\nDenmark.............................       273.0       239.7        33.3\nFrance..............................     2,713.6     2,488.0       225.6\nGermany, Federal Republic of........     1,390.6     1,173.7   \\2\\ 216.9\nGreece..............................       706.7       706.7  ..........\nIceland.............................        29.3        24.0         5.3\nIreland.............................       147.5        19.3       128.2\nItaly (including Trieste)...........     1,508.8     1,413.2        95.6\nNetherlands (*East Indies) \\3\\......     1,083.5       916.8       166.7\nNorway..............................       255.3       216.1        39.2\nPortugal............................        51.2        15.1        36.1\nSweden..............................       107.3        86.9        20.4\nTurkey..............................       225.1       140.1        85.0\nUnited Kingdom......................     3,189.8     2,805.0       384.8\nRegional............................   \\4\\ 407.0   \\4\\ 407.0  ..........\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Loan total includes $65.0 million for Belgium and $3.0 million for\n  Luxembourg: grant detail between the two countries cannot be\n  identified.\n\\2\\ Includes an original loan figure of $16.9 million, plus $200.0\n  million representing a pro-rated share of grants converted to loans\n  under an agreement signed February 27, 1953.\n\\3\\ Marshall Plan aid to the Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia) was\n  extended through the Netherlands prior to transfer of sovereignty on\n  December 30, 1949.

The Marshall Foundation said:\n\n       The idea of massive U.S. loans to individual countries had \n     already been tried [right after World War II] (nearly $20 \n     billion--mainly long-term low-interest loans--since the war's \n     end) and had failed to make significant headway against \n     Europe's social and economic problems.\n\n  But there was a better idea, a different choice that someone learned \nfrom history. It was George C. Marshall. The Marshall plan was a 4-year \nplan, $13.3 billion, helping to rebuild the economies of 16 countries. \nNearly $12 billion was grants, about $1 billion was loan, and what was \nthe result? A continent that had been fighting itself for a thousand \nyears became democratic, stopped fighting among themselves, and became \nour allies.\n  That is why we need a ``Marshall plan'' for Iraq. We need a 4- or 5-\nyear plan for building a democracy. The Marshall plan was used for a \nvariety of purposes. It paid for the building of railroads, water \nsystems, medicines, modernizing factories, restoring ports to allow \nforeign trade, and much, much more.\n  We should do the same in Iraq. It cost $13 billion from 1948 to \n1952--more than $100 billion in today's dollars. We can learn a \nvaluable lesson from our experiences with Germany after World War I, a \nterrible failure, and after World War II, a remarkable success. After \nWorld War I, we made Germany pay its debts and we left them in ruins. \nWe sent them a bill. We went home. We got Adolf Hitler. After World War \nII, we pursued the Marshall plan. It cost us some money. We gave them \nthe money but as a result we got peace, new democratic economies, and \nour greatest allies.\n  President Kennedy said it best in 1961. In his inaugural address, he \nsaid:\n\n       We shall pay any price, we shall bear any burden . . . to \n     assure the survival and success of liberty.\n\n  The people of Iraq need our support. We paid for German \nreconstruction under the Marshall plan because it was in our interest. \nWe should do the same in Iraq and support the President's request. We \ncannot afford, in our own interest, to do anything less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 38 minutes 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles amendment \nand in opposition to the Bayh amendment. I believe in truth in lending, \nand I think there are some Members of the Senate who think somehow if \nwe talk about this loan, it is going to be acceptable to the American \npeople. Frankly, I believe the loan is going to be a grant.\n  We just need to be upfront with the American people and say that the \n$20 billion in the President's request is going to be a grant and \nexplain it to the American people. Iraq has a huge debt--from sources I \nhave heard in testimony--of anywhere between $100 billion to $200 \nbillion. We just heard on the news this evening where one of their \nmajor pipelines has been blown up so they are not going to have any \nability to expect to export oil. The oil they have now will be used for \ndomestic purposes. That is as a result of an attack by terrorists this \nparticular evening as we are debating.\n  Let's be honest; whether this is couched as a loan or a grant, it is \ngoing to be a grant. It is something we are going to have to give to \nthe American\n\n[[Page S12703]]\n\npeople in order to move forward with the development of the \ninfrastructure in that country, which I happen to believe is essential \nif we want to get our troops home quickly. We simply have to get that \nin place along with security forces. The only way that will happen is \nif we give the full amount of $87 billion available for the \nreconstruction and for the security in Iraq.\n  We have heard time and time again about the complications of going \nthe route of a loan. In fact, Ambassador Bremer testified before \nseveral committees in the Senate, and he has actually sent a letter to \nthe chairman, the Honorable Ted Stevens. I will read from it. He says:\n\n       I understand there are various proposals being offered \n     which would convert portions of the funding request to a loan \n     mechanism of some type. Any such proposal would merely add \n     further debt to the already-huge debt currently owed by the \n     Iraqis. As you know from my testimony three weeks ago, I am \n     concerned that, as was the case in the young, fragile \n     democracy in Weimar, Germany, such a situation could \n     destabilize the young Iraqi democracy before it even gets off \n     the ground. Moreover, if the United States makes its \n     contribution in the form of a loan, we will encourage other \n     nations to follow that example at the Madrid Donors \n     Conference next week--further exacerbating Iraq's debt \n     situation, I might add, complicating the eventual process of \n     restructuring the country's overall debt burden.\n\n  I sat down with a group of people and I visited with Colin Powell. He \nalso urges us, in the strongest terms, to not make this a loan and that \nwe grant these dollars. It gives us an opportunity to maintain control \nof those dollars.\n  We have to keep in mind that Iraq has established trade agreements \nwith many of those countries that opposed our presence in Iraq. If this \ngoes to a loan, they will control the money; they will be the ones \nletting out the contracts. I feel their inclination would be to be to \ndisburse it all over the international community. That means that \ncountries such as France, Germany, and Russia will be looked to also to \nshare in the contracting out of the building of the infrastructure in \nIraq.\n  The other advantage of a grant is it gives us control of the moneys \nas they are spent in Iraq.\n  Finally, a loan means Iraq is going to have that control. It means it \nis going to complicate our ability to work with other countries with \nthe loss of control. We ought to be straightforward with the American \npeople. We need to tell them this is going to be a grant and account \nfor it accordingly and move forward with the rapid reconstruction of \nthe infrastructure in Iraq. That is the best policy. It is a \nstraightforward policy.\n  I believe if we are true and straightforward with the American \npeople, the American people will understand the need to move forward \nwith the full $87 billion the President requested.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been an extraordinarily good \nday for the President's policy in Iraq. The naysayers said: Go get \ninternational support, Mr. President. Let's prove we can get the rest \nof the world behind us.\n  Today, by a vote of 15 to 0--15 to 0--the United Nations passed a \nresolution. It was one that simply suggested we do what we were going \nto do anyway. It is a thoroughly acceptable resolution.\n  To get a 15-to-0 vote, that means the President had the support of \nthe Russians, the French, the Germans, and, believe it or not, the \nSyrians. This administration's policy in Iraq, as adopted by the United \nNations today, had the support of the Syrians. The only remaining \nobstacle appears to be the Senate, and we will get an opportunity at \naround 9:30 p.m. to see if the Senate will join with the Russians, the \nFrench, the Germans, and the Syrians to do the right thing and begin to \nrebuild Iraq.\n  There are some Senators who have argued that somehow this loan-grant \nissue really is not that important or they have better judgment than \nthe President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State, and \nothers about how to structure this.\n  It seems to this Senator that those who are skilled at conducting \nforeign policy have gotten it right, and their judgment is that you \ncannot go to a donor conference next week in Madrid and ask countries \nto grant--not loan--grant money to share the costs with us of \nreconstructing Iraq if we say we are going to try to get paid back.\n  Let's take a look at what we know is going to happen at the donor \nconference already. The Japanese are down for $1.5 billion, not an \ninsubstantial amount of money; the British, $900 million; the \nCanadians, $224 million; the European Union, $234 million. These are \nall grants, not loans. The Japanese, the British, the Canadians, the \nEuropean Union are not saying you have to pay us back. They know Iraq \nis on its back after 25 or 30 years of Saddam Hussein.\n  In addition to that, there are over 50 countries that have either \nalready provided or have pledged humanitarian assistance; to name a few \nof them: Kuwait, Spain, Australia, Korea, Germany, Denmark, and the \nUnited Arab Emirates; and there are going to be others. They are all \ngoing to be at Madrid next week looking at this United Nations \nresolution that passed 15 to 0 today, with the support of the Russians, \nthe French, the Germans and, for goodness' sake, the Syrians. This is \nthe time to speak with a united voice.\n  The administration has united the world. They may have been divided \nabout whether this war should have been fought in the first place, but \non the issue of reconstruction of Iraq, we are moving toward world \nunity, and we ought not to disrupt that here tonight.\n  I had an opportunity last week, along with Senator Thomas, whom I see \nin the Chamber, Senator Burns, Senator Craig, and Senator Chafee, to go \nto Iraq and take a look firsthand at what is happening there. I must \ntell you, Mr. President, there is a lot of good news in Iraq. We have a \nhard time picking it up watching the evening news. They teach them in \njournalism school that good news is not news. I think you can accept \nthat and still say that in Iraq good news is news because they had no \ngood news for 30 years--no good news. Saddam Hussein murdered 300,000 \nof his own people during that quarter of a century. There was no good \nnews in Iraq. Now 9 out of 10 things that are happening there are good: \n13,000 construction projects completed; 1,500 schools renovated; local \nelections up in Mosul. They had a provincial election in the Ninawa \nprovince, and they have elected officials up there. We sat down with \nthem and talked with them. They are brave people.\n\n  In the violence area where obviously there is still much to be done, \nthe Iraqis themselves are providing a lot of security. The attack on \nthe Baghdad Hotel was thwarted. Some people were killed, indeed, but \nthe bomber wanted to get into the hotel and blow it all up. He was \nthwarted by Iraqi security.\n  Part of this Iraqi security force is up to 60,000 people now and \ngrowing on a daily basis. The attack on the Turkish Embassy was \nthwarted, not by us but by Iraqi security. We are on the way to putting \nthe security force in place so that the Iraqis can carry this job \nforward.\n  Let's compare it to Bosnia. I was one of a minority of Republicans \nwho supported President Clinton on Bosnia and Kosovo. I met the head of \nthe 101st headquartered in Kentucky and Tennessee. He was in Bosnia, \ntoo. General Petraeus said we made more progress in Iraq in 6 months \nthan we made in Bosnia in 6 years--more progress in 6 months than in \nBosnia in 6 years. Great progress is being made.\n  This is a time to unify behind the reconstruction policy in Iraq. Now \nis the time to do that.\n  The last stumbling block is this amendment in the Senate tonight. The \nHouse is going to finish up tonight, and we are going to finish up \ntonight or tomorrow, and this is probably the last vote with any real \ndrama attached to it. No matter how long you have been in the Senate, \nyou haven't cast a more important vote than this one. We are casting \nvotes all the time around here, and if you are in my job, you are \ntwisting arms every day on some issue, but it reminds me of what Orwell \nsaid in ``Animal Farm.'' He said all pigs were equal, but then some \npigs were more equal than others. All votes are equal, but some votes \nare more equal than others. This is a more equal vote. This is a big \nvote, one that makes a difference for America and for the world\n\n[[Page S12704]]\n\nand certainly for the Iraqis for whom this policy is so important.\n\n  There are 170 newspapers in Iraq. I do not think anybody in America \nknows that, but there are 170 newspapers in Iraq. They have by far more \nnewspapers in Iraq than we have in my hometown. Some of them are even \nmore credible than the New York Times, arguably. The streets are \ncrowded with people engaged in commerce with their little businesses, \nwhich the Iraqis are quite good at when allowed to be. Just this week, \nthey have a new currency. I happened to have picked up a souvenir, the \nlast of the previous currency. It has a picture of Saddam Hussein on \nit. I can tell my colleagues this: The new currency being issued over \nthe next few weeks in Iraq has no picture of Saddam Hussein on it.\n  Today we heard--Senator Thomas and I were at the same meeting--that \ninternational bankers are interested in coming into Iraq. So everything \nis heading in the right direction. Let's not get off track tonight by \nleaving the impression with the Iraqi people that we came into the \ncountry to help them and then to send them a bill for it. I hope the \namendment will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \ncongratulate all of my colleagues on a very important and well-\nconducted debate.\n  I strongly oppose the Bayh amendment because its enactment would \nundermine the central purpose of our mission in Iraq, which is to \nempower the Iraqi people to build a prosperous and secure future in \nwhich their country's natural resources support progressive government \nand economic prosperity, not additional debt payments to rich Western \npowers.\n  I oppose the amendment because I believe decisions on how to finance \nIraq's reconstruction should be made in Washington, not in Moscow, \nParis, Berlin, or Bonn, whose leaders' decisions, if this amendment \nwere enacted, could determine what form United States assistance takes. \nI cannot accept the prospect that the United States, with our British \nallies, who liberated Iraq, would now cede our leadership on \nreconstructing it to Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder.\n  Let's talk about what is at stake. Things are not going as well in \nIraq as we would hope. They are not going as poorly as some would \nallege. In the northern part of Iraq, in the southern part of Iraq, \ndemocracy and reconstruction are proceeding apace. As I said, things \nare not going as well in some parts of Iraq but they are going very \nwell in other parts. The fact is that every few days, tragically, we \nlose additional American lives. This is the result primarily of a \nconcerted effort in what we know of as the Sunni triangle, of a rare \ncombustible mixture of ex-Baathists, criminals who were released from \nprison, terrorists from outside the country of Iraq who have \ninfiltrated into the country, and former military people who really \nknow that they will never attain their goals unless the United States \nis driven out of Iraq. These people have done very bad things. We know \nall about them. We hear about them or see them every single day.\n\n  What are they telling the people of Iraq? They are telling the people \nof Iraq the following: The United States of America is not on your \nside. The United States of America supported Saddam Hussein all during \nthe 1980s. They propped up his regime, as a matter of fact. They turned \na blind eye while he used weapons of mass destruction twice, once \nagainst the Iranians and once against his own people.\n  In 1991, the Americans told the people of Iraq that Saddam Hussein \nwas on his way out the door. That turned out not to be the case. Saddam \nHussein stayed in power and slaughtered thousands of people who rose up \nagainst him in places such as Basra. In the 1990s, the Iraqi economy \nwas crippled by economic sanctions imposed by coalitions led by the \nUnited States of America, and now the United States of America is about \nto do what they came for, and that is to take your oil.\n  Now, I can rebut every single one of those arguments that these bad \npeople are making to the people in the Sunni triangle, but, frankly, I \nam not there to talk to them. Nor is there much besides Al-Jazeera for \nthem to watch.\n  The battle for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people is not over \nby a long shot, and the passage of this amendment will send a clear \nsignal that the United States is really there for the oil as they \nalleged all along.\n  The Washington Post, on October 15, 2003, stated that Iraq is already \nburdened with $200 billion in debt. Either much of that will be \nforgiven, in which case the United States reconstruction loan will \nprove mostly symbolic, or Iraq will struggle for years under a crushing \ndebt burden--by the way, the estimates are that the interest on that \ndebt is as high as $6 billion or $7 billion a year--in which case, \nanother loan only adds to the memory. To make a loan in these \ncircumstances is like swimming out to a drowning man and handing him a \n10-pound weight. That is from the Washington Post on October 15, that \nwell-known, conservative, right-wing periodical.\n  I do not know who is going to volunteer to go to the donors meeting \nif this amendment is passed. If we go to the donors meeting and say, my \ndear friends, we want you to give money for Iraq but, by the way, we \nare only going to loan it to them, the rest of you give the money but \nwe are going to loan it to them, I am sure there is somebody who is \nhighly paid in the State Department who will carry out that task, but \nit cannot be a pleasant one because it is hypocrisy. How can we ask \nother countries to give money when ours is in the form of a loan?\n  I would like to express a little sympathy for my colleagues who \nsupport this amendment. It is tough going home when people are without \njobs and the economy is still stumbling along and say, we are going to \ngive all this money to Iraq and, by the way, I know that the local \nhighway needs to be fixed and a bridge needs to be built. It is tough, \nbut I want to tell my colleagues what is at stake here.\n  The reason these bad guys came from all of these other countries into \nIraq, the reason the Muslim extremists all over the Middle East are \ndoing everything they can to incite people against America, the reason \nwe are seeing such fierce opposition in some quarters, is that they \nknow that the day democracy flourishes in Iraq, their day is over. The \nday of the Middle East despot is gone. The day of the Muslim extremist \nis gone. No longer will the madrasahs, funded by the Saudis, function \nanymore to train people who are terrorists who will then sacrifice \ntheir lives as well as taking others'.\n  The seminal event since the Vietnam war in American history is now, \nand there has never been more at stake. We paid a very heavy price for \na long time for our failure in Vietnam. We should not pay that price \nhere because we send a signal to the Iraqi people that our commitment \nto democracy and freedom is somehow contingent upon their ability to \npay us back a loan which will then be gauged by the willingness of \nother countries. Are we going to be the Blanche DuBois of loans? Are we \ngoing to be dependent upon the generosity of others? Is it going to be \nMr. Chirac and Mr. Schroeder who determine whether we give money to the \nIraqis?\n  I don't think we should. I think this has been a fine debate. I hope \nwe will vote to turn down this amendment. I hope we will vote to \nmaintain the commitment we made when we sent our young men and women to \nfight and some to die in a conflict which is important, not only to the \nfuture of the Middle East but the future of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 14\\1/2\\ minutes on the majority \nside and 6\\1/2\\ on the minority side. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. I will yield a minute and a half to my distinguished \ncolleague from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic supporter of \nthis wonderful bipartisan agreement, the\n\n[[Page S12705]]\n\nBayh-Ensign amendment. I do it because it meets four of my principles \non supplemental spending.\n  No. 1, there must be international burden sharing.\n  With international burden sharing, if the stability of Iraq is in the \nworld's interest, then the world should help pay for the \nreconstruction. If we say we are going to go it alone, they are going \nto let us go it alone. If we say we are going to go grants, they will \nsay fine with us.\n  We need a coalition of the willing. We need a coalition of the \nwallet.\n  No. 2, in helping Iraq, we should have loans, not giveaways.\n  Iraq has the world's largest oil reserves, capable of pumping out \nmillions of barrels a day. These profits should help pay for \nreconstruction.\n  There are those who say Iraq has debt. Well, so does America. America \nhas a lot of debt and we think that this debt, the very balanced \napproach of the Bayh-Ensign amendment, will provide 50 percent as a \ngrant for $10 billion, including $5 billion for police and military, \nbut the other will be converted to a grant only if 90 percent of Iraq's \npreliberation bilateral debts are absolved.\n  That is what I call burden sharing. We need the world's help. Iraq \nneeds the world's help. I am glad we have a legislative framework to do \nit.\n  No. 3, is accountability to stop waste, cronyism contracting, and \nprofiteering.\n  No. 4, the administration must lay out a plan to end the occupation \nof Iraq. There was a plan for the war. Now we need a plan for the \npeace.\n  What will this amendment do? Half the requested aid to Iraq will be \nprovided as a grant, a total of $10 billion, including $5 billion to \nrebuild Iraq's police and military forces. The other half of the \nrequested aid will be a loan.\n  So the President can lend up to $10 billion to Iraq. The loan would \nbe converted to a grant and only if 90 percent of Iraq's pre-liberation \nbilateral debts are absolved.\n  The amendment also expresses the sense of the Senate that all \ncountries should forgive the bilateral debts owed by Saddam Hussein's \nregime and provide robust levels of reconstruction aid at the Madrid \nDonors Conference.\n  Why is this amendment important? I support this amendment because it \nis consistent with my principles for aid to Iraq: No. 1, international \nburden-sharing; No. 2, loans, not give-aways.\n  The amendment clearly supports international burden-sharing, not just \nwith words of encouragement but by providing an incentive for other \ncountries to forgive Iraq's debts. Ambassador Bremer says Iraq can't \nafford to borrow more because it is already shackled with $200 billion \nin debt. I say America can't afford more debt, not when we're facing a \n$2 trillion deficit. The Iraqi debts were racked up by Saddam Hussein \nto pay for his wars against Iran. Most is owed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait \nand other Gulf states, and to Russia and France. Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait and Russia and France should forgive Iraq's debt as their share \nof rebuilding costs. If these countries let Iraq start with a clean \nslate then Iraq's oil income can be used to pay for Iraq's \nreconstruction.\n  The amendment also promotes my principle that U.S. aid to Iraq should \nbe loans, not giveaways. Until and unless 90 percent of Iraq's debts \nare forgiven, half of U.S. aid will be in the form of loans.\n  I supported Senator Dorgan's effort to make all of America's new aid \nto Iraq loans rather than grants--the full $20 billion.\n  Here's why. Iraq can afford to pay. Iraq oil sales can finance \nbuilding Iraq's infrastructure so we can use American tax dollars to \nbuild America's infrastructure. Iraq already has a very developed \ninfrastructure and suffered relatively little damage during the war.\n\n       It's certainly the complete opposite of the situation in \n     Afghanistan, where that's a country that has no prospect of \n     being self-sufficient for quite some time to come . . . We're \n     dealing with a country that can really finance its own \n     reconstruction and relatively soon.\n\nThat's not just me talking. That's the testimony of Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Paul Wolfowitz back in March.\n  Iraq has the world's second-largest proven oil reserves and could \nhave even more oil and natural gas. Iraqi oilfields are already \nproducing close to 2 million barrels a day. That means billions of \ndollars a year in oil revenue. According to Ambassador Bremer, by 2005, \nIraq will produce enough oil to take care of its basic needs and have \nadditional funds.\n  I understand that Ambassador Bremer doesn't want to delay \nreconstruction in Iraq until after Iraq has a constitution and an \nelected government. I remind the Senate that we have already provided \naid to meet Iraq's immediate needs. Just this April Congress provided \n$75 billion requested by the President. That supplemental bill covered \nongoing military operations in Iraq. It also included $2.5 billion for \nIraq Relief and Reconstruction. That was grant aid.\n  I believe the aid we provide now should be all loans, but half is \nbetter than none. America's taxpayers stand to get $10 billion back \nfrom Iraq's oil revenues under this amendment.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the cosponsors, my Republican colleagues, \nSenators Ensign, Snowe, Collins, Graham, and Chambliss, and my \nDemocratic colleagues, Senators Bayh and Nelson. They worked together \non a bipartisan basis to improve this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bipartisan amendment \nto promote burden-sharing and to provide loans, not giveaways.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of fiscal year 2004 \nsupplemental appropriations request for military operations and \nreconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am also pleased to \ncosponsor this amendment with my colleagues Senator Bayh, Ben Nelson, \nChambliss, Ensign, Dorgan, Lindsey Graham, and my fellow Senator from \nMaine, Senator Collins. This amendment directs that $10 billion of the \nfunds requested for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Iraq's \ninfrastructure be provided as loans rather than grants.\n  It is incumbent upon us as stewards of the public trust to scrutinize \nthis $87 billion supplemental legislation, to assure ourselves of the \nsoundness of the proposals and to understand what it is the American \npeople are being asked to provide. I believe that we all fundamentally \nagree that the $65.6 billion requested to support our military forces \nin the field must be made available immediately. As our troops continue \nto root out the remnants of Hussein's horrific regime and work to \nensure stability in Iraq, we must do no less than provide them with the \nmost advanced technology, the most reliable force protection equipment, \nand the best personal care available.\n  Rather, the amendment before us focuses on the $20.3 billion \ndesignated for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq. I have \nmaintained during this debate that a portion of these reconstruction \nfunds should be in the form of loans, and this amendment designates $10 \nbillion of the $20.3 billion toward that very end. At the same time, \nthe amendment contains a ``trigger with a purpose''--designed to both \nencourage existing creditor countries to forgive at least 90 percent of \nthe debt owned on loans that were made to the former regime of Saddam \nHussein, and to foster within Iraq itself a greater sense of \nresponsibility toward, and a stake in, their own long-term rebuilding \nsuccess.\n  I know some have said that loans simply aren't feasible. But let's \ntake a look at the totality of what we're talking about. While American \nmen and women are putting themselves in harm's way day in and day out \nin securing the liberation of the people of Iraq, we are also in the \nprocess of spending $100 billion and more for that very same purpose.\n  And let there be no mistake--the American people aren't making a \ndistinction between the money we are spending to support our troops and \nthe additional funds being proposed to rebuild Iraq when it comes to \nthe total measure of our Nation's sacrifice toward this cause. So \nasking Iraq to repay one-tenth of that $100 billion in the form of \nloans hardly seems unreasonable.\n  But what about those who have argued there is no legitimate \ngovernment in Iraq that can obligate the nation to the repayment of \nloans? Well, just today, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution \n1511 which specifically determines that the Governing\n\n[[Page S12706]]\n\nCouncil and its ministers are the principal bodies of the Iraqi interim \nadministration which ``embodies the sovereignty of the State of Iraq \nduring the transitional period until an internationally recognized, \nrepresentative government is established.'' So this interim \nadministration discussed in Resolution 1511 will be that legitimate \ngovernment to which U.S. loans are made, while Iraq moves forward \ntoward complete self-governance.\n  Still others say that providing loans to Iraq would run counter to \nthe U.S. policy of shifting away from loans for development because of \nthe ineffectiveness of such programs in the past. But that policy is \npredicated on the fact that many heavily-indebted, poor countries do \nnot have the resources to both service debt and institute economic and \nsocial reform. Iraq, in contrast, is tremendously rich in resources to \nan extent sufficient to service this debt and continue to make future \ninvestments in their own infrastructure.\n  Of course, as I have mentioned, there is also that ``trigger with a \npurpose''. What exactly is that purpose? Well, I would hope we can all \nagree that long-term stability in Iraq is a global concern that \nrequires global action and a global commitment. A secure, stable Iraq \nis not only in the best interests of the Middle East, it is also \nunquestionably in the best interest of freedom-loving nations \neverywhere.\n  What we are saying with this amendment is, we have been willing to \nsend our American men and women to liberate Iraq . . . we have been \nwilling to spend $100 billion--and undoubtedly that figure will only \nclimb in the future--for that worthy cause . . . and we're even willing \nto make that ten percent we expend as loans into full fledged grants--\nif only those nations who loaned money to the horrific, corrupt Hussein \nregime in the past will forgive those loans. We are saying, the United \nStates has been willing to accept the overwhelming responsibility for \nthe liberation and rebuilding of Iraq--in money and in lives--now, all \nwe ask is that you, as a creditor nation, contribute to the cause by \nforgiving loans that only ultimately enriched a criminal, self-\naggrandizing regime we all agree we're better off without today.\n  The bottom line is, this amendment sends a message to these creditor \nnations that they can have a positive role in ensuring a better future \nfor Iraq, not only by lessening Iraq's debt load by the forgiveness of \ntheir own loans, but also by triggering our provision that transitions \nour $10 billion loan into grants. This is a win-win for the \ninternational community and for Iraq--and in the long run, with the \nreduced debt burden for Iraq, it may even save some additional American \ntaxpayer dollars that would have otherwise been expended for further \nIraqi rebuilding.\n  Frankly, I don't believe for a moment that taxpayer money sent to \nIraq for reconstruction should in any way, shape or form be used to pay \nback loans made to the heinous regime of Saddam Hussein. So I hope that \nwith the passage of this amendment creditor nations will do the right \nthing and vitiate their claims against Iraq.\n  Moreover it should be noted that the amendment provides $5.1 billion \nin direct funding for the purpose of re-establishing the rule of law \nthrough the establishment fire and civil defense forces, police forces, \na more fully developed judicial system, and the development and \nenforcement of public safety requirements.\n  The fact is, the sooner we can transfer the responsibility of \nproviding basic police, fire and first responder services to the Iraqi \npeople, the sooner we can begin to remove our troops from the front \nline and focus them on the missions they are trained for--conducting \ncombat-type operations against the forces bent on attacking American \ninterests at home and abroad. Additionally, as we have learned in \nEastern Europe and Latin America, the rule of law is critical to the \neffective transition of a state-based economy to a free-market economy.\n  Finally, the amendment would provide $5.1 billion immediately to \nAmbassador Bremer as ``seed'' money for the infrastructure projects he \nidentified in the request.\n  In closing, I do not believe that the provision of $10 billion in \nloans to the Iraqi people for the reconstruction of their nation will \nunduly burden them or their economy. Instead, by investing these loans \nin Iraq, we are working to restore their national pride and enhance \ntheir sense of responsibility as we work toward the common goal of a \nfree and stable Iraq. Furthermore, I do not believe it is too much to \nask that, as we stand willing to turn our loans into grants, creditor \nnations who loaned money to the Hussein regime help the cause by wiping \ntheir debt slate clean.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor to the Bayh-\nNelson amendment to this Supplemental Appropriations bill. This \namendment would authorize the President to lend $10 billion in \nreconstruction funds to the Iraqi Governing Council or its recognized \nsuccessor. These funds could be converted to grants provided that 90 \npercent of Iraq's pre-liberation bilateral debts are absolved, \nincluding loan forgiveness for any funds obligated as loans. It also \nprovides the sense of the Senate that it is the strong preference of \nthe United States that all countries forgive their pre-liberation \nbilateral debts owed by the Saddam regime and provide robust levels of \nreconstruction aid to post-liberation Iraq at the October 23 Madrid \nDonors Conference.\n  The American people are being asked to contribute over $20 billion of \ntheir taxpayer dollars for the reconstruction of Iraq. Before the war \nagainst Iraq, the administration was vague about how much security and \nreconstruction funding would be needed in Iraq. Instead, Congress was \ntold by administration officials, as my colleague Senator Dorgan has \npointed out, that we could expect Iraqi oil revenues to pay for Iraqi \nreconstruction or that other nations would join us in shouldering the \nburden of rebuilding Iraq.\n  Now the administration argues that it needs over $20 billion for \nIraq's reconstruction. The administration argues that this money must \nbe given as grants and not loans. However, once the money is used to \nrebuild Iraq's infrastructure and economy, the Iraqi government will \nthen be obligated to pay back other nations who hold Iraqi debt. \nNations like France and Russia, who loaned money to Saddam Hussein's \nregime, will receive debt payments off the backs of the U.S. taxpayer.\n  This amendment directly addresses this problem by requiring 90 \npercent of Iraqi debt to be forgiven before $10 billion can be \nconverted to grants. It gives an incentive to the administration to \nengage in diplomacy with nations that hold Iraqi debt in order to \nencourage them to forgive it. And it will ensure that other nations' \ntaxpayers are not treated more generously than U.S. taxpayers.\n  In these difficult economic times with U.S. deficits ballooning, the \nadministration is asking the American people to increase the fiscal \nburden without any hope of recouping these funds. The American taxpayer \nshould not be treated more shabbily than debtors from other nations and \nwe should be encouraging other nations to help rebuild Iraq's economy.\n  Taxpayers are concerned that we are simply passing on the bill for \nthis and other problems to our children. They are concerned that this \nCongress can find the resources for Iraq, but at the same time can't \nfind the resources for after-school programs, for prescription drug \nbenefits, and for rebuilding the infrastructure here at home.\n  We need to allay some of the very legitimate concerns of the American \ntaxpayers. They are concerned about our ballooning debts and shrinking \nservices while we send billions overseas. We need to address these \nconcerns of every American. By ensuring that taxpayer funds are treated \njust as dearly as the debts owed to other nations, we can begin to \naddress those concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much more time now remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 14\\1/2\\ minutes on your side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was prepared to yield time to another \nSenator who is not here.\n  Let me just say this. I am impressed with the debate. There is \nclearly a division in the Senate. But I do hope Senators will keep in \nmind that the President of the United States is traveling\n\n[[Page S12707]]\n\nabroad on a very important mission. We have been appealed to before, on \nthis side, when Presidents have been traveling abroad, to honor the \nposition of the Presidency and not to take positions that would \nembarrass him when he is abroad.\n  I believe there is no question that the problem we face in Iraq is \nthe populace of Iraq that wants to be part of a new government, wants \nto have a new government, a new democratic government, really faces a \nquandary of what can they do? How can they be involved? How can they \nget their electricity back? How can they get their police service back? \nHow can they get their banks open? How can they get their hospitals \nopen? How can they get potable water? How can they be sure they have \nthe capability to present a firm, new constitution that will be \napproved by their people?\n  That takes the money the President has requested. I believe if we do \nnot take action to get this money into Iraq and get it moving so they \ncan have the momentum of building a new government, the hearts and \nminds of those people will be hardened against us. As they are hardened \nagainst us, we will have more violence in the street and our soldiers, \npeople in uniform, even the people who are there in civilian capacity \nnow, will be at greater risk.\n  I think that is what the Senator from Arizona has been saying. The \nrisk we face is, if we do not support these loans, our men and women in \nuniform are going to be in greater harm's way.\n  If you want to support the troops--and I have heard that from every \nMember of the Senate so far--if you want to support these troops, \nsupport the President on this issue and do not approve these loans. As \nto the concept of loans, I am sure, sometime, there will be some way \nthe people of Iraq are going to under--see the debt they have to the \nUnited States when they become a real, strong government.\n  Look what happened to us after World War II. We did not saddle France \nand Germany with loans. We forgave all the indebtedness, even the \nindebtedness we had from prior to that war. We helped them through the \nMarshall Plan to get going.\n  These grants that we have in this part of this bill are absolutely \nessential to the continued safety, improvement of the safety of our men \nand women in uniform. I appeal to those who say they support the troops \nto support the President. He is the Commander in Chief of these troops \nand he has told us, his military commanders have told us, they need \nthis money.\n  It goes hand in glove with the $66 billion here, to assure they have \nthe right equipment, the right protection while they are there. But \nlet's take the actions necessary to get them out of there.\n  I hope we would have the support of the Senate to do that tonight.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will yield 2 minutes. I believe the leader is on his \nway to take the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I had the honor to travel last week with \nthe Senator to Iraq and to Afghanistan. Frankly, it was a very \ninteresting meeting, one that makes us feel a little differently, being \non the ground, than it is when we hear what we hear.\n  I wish to make I think a fairly practical point, and that is that \nwhen we were there, obviously, we had a lot of security things to do. \nWe have a lot of problems there.\n  On the other hand, they have a plan that is being put into place for \nthe schools, for the hospitals, for the government. They are making \ngreat progress. So we are talking here about $87 billion, $67 of which \ngoes to support the troops. The other goes to try to get Iraq on its \nown feet.\n  I have to suggest from a point of view of someone who is inclined not \nto want to spend a lot of money, if we really want to get them going on \ntheir own and get our troops out of there, the best way to do it is for \nus to take this money and to help them get on their feet.\n  The biggest cost is maintaining our troops there. We can move that \nmuch more quickly if this $20 billion is put in the hands of our folks \nwho are there now and we can move to get the Iraqis on their own feet \nand get our troops home more quickly than if we have to do this again \nto support the troops.\n  I am talking about a very practical expenditure matter. I think we \nare much better off to go ahead and do this $20 billion as a grant, be \nable to have authority over how it is spent, and be able to get our \ntroops home more quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of our time to the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have reached a point in this debate \nwhere each of us must make difficult decisions. We debated many \namendments over the past 2 weeks and we have, in my view, come to a \npoint about which most all of us agree; that is, we are at war against \nterrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the assistance that we are \nconsidering is integral to our victory and the safe return of our \nsoldiers, the men and women who represent us in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I am confident, when the final vote is taken on the $87 billion, that \nthere will be an overwhelming bipartisan majority in favor of this \ncommitment--in favor of this legislation. But now the Senate has moved \non to consider the very best way, the very best manner in which to \ndeliver this assistance, which we all know is so important.\n  How best can we stabilize the country in which our men and women \nright now are serving us right this very moment, risking their own \nlives so others and, indeed, we can live in safety.\n  I respectfully suggest the amendment which we will be voting upon \nshortly and which we are now considering simply does not help in this \nregard. In fact, I would argue it has the very real potential of \ncomplicating and, yes, even undermining our ability to do what we all \nwant; that is, to successfully stabilize Iraq.\n  Let me suggest what this amendment is not. The amendment before us \npurports to save money for the American taxpayer by insisting upon \nforeign help and foreign assistance by making this a loan that will be \npaid back by the Iraqi people. But, as has been discussed on the floor \nalready, the Congressional Budget Office, due to Iraq's already \ncrushing burden, will score or value this amendment in the same way as \nif it were a grant. In other words, there is absolutely no savings to \nthe American taxpayer, who might be listening right now, as a result of \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment purports to provide an incentive for other countries \nto relieve that crushing burden, that $200 billion of debt that is \nalready as we speak on the backs of the Iraqi people. This logic \ncompletely escapes me.\n  As we began this debate tonight, the newly liberated country of Iraq \nwas $200 billion in debt. By the time this debate finishes tonight, if \nthis amendment were to pass, Iraq would be $210 billion in debt.\n  By a single vote, we might--I hope and pray we don't--catapult the \nUnited States to the front of the line as Iraq's greatest creditor if \nthis amendment were to pass. Iraq would owe more to us than to France, \nor to Germany, or to Russia.\n  The Washington Post I thought captured the essence in the editorial \nyesterday when it said it is the equivalent of swimming out to a \ndrowning man and handing him a 10-pound weight.\n  If the idea is that by in some way adding to Iraq's debt we will \ncreate an incentive for other countries to move toward debt \nforgiveness, I am confused. How is seizing the moral low ground \nadvantageous in that debate? If we want others to forgive Iraqi debt, \nwe must stop piling that debt on.\n  I remain utterly unconvinced by the suggestion that by adding to this \nburden of Iraqi debt and then tying the forgiveness of our debt to the \nwillingness of France and Russia and Germany to relieve 90 percent of \ntheir debt, that we will leverage the desired result. France, Russia, \nand Germany showed no shame whatsoever in loaning their money to prop \nup Saddam Hussein, one of the world's most brutal dictators. Despite \nthe abundant evidence that he used weapons of mass destruction on his \nown people, invaded surrounding neighbors, and tortured and mass-\nmurdered his own people, these three nations could not find the\n\n[[Page S12708]]\n\nresolve to support the coalition's successful effort to remove Saddam \nHussein from power. They will find their conscience now?\n  Hope does spring eternal.\n  This amendment purports to talk about what the Iraqi people should do \nto help themselves, but it offers them less help than the President \nproposed. This amendment purports to talk about what our allies should \ndo, but we do not and cannot govern their actions either.\n  What this amendment and this debate truly speaks to is who we are as \na people. Throughout history, the American people have responded again \nand again to the tyranny of dictators, to defend the name of freedom, \nto liberate the oppressed, to relieve the plight of the downtrodden. We \nsend our soldiers to fight and to die in foreign lands. We send the \nhard-earned tax dollars of our citizenry to the impoverished and sick \naround the world.\n\n  When communism collapsed in Europe, we were there with billions of \ndollars in assistance to heal the wounds of tyranny.\n  When Israel and Egypt found the courage to negotiate peace at Camp \nDavid, we were there with billions of dollars in assistance to make it \na lasting peace.\n  Earlier this year, we approved $15 billion to treat and care for \nthose who suffer from HIV/AIDS. Now we stand with billions more to help \nthe people of Iraq to stand with the free nations of the world.\n  Why? We help others because it is good and it is right. We do so \nwithout the expectation of gratitude because that is who we are as a \npeople. As the beneficiaries of the blessings of liberty, we understand \nfreedom is not free. The American people are a generous and good \npeople. We do not sell our commitment to liberty, and we do not loan \nour good will to the needy.\n  So what are we to do with this amendment and this vote tonight? What \nare we to do? For me it is an easy question. We vote no. There is \nnothing in this amendment that will make the President's job easier or \nour soldiers safer. Nothing in this amendment will save the taxpayers \nmoney or ease the burden upon the people of Iraq. Others of good \nconscience think otherwise, and that is their right as elected \nrepresentatives to this body. For those who have not decided, I ask you \nto vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I am new to the Senate. \nThis has been a terrific debate in the best traditions of the Senate. I \ncome to this conclusion after having listened to people I admire and \nrespect, such as our leader, the President, the Vice President, and \nSecretary Powell. I asked myself: Who are you to disagree?\n  I thought about it, and I came to this conclusion. I do disagree. I \nknow they are genuine in their beliefs, but I just do not believe we \nare being unfair to the people of Iraq. We have lost 332 lives \nliberating Iraq. We are spending $1 billion a week, and all we are \nasking for is once the country gets something going--we are going to \nbuild schools and hospitals, we are going to do great things for the \nIraqi people--but once the oil refineries are fixed, because that is \nwhat makes the money, and once we do other things to get you back in \nbusiness, consider helping us because we are deep in debt. We borrowed \nevery penny of this $87 billion. And I would vote tomorrow to borrow \nmore money to make our country safe.\n  We have one of the highest deficits in our Nation's history because \nour economy has turned down. But we have to win this war. The only way \nwe will lose this war--here is where I am tonight--is if the American \npeople leave. It is very hard for me to go home and explain how you \nhave to give $20 billion to a country that is sitting on $1 trillion \nworth of oil and the net result of this policy we are pursuing is the \npeople who died to liberate Iraq are going to be left holding the bag, \nand the only people who will get paid back are the people who lent \nmoney to Saddam Hussein. If we follow that policy, people will leave us \nbecause it is not fair to the taxpayer. We need to make sure we don't \ndivide ourselves here at home.\n  This is very important, not just for international politics but for \ndomestic politics.\n  The French and the Germans voted today for a resolution, but in the \nsame breath they said they would send no troops and no money.\n  We are pretty much alone for a while. Let us stay together and not \nask more of the American people. It would be unfair to ask.\n  I really do love my country. We give $15 billion in aid to Africa and \nwe don't want a penny back. We are giving $10 billion in grants, and we \ndon't want a penny back. But if we are going to build your \ninfrastructure to make you prosperous, help us because we are in debt. \nAnd if other countries will do the right thing, we will even forgive \nthat.\n  The biggest thing we have done for Iraq is give our young men and \nwomen, and more are going to die. That is a fact.\n  Tonight is important. We need to stay together and look at the \nAmerican taxpayer, and say, Yes, you can be helped too. Don't feel \nguilty to ask for some of your money back, because you have given and \nyou have given, and there is more to give.\n  Please vote for this amendment for the sake of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAYH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 40 seconds on your side and 1 \nminute 40 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank all the cosponsors on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir support and say to my colleagues, all of us are committed to the \nsuccess in Iraq. To achieve that success we must have the help of the \nrest the world and the help of the Iraqi people on their own behalf.\n  Several arguments have been offered in opposition to our amendment. \nLet me address them. First, there is no government in power to take on \nthese obligations. Really? Was Saddam Hussein in power to burden the \nIraqi people with these loans? I suggest the current council has at \nleast as much legitimacy as Saddam Hussein. If his loans were \nlegitimate, so are the actions of the council.\n  It is said this is a test of our resolve. That is true. But the \nsurest way to assure the resolve of the American people is to do what \nis just and fair and right. How can we possibly say to the American \npeople the French, the Germans, and the Russians may get repaid, those \nwho propped up Saddam Hussein, but those who paid to liberate the \ncountry receive nothing. Is that fair? That would undermine the \nresolve.\n  There is a perception this is all about the oil. That is a lie. We \nknow it is a lie. It is a demonstrable lie. I say to my colleagues, no \ngreat power, including our country, can base its policy upon falsehoods \nand lies. We must base our policy upon the truth and the facts. We know \nwhy we are in Iraq.\n  It is also said this will undermine our effort to achieve loan \nforgiveness. On the contrary. This will provide an incentive for others \nto forgive their loan and puts us in a position of maximum leverage to \ninsist they do. If they drag their heels and refuse, it is said we will \nlose control of this money. No, my friends, we include a specific \nprovision providing Ambassador Bremer with veto power over \nexpenditures.\n  Finally, this is about American leadership. We lead when we do the \nright thing. I ask for your support for this amendment. It will \naccomplish our objectives in Iraq.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1876\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided prior to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution which urges countries that currently hold Iraqi \ndebt that was incurred by Saddam Hussein to forgive that debt. If they \ndo not, the Iraqi people and the Iraqi economy will suffocate.\n  The Congressional Research Service says there is from $95 to $153 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S12709]]\n\nworth of debt. They cannot service that debt and grow as an economy. \nThat debt is owned or held by Saudi Arabia. They have $25 billion. It \nis held by Kuwait, $15 to $27 billion; Russia, $3 to $16 billion; \nJapan, $3 to $7 billion; Germany, $2 to $4 billion; France, $2 to $8 \nbillion.\n  We urge the countries that took debt, made loans to Saddam Hussein's \nregime, to forgive that debt and allow the Iraqi people and their \neconomy to grow.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--``yeas'' 98, ``nays'' 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 388 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Lieberman\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1876) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1871\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided in relation to the Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is it 1 minute a side or 2 minutes a side? I thought I \nhad a standing order there would be 2 minutes before every vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This order says 2 minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sorry. I ask unanimous consent that it be 2 minutes \non each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nMexico and 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I only have a minute. I want you to take \na trip with me. I want you to take a trip to Iraq. The first thing we \nare going to do is walk up to a soldier. His name is Joe Chavis. We are \ngoing to say: Hi, Joe, how are you? I see that tank of yours. It needs \nrepairing. Hey, Joe, that electric line isn't working and those kids \ndon't have any electricity. Which do you think we ought to do: Fix your \ntank or fix the electricity?\n  Sergeant Chavis says: Fix the electricity, Senator.\n  I walked down the road a little bit and I saw another soldier, a \nwoman who was there in military uniform.\n  I said: Ma'am, I understand that you don't have the vests that you \nneed to protect yourself. But I also noticed over there a schoolhouse \nis broken down and it needs fixing. I said: What do you need most?\n  She said: Fix the schoolhouse.\n  I did that five times. Every time the soldier said: Fix whatever it \nis, give them whatever it is and wait on me. I can wait.\n  I think you should all understand that is what is going on. If we \ndon't do that, they will be there forever. That is why they are saying, \nfix the other things and don't worry so much about us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this has been a very important debate. I \ncongratulate all who took part. This is obviously a very important and \ncritical vote. This vote is a message to our constituents about how we \nfeel about foreign aid. It is a message to the Iraqis about what we \nexpect from them and what they can expect from us. It is a message to \nour allies about their obligations to peace in the Middle East and our \nwillingness to meet our own.\n  Ultimately, this vote speaks to who we are as a nation and as a \npeople. We won the peace. Let's win the reconstruction and democracy \nand freedom for the Iraqi people. I ask you to vote no on this \namendment.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, how much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BAYH. I yield 1 minute of my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, everything that the Senator from New \nMexico asked, this amendment doesn't take away any of that. The full \n$20 billion stays within this amendment. The difference is, do we give \nit all in a grant and does that strengthen the President's hand or do \nwe give half of it in a grant and half of it in a loan? We believe if \nyou give half in a loan, the President's hand is strengthened on \ngetting other countries that are owed money from the previous Saddam \nHussein regime to forgive that debt. I make no apologies for the \nAmerican people to say, if France, Germany, and Russia can be paid \nback, then we should be paid back. I hope all of the debt is forgiven. \nI think that is best for Iraq. But if the rest of the countries don't \nforgive their debt, then the American taxpayer should be paid back.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it has been said that our decision tonight \nwill determine whether America is perceived as a leader in the world. \nWhat kind of message will we send after all the dying and treasure and \nblood we have expended in Iraq? Can there be any doubt about American \nleadership and about the message we send? When we removed Saddam \nHussein, America sent a message that we lead to stand for freedom--the \nfreedom to choose your own government, the freedom to run your own \neconomy.\n  Tonight, again, we lead with $72 billion free and clear in grants for \nthe security of Iraq; further, $5 billion for the immediate \nreconstruction needs, free and clear to Iraq; further, $10 billion for \nthe long-term reconstruction needs for the people of Iraq is a loan to \nbe forgiven if the rest of the world will join us in this cause.\n  That is American leadership. That is the message we send. That is why \nwe ask for your support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be a \n10-minute vote. A number of Senators still hope to offer amendments \ntonight, and that would save us some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am compelled to object because I think \nthere are some people who have left the building already. I inquired \nwhether it was going to be a 10-minute vote. I asked the \nParliamentarian if we had agreed, and then I told them we had not. I \nurge the leader to leave it the normal 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there will be no further votes tonight. \nWhat we plan to do now is ask Members who still have amendments to be \nconsidered to consult with us. We are prepared to accept some of them. \nWe will have an early session of the Senate tomorrow starting at 9. We \nwill start voting on the amendments that are still pending that have \nnot been resolved tonight. There are still a couple of amendments that \nMembers wish to offer tomorrow, but first we will vote on the pending \namendments. So all Senators should be on notice there will be votes \nstarting immediately in the morning. After the first vote, I shall ask \nthat the amendments be 10 minutes each so that there will be a series \nof probably 19 to 20 amendments, as I count them right now, that could \nwell be voted on before we will then take up the several amendments, \ntwo to three amendments, that Members wish to debate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do yield.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd has asked me to announce that tonight we would \nhave Senator Boxer offer an amendment. She is going to just take a \ncouple of minutes. Senator Leahy has an important amendment. He will \ntake a reasonably short period of time. Senator Durbin has an \namendment. He will take a short period of time, and then Senator \nCorzine and Senator Landrieu, in that order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not agreeing to any order, Mr. President. We have a \nlist of amendments. We are going to go down the list of amendments and \nsee who is here.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not know then how to operate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am perfectly ready to start considering amendments, \nbut I am not going to have any time agreement right now on any \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not asked for any time agreement. I \nam trying to help. I am trying to move this along. I personally do not \ncare if we ever finish this bill. I am trying to work and move this \nbill along. I was asked to have some people offer some amendments who \nhave a vote. I have spent probably an hour and a half getting these \npeople lined up to offer amendments.\n  If we are going to finish this bill tomorrow, then we have to do it \nthis way. Otherwise, count me out of the ball game. Somebody else can \nfigure out how to do it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senators are at liberty to offer their amendments as \nthey wish tonight. We will be glad to stay as long as Senators want to \noffer amendments and present them to us. We are trying to work out \nthose amendments with people who want to settle amendments first, not \nthose who want to bring up amendments and demand a vote tomorrow. There \nare a bunch of Senators willing to compromise on amendments and I want \nto let them proceed and have them go home before the other people who \nwant to offer amendments, argue, and then have a vote tomorrow.\n\n  I think that is a logical progress.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield. I then say to Senator Boxer, \nSenator Leahy, Senator Durbin, Senator Corzine, and Senator Landrieu, \ngo home. We will do them tomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is perfectly all right with me, Mr. President. I am \nhere until Saturday, Sunday, whatever it takes. The bill will be \nfinished sometime before the end of this week.\n  To stand up and say these people are going to come first before those \nwe have been negotiating with, we told them we will accept amendments \nand can handle those, I think that is wrong. So if Senators want to go \nhome, go home. If they want to stay here and settle this bill, stay.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, \nhas an amendment that has been cleared on both sides. She wants to make \na few remarks on that amendment. I welcome her offering that amendment \nat this time and discussing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I am happy to \nwork within the system. I have a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Senators \nengaging in conversations, please take those conversations from the \nSenate floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate is not in \norder.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a modified version of my \namendment No. 1877 to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1877, as modified.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on reconstruction efforts in \n                                 Iraq)\n\n       On page 38, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. 2313. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A coalition of allied countries led by the United \n     States entered Iraq on March 19, 2003, to liberate the people \n     of Iraq from the tyrannical rule of Saddam Hussein and the \n     Baathist party and to remove a threat to global security and \n     stability.\n       (2) Achieving stability in Iraq will require substantial \n     monetary investments to develop a secure environment and \n     improve the physical infrastructure.\n       (3) A stable and prosperous Iraq is important to peace and \n     economic development in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S12711]]\n\n       (4) As of October 2003, the United States has provided the \n     majority of the personnel and financial contributions to the \n     effort to rebuild Iraq.\n       (5) Congress fully supports efforts to establish a stable \n     economic, social, and political environment in Iraq.\n       (6) The President is currently seeking to increase global \n     participation in the effort to stabilize and reconstruct \n     Iraq.\n       (7) While the United States should aid the people of Iraq, \n     the participation of the people of Iraq in the reconstruction \n     effort is essential for the success of such effort.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) make every effort to increase the level of financial \n     commitment from other nations to improve the physical, \n     political, economic, and social infrastructure of Iraq; and\n       (2) seek to provide aid from the United States to Iraq in a \n     manner that promotes economic growth in Iraq and limits the \n     long-term cost to taxpayers in the United States.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be brief. The sense of the \nSenate says we support helping Iraq as it builds a new democracy and \nbelieve we need to finish what we have started there and in \nAfghanistan. It is critical that this reconstruction effort have a \nmultilateral approach, that our allies would help us in the war on \nterrorism, because our allies are reaping the benefits of this war on \nterrorism. No one will be free in the world if we lose the war on \nterrorism. It is essential we have all of the support we need to finish \nthis job. So we ask the administration to continue to seek commitments \nduring the donors conference and afterward. It encourages the President \nto provide aid in a way that promotes economic growth in Iraq and \nlimits the long-term cost to our taxpayers. The President is in the \nbest position to determine how to accomplish this, and we must support \nhim in every way.\n  That is my amendment, my sense of the Senate. I hope we can support \nit and vote for it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I ask the Senate consider and adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is whether there is further \ndebate on the amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe this is open for debate. I want \nto express myself tonight. I have not said this before, but I have to \ntell you that the Senator from Nevada has been working so diligently \nwith his colleagues on the other side to move along the business of \nthis body.\n  He suggested that four of us who have very brief amendments be \nallowed to go forward--not in advance of the other side. I don't have \nany problem with a few people going first or alternating back and \nforth. But I have to say, I feel very bad about this, and I am not \ngoing to be cooperating tonight if we are not going to allow this to \ntake on some kind of comity at this late hour where we hear from \nSenator Hutchison, who has a very good amendment, and then we go to our \nside, and back and forth.\n  I want to speak just as one Senator to say I feel bad about the way \nthings are deteriorating tonight and I am not going to cooperate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from California and I came to Washington \ntogether many years ago. We are very close friends. I consider Senator \nBoxer a sister. I appreciate her saying a few words on my behalf. But I \nthink probably part of the blame was mine. I know the Senator from \nAlaska very well, and I probably would have been well advised, when he \nwas raising his voice a little bit, for me not to raise my voice. The \nfact of the matter is, we both have been working on this bill for hours \nand days, and probably we are both a little testy. So I think there is \nblame to go around on both sides. I do appreciate my friend from \nCalifornia defending me. She has made her point, at least as confirming \nour friendship, and I think Senator Stevens and I can work this out and \nmove the bill along.\n  I do appreciate very much my friend from California sticking up for \nme as she has done tonight and has done for the last 22 years we have \nbeen together.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Can we get this amendment adopted? May we adopt the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1877), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The procedure we had, and I told people on this side we \nwould do, we have two amendments on this side, one amendment on that \nside, that have been cleared and we will let them go home. I am \nperfectly willing to go to anyone else who wants to talk, but as the \nmanager of the bill we have the right to say to people: Look, if you \nwill agree to offer these and make these changes, we will take them up \nright away, as soon as this vote is over. That I did, so I don't \napologize to anyone.\n  I would like to yield to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. As I look around, \nthere is only one person on this floor who has served longer than I \nhave and that is the Senator from Alaska. I know the difficulties--both \nhe and I have gone back and forth, sometimes one is chairman, sometimes \nthe other is, on different committees--how difficult it is to keep a \nmajor bill going through. I understand his concern in doing it.\n  The senior Senator from Nevada has done the job of being whip for our \nside better than anybody I have ever known who served here. There is a \ngreat deal of respect for his integrity on both sides of the aisle, as \nthere is for the senior Senator from Alaska. I know both have been \ntrying to work this out. I hope we would just continue that way. It is \nnot an easy process. There are differences of opinion on a number of \nthese amendments. But I know both the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Nevada are two of the finest people I have served with, \nand I hope we would allow the two of them to work, as they do so very \nwell, and Members on both sides of the aisle would work with them and \nallow them to work out the schedule.\n  The Senator from Vermont is perfectly satisfied with that kind of \narrangement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I said I wouldn't apologize. I do apologize to my friend \nfrom Nevada if I offended him. I did not intend to offend him. He is a \nvaluable Member of the Senate and has worked, whether in the majority \nor minority, assiduously to see the Senate does its work. I don't argue \nwith that at all. I have great fondness for the Senator from Nevada.\n  I wish I lived in Nevada. I might even vote for him if I lived there.\n  I see the current occupant of the chair is laughing at that, but it \nis true.\n  The difficulty I have is I think we don't communicate well enough \nacross this aisle in terms of the plans we each make as manager of our \nside on this particular bill.\n  Right now the Senator from Nevada has an amendment by Senator Nelson \nwe agreed to clear. I am pleased to yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1858, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. I send a modification of the Nelson amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by Senator Nelson. He has \nbeen in negotiations with the majority staff for several days now.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is acceptable.\n  Mr. REID. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge its adoption also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Without objection, \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1858), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 316. Of the amounts appropriated by this title, \n     $10,000,000 shall be available only for the Family Readiness \n     Program of the National Guard.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n\n[[Page S12712]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1867\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the amendment for Senator Warner, \nfor himself, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Edwards. It has been cleared on both \nsides. According to my information, it is amendment No. 1867.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  That amendment is currently pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1880 to Amendment No. 1867\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I also have a second-degree amendment to \nthat amendment. I ask that amendment be adopted. This is the hurricane \nflood damage amendment. We are taking out of the bill those items which \nwere not relevant to the bill. I send that amendment to the desk.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1880 to amendment numbered \n     1867.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To designate the amount designated for disaster relief \n   provided in connection with Department of Defense infrastructure \n damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Isabel as an emergency requirement.)\n\n       At the end of line 8, strike ``.'' and insert the \n     following:\n       ``: Provided, That the entire amount is designated by the \n     Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 502 \n     of H. Con. Res. 95 (108th Congress): provided further that \n     the entire amount shall be available only to the extent that \n     an official budget request for a specific dollar amount, that \n     includes the designation of the entire amount of the request \n     as an emergency requirement as defined in House Concurrent \n     Resolution 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2004, is transmitted by the President to the \n     Congress.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask consideration of the amendment, the adoption of \nthe amendment, and consideration of the amendment as amended.\n  Mr. REID. This amendment is also one that has been reviewed by the \ntwo Senators from Maryland. They both think this is good. There has \nbeen tremendous damage at the Naval Academy. This covers that also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the second-degree amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1880) was agreed to.\n  The question is on agreeing to the first-degree amendment, as \namended.\n  Without objection, that amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1867), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1843\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state to the Senator from \nCalifornia that on amendment No. 1843 we sent a notice to the Senator \nthat we are prepared to accept that retroactive assistance meal \nreimbursement amendment, if she is prepared to offer it tonight. That \nis Senator Boxer's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending \namendment aside, and I call up my amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1843.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make retroactive the relief of hospitalized members of the \n uniformed services from the obligation to pay for food or subsistence \n while hospitalized; and to provide an offset for the additional cost)\n\n       On page 20, strike lines 9 through line 12, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Section 1075(b) of title 10, United States Code, as \n     added by subsection (a), shall take effect as of September \n     11, 2001, and shall apply with respect to injuries or \n     diseases incurred on or after that date.\n       (c) The amount appropriated by chapter 2 of title II under \n     the heading ``Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund'' is hereby \n     reduced by $1,500,000, to be derived from the amount set \n     aside under such heading for transportation and \n     telecommunications for the Iraqi Postal Authority for the \n     administration of a zip code system.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am offering an amendment that \nwill help service members who have been hospitalized after being \nwounded or becoming ill during combat or other operations in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and during the war on terror since September 11, 2001.\n  Right now, when one of our soldiers is wounded, they are evacuated to \na military hospital. When whey are discharged from the hospital, they \nreceive a bill for their hospital food. The current daily rate for \nthose charges is $8.10.\n  I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Florida, Senator \nBob Graham, for offering leadership on this issue. Accepted as part of \nthe manager's package, his amendment exempts service members who are \nhospitalized from combat injuries and other conditions from having to \npay for their meals. His amendment addresses the problem \nprospectively--in the future.\n  My amendment supplements his--by closing the loop. It will require \nthe Department of Defense to reimburse troops who paid for meals while \nhospitalized as a result of either injury or illness while in combat or \ntraining for combat since September 11, 2001.\n  I recently learned about a Marine staff sergeant who was injured when \nan Iraqi dropped a grenade in the HUMVEE he was driving. As a result of \nthe explosion, he lost part of his food, and spent 26 days in the \nhospital recovering. He was then discharged to return home and to his \njob as a sheriff's deputy. At the same time, he was handed a bill for \n$210.60 for his food.\n  Mr. President, $210.60 may not seem like a lot of money to some of \nus. But to an enlisted person with a family making under $20,000 a \nyear--this is a serious financial burden.\n  When service members are discharged, we should express our gratitude \nfor their profound personal sacrifice, not hand them a bill for their \nhospital food.\n  My amendment is simple and corrects this stunning injustice. It shows \nour strong support for the courageous men and women who fought in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and have returned, wounded, ill, missing limbs, \ntoo often permanently disabled.\n  The price to the Government for correcting this serious affront to \nour service members is very, very small indeed. This amendment costs \njust $1.5 million, with the offset found in the account to create new \nzip codes in Iraq, which the House eliminated in their bill last week.\n  I understand the Department of Defense has recouped only $1.5 million \nthis year for hospital meals from all hospitalized service members \nworld-wide. We are talking about just $1.5 million from over 2 million \nactive and reserve forces across the globe.\n  What I am proposing is much more limited in scope. It would only \nreimburse service members who have been wounded or become ill due to \ncombat or training for combat since September 11, 2001. According to \nthe Defense Department, approximately 2,000 service members have been \ninjured or wounded in action in Iraq. Considerably less were injured in \nour operations in Afghanistan. The Defense Department says the total \nfor both conflicts may be roughly 3,500 people.\n  I am talking about giving back a small amount to our troops for their \nextraordinary sacrifice. It would mean a great deal to the service \nmembers and military families who face extended separations, financial \nhardship, and sometimes serious injury.\n  We were very fortunate that Representative Bill Young from Florida \ndiscovered that our service men and women who are in hospitals were \nbeing asked to pay for meals as they checked out of the hospital. Some \nof them had horrible injuries and some lost limbs. Congressman Young \nfixed the problem, and Senator Graham, working with Senator Stevens and \nothers, fixed the problem. But the fix has only been for the future. It \nhas not been fixed for those who actually went to war in Afghanistan \nand Iraq and are getting hit with these bills.\n  I recently learned about a marine staff sergeant who was injured when \nan Iraqi dropped a grenade on a Humvee he was driving, and he lost part \nof his foot. He spent 26 days in a hospital. When he was discharged to \nreturn home as a sheriff's deputy, he was handed a $210.60 bill for his \nfood. That may not seem like a lot to some, but\n\n[[Page S12713]]\n\nwhen you are earning approximately $20,000 a year, it is a serious \nfinancial burden.\n  I know we all want to fix this. What we have done in the amendment is \nvery simple. We pay back those who served in Afghanistan and in Iraq \nwho wound up in hospitals and were billed for their food, and we pay \nfor it with an offset. The amendment will cost $1.5 million. We pay for \nit in an offset found in the account for a new ZIP Code in Iraq. I \nthink it is very important for us to do this. It is much more important \nthan new ZIP Codes in Iraq.\n  I am very hopeful that tomorrow we will have an overwhelming vote in \nfavor of this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment. The Senator \nfrom California is absolutely right. If there is a saint in this town, \nit is Mrs. Bill Young. She has been extremely helpful to all of the \nsoldiers and sailors at Walter Reed and at Bethesda. Just today, she \ncalled me and told me that the admiral at Bethesda told her he is under \norders to send bills for about $5,000 to several different military \npeople who are in the hospital for reimbursement of their meals. I told \nmy staff to notify the admiral that we had fixed it in this bill, or I \nwould personally guarantee the payment, and not just have standard \ngarnishing of these kids' salaries.\n  I commend the Senator for the amendment. We attempted to fix that in \none former bill. But that bill hasn't become law. I think the bill will \nbecome law very fast.\n  I support the Senator's amendment and urge its adoption.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1843, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer \namendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1843), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, strike lines 9 through line 12, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Section 1075(b) of title 10, United States Code, as \n     added by subsection (a), shall take effect as of September \n     11, 2001, and shall apply with respect to injuries or \n     diseases incurred on or after that date.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment, if I could be heard \nbriefly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is that modification of the amendment we just agreed to \nthe yeas and nays on? I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from California was concerned \nabout the modification. This had been approved by staff. She wanted to \nmake sure everyone understood that the money she is seeking would be \npaid for out of existing funds rather than offset. That is the purpose \nof the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask the Senator from \nAlaska this question. We will not have an offset. I have agreed not to \nhave an offset. Is it the chairman's understanding that the $1.5 \nmillion will come from----\n  Mr. STEVENS. From the funds that are in the bill. Those amounts are \nde minimis, really. There will be no budget point of order against \nthat.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And it will happen.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It will happen. It is in another bill also. The question \nis which bill gets there first.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is retroactive. We took care of it prospectively. \nThis is to actually write checks to people.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is right. Our current amendment which we \nhave out there somewhere goes through 2004. The Senator's amendment \ngoes back to 2001.\n  We are happy to accept that, but the moneys are there. It is \ncarryover money from past years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As long as I am clear on that, I am very happy. I thank \neveryone.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I congratulate the Senator. It is a good amendment.\n  We have no objection to Senator Daschle's amendment, if it is cleared \nby Senator Byrd.\n  We have that, by the way, in the managers' package. We worked it out \nwith Senator Byrd's staff and mine. We will be happy to adopt it now, \nif the Senator would like to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am told by staff that in the usual fine \nwork of Senators Reid and Stevens there has been a slight misstep. This \nwas already approved earlier today.\n  Mr. REID. Unless Senator Stevens has something else--I know it is in \norder--I call up the amendment of the Senator from Vermont who has been \nwaiting around for a while. He has a short statement to make.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection. I would like to confer with the \nSenator and Members on that side on items we believe are subject to \nbudget points of order and give notice of that.\n  Mr. REID. We will do that as he is speaking.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1807, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I call up amendment numbered 1807 on behalf of Senators \nLeahy and Chafee and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1807), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction of \n                                Liberia)\n\n       Beginning on page 29, strike line 13 and all that follows \n     through page 31, line 5, and insert the following:\n\n       International Disaster Assistance and Military Assistance\n\n       For an additional amount for ``International Disaster \n     Assistance'' for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction \n     assistance for Liberia, and for an additional amount for \n     military assistance programs for Liberia for which funds were \n     appropriated by title III of the Foreign Operations, Export \n     Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2003 \n     (division E of Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 176), \n     $200,000,000, to remain available until expended, of which \n     $100,000,000 shall be derived by transfer from funds \n     appropriated in this title under the subheading ``Iraq Relief \n     and Reconstruction Fund'' under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL \n     ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT''.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Coleman, Daschle, \nBiden, Lieberman, Feingold, Reed of Rhode Island, and Lautenberg be \nadded as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Chafee, for \n     himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1807, as modified.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This amendment addresses the humanitarian crisis in \nLiberia. This is a bipartisan amendment, supported by Senators Chafee, \nColeman, Biden, Lieberman, Feingold, Reed, Lautenberg, and Landrieu.\n  Anyone who has read a newspaper or watched CNN over the past couple \nof months knows about the tremendous suffering in Liberia today.\n  Three-quarters of Liberians do not have access to safe drinking \nwater.\n  Three-quarters are living in poverty.\n  Three-quarters do not have access to acceptable sanitation.\n  Eighty-five percent of Liberians are unemployed.\n  These numbers, provided by the U.N. are absolutely appalling. To me, \nthis is more than enough reason to act.\n  We have deep historical ties to its people. Presidents James Monroe \nand Andrew Jackson, along with some of the most notable Senators ever \nto serve in this body, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, helped create the \nnation of Liberia. Liberia's flag is nearly identical to our own.\n  We have heard urgent pleas from the Liberian people for the U.S. to \nhelp.\n\n[[Page S12714]]\n\nArchbishop Michael Francis of Monrovia, wrote a letter in support of \nthis amendment. He wrote:\n\n       [W]e are at a critical juncture where an intervention by \n     the United States, renewing its leadership role, will greatly \n     help to ensure the stabilization of Liberia. It is for this \n     reason that your amendment to include $200 million in the FY \n     2004 Supplemental Appropriations bill to address relief and \n     reconstruction needs in Liberia is timely and must be \n     supported by the Senate body.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Daschle: \n     Thank you for your leadership on the important issues that \n     face the African continent each day. Your important voice on \n     many of the issues such as infectious disease, conflict \n     resolution, human rights, and democratic transition the \n     continent is incredibly appreciated, particularly by those of \n     us on the ground who are working daily to affect the change \n     necessary to bring peace, justice, and stability to our \n     respective nations.\n       As you know, the on-going human rights crisis in Liberia \n     continues to require close examination and a comprehensive \n     response so that the country does not spiral back to the days \n     when Liberia was governed by warlord Charles Taylor. As this \n     transition progresses, we are at a critical juncture where an \n     intervention by the United States, renewing its leadership \n     role, will greatly help to ensure the stabilization of \n     Liberia. Thus, I write to strongly urge your support for the \n     Chafee-Leahy amendment which would include $200 million in \n     the FY2004 Supplemental Appropriations bill to address the \n     relief and reconstruction needs of Liberia.\n       Liberia has endured years of a brutal conflict. The signing \n     of a peace agreement in Accra, Ghana, as well as the \n     deployment of peacekeeping troops to Liberia have paved the \n     way for the best opportunity for peace and stability in the \n     West African nation since the onset of civil strife in 1989.\n       We have seen that, despite a peace accord between rebel \n     forces and the Government of Liberia, fighting continues in \n     our war-ravaged nation. The inability of humanitarian \n     organizations to safely deliver aid, given grave security \n     problems, has precipitated a large-scale humanitarian crisis \n     in the small West African nation. U.S. Agency for \n     International Development estimates more than 500,000 \n     Liberians are currently internally displaced. Many internally \n     displaced and tens of thousands of refugees who fled to \n     Liberia from other conflicts in the region have been cut off \n     from outside assistance. Moreover, the country's physical \n     infrastructure is in dire straits, and the peace process in \n     Liberia is dependent on investments from the United States, \n     which will help provide good governance, employment, law and \n     order, and basic social services.\n       In testimony before the House International Relations \n     Committee on October 2, 2003, Assistant Secretary of State \n     for African Affairs Walter Kansteiner, III, agreed that at \n     least $200 million would be needed to address humanitarian \n     and reconstruction needs in Liberia in FY2004. He also \n     pledged to work with the Congress to include such funding in \n     the supplemental bill.\n       Senators Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) \n     have introduced a corresponding amendment to address the \n     humanitarian and reconstruction needs of Liberia in the \n     supplemental. The $200 million would come from funds already \n     in the supplemental and would not raise the total amount of \n     the bill.\n       Additionally these resources would assist by sending a \n     strong, clear and unequivocal message to all the parties, \n     expressing the United States' determination to play an active \n     and robust role in the initiative aimed at ameliorating the \n     Liberian crisis. I appeal to you to ensure that this funding \n     remain consistent with our desire to avoid any rush to quick \n     fixes and semi-solutions. Rather our collective strategy \n     should be aimed at achieving the following strategic \n     objectives:\n       1. Consolidating the cease fire and stabilizing the \n     security situation on the ground;\n       2. Ensuring the demobilization of the militia and their \n     proper reintegration into the civil society;\n       3. Creating a secure environment over the entire country;\n       4. Contributing to consolidating national unity and \n     assisting in establishing a viable transitional government;\n       5. Reestablishing the necessary state structures for \n     effective governance and ensuring that they function in a \n     proper and durable way; and\n       6. Once these pre-conditions have been met, we must further \n     assist in the preparation of free, fair, transparent, and \n     democratic elections.\n       As you know, the supplemental request, as it was sent to \n     Congress, fails to identify any resources to meet these \n     urgent needs in Liberia. Without adding money to the 2004 \n     supplemental, Liberia will receive no significant funding \n     until FY2005, a full year after the outbreak of a fragile \n     peace. I implore you, on behalf of the Liberian people, to \n     assist us in addressing Liberia's human rights, peace \n     building, and reconstruction needs. Without strong U.S. \n     support, Liberia threatens to fall once more into violence \n     and chaos, possibly becoming a haven for criminal and \n     terrorist activity on the African continent.\n       The critical human rights needs of our brothers and sisters \n     in Liberia and West Africa require your uncompromising \n     support of the Chafee-Leahy amendment to include $200 million \n     for humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Liberia in the \n     FY2004 Supplemental Appropriations bill when it comes to the \n     Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                               Archbishop Michael Kpakala Francis.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Archbishop Francis is said to be the only man in Liberia \nthat Charles Taylor feared. This is because of the archbishop's \ntireless criticism of Charles Taylor and his brutal regime.\n  If we don't move decisively to help solidify the fragile peace in \nLiberia, fighting could easily resume and spread throughout the region. \nGuess who the world will look to help solve the crisis?\n  The United States. More lives will have been lost, more time will \nhave been wasted and it will be more difficult and expensive to act.\n  Mr. President, this amendment gives the Senate a chance to take \ndecisive action to address the crisis in Liberia. This amendment \nprovides $200 million in badly needed aid, and it allows the \nadministration to determine the best way to spend these funds.\n  How did we arrive at this figure? Two hundred million dollars is what \nthe Bush administration says we should spend to respond to this crisis. \nOn October 2, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Walter Kansteiner \ntold the House International Relations Committee that $200 million is \nwhat the U.S. should contribute to Liberia.\n  In other words, this is the administration's own number.\n  This amendment is fully offset--it does not add one dime to the total \namount of the supplemental. It also allows the administration to use \nthese funds for virtually any purpose: humanitarian, reconstruction, or \nsecurity assistance.\n  We have an $87 billion bill before the Senate. But there is no money \nin this bill designated for Liberia.\n  We are already involved in Liberia. The United States worked to get \nrid of a despicable dictator who is wanted for war crimes. We sent the \nMarines to Liberia. The United States has deep historical ties to \nLiberia. We should do the job right--not just stick a band-aid on the \nproblem and hope it goes away.\n  Mr. President, it is up to Congress to show leadership on this issue.\n  The House has acted. It has included $100 million of international \ndisaster assistance for Liberia and Sudan. The Senate should build on \nthis effort. This amendment does that.\n  There should be no question. We should join together and pass this \nbipartisan amendment and help the people of Liberia. That is why I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? At the moment, \nthere is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold the quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the purpose of Senator Durbin offering an \namendment.\n\n[[Page S12715]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1837\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk on Reserve \npay which I will be asking to be put in the queue for a vote tomorrow. \nThis amendment I offered 2 days ago.\n  I am not going to belabor the issue other than to say to my \ncolleagues, and for the record, that what it provides is that Federal \nemployees who are members of the Guard and Reserves who are activated \nwould have the difference in their pay--their military pay and their \nFederal pay--made up by the Federal agency for which they work. This is \ndone by State governments and private companies and local units of \ngovernment. It is not done by the Federal Government.\n  Frankly, this amendment was offered in good faith to have the Federal \nGovernment establish the standard so that activated Guard and Reserves \nwho are Federal employees will receive this difference.\n  There are 1.2 million Guard and Reserves in America. Ten percent of \nthem are Federal employees, 14,000 are now activated, and almost half \nof them have seen a cut in pay. Since activation has gone for an \nextended period of time, I will ask that that amendment be put in the \nqueue tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1879\n\n  Mr. President, I have another amendment, but before I send the \namendment to the desk, let me describe it to my colleagues.\n  I offered an amendment, earlier today, on the global AIDS epidemic, \nan amendment which said we have made a commitment as a nation to spend \n$15 billion over the next 5 years to deal with this epidemic. This is \nan epidemic which President Bush acknowledged in his State of the Union \nMessage and one that he has spoken of extensively here in the United \nStates and while traveling abroad.\n  Unfortunately, the administration did not come up, in the first year, \nwith $3 billion to deal with the global AIDS epidemic.\n  We know there is a serious need across the world to spend the funds \nnecessary. I would say to my colleagues who might ask, ``Why would you \nraise the global AIDS epidemic on this emergency appropriations bill,'' \nconsider the statement made by Secretary of State Colin Powell to the \nUnited Nations just a few weeks ago. I quote:\n\n       AIDS is more devastating than any terrorist attack, any \n     conflict, or any weapon of mass destruction.\n\n  The extended quote will be made a part of the Record. But what I \nwould like to say to my colleagues is this: I hope--as we consider what \nit takes to make this a safe world for future generations, as we \nconsider what is necessary in the Middle East and Iraq--we also \nconsider that we are living in a world devastated by AIDS, that AIDS is \nan epidemic destabilizing countries, making them vulnerable to \nterrorist takeovers, and creating the kind of instability that \nguarantees the United States must pay heed.\n  There is a way to deal with this, and the way to do it is to keep our \nword.\n  My earlier version of this amendment was objected to by Senator \nStevens. He argued it included legislative language. We have stricken \nall legislative language in this amendment.\n  Secondly, this would not be subject to a budget point of order \nbecause the foreign operations appropriations bill has not passed, and \nthe set-off in the amendment comes in emergency appropriations, so \nthere is no problem with either the budget or the spend-out rate.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1879.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the prevention, treatment, and control \n                     of, and research on HIV/AIDS)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Global HIV/AIDS Funding.--For necessary \n     expenses to carry out the provisions of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 for the prevention, treatment, and \n     control of, and research on HIV/AIDS, in addition to funds \n     appropriated under the heading ''Global AIDS Initiative'' in \n     the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Act, 2004, $879,700,000.\n       (b) Offset.--The total amount appropriated under title II \n     under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE--\n     FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE PRESIDENT--Iraq Relief and \n     Reconstruction Fund'' (other than the amount appropriated for \n     Iraqi border enforcement and enhanced security communications \n     and the amount appropriated for the establishment of an Iraqi \n     national security force and Iraqi Defense Corps) shall be \n     reduced by $879,700,000.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we consider this $87 billion \nsupplemental--and what is truly in the interest of our national \nsecurity, for this generation and generations to come--these words from \nthe Secretary of State about the impact of AIDS have special resonance: \n``more devastating than any terrorist attack, any conflict, or any \nweapon of mass destruction.''\n  AIDS is fast becoming the worst plague the world has ever \nencountered. Already, 25 million people have been killed by the \ndisease.\n  Today, another 42 million people around the world face a death \nsentence from AIDS because they have no access to life-saving treatment \nthat can cost as little as a dollar a day.\n  As parents are dying, 14 million AIDS orphans have been left without \nthe care and support that they need. Unless we act soon, there will be \n25 million AIDS orphans by the end of the decade.\n  Each year the world loses a population greater than the city of \nChicago because of AIDS. Yet, we know how to stop these deaths.\n  Keeping our promises in the fight against AIDS is in America's \ninterest. AIDS represents not only a humanitarian crisis on a scale the \nworld has never seen. AIDS also presents a growing security threat \naround the world.\n  Living up to the President's promises on AIDS makes good sense for \nour national security. It is also important for showing the world that \nwe make good on our commitments.\n  As the CIA Director recently said about AIDS:\n\n       Is this a security issue? You bet it is. With more than 40 \n     million people infected right now, a figure that--by 2010--\n     may reach 100 million, AIDS is building dangerous momentum in \n     regions beyond Africa.\n\n  As the disease spreads, it unravels social structures, decimates \npopulations and destabilizes entire nations.\n  The National Intelligence Council found that in five of the world's \nmost populous nations, the number of HIV-infected people will grow to \nan estimated 50 to 75 million by 2010.\n  AIDS is particularly devastating national armies around the world \nthat ensure stability. In South Africa, according to the Rand \nInstitute, some military units have infection rates as high as 90 \npercent.\n  Keeping our promises on AIDS is not only the compassionate thing to \ndo, it is the smart thing to do in terms of our national security as \nwell.\n  Today, we have a change to change the course of the AIDS pandemic and \nstrengthen our national security by providing $3 billion in the coming \nyear.\n  In this State of the Union address, the President made a 5-year \npledge of $15 billion to help the millions of AIDS sufferers in Africa \nand around the world. We must keep that pledge today.\n  The President has said:\n\n       We can turn our eyes away in resignation and despair, or we \n     can take decisive, historic action to turn the tide against \n     this disease and give the hope of life to millions who need \n     our help.\n\n  Unfortunately the President's budget failed to live up to the \nPresident's rhetoric. His budget fell nearly $1 billion short of the $3 \nbillion for the coming year.\n  The President's shortchanging on AIDS will cost lives. The additional \nfunding which we seek to restore today can put 1 million people on \ntreatment and prevent 2.5 million new infections.\n  In July, 78 members of this body voted for sense of the Senate \nlanguage calling for fully funding the $3 billion to fight AIDS this \nyear, even if it meant exceeding the levels authorized in the budget.\n  The President himself said that ``we care more about results than \nwords.\n\n[[Page S12716]]\n\nWe're interested in lives saved.'' Now is our opportunity to go beyond \nwords and fulfill the pledge that the President made in the State of \nthe Union and that we made in July.\n  The amendment I am putting forward will close the gap between the \nrhetoric and the real needs of AIDS sufferers by fully funding the $3 \nbillion.\n  This amendment will provide the $879.7 million necessary to close the \ngap and fully fund the $3 billion pledge made in the authorizing \nlegislation.\n  It will do so by reducing the $20.3 Billion Iraq Relief and \nReconstruction Fund in the supplemental by a pro-rata $879.7 million. \nThis allows the administration to choose where to take the reduction--\nand the options are many.\n  For example, the supplemental contains $2.1 billion for ``oil \ninfrastructures''--$900 million for importation of petroleum products \ninto Iraq. Perhaps instead of spending nearly a billion dollars to \nimport oil into Iraq, a billion dollars might be better spent treating \n1 million additional people with AIDS and preventing an additional 2.5 \nmillion new infections.\n  The stakes could not be higher. As Majority Leader Frist said \nrecently:\n\n       History will judge whether a world led by America stood by \n     and let transpire one of the greatest destructions of human \n     life in recorded history--or performed one of its most heroic \n     rescues.\n\n  Instead of fulfilling this pledge, the White House is claiming that \nthe full amount cannot be spent in the coming year. All the leading \ndevelopment organizations and medical authorities reject this White \nHouse claim as baseless and have said so publicly.\n  Last month in Roll Call, all of the leading relief and development \norganizations in the United States placed an ad that endorsed the fact \nthat the full $3 billion could be well spent.\n  The White House is also ignoring the capacity of the Global Fund to \nFight AIDS, TB and malaria--the most effective tool we have to beat \nAIDS. The Global Fund, Chaired by Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Tommy Thompson, is scaling up successful programs on the \nground in Africa and is working to stop the next wave of the pandemic \nin places such as India and it needs hundreds of millions of dollars \nmore by this fall to fund a new round of grants.\n  The White House is also forgetting the extraordinary needs of AIDS \norphans. According to a soon to be released report by the Earth \nInstitute at Columbia, orphans and vulnerable children need $15 billion \neach year for basic health, education and community services.\n  The Global HIV Prevention Working Group found that AIDS prevention \nspending falls $3.8 billion short of what is needed by 2005. Although \nwe can spare babies a life with AIDS for the price of a Sunday \nnewspaper, only 5 percent of women at risk have access to medication to \nprevent mother-to-child transmission.\n  I hope today that the 78 of my colleagues who committed to fully fund \nthe $3 billion to fight AIDS will join me in supporting this amendment. \nWe have a unique chance to change the future and save many lives. \nToday, a 15-year-old boy in Botswana faces an 80 percent chance of \ndying of AIDS. If we act now, we can change the future for these \nchildren before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, at this point it is my understanding this amendment \nwill be put in the queue with the others for consideration tomorrow. \nWith that understanding, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1881\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment that has been cleared on \nboth sides. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set \naside and send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendments are set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Nelson of \n     Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 1881.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report on the plans of the Navy for basing \n                    aircraft carriers through 2020)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 316. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The Committee on Armed Services of the Senate specified \n     in Senate Report 107-151 to accompany S. 2514 (107th \n     Congress) that the Chief of Naval Operations submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report, not later than \n     June 2, 2003, on the plans of the Navy for basing aircraft \n     carriers through 2015.\n       (2) As of October 16, 2003, the report has not been \n     submitted.\n       (b) Report on Aircraft Carrier Basing Plans Through 2020.--\n     Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the plans of the \n     Navy for basing aircraft carriers through 2020.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been advised by the majority that \nthis amendment has been approved on both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. It has been approved on our side \nfor Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1881) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Chair would allow, we now have two \namendments we would like to offer tonight and debate tonight, one by \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, and the other by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. And we have been told that the mother of \ntwo small babies is going to go first, Senator Landrieu. I will yield \nto her if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the courtesies. \nThe children have been long in bed and are sound asleep before this \nhour. But I appreciate the courtesies extended to allow me to take a \nfew minutes to explain this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1859\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \ntemporarily laid aside and call up amendment No. 1859, which is at the \ndesk, on behalf of myself, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is a modified amendment based on a \nconcept that Senator Dorgan, Senator Levin, and others have been \nworking on now for several weeks. It is a very important amendment to \nconsider in terms of shaping a sustainable aid package for Iraq.\n  It does not address or take any money away from the $20 billion. It \nsimply establishes a framework whereby future reconstruction efforts in \nIraq could be financed through a financing mechanism using the great \noil wealth of that nation. It does not, in any way, affect the \nimmediate $20 billion which the Chair and others and I were proud to \ncosponsor and which was shaped and crafted over an hour ago on the Bayh \namendment.\n  This is about the future, not the present. It does not have an effect \non the $20 billion.\n  Within an hour or two of this time, the Senate rose to the occasion. \nWe had a very vigorous and enlightening, at times tough, but very good \ndebate on the way we should put out our reconstruction efforts for \nIraq. The Senate is fulfilling its role, shaping foreign policy, being \na partner with the executive branch, and, in my opinion, since that \namendment passed, improving the original plan.\n  As I said when I supported the Bayh amendment, the administration's \noriginal plan, which seems to people in Louisiana and to the American \npeople to be billions of dollars of grants often, only, and alone will \nnot work. Not only is it not popular, it is not sustainable in our \ndemocracy. Iraq doesn't have a democracy yet, but we do. In a \ndemocracy, we have to lay down plans that not only will the leadership \nsupport but the people support. Because without the people's support, \nno plan that\n\n[[Page S12717]]\n\nwe lay down, either at the White House or in Congress, in the House or \nthe Senate, is sustainable over a long period of time.\n  Why is that important? It is important because every study that has \nbeen conducted by independent think tanks and authorities has said that \nthe task we have undertaken in Iraq is not going to be completed in the \nnext 6 months or 1 year or 2 years. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nthis is at a minimum a 5 to 7-year effort. Does that mean our troops \nwill be there for 5 to 7 years? We hope not. Does it mean all the \ntroops there now will have to be there in that number even 2 or 3 \nyears? The effort itself of reconstruction--helping take a country that \nwas cruelly administered by a dictator, taking it to a vibrant \ndemocracy with democratic institutions in place, based on the history \nand the region we are talking about--is not going to be easy.\n  Yes, I think the Iraqi people want that. Yes, we will be good \npartners. But it is not going to be easy. It is going to take time.\n  The amendment we spoke about earlier tonight, and voted on by a 52 or \n53-vote margin, helps to take the original plan, which was not \nsustainable, and turn it into something that can be sustainable over \ntime. It targeted the grants. It was strategic. It had strong \nincentives for debt forgiveness, which is a crucial aspect and \nprinciple of a strong reconstruction plan. And most importantly, it put \nup the $20 billion right now so we can get started and build a strong \nfoundation for a successful reconstruction plan.\n  This amendment I am offering tonight, and hopefully we will vote on \ntomorrow, is a complementary piece. It says that because Iraq has some \nof the richest oil reserves in the world, most people think they are \nthe second largest resource of oil in the world, they could be the \nfirst because not all of the fields have been explored and developed. \nIn fact, it has in some instances been barely touched.\n  Let me show a picture of the country. As you can see, these are the \noil fields that are outlined right here in the north, in the center, \nright outside of Baghdad, and in the southern portion of the country. \nBut the geologists, the industry publications believe that there is as \nmuch oil in this section of Iraq, in the southwestern section, as there \nis here. As you can see, there is not one designation on this map \nbecause it has been totally unexplored.\n  The reserves we are calculating--and they are in the hundreds of \nmillions, billions of barrels of oil, and not even counting the gas--\nare well underestimated.\n\n  The point of this is that when these oil fields come back on line--\nand they are coming back on rather quickly with the support of the \ncommunities and with the support of American ingenuity and technology \nand know-how, and, by the way, that technology is improving and has \nimproved substantially--there is going to be even more oil and gas \nfound, thus making the possibility of future construction and \nrenovation and reconstruction definitely possible to be refinanced with \nthese resources.\n  This amendment will help to ensure that the Iraqi people themselves \nare benefiting from their own oil reserves. It seeks to make that point \nin no uncertain terms. The reconstruction of Iraq for the benefit of \nthe people of Iraq can be done and accomplished through a financing \nmechanism, allowing the oil reserves, which are plentiful and quite \nsubstantial, to be used in that way.\n  This is not Senator Landrieu's idea. I didn't come up with this idea. \nI heard about it. I heard administration officials speaking about it. \nIn fact, Secretary Wolfowitz said just a year ago in an interview on \nthis subject:\n\n       On a rough recollection, the oil revenues of that country \n     could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of \n     the next two or three years. . . . We're dealing with a \n     country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and \n     relatively soon.\n\n  This is what our own Secretary said. This Senate voted a few minutes \nago to decide that, no, we were not going to move to this system right \nnow. We were going to vote for this amendment that Senator Bayh and \nothers offered. We said we would not move to the reconstruction based \non the oil reserves at this time. Let's lay down the $20 billion in the \nway that we did it, part in a loan that could be forgiven if other \ndebts are forgiven, part immediately for the construction. But, in the \nfuture, my amendment says that establishing this financing mechanism \ncould match what the administration originally said they wanted to do, \nwhich, of course, makes sense not only to me but to the American \npeople.\n  The American people want us to be successful in Iraq. This is their \nchallenge. It is not something that belongs only to the leaders here in \nWashington or the President or the White House. The American people are \ngiving their own sons and daughters to the effort. They are sending \ntheir own family members to the effort. They want us to come up with a \nplan that can make sure they are not sending them in vain. It is not \njust a matter of getting the troops home. As a mother, as a parent, I \ncan appreciate and understand that if we lost a child, I would want to \nmake sure the death was not in vain, that we actually accomplished what \nwe set out to do.\n  We have to get a plan that will work. The American people know one \nthing that won't work, and that is asking the American people to foot \nthe bill, 100 percent of it, with limited help, with us carrying the \nburden of the troops and the finances over a long period of time. What \nthe American people think would work, and I agree with them, is to \njump-start it with some grants, do everything we can to make other \nnations relieve the debt, and then, over the long run, establish a \nfinancing mechanism that the country of Iraq can themselves begin the \nreconstruction. And let me just say that it is not often that the \nadministration agrees with the U.N. or that the U.N. agrees with the \nadministration. We have been trying to find common ground now for \nmonths. The U.N. thinks one way and this administration thinks a \ndifferent way, so they cannot get together.\n\n  Let me tell you one thing they agree on. This is U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 1483 that lifted sanctions on Iraq right after we \nwere successful in the war. Summarizing, it says the U.N. itself says \nthe oil resources in Iraq should not be used to pay down debt owed to \nother countries. It should not be, basically, given away to anyone. But \nwhat should it be used for? The U.N. said it should be used for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. So the U.N. and members of the administration, \nincluding the Vice President--and I will show you what the Vice \nPresident said just a few months ago, in March. He said in answer to \nTim Russert on one of the talk shows:\n\n       In Iraq you've got a nation that's got the second largest \n     oil reserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. It \n     will generate billions of dollars a year in cash flow if they \n     get back to their production of roughly 3 million barrels of \n     oil a day, and in the relatively near future.\n\n  He is saying, no, we are not going to have to pick up the $100 \nbillion, which is estimated; the Iraqis have that ability to do so \nthemselves. Mr. President, this is something the U.N. supports. It is \nsomething the administration told the American people would be part of \nthe reconstruction effort. Now we are finding, for some reason, a \ntremendous amount of resistance to this. It is hard to understand, and \nso that is why I am putting forth this amendment, which has been \nmodified.\n  It doesn't try to substitute the financing mechanisms for any part of \nthe $20 billion. It says in the future, after we have allocated this \n$20 billion, it is the sense of the Senate that the future \nreconstruction could be paid for using the Iraqi resources, which are \nplentiful--oil and gas.\n  Let me make one other point. I know my time is almost up. A lot has \nbeen said about the Marshall plan. One of the principles of the \nMarshall plan, one of the foundations on which the Marshall plan rested \nwas the fact that Germany had more coal reserves than any country in \nEurope, and that because Germany was rich in coal, in natural \nresources, the U.S. plan that was fashioned in a way that was \nsustainable over a long period of time and could be based on the riches \nand resources of that coal was not to take it from Germany but to help \nGermany use its resources to rebuild itself, to establish peace and \nprosperity for itself and its neighbors.\n  So I don't have any reason to understand or know why the same \nadministration that would say this is the way\n\n[[Page S12718]]\n\nwe should proceed is now objecting to even outlining a possibility to \nuse these resources, not for the people of the United States, not for \nthe people of Europe, but for the Iraqis themselves. So that is the \nessence of the amendment that Senator Dorgan and Senator Levin and I \nhave sent to the desk and asked for the Senate to consider. Hopefully, \nwe will have a vote tomorrow.\n  To summarize briefly, the most important thing that we need to do is \nto, together with the President and the Congress and in partnership \nwith the American people, right now, today, tonight, tomorrow, fashion \na reconstruction plan that brings our troops home safely, minimizes the \nloss of life, and actually achieves our objectives.\n\n  A tremendous amount is riding on America's reputation, our position \nin the world, our pride, our word. It is resting on how well we do \nthis. We have to have a plan that will work. What will work in the long \nrun is unleashing the tremendous wealth of that nation, not for anybody \nelse but for themselves, to fashion a plan that is good for the people \nof Iraq and for the American taxpayers who have already sacrificed a \ngreat deal in terms of treasure, life, and American blood--to come up \nwith a plan that works for both countries and actually has a chance of \nworking, so that this long-range strategy of peace in the Mideast we \ncould actually accomplish.\n  So we offer this in good faith. I am sorry the other side has not yet \naccepted this amendment, so we are going to have to vote on it \ntomorrow. I hope that perhaps overnight, through the early hours of the \nmorning, we can consider the great benefit of establishing such a \nfinancing mechanism and, that way, we will send the right signal to the \nIraqi people that America is there to stay; that we have a plan that we \ncan sustain in partnership with them using our strength and our \ntechnology and our ingenuity, their natural resources, to accomplish \nwhat their leaders have not been able to accomplish for them and which \nthey tried to take from them.\n  Saddam Hussein took the oil revenues and used it for himself and his \nfamily, to build palaces. I know a little bit about this because I come \nfrom a State where the oil revenues are not always used on behalf of \nthe people. I am very familiar with what happens when leaders take the \npublic's resources and use it for their own benefit and not the \npeople's: Children don't read, they don't go to college, hospitals are \nnot built, roads stay gravel, highways don't get built, and jobs are \nnot created. I know about that. I am saying this as passionately as I \ncan to try to explain this. The people of Iraq need help with unleashig \nthese resources for themselves, and setting up this financing mechanism \nis one of the best things we can do for them. It sends the right \nsignal, and I am positive the American people would think that this \nmakes a lot of sense, it makes common sense. Instead of asking us to \nbring the troops home, or we cannot sustain it, they might say: \nSenator, we can do this, we can help and be there for as long as it \ntakes because it is important for America to be successful.\n  That is the essence of the amendment. I thank my colleagues. The hour \nis late. I know others have to offer amendments. I thank the leader \nfrom Nevada. This will be in line for a vote tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside to allow Senator Corzine to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1882\n\n(Purpose: To establish a National Commission on the Development and Use \n                   of Intelligence Related to Iraq.)\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, in a few minutes I will be sending an \namendment to the desk. This amendment calls for a bipartisan commission \nto study the development and use of intelligence related to Iraq. The \nmission would examine several key issues, including intelligence \nrelated to the following questions: Whether Iraq possessed chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons; whether Iraq had a link to al-Qaida; \nwhether they attempted to acquire uranium in Africa; whether Iraq \nattempted to procure aluminum tubes for the development of nuclear \nweapons; whether Iraq possessed mobile laboratories for the production \nof weapons of mass destruction; whether Iraq possessed delivery systems \nfor weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, this is the same amendment I offered in July. At that \ntime, 45 Senators joined in the effort to establish an independent \ncommission, reflecting broad public concern about the potential misuse \nof intelligence information leading up to the war.\n  Since then, however, additional troubling information has come out \nand these concerns have grown considerably in many people's minds. \nThese concerns also have grown in the context of a larger intelligence \nshortcoming. One need only look at our failure thus far to find Osama \nbin Laden or Saddam Hussein, to know that we have a long way to go to \nensure that our intelligence capacities are as strong as they can be.\n  Time after time we have seen news stories about the administration's \nselective use of intelligence. Just last night, it was reported in a \nvery troubling report on ``60 Minutes II'' that a former aide to \nSecretary of State Powell, Greg Thielmann, a senior career State \nDepartment official, made serious charges against the Secretary and the \nadministration.\n  According to Mr. Thielmann, at the time of Secretary Powell's \ndramatic prewar presentation to the United Nations, Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction capability was so weak that it posed no threat to the \nUnited States and little threat even to its immediate neighbors.\n  According to Mr. Thielmann, the administration adopted a ``faith-\nbased approach to intelligence.'' He went on to say:\n\n       They knew what they wanted the intelligence to show. They \n     were really blind and deaf to any kind of countervailing \n     information the intelligence community would produce.\n\n  I have a full transcript of that interview which I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From 60 Minutes II, Oct. 15, 2003]\n\n   The Man Who Knew; Former Powell Chief of Intelligence and Others \n         Disagree With Evidence Presented to UN for War in Iraq\n\n       Scott Pelley (co-host). In the run-up to the war in Iraq, \n     one moment seemed to be a turning point: the day Secretary of \n     State Colin Powell went to the United Nations to make the \n     case for the invasion. Millions of us watched as he laid out \n     the evidence and reached a damning conclusion: that Saddam \n     Hussein was in possession of weapons of mass destruction. But \n     the man you will hear from tonight says that key evidence in \n     that speech was misrepresented and the public was deceived. \n     Greg Thielmann should know. He had been Powell's own chief of \n     intelligence when it came to Iraqi weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       When you saw Secretary of State Powell make his \n     presentation to the United Nations, what did you think?\n       Mr. Greg Thielmann. I had a couple of initial reactions. \n     Then I had a--a more mature reaction. I--I think my \n     conclusion now is that it's probably one of the low points in \n     his long and distinguished service to the nation.\n       Pelley. At the end of the speech, the United Nations and \n     the American people had been misinformed, in your opinion?\n       Mr. Thielmann. I think so.\n       Pelley. Greg Thielmann was a foreign service officer for 25 \n     years. His last job at the State Department was acting \n     director of the Office of Strategic Proliferation and \n     Military Affairs, responsible for analyzing the Iraqi weapons \n     threat for Secretary Powell.\n       You and your staff had the highest security clearances.\n       Mr. Thielmann. That's right.\n       Pelley. And you saw virtually everything.\n       Mr. Thielmann. That's right.\n       Pelley. Whether it came in to the CIA or the Defense \n     Department, it all came through your office sooner or later.\n       Mr. Theilmann. That's right, yes.\n       Pelley. Thielmann was admired at State. One high-ranking \n     official called him ``honorable, knowledgeable, very \n     experienced.'' Thielmann took a long-planned retirement four \n     months before Powell's big moment at the UN. February 5th was \n     the day the world was waiting for: Secretary Powell would \n     reveal evidence against Saddam. The speech represented a \n     change in Powell's thinking. Before 9/11, he said that Saddam \n     had not developed any significant capability in weapons of \n     mass destruction. But now, two years later, he warned that \n     Saddam had stockpiled those very weapons.\n       Sec. Colin Powell (State Department). (From UN Speech) The \n     gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the \n     threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the \n     world.\n\n[[Page S12719]]\n\n       Pelley. Do you believe that Iraq posed an imminent threat \n     to the United States of America at the point we went to war?\n       Mr. Thielmann. No. I--I think it didn't even constitute an \n     imminent threat to its neighbors at the time we went to war.\n       Pelley. Theilmann says that's what the intelligence really \n     showed. For example, he points to the evidence behind \n     Powell's charge that Iraq was importing these aluminum tubes \n     to use in a program to build nuclear weapons.\n       Sec. Powell. (From UN speech) Saddam Hussein is determined \n     to get his hands on a nuclear bomb. He is so determined that \n     he's made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-\n     specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, \n     even after inspections resumed.\n       Mr. Thielmann. This is one of the most disturbing parts of \n     Secretary Powell's speech for us.\n       Pelley. The tubes were intercepted by intelligence agents \n     in 2001. The CIA said that they were parts for a centrifuge \n     to enrich uranium, fuel for an atom bomb. But Thielmann \n     wasn't so sure. Experts at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, \n     the scientists who enriched uranium for American bombs, \n     advised that the tubes were all wrong for a bomb program. At \n     about the same time, Thielmann's office was working on \n     another explanation. It turned out the tubes' dimensions \n     perfectly matched an Iraqi conventional rocket.\n       Mr. Thielmann. The aluminum was e--exactly, I think, what \n     the Iraqis wanted for artillery.\n       Pelley. And you sent that word up to the secretary of \n     State----\n       Mr. Thielmann. That's right.\n       Pelley. Many months before.\n       Mr. Thielmann. That's right.\n       Mr. Houston Wood: You'll see where it intersects. This is \n     the velocity.\n       Pelley. Houston Wood was a consultant who worked on the Oak \n     Ridge analysis of the tubes. He watched Powell's speech, too.\n       When you saw the presentation in full wi--with regard to \n     the aluminum tubes, what were you thinking?\n       Mr. Wood. I guess I was angry. I think that's probably the \n     best emotion that I--best way to describe my emotions. I was \n     angry at that.\n       Pelley. Wood is among the world's authorities on uranium \n     enrichment by centrifuge. He found that the tubes couldn't be \n     what the CIA thought they were. They were too heavy, three \n     times too thick and certain to leak.\n       Mr. Wood. It wasn't going to work. No, they would--they \n     would have failed.\n       Pelley. Wood reached that conclusion back in 2001. \n     Thielmann reported to Secretary Powell's office that he was \n     confident the tubes were not for a nuclear program. Then \n     about a year later, when the administration was building a \n     case for war, the tubes were resurrected on the front page of \n     The New York Times.\n       Mr. Wood. I thought when I read that, ``There must be some \n     other tubes that people were talking about.'' I--I just wa--\n     was flabbergasted that people were still pushing that those \n     might be centrifuges.\n       Pelley. Flabbergasted?\n       Mr. Wood. Yeah. Yeah. So it just didn't--it didn't make any \n     sense to me.\n       Pelley. The New York Times reported that senior \n     administration officials insisted the tubes were for an atom \n     bomb program.\n       Was it clear to you that science wasn't pushing this \n     forward?\n       Mr. Wood. Yes. That's a very good way to put it. Science \n     was not pushing this forward. Scientists had made their \n     evaluation and made their determination, and now we didn't \n     know what was happening.\n       Pelley. In his UN speech, Secretary Powell acknowledged \n     there was disagreement about the tubes, but he said most \n     experts agreed with the nuclear theory.\n       Sec. Powell. (From UN speech) There is controversy about \n     what these tubes are for. Most US experts think they are \n     intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich \n     uranium.\n       Mr. Wood. Most experts are located in Oak Ridge, and that \n     was not the position there.\n       Pelley. Do you know one in academia, in government, in a \n     foreign country who disagrees with your appraisal, who says, \n     ``Yes, these are for nuclear weapons?''\n       Mr. Wood. I don't know a single one anywhere.\n       Pelley. Greg Thielmann says the nuclear case was filled \n     with half-truths.\n       If the secretary took the information that his own \n     intelligence bureau had developed and turned it on its head, \n     which is what you're saying, to what end?\n       Mr. Thielmann. I can only assume that he was doing it to \n     loyally support the president of the United States and build \n     the strongest possible case for arguing that there was no \n     alternative to the use of military force.\n       Pelley. That was a case the president himself was making \n     only eight days before Secretary Powell's speech, but the \n     argument in the State of the Union address turned out to be \n     too strong.\n       President George W. Bush. From State of the Union) The \n     British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently \n     sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our \n     intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to \n     purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear \n     weapons production.\n       Pelley. After the war, the White House said the African \n     uranium claim was false and shouldn't have been in the \n     president's address, but at the time, it was part of a \n     campaign that painted the intelligence as irrefutable.\n       Vice President Dick Cheney. There is no doubt that Saddam \n     Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no \n     doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, \n     against our allies and against us.\n       Pelley. But if there was no doubt in public, Greg Thielmann \n     says there was plenty of doubt in the intelligence community. \n     He says the administration took murky information out of the \n     gray area and made it black and white.\n       Sec. Powell. (From UN speech) My colleagues, every \n     statement I make today is backed up by sources--solid \n     sources. These are not assertions. What we're giving you are \n     facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\n       Pelley. Solid intelligence, Powell said, that proved Saddam \n     had amassed chemical and biological weapons.\n       Sec. Powell. (From UN speech) Our conservative estimate is \n     that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons \n     of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill \n     16,000 battlefield rockets.\n       Pelley. And part of that stockpile, he said, was clearly in \n     these bunkers.\n       Sec. Powell. (From UN speech) The four that are in red \n     squares represent active chemical munitions bunkers. How do I \n     know that? How can I say that? Let me give you a closer look.\n       Pelley. Up close, Powell said, you could see a truck used \n     for cleaning up chemical spills, a signature, he called it, \n     for a chemical bunker.\n       Sec. Powell. (From UN speech) It's a decontamination \n     vehicle in case something goes wrong.\n       Mr. Thielmann. My understanding is that these particular \n     vehicles were simply fire trucks that you cannot really \n     describe as being a unique signature.\n       Pelley. Satellite photos were notoriously misleading, \n     according to Steve Allinson. He was a UN inspector in Iraq in \n     the months leading up to the war.\n       Was there ever a time, in your experience, that American \n     satellite intelligence provided you with something that was \n     truly useful?\n       Mr. Steve Allinson. No, n--no, not to me, not on--not on \n     inspections that I participated in.\n       Pelley. Not once?\n       Mr. Allinson. No.\n       Pelley. Ever?\n       Mr. Allinson. No.\n       Pelley. Allinson had been sent to find decontamination \n     vehicles that turned out to be fire trucks. And another time \n     a satellite spotted what they thought were trucks used for \n     moving biological weapons.\n       Mr. Allinson. We were told that we were going to the site \n     to look for refrigerated trucks specifically linked to \n     biological agents.\n       Pelley. And you found the trucks?\n       Mr. Allinson. We did. We found about seven or eight of \n     them, I think, in total. And they were--they had cobwebs in \n     them. Some samples were taken, and nothing was found.\n       Pelley. Steve Allinson watched Powell's speech in Iraq with \n     a dozen other UN inspectors. There was great anticipation in \n     the room, something like waiting for the Super Bowl. They \n     always suspected that the U.S. was holding back its most \n     damning evidence for this moment.\n       And as you watched the speech unfold, what was the reaction \n     among the inspectors?\n       Mr. Allinson. Various people would laugh at various times \n     because the information he was presenting was just--you know, \n     it didn't mean anything. It had--had no meaning.\n       Pelley. When the secretary thanked everyone for listening \n     and had finished the speech, you and the other inspectors \n     turned to each other and said what?\n       Mr. Allinson. ``They have nothing.''\n       Pelley. If Allinson doubted the satellite evidence, \n     Thielmann watched with worry as Secretary Powell told the \n     Security Council that human intelligence provided conclusive \n     proof. Thielmann says that many of the human sources were \n     defectors who came forward with an ax to grind.\n       Give me some sense of how reliable the defector information \n     was across the board. You got bad information--What?--rarely?\n       Mr. Theilmann. I guess I would say frequently we got bad \n     information.\n       Pelley. Some of it came from defectors supplied by the \n     Iraqi National Congress, the leading exile group headed by \n     Ahmed Chalabi.\n       Mr. Theilmann. You had the Iraqi National Congress with a \n     clear motive for presenting the worst possible picture of \n     what was happening in Iraq to the American government.\n       Pelley. That may have been the case with this man. Adnan \n     Sayeed Haideiri was provided by the Iraqi National Congress \n     to the US Government, the New York Times, and he appeared \n     on CBS News. Haideiri said he was a civil engineer and he \n     claimed to have visited many secret weapon production \n     sites. The government thought he was so valuable they put \n     him in a witness protection program, and the White House \n     listed him first in its Web page on Iraqi weapons.\n       Mr. David Albright. He was, basically, an epoxy painter.\n       Pelley. David Albright is a physicist who has investigated \n     defectors for his work with the UN. He studied a transcript \n     of Haideiri's claims.\n       Mr. Albright. Well, if you read a transcript of an \n     interview that he went through, he has no knowledge of--of \n     chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.\n       Pelley. Based on Haideiri's statement, did UN inspectors go \n     in and try to follow up on what he said?\n\n[[Page S12720]]\n\n       Mr. Albright. Certainly.\n       Pelley. And what did they find from Haidieri's information?\n       Mr. Albright. Nothing.\n       Pelley. There was a good deal more in Secretary Powell's \n     speech that bothered the analysts. For example, Powell \n     claimed that Saddam still had a few dozen Scud missiles.\n       Mr. Thielmann. I wondered what he was talking about. We did \n     not have evidence that the Iraqis had those missiles, pure \n     and simple.\n       Pelley. Powell warned that empty chemical warheads found \n     recently by the UN could be the `tip of the iceberg.'\n       Mr. Allinson. They were shells that were left over from the \n     Gulf War or pri--prior to the Gulf War from their past \n     program.\n       Pelley. Powell did make several points that day that turned \n     out to be right. Among them, he was right when he said Iraqi \n     labs were removing computer hard drives, he was right that \n     Iraq had drawings for a new long-range missile, and he was \n     right about Saddam's murder of thousands of Iraqi citizens. \n     But an interim report by coalition inspectors say, ``So far \n     there is no evidence of a uranium enrichment program, no \n     chemical weapons, no biological weapons, no Scud missiles.'' \n     The State Department told us Secretary Powell would not be \n     available for an interview, but earlier this month, he said \n     the jury on Iraqi is still out.\n       Sec. Powell. And so I think one has to look at the whole \n     report. Have we found a factory or a--a plant or a warehouse \n     full of chemical rounds? No, not yet.\n       Pelley. Powell added that Iraq was a danger to the world. \n     He said, ``How clear and present a danger it was, people can \n     judge.'' As for Greg Thielmann, he told us he's a reluctant \n     witness. He ways the president's address worried him because \n     he knew the African uranium story was false. And he watched \n     Secretary Powell's speech with disappointment because, up \n     until then, he said, he'd seen Powell bringing what he called \n     ``reason'' to the administration's inner circle. Today, \n     Thielmann believes the decision to go to war was made, and \n     the intelligence was interpreted to fit that conclusion.\n       Mr. Thielmann. There's plenty of blame to go around. But \n     the main problem was the senior administration officials have \n     what I've called faith-based intelligence. They know what \n     they wanted the intelligence to show. They were really blind \n     and deaf to any kind of countervailing information the \n     intelligence community would produce. So I would a--I would \n     assign some blame to the intelligence community and most of \n     the blame to the senior administration officials.\n       Pelley. The administration wants to spend several hundred \n     millions dollars more to continue the search for evidence.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the administration's own search for weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq has borne out the concerns that Mr. Thielmann and \nothers held. After months of searching throughout the country, \ninspectors still have not found any evidence of such weapons. Several \ntimes the administration tried to claim that such evidence had, in \nfact, been found. But each time the claims have proven empty.\n  Recently heard again from David Kay, the man leading the CIA's \nsearch, that no chemical or biological weapons have been found to date \nand that Iraq's alleged nuclear program--the one that administration \nofficials regularly raised when discussing the specter of a mushroom \ncloud--was only at ``the very most rudimentary stage.''\n  Let me give a couple examples of other claims that may have been \nintentionally misleading.\n  Last September, President Bush, surrounded by Members of Congress in \nthe White House Rose Garden, claimed that Iraq could launch a chemical \nor biological strike within 45 minutes. White House Press Secretary Ari \nFleischer cited this capability as the elusive ``smoking gun'' when it \nfirst came to light. Just 2 weeks later, Congress gave the President \nauthority to go to war in Iraq. Yet this claim, the strongest evidence \nthat Iraq represented an imminent threat, was dropped after the \nadministration consulted with the CIA.\n  One has to ask: Why wasn't that consultation done with the CIA before \nmaking the claim and before Congress used the information in \ndeliberations about the war resolution?\n  Similarly, President Bush and his top advisers repeatedly asserted \nSaddam and al-Qaida had a strong relationship. On September 25, 2002, \nPresident Bush said:\n\n       You can't distinguish between al-Qaida and Saddam.\n\n  The implication was clear: There was a connection between Saddam and \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11.\n  Only in the last month, after the Vice President repeated a similar \nassertion strongly disputed by the press and security analysts, did the \nPresident admit no such connection existed.\n  It is now clear that the administration has either been grossly wrong \nin its interpretation of intelligence or has intentionally misused the \nintelligence produced by the community.\n  When I offered this amendment in July, we were focused on a \nparticular assertion that was made in the January State of the Union \nAddress. That is:\n\n       The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein \n     recently sought significant quantities of uranium from \n     Africa.\n\n  At the time, there was a flurry of press interests in these words, \nthough lately that seems to have largely been forgotten. The power of \nthe President's allegation in those words is difficult to overstate. \nThe Bush administration used legalistic language apparently intended to \nlead people to believe that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear program. The \nPresident didn't say the British were claiming anything. He didn't say \nthey alleged anything. He said they learned Saddam was attempting to \nbuy uranium, implicitly accepting the charge as fact.\n  Although just 16 words, it was a powerful statement that resonated \nthroughout the Nation and the world. It became a key argument in the \ncase of immediate use of force in Iraq. Only after many months did we \nlearn the statement was based on information that the CIA had \nrepeatedly flagged the White House as inaccurate.\n\n  We didn't learn about this from the administration. We learned about \nit from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the media. Only \nlater did the administration spokesperson and the President admit the \nstatement was inappropriate for the State of the Union Address. The \nadministration has yet to fully explain how it got there.\n  Instead, the administration has turned on those who have reported the \ntruth. Recently, unknown senior administration officials publicly \ndisclosed the name of a covert CIA operative apparently in retaliation \nfor public statements by the operative's spouse that contradicted the \nadministration's claims about Iraqi attempts to obtain uranium from \nNiger.\n  This wasn't just any operative. It was one of the CIA's elite \nintelligence officers, a nonofficial cover agent. Releasing the agent's \nname was a betrayal of intelligence apparatus for political purposes, \nwhich has likely harmed our national security and has only contributed \nto a sense among many that the administration is uninterested in \nprotecting the integrity and objectivity of our intelligence \noperations.\n  In this case, the administration continues to resist efforts to \nappoint a special counsel to investigate this criminal act.\n  Nor has this been the only example of opposition to independent, \nnonpartisan reviews on national security matters. The administration \nalso seems unwilling to openly share information with the commission \nestablished by Congress to investigate the events of September 11. The \ncommission was established on a bipartisan basis. It is charged not \nonly with investigating the events leading up to 9/11 but with \nproducing recommendations to prevent future terrorist attacks.\n  Their mission is critical. I can tell you as a Senator who comes from \na State where 693 people died on September 11--10 in my hometown--this \nis a serious investigation and review of the failures that led to 9/11. \nYet, according to recent statements by several commission members, the \nadministration has been stonewalling. Too many of their requests are \nbeing ignored. Too much evidence is being withheld. And the commission \nhas been frustrated in its efforts to get the information it needs to \ndo the job.\n  Again, just yesterday, the commission was forced to issue subpoenas \nto officials at the FAA for documents that the administration should \nhave been handing over voluntarily. By the way, this was not the CIA, \nnot the Pentagon, but the FAA.\n  The question of accurate intelligence is central to Congress's \nability to make decisions about national security. It is especially \nimportant now that the Bush administration has endorsed a doctrine of \npreemptive war, a doctrine the administration reiterated today \npreceding its trip to the Far East.\n  As we confront ongoing threats to U.S. interests, particularly with \nregard to weapons of mass destruction, we must be sure that what we are \ntold is true.\n\n[[Page S12721]]\n\n  Last October, for example, during the Iraqi debate, Secretary James \nKelly was in Pyongyang meeting with the North Koreans. At that \nmeeting--a meeting that occurred a full week prior to the Senate vote \non the resolution authorizing force in Iraq--the North Koreans admitted \nto Mr. Kelly that they had an active nuclear program. Yet despite the \nimportance of such information from the North Koreans, admitting a \nnuclear weapons program, and its relevance to debate regarding Iraq and \nAmerica's national security posture generally, administration officials \nwaited until after Congress had voted on the resolution to authorize \nthe use of force before revealing the details of the North Korean \ndisclosure to most Members of Congress and certainly the American \npeople.\n  As I see it, that information was both relevant and timely to the \ndebate on whether to go to war in Iraq. What should have our priorities \nbeen? What was the information that should have been factored in when \nwe made that judgment?\n  Was the information withheld because it might affect Congress's \ndebate on the war resolution? I cannot be sure. But the American people \nhave a right to know.\n  While matters such as these may be beyond the scope of the commission \nI am proposing, a thorough review of intelligence questions related to \nIraq is necessary if we are to successfully address other threats and \nwe are to have credibility and confidence in those judgments--including \nNorth Korea, Iran, and other rogue states and international terrorist \nnetworks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I hope some of those \nwho initially opposed it will see that the time has come for a \nthorough, independent, nonpartisan review, structured so there would \nnot be any partisan bias. David Kay's report finding no weapons of mass \ndestruction after a 6-month search, the statements from former \nadministration insiders charging that intelligence was misused, a \nwillingness of administration officials to retaliate against one such \ninsider by revealing the identity of a key CIA operative, the \nadministration's refusal to appoint a special counsel to investigate \nthe crime, the administration's failure to cooperate fully with the \ncommission investigating the 9/11 terrorist attacks, all highlight the \nneed for an independent, nonpartisan commission to examine what are \nalready acknowledged deficiencies in how intelligence related to Iraq \nwas presented to the American people prior to the war.\n  The goal of this commission is not to assign blame. The goal is to \nunderstand what happened and then use those findings to recommend \nimprovements in our intelligence operations and make certain \nintelligence is used for policy formulation, not policy justification.\n  I say to my colleagues, why would anybody be afraid to let an \nindependent commission find the truth? If the administration was acting \nin good faith, they should want the facts to come out. If there were \nsystemic problems in our intelligence establishment, its relationship \nwith the White House, we all have an interest in identifying them and \ncorrecting them. The commission would not prejudge anything. It would \nsimply provide a mechanism to find the truth and bring it to light.\n  Again I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. In the end, \nthe safety and security of the American people are at stake and so, by \nthe way, is the safety and protection of our men and women in uniform. \nThey deserve unbiased, nonpolitical, actionable intelligence to be able \nto do their job and do it well. Just as much as they need financial \nsupport, just as much as they need the support of all of America, they \nneed to have unbiased, nonpolitical intelligence to do their job.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so I \ncan offer this amendment which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1882.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CORZINE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1848 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1848 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1834\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my notice of \nreconsideration on amendment No. 1834 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for a voice vote of the Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator referring to amendment 1834, \nthe Reed of Rhode Island amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 1834.\n  The amendment (No. 1834) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in amendment No. 1834 the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, raises a number of good points \nabout our global commitments, especially those in Iraq. The increased \noperational tempo is straining the Army, the National Guard, and the \nReserves. We do run the risk of hurting recruitment and retention in \nboth the Active and Reserve component. We are committing our troops to \nsuch an extent that we may not be able to sustain all of those \ncommitments indefinitely. I am greatly concerned about these and other \nissues raised by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. However, \nI do not agree that increasing the end strength of the Army is the \nanswer to these problems.\n  The increase in end strength does not necessarily solve our immediate \nproblem of overextended troops. It will take years to get the 10,000 \nsoldiers recruited, trained, equipped, and deployed. We need solutions \nnow. We need more foreign troops in Iraq and we need to work with the \ninternational community toward that goal. We also need to work with our \nallies to fight against terrorism with more than just military might. \nMost importantly, we need to refocus ourselves on the fight against \nterrorism instead of diverting our focus to ideologically driven wars \nof our choosing.\n  Furthermore, according to rough estimates done by the CBO, increasing \nthe end strength of the Army by 10,0000 will cost $409 million this \nyear. Senator Reed's amendment fully offsets that amount. However, the \nfollowing year the cost of this end strength increase will jump to over \n$800 million a year, and it will continue to grow. By passing this \namendment, we will either be locking in an increase in Department of \nDefense spending of over $800 million a year or asking the Army and/or \nthe other military services to simply absorb that cost. Neither option \nseems good to me.\n  But the Senator from Rhode Island was right to bring this debate to \nthe Senate. I agree with my colleague that the important issues he \nraised must be dealt with expeditiously and I look forward to working \nwith him to address these problems.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1852\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate amendment No. 1852.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is the Feingold military family leave amendment. I \nask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S12722]]\n\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1852) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m. \nthis morning, the Senate proceed to a series of consecutive votes in \nrelation to the following amendments; further, that there be no \namendments in order to the amendments in the below stacked sequence \nprior to the votes, with 2 minutes equally divided before each vote, \nand that each vote in sequence after the first be limited to 10 \nminutes. The stacked sequence is: the Durbin amendment No. 1837, the \nDaschle amendment No. 1854, the Landrieu amendment No. 1859, the Boxer \namendment No. 1843, the Leahy amendment No. 1807, and the Durbin \namendment No. 1879.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that other than the above mentioned \namendments, the only other amendments in order to the bill be the \nfollowing, and they be subject to second-degree amendments that will be \nrelevant to the first-degree amendment to which they are offered: Byrd \namendment No. 1819; Corzine amendment No. 1882; Bond amendment No. \n1825; Domenici amendment No. 1864; Senator Brownback is to offer an \namendment relative to rescission; Senator Collins will have an \nopportunity to offer an amendment relative to loans; Senator McConnell, \na sense of the Senate on troops; Senator Specter on loans; Senator \nByrd, the remaining amendments on his list; Senator Dorgan, an \namendment related to Iraqi oil; Senators Boxer and Schumer, shoulder-\nfired weapons; Senator Daschle, a relevant amendment; Senator Frist, a \nrelevant amendment; myself, a relevant amendment; Senator McConnell, a \nrelevant amendment; and Senator Reid, a relevant amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that budget points of order not be \nwaived by virtue of this agreement and that no other points of order \nlie against any pending amendments at this time.\n  I state, as an explanation, that the order of the nonstacked \namendments will be determined by when people arrive and they are called \nup. That second part is not a list of order in which they will \nnecessarily be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, we were just notified by \nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, that he would prefer to have his \namendment taken out of the stacked list and brought down to the second \ngroup in order for additional debate on the amendment. But we expect it \nis possible that something could be worked out. So I ask that \nmodification be made in the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is acceptable to us, and we will be pleased to move \namendment No. 1807 to be just prior to the Byrd amendment No. 1819. As \nI said, the amendments on the second list are not in any order of \nsequence.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, to clarify, we would like it to follow \nthe Byrd amendment, not precede it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is not in sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today in support of the President's \nsupplemental appropriations request. This request primarily funds \nongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it also \nprovides reconstruction assistance to both of those countries, so that \nfundamental economic and civic infrastructure can be rebuilt. We must \nall recognize that providing for the initial reconstruction of the \ninfrastructure is a practical requirement for us to succeed in the \nestablishing the stability necessary--in both of those countries--\nbefore we can begin to withdraw our military forces.\n  I have not heard anyone here speak of a military failure in either \nIraq or Afghanistan, but I have heard a great deal of speculation that \nwe are failing to win the peace. It is not accurate to make this \nassertion. But I cannot emphasize strongly enough that the chances of \nwinning a sustainable peace are directly related to the support we give \nthis request before us.\n  We cannot support our troops, our mission, and our goal of a peaceful \nand stable Iraq without providing the funding necessary to achieve \nthese goals, and providing that funding now.\n  For this reason, I would think--I would hope--that this request would \nreceive unanimous support from my colleagues. I regret to see that this \nwill not be the case. As best as I can understand, this is because many \nof my colleagues in the other party have declared the President's \npolicy a failure. We have won the war, we seem to agree, but the peace \nis being lost.\n  As I review the many reports I receive on the situation in Iraq, I do \nnot think we can declare that the peace is being lost. Yet I do not \nthink we can rest assured that security has been achieved.\n  The President has a plan, and every Member in this body has had a \nchance to review the plan. I have heard the declarations of failure, \nbut I have heard no alternatives to the detailed plan that the \nPresident has provided us. What do our opponents propose to do instead? \nThe President's critics are silent here.\n  It is both unfair and unrealistic to take the reports of bombings and \ndeaths coming out of Iraq and declare that our plan has failed. The \nPresident never said that it would be easy. Nobody in this body had \nreason to believe that it would be.\n  The President and our military had a brilliant battle plan. And we \nhad the best post-conflict plans available, considering the dearth of \nanalysis we had from inside this Arab Stalinist state. Would I have \nbeen pleased to have had more political intelligence on what was going \non inside Iraq? Would I have been pleased to have a better assessment \nof the level of decay of Iraq's economic infrastructure? Of course. \nThere is not a military planner in the history of mankind that has not, \nin retrospect, wished for better intelligence prior to a conflict. We \nalways wish we had better intelligence.\n  But those questions should not be the basis for criticizing an \nongoing policy. We are in Iraq. We must, as our critics agree, win the \npeace. And we do not have time to waste.\n  Some of the opponents of the President have criticized him for \naltering his policy during this occupation, as if altering a policy \nbased on changing circumstances--or simply as a result of a better \nunderstanding of a fluid environment--should be seen as an admission of \nfailure. I ask anyone here: What great undertaking occurs without \nchanges in plan? Is it a sign of failure to shape your plans according \nto new discoveries, changes in the situation, and a shifting context? \nOf course, the answer is no.\n  Today, fewer than 6 months after the conclusion of major military \noperations in Iraq, the security situation is still dangerous. We are \nlosing precious American lives every week, and we are suffering \ninjuries every day. I see no good reason to downplay this grim reality, \nin this debate or anywhere else.\n  But the situation is far from dire: Iraqis, by almost all measure, \nare thankful for their liberation from the dictatorship of Saddam \nHussein. Few, very few, declare their wish to return to his dungeon \nstate.\n  Instead, as we have heard from administration sources in the past \nweeks, more than 70,000 Iraqis are presently serving in police, border \npatrol, facilities protection and civil defense positions. Fewer than 6 \nmonths after the conclusion of the Coalition's major military \noperations, Iraqis are serving side by side with coalition forces, and \nthey have already conducted thousands of joint patrols with our forces.\n\n  Their enemies are our enemies: The criminal Saddamite resistance and \nthe international jihadists, the terrorist brethren of Osama bin Laden.\n  No one can argue that Iraq has currently become calling ground for \nterrorists. That presents us with a great\n\n[[Page S12723]]\n\nchallenge, and an immediate security threat. We knew this was a \npossibility before we invaded Iraq. Saddam Hussein had long associated \nwith almost all of the known terror organizations through the last \ndecades, including, beginning in the 1990s, with Osama bin Laden and \nhis associates.\n  I, for one, was not surprised when bin Laden called his followers to \nIraq prior to our invasion. I was not surprised for a number of \nreasons, beginning with the reports we read through the years about bin \nLaden's associations with Saddam's Iraq.\n  But another reason I have not been surprised to see al-Qaida join the \nSaddamite resistance is that I have never believed al-Qaida is about \nideology, religious or otherwise. I believe bin Laden seeks power, and \nhe has hijacked his religion for his attempts to gain power. Bin \nLaden's use of religion as ideological appeal is as sincere as Saddam's \nuse of Arab socialism, in the guise of Ba'athism. Both are about \ngaining and holding dictatorial power--for personal ends. And the \njoining of forces of bin Laden's terrorists and Saddam's thugs proves \nthis point.\n  The tools of the Saddamite resistance are the tools of gangsters: car \nbombs and assassinations. Some of these recent horrific bombings have \nbeen committed by suicide terrorists, which, we know, is not a common \ngangster tactic. But in my years of studying international crime and \nterrorism, I have concluded this: You cannot remain an ideologue--\nreligious or secular--while behaving like and coordinating with \ncriminals.\n  Saddam's reign was a criminal dictatorship. There was no ideology but \nthe one that made Saddam more powerful, that enriched his clan and \ncronies, that crushed all of his real or perceived opponents. When his \nsons, Uday and Qusay, were cornered and killed, they were not part of a \nwell-organized resistance, protected by a dedicated network of \nideologically motivated supporters. They were alone, and they were \ncornered and killed, like common gangsters, because an Iraqi dropped a \ndime on them.\n  By joining with the Saddamites, bin Laden and his fellow jihadists \nhave exposed themselves to be gangsters. They are demonstrating this to \nall who wish to see: To the masses in the Middle East who bin Laden has \ntried to convert, they can now see him hand-in-hand with the corrupt \nbutchers and jailors of Saddam's Tikriti clique, who the Iraqi people \nhave roundly rejected and now publicly detest. Bin Laden and his \nsupporters can now be seen allying with those who deny the Iraqis \nfreedom.\n  Yes, the situation in Iraq is dangerous now, for the short term. But \nthe defeat of the Saddamite-led resistance--which we will accomplish, \nand which we will accomplish with the active support of the Iraqi \npeople--will provide a great victory in the war on terrorism, will \nbring peace to Iraq, will advance peace and stability in the region and \nwill enhance the national security of this country.\n  Some of the Iraqi voices calling for our departure are not anti-\nAmerican. Some Iraqis fear that we will overstay, that we will not move \nfast enough in transferring power and political legitimacy to the Iraqi \npeople. I believe Ambassador Bremer's seven-point plan to move toward \nfull sovereignty is sound and sensible. I am watching with great \ninterest as the Iraqis begin to draft the constitution that will \ndelineate their system of government, with all the protections of the \nfreedoms they have been granted by coalition action and sacrifice.\n  I wish I could predict the future and declare here how long it will \ntake for us to succeed. We can't give a finite number on costs, nor \ngive a definite date of conclusion. To do so is to fall into one of the \nmost partisan traps in Washington: If we can not say how much it will \nultimately cost and we can not say when we will have achieved our \ngoals, we are accused of having no plans; if we do, we will inevitably \nbe wrong and the opposition naysayers will scream ``gotcha.''\n  Many state that the cost is high. I agree. America's ventures abroad \nhave always been costly, never more so than when we pay in the lives of \nour men and women. The dollar figures pale in comparison.\n  I am not happy that we are faced with such a financial requirement \ntoday. Certainly many of our constituents are concerned about such a \ncommitment when they worry about the national economy and the economies \nof their families.\n  But the budget proposed is not arbitrarily chosen. It is based on \nproviding necessary resources that must be allocated to achieve the \ngoals that the President outlined: to deny terrorists a new sanctuary \nby creating a secure and stable Iraq, by providing a minimal level of \nessential services and civic infrastructure which will enhance the \nstability we need to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqi people.\n  Over the past weeks, since the President first announced his request, \nthe Senate Appropriations, Armed Services, Foreign Relations, \nIntelligence, and Joint Economic Committees have held numerous \nhearings. We have had reports from the Office of Management and Budget, \nfrom the White House, Pentagon, State Department, and Coalition \nProvisional Authority. Numerous witnesses from the administration have \nbriefed both bodies of Congress.\n  The President's plan is broken into four parts, or core foundations: \nsecurity; essential services; economy; and governance. As Ambassador \nBremer, the Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority, \nstated, ``These are intertwined: none can be pursued in isolation. \nPolitical and economic progress depends, in part, on security, but \nshould itself help to create a safer environment.''\n  That is how I view the President's request. If we wish to protect our \ntroops, the Iraq people must believe that our forces are there to \nimprove their lives and that cooperation instead of confrontation is \nthe road to a better future. The Iraqis are responding: More and more \nare working, and thousands are working with us.\n  To gain intelligence on the location of terrorists in Iraq, the local \npopulation must believe that we have their true interests at heart and \nnot the terrorists. These goals cannot be achieved by funding just our \nmilitary operations. We must assist the Iraqi people in developing an \ninfrastructure that was allowed to fall into disrepair by a greedy \ntyrant.\n  During this debate, some have made a valid point in suggesting that \nIraq's vast oil resources might be used for reconstruction costs. I \nhave opposed all the amendments that have attempted to convert our \ngrants to loans, however, and I have done so for the following reasons \nI will now outline.\n  First, Iraqi oil output while still low, is already being used by the \nIraqi people to fund the resumption of their government costs.\n  Second, Iraq is weighed down by a staggering debt for a small country \nwhose economy has been ravaged by years of Saddam's thievery and \nneglect. Paying this debt is something that the future Iraqi sovereign \nwill have to negotiate. Certainly no U.S. funds should be used for such \nrepayment. And it is my opinion that the future Iraqi sovereign should \nnot be beholden to the debts incurred by its former torturer, nor the \nnation states who cynically loaned to the dictatorship of Saddam \nHussein. For the moment, however, incurring further debt while \nattempting to reconstruct a country without a basic economic foundation \ncould seriously stifle necessary economic recovery. Any delay in \nrebuilding the economy only improves the chances of terrorists of \ntaking root among the local population.\n  But I have a more basic reason for opposing all attempts to turn our \ngrants into loans. This would be a radical departure in the conduct of \nAmerican foreign policy. For the first time in our history, we would be \noccupying a country and forcing them to incur loans. Far more than a \nmeager attempt to preserve financial capital with such misguided \nproposals, we would be seriously risking our moral capital.\n  I note to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that, despite the \nrecriminations and accusations, this administration has done its best \nto work within the context of international law. I believe that we have \nbeen successful in respecting international law, while preserving our \nsovereign right to defend our national interests. I commend the \nadministration for its successes here, from debates about preemption \nwhich has been hotly disputed but not discredited, under terms of \ninternational law to the herculean efforts going on to\n\n[[Page S12724]]\n\nthis day, as our State Department works to craft resolutions that will \nbuild international support for our policies in the Security Council.\n  I believe that if the United States sets the precedent of occupying a \ncountry and then foisting debt upon them, we will have done our \nstanding before the rest of the world long-term harm.\n  Soon enough, because of their oil resources, because of their human \ncapital, and because of the assistance they will get from us and the \nrest of the international community, the Iraqi people will begin the \nprocess of paying for portions of the reconstruction themselves. This \nwill become increasingly true as their oil infrastructure is repaired.\n  I believe that President Bush's proposal supports the long-term \ninterests of the United States by addressing the short-term interests \nof the Iraqi people. By assisting the Iraqi people in developing these \nfour core foundations identified in the President's plan, I believe we \nare undermining the Saddamite resistance, denying terrorists a \nsanctuary, and advancing our long-term security.\n  We have faced this challenge of winning a peace before. We won the \nFirst World War, and returned to isolationism while a fragile peace \nfailed to take root in Europe. We won the Second World War, and stayed \nin Europe, making massive commitments which laid the foundation for \nwinning the peace and the cold war that continued for nearly 50 years.\n  We must follow through on what we have begun, and we cannot delay. \nWhile the sums we are appropriating here are large, the costs of \nfailing to succeed are larger. While the bill may seem big, we have \nalready paid in measure far greater. Today I am thinking of: SSG James \nW. Cawley, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve; SSG Nino D. Livaudais of the \nArmy's Ranger Regiment; SFC Randall S. Rehn, of the Army's 3rd Infantry \nDivision; SGT Mason Whetstone, of the U.S. Army; and Brett Thorpe--a \nformer Army special forces operator working with the State Department.\n  I understand if these names may be unfamiliar to others. They are not \nto me. These are the names of the sons of Utah that died defending us \nduring this these operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. They followed \nthrough on their commitments. There job is done now. It is our turn to \nfollow through.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nSenator Cantwell's Truth in Deployment amendment. This amendment \nsupports our reserve forces and corrects an error in our deployment \nprocess.\n  I am extremely proud of our reserve forces. The Arkansas Army \nNational Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade is beginning their mobilization \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 39th Infantry Brigade \nconsists of over 3,000 soldiers who are ready to serve their country.\n  The 39th Infantry Brigade soldiers are going to sacrifice time away \nfrom their family, place their civilian careers on hold, and place at \nrisk the greatest gift provided by our Creator, their very life, to \nprotect the freedoms and liberties we hold so dear.\n  If the 39th Infantry Brigade and other reserve forces are willing to \ndo so much without complaint, I believe it is not too much to ask that \nwe provide them as much opportunity as possible to minimize the impact \nof overseas deployments on themselves, their families and their \nemployers. This amendment provides for this opportunity.\n  This amendment is straightforward. It starts the deployment period \nfor members of the reserve component as the date of activation. This \nhas always been the standard practice, prior to the administration's \nshift in policy on September 9th. This amendment simply asks our Nation \nto remain true to the standard practice, tradition of considering the \ndate of activation as the date of deployment for reserve members.\n  Nothing in this amendment weakens our ability to employ our reserve \nforces. In fact the exact opposite is the case. This amendment enhances \nthe ability and effectiveness of our reserve forces by enabling them to \nplan their lives to reduce the inherent adverse impact of overseas \ndeployment on their families, employers, and community. I thank my \nfellow Senators for supporting this amendment. It will enhance the \nability and effectiveness of our reserve forces and support the men and \nwomen like those who serve in the 39th Infantry Brigade.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate considered \namendment No. 1811 offered by Senator Corzine to lower the age at which \nmembers of the Reserve components can collect retirement pay from age \n60 go age 55. This amendment had no offset and would have created a \nhuge bill for the Department of Defense which we cannot afford to pay. \nFor this reason, the floor manager of the bill raised a budget point of \norder against the amendment and I voted to uphold this point of order.\n  I believe the Congress should carefully review pay and benefits for \nmembers of the Reserve components, including lowering the age at which \nreservists and guardsmen can receive retirement pay. These men and \nwomen provide an invaluable service to our Nation and we should provide \nthem pay and benefits which recognize their contributions and help \nretain them as citizen soldiers in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, I \nbelieve there are several options we should consider for lowering the \nretirement age, and that we should consider this issue alongside other \nbenefits in order to offer a complete package that makes sense and \naccomplishes the goals we are trying to achieve. The Iraqi supplemental \nis not the right context to undertake a careful review or make long-\nterm changes in this area, and for this reason I opposed the amendment.\n  As cochair of the Senate Reserve Caucus, these are issues that I take \nvery seriously. I will continue to work with my colleagues in that \ncaucus and in the Senate to ensure that we make wise financial \ndecisions, and that our guardsmen and reservists receive the pay and \nbenefits they deserve while recognizing their unique contribution to \nour Nation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to report on the \nbudgetary effect of S. 1689, the Emergency Supplemental for Iraq and \nAfghanistan Security and Reconstruction for Fiscal Year 2004, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  The pending bill provides $87 billion in budget authority and $36.7 \nbillion in outlays for Fiscal Year 2004 for ongoing operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and reconstruction of Iraq. Since all funds contained \nin the reported bill are either emergencies or contingent emergencies, \nunder section 502(c) of the 2004 budget resolution none of these funds \ncount for purposes of section 302, 303, 311, and 401 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and sections 504 and 505 of the 2004 \nBudget Resolution.\n  Additionally, I would like to remind my colleagues of the criteria \nfor using the emergency designation. Section 502 of the 2004 budget \nresolution identifies the following criteria for the appropriate use of \nthe emergency designation: that the funding is (1) necessary, \nessential, or vital, not merely useful or beneficial; (2) sudden, \nquickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (3) an \nurgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; (4) \nunforseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (5) not permanent, \ntemporary in nature.\n  The reported bill has satisfied these criteria. Given the fact that \nmost of the regular appropriation bills have not yet been enacted, we \nought to view any further use of the emergency designation with great \nskepticism.\n  I also note for my colleagues that we are in a highly unusual \nparliamentary situation with this supplemental. Instead of doing a 2004 \nsupplemental after all regular appropriation bills have been enacted, \nwe are considering an $87 billion supplemental before most of the \nregular bills have been enacted. While there is an allocation for each \nof the 13 regular bills, there is no additional or special allocation \nfor a supplemental. Because this is such an unusual situation, I do not \nwant people to think that the way the Senate deals with possible \namendments on this bill sets a precedent for the way the Budget \nCommittee will enforce the 302(b) allocations in the future.\n  If any amendments are adopted adding nonemergency spending to this \nbill, then members should know that the cost of such amendments will be \ncounted against the appropriate subcommittee allocation. And I will \nremind the Senate at the appropriate time about any points of order \nthat apply to subsequent bills and will insist that bills be changed to \nremedy\n\n[[Page S12725]]\n\nthe situation or will raise the appropriate point of order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n        S. 1689--EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n                     [Fiscal Year 2004, $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Discretionary\n                                                              spending\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEmergencies in S. 1689, as reported: *\n    Budget authority.....................................        87,004\n    Outlays..............................................        36,695\nNon-Emergencies in S. 1689, as reported:\n    Budget authority.....................................             0\n    Outlays..............................................             0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Section 502(c) of H.

Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughtful words of my \ncolleague from Illinois. Many sports fans across my home state have \nknown both joy and anguish from our sports teams, and I assure the \nSenator that I sympathize with the sorrow that Chicago Cubs fans are \nfeeling today over last night's loss.\n  And now, Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter that has caused \nmuch sadness in my home state of New York. It is with a heavy heart \nthat I come to the floor today to speak about the tragedy on Staten \nIsland that took 10 New Yorkers from us too soon, and changed the lives \nof dozens who were injured. As you know, the ferry in New York crashed \ninto a pier adjacent to its terminal, with tragic and unforeseen and \nunprecedented results. We mourn for the families of those who were \nlost.\n  Staten Island has had a very difficult time in the last several \nyears. We know, for instance, 286 Staten Islanders were lost on 9/11. \nStaten Island is 5.5 percent of New York City's population, but on that \nterrible day sustained nearly 20 percent of New York City's September \n11 deaths. Many of those were police officers and firefighters. We had \nthe refinery fire on Staten Island not too long ago, and now this \nterrible incident.\n  One thing I can tell you is the people of Staten Island are strong, \nthey are resilient, they are self-reliant. Many of them come from my \nhome borough of Brooklyn and have moved to pastures across the narrows. \nBut they retain the same feistiness and the same ability to bounce back \nfrom tragedy their forebearers did, across the narrows in Brooklyn. So \nStaten Island will bounce back and be stronger and better than ever. \nBut, right now, we mourn them.\n  The Staten Island ferry's history is so important to our city. It is \nas long as our Nation's history. It has existed in some form since \n1713, and 70,000 New Yorkers, mostly from Staten Island, ride it every \nday. That would be enough people to fill a medium-sized city almost \nanywhere else in the United States.\n  It is one of the great symbols of New York City, up there with the \nEmpire State Building, Brooklyn Bridge, Yankee Stadium. It is one of \nthe best ways to see the great symbols of opportunity in New York, the \nStatue of Liberty--Ellis Island, and, sadly, until 2 years ago, the \nWorld Trade Center.\n  The view of lower Manhattan coming into the terminal at Whitehall or \nlanding at St. George has been nothing short of breathtaking, although \nI must admit, having taken the ferry since 9/11, it now has some \nsadness to it as we see the empty space on the skyline where the towers \nonce existed.\n  It is a necessity for many on Staten Island. It is also a great \nopportunity for tourists to see New York. I might say, also, it is a \nvery good first date, particularly at its price. The Staten Island \nferry is free.\n  I am proud to say this morning, due to the resilience of New Yorkers \nand their transportation commissioner, ferry service resumed at the St. \nGeorge terminal at 5 a.m., the site of yesterday's tragedy, befitting \nthe spirit of New York and the spirit of Staten Island, where we bounce \nback quickly. The terminal was packed, the boats were crowded, and the \npeople to a one, it seemed, were determined not to shy away but to go \non with their lives as best as possible, while remembering those \nfamilies who were suffering in the wake of this terrible tragedy.\n  We remember the lives lost, but not to stop living. This attitude is \nat the heart of what it means to be a Staten Islander: grit, \ndetermination to survive and move on, but to never forget what has \nhappened and to never stop trying to make a better world for our \nchildren.\n  I would like to mention the names of those who passed away, and send \nmy condolences to each of their families: Joseph Bagarozza, Pio Canini, \nJohn T. Healy, Vincent Ferrante, Darios Marshall, Guillermo Pagvay, \nLouis Robinson, Frank Sullivan, John Valinski, and the woman--our \ncondolences to her family, too, even though her name has not yet been \nreleased.\n  Today Congressman Fossella of Staten Island and I are asking the \nUnited States Department of Transportation to pay for the repairs of \nthis ferry. The Federal Government has been actively involved in the \nferries. We have received money for them in the past and will ask once \nagain that Washington rise to the occasion of another tragedy in New \nYork. Our budget, as you know, is tight as a drum and these funds will \nnot bring back a single loss of life and, in fact, pale before the loss \nof life.\n  We will move forward, hopefully, in whatever way, and make our city \nand Staten Island even greater than ever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I also make a note of the fact that \nwe, too, in New Jersey had two of our citizens perish in that terrible \naccident that took place yesterday, a Mr. John Healy from Middletown, \nNJ, and Frank Sullivan, from Red Bank, NJ. We send our sympathies to \nthese families, but we are reminded at the same time that ferries play \nan important role in our region; that while the Staten Island ferry \ncarries about 70,000 passengers a day, we have 60,000 people going from \nNew Jersey to New York for their business requirements or their jobs on \nthe\n\n[[Page S12726]]\n\nNew York waterway ferries. It continues to remind us how much of a need \nwe have to make certain that the ferries operate safely, as well as \nefficiently.\n  I ask, along with the distinguished Senator from New York who made \nhis remarks a few minutes ago, that the Federal Government do whatever \nthey can to understand what took place, and we understand and know the \nfacts; that we take all the steps we can to make certain it should not \nhappen again.\n  One of the questions I asked in the committee in which I serve, the \nCommerce Committee, is take a look and see what the Coast Guard \nrequires by way of licensing for captains of these boats. The ferry \nthat had the accident yesterday can carry as many as 6,000 people. We \nhave to make certain in that travel they are not careless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12726-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today Pope John Paul II and billions of \nfaithful around the world celebrate the 25th anniversary of his \nelection in 1978 to the papacy.\n  Born Karol Wojtyla on May 18, 1920 in Poland, John Paul II is the \nfirst non-Italian pope in 380 years. He has profoundly shaped the \nmodern church and advanced its spiritual and moral influence across the \nglobe. A poet, a playwright and a philosopher, Pope John Paul II has \nbeen an indefatigable champion of the poor and dispossessed.\n  In his 25 years of service to the church, he has also traveled more \nextensively than any pope before him. His historic trip to Poland in \n1979 catalyzed the Solidarity Movement and led to the peaceful \ndissolution of the Soviet Empire. He is also the only pope ever to have \nvisited a mosque or a synagogue.\n  Those who have studied the Pope's writings and biography say that the \nPope was profoundly shaped by his early encounter with death and \nsuffering.\n  As one expert observes, Professor Tony Judt for ``Frontline'', John \nPaul ``was born in 1920, shortly after World War I to an impoverished \nPoland, into a family, where, one by one, his closest relatives died \naround him--He was left before his 21st birthday with no family. At \nabout the time of his father's death, shortly before, World War II \nbroke out, and he lived in Poland under the worst dictatorship ever \nknown--And then this man lives in post-war Poland for 20 years under \nCommunist occupation when Poland was a grim, depressed, dishonest, \nduplicitous impoverished place.''\n\n  Out of all of this grimness and death, John Paul did not become \ndespondent or embittered. No, indeed, his experience of profound loss \nand suffering seemed to have deepened his spirituality and his capacity \nto find strength first and foremost in God, but also in man's \nfragility.\n  Billions around the world have been blessed by the Pope's goodness \nand drive, his sincere love for the individual, and his determination \nto reconnect human endeavor to its higher purpose.\n  Pope John Paul has fought tirelessly against the culture of death, he \nhas fought for man's dignity against tyranny and triviality. And if it \nis not too much to say, Pope John Paul has devoted his life to fighting \nfor our souls.\n  I would like to close with a poem he wrote when he was only 19 years \nold. To me, it typifies his extraordinarily sensitive nature and \nperception of the divine mystery. It is called, ``Over This, Your White \nGrave''\n\n     Over this, your white grave\n     the flowers of life in white--\n     so many years without you--\n     how many have passed out of sight?\n     Over this your white grave\n     covered for years, there is a stir in the air, something \n           uplifting\n     and, like death, beyond comprehension.\n     Over this your white grave\n     oh, mother, can such loving cease?\n     for all his filial adoration a prayer:\n     Give her eternal peace--\n\n     [Krakow, spring 1939]\n\n  God bless Pope John Paul II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12726-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nIndianapolis, IN. In October 1999, Jamie C. Carson and two accomplices \nrobbed and tortured two men who were targeted because they were gay. \nPolice said that one victim was forced to drink a mixture of bleach and \nurine. Both men were tied up and burned with a steam iron.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12726-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12726-S12730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REPORT ON U.S.-INDONESIA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to commend to Senators the \nReport of the National Commission on U.S.-Indonesian Relations issued \ntoday by the United States-Indonesia Society. This report is the \nculmination of more than one year of work by the Commission, whose co-\nchairs are former Secretary of State George Shultz, my fellow Hoosier \nand former Congressman Lee Hamilton, and George Russell, Chairman \nEmeritus of the Frank Russell Company.\n  This report will be an important point of reference for members of \nCongress and the public as a whole as the future course of Indonesia-\nU.S. relations is debated. I, for one, believe that the significance of \nIndonesia to Asia and to the world is often underappreciated. A \nrelatively new democracy, Indonesia is home to the world's largest \nMuslim population and overall is the world's fourth most populous \nnation. The U.S. trade deficit with Indonesia is decreasing. U.S. \nexports of goods to Indonesia in 2002 were $2.6 billion, up 2.4 percent \nfrom the previous year and U.S. imports from Indonesia were $9.6 \nbillion, down 4.6 percent from 2001.\n  The Commission's report examines the U.S.-Indonesia relationship and \noutlines policies and programs that ``will help strengthen the nation's \nprospects for success.'' Education, democratization, economic growth \nand security are areas for emphasis highlighted by the Commission.\n  The report goes into considerable detail about many aspects of life \ninside Indonesia, citing the challenges and hopes of this fellow \ndemocracy. For example, the report notes that the roles of the military \nand police are changing, with the goal of the Indonesian government \nbeing to make the police, rather than the military, fully responsible \nfor internal security.\n  Important reference is made to ongoing conflict in the province of \nAceh as well as unrest in Papua connected to issues surrounding the \nspecial autonomy law. Of special significance to justice-seeking \ncitizens in the United States and Indonesia, the Commission highlighted \nthe need for a full and thorough investigation into the murder of an \nIndonesian and two Americans, and the wounding of eight others in an \nambush last year near Timika in Papua.\n  My purpose today is not to concur in all of the report's findings, \nbut rather to recommend it to my colleagues as a helpful point of \nreference in future deliberations by this body on a wide range of \nissues regarding Indonesia.\n  Those Members interested in viewing the full report may contact the \nUnited States--Indonesia Society for a copy. I conclude my remarks by \ncommending the ongoing work of Paul Cleveland, President of the United \nStates--Indonesia Society and Edward Masters, Co-Chair of the Society's \nBoard of Trustees for their tireless and outstanding commitment to \nstronger Indonesia--U.S. relations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Executive Summary in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     REPORT OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON U.S.-INDONESIAN RELATIONS\n\n Strengthening U.S. Relations With Indonesia: Toward a Partnership for \n                       Human Resource Development\n\n          The National Commission on U.S.-Indonesian Relations\n\n       Honorable George P.

William Liddle--Professor of \n     Political Science, Ohio State University.\n\n                                Preface\n\n       This report is the culmination of more than one year of \n     effort by members of the National Commission on U.S.-\n     Indonesian Relations. We first assembled in September 2002 to \n     discuss increasingly evident and pressing concerns: that \n     Indonesia is a frontline state in the war on terrorism; that \n     it is in the midst of one of the most significant political \n     transitions and economic recoveries in its history; that, \n     despite its size and strategic location in Southeast Asia, it \n     is one of the least well-known or understood countries in the \n     United States; and that it would be enormously beneficial for \n     the U.S.-Indonesia bilateral relationship, which has become \n     strained in recent years, to move to a more balanced and \n     sustainable footing.\n       The members of the National Commission on U.S.-Indonesian \n     Relations represent a diverse range of backgrounds, \n     interests, and opinions from the worlds of policymaking and \n     diplomacy, the military, business, and academic. We were \n     charged with drafting a consensus report that reflects the \n     breadth of U.S. interests in Indonesia, of consulting widely \n     with current and former policymakers, and others, in \n     Washington and Jakarta, and of suggesting ways that the U.S. \n     Congress and Administration might move toward a relationship \n     which over the longer term will serve the interest of both \n     countries.\n       In our work, we have been supported by the hardworking \n     staff and representatives of the three institutions \n     sponsoring this initiative--the Asia-Pacific research Center \n     at Stanford University, The National Bureau of Asian \n     Research, and the United States-Indonesia Society--to whom we \n     offer our sincere appreciation. Thanks are also due to our \n     colleagues on the Commission, who gave freely of their time \n     and expertise, as well as for the valuable counsel of a large \n     number of Americans and Indonesians who contributed their \n     insights to this report. In particular, we wish to \n     acknowledge and commend the work of Edward Masters, former \n     U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Co-Chairman of USINDO, and Vice \n     Chairman of this Commission, who has expended great effort \n     over many months on the unenviable task of drafting a report \n     that reflects our general consensus of opinion.\n       Two final notes: First, although it reflects the views of \n     various public and private Indonesians with whom the general \n     concept of a ``partnership'' has been discussed, this report \n     is written from a U.S. standpoint. If the partnership concept \n     is formally accepted by the two governments, we hope this \n     report can serve as the basis for more detailed discussions \n     to ensure that both sides have an equal opportunity to \n     express their views, and that any programs adopted have the \n     full support of the two governments and relevant private \n     organizations.\n       Second, the National Commission and this report represent a \n     non-governmental effort to explore ways to improve relations \n     between the third and fourth most populous countries in the \n     world. In an international environment driven by the \n     challenges and opportunities of globalization and beset by \n     the problems of global terrorism, we are convinced that \n     strong and positive relations between the United States and \n     Indonesia are, and will remain, a key component of a \n     prosperous and peaceful future.\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation and \n     third largest democracy, is the pivotal state in Southeast \n     Asia. It has exercised major influence in the region and \n     plays an active and constructive international role. It has \n     vast natural resources and is strategically located astride \n     major lines of communication between the Pacific and Indian \n     Oceans. Half of the world's merchant fleet capacity passes \n     through straits with Indonesian territory on one or both \n     shores. Including its oil and mineral sectors, Indonesia is \n     home to about $25 billion in U.S. investment, with more than \n     300 major U.S. firms represented there.\n       Two additional factors are of particular importance today: \n     Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population--more \n     than all the Middle Eastern Arab states combined. The vast \n     majority of Indonesia's Muslims have historically been noted \n     for their moderation. Theirs is one of the few Muslim-\n     majority nations in which Islam is not the state religion; \n     and given its size and importance, Indonesia is critical to \n     stability in Southeast Asia. It has been the anchor of the \n     Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a key \n     player in the ASEAN Regional Forum, the only organization in \n     the Asia-Pacific region that brings the United States \n     together with Japan, China, ASEAN and others to discuss \n     security issues.\n       Today Indonesia faces major faces major problems: a \n     difficult transition from authoritarian rule to democracy; \n     slow economic growth combined with inadequate job creation; \n     capital outflow; endemic corruption; ethnic and sectarian \n     violence; a weak judiciary; and a serious threat from \n     domestic and international terrorists. The October 12, 2002 \n     bombings in Bali were the most grievous instance of terrorism \n     since the September 2001 attacks on the United States. The \n     carnage in Bali was a wake-up call for Indonesians and their \n     government, and Indonesia joined the fight against terrorism. \n     Local police arrested more than 90 suspected terrorists, but \n     more are still at large as shown by the August 5, 2003 attack \n     on the J.W. Marriott Hotel in the heart of the capital city \n     Jakarta. Fourteen people (all but one were Indonesians) died \n     as a result of that attack and 150 were injured.\n       There are continuing problems, but the news from Indonesia \n     has not by any means been all bad. Since 1999 the country has \n     had a free and fair national election and two peaceful \n     presidential successions. Its media are among the most free \n     in Southeast Asia. Civil society is flourishing, and more \n     than 5,000 non-governmental organizations are active \n     across a broad range of sectors. Constitutional reform and \n     decentralization have made the government less top-down. \n     For the first time, beginning in 2004, the president and \n     vice president will be directly elected. In this process \n     of reform, the leaders of major Muslim organizations have \n     played a constructive role in defining relations between \n     religion and the state. The ceasefire agreement in Aceh \n     has failed, but those between hostile ethno-religious \n     groups in the eastern islands are holding. And the \n     Indonesian economy, despite its vulnerabilities, has \n     stabilized in important respects.\n       The country is now at a critical juncture in its democratic \n     transition and economic recovery. This is therefore an \n     opportune time for the United States to rethink its approach \n     to Indonesia. A failure of democracy there would hurt not \n     only Indonesians. It would reinforce the stereotype that a \n     Muslim-majority nation cannot manage a democratic system. \n     Given the size and importance of Indonesia, we believe that \n     success of that nation's democracy would not only provide a \n     better life for its people but also reduce vulnerabilities to \n     radicalism and have an impact beyond Indonesia's borders.\n       For these multiple reasons, the National Commission on \n     U.S.-Indonesian Relations recommends that the United States \n     and Indonesia enter into a ``Partnership for Human Resource \n     Development'' in which the two nations pledge to work \n     together on joint programs to promote in Indonesia an \n     effective democracy, sustainable development, and the rule of \n     law. The idea of a formal partnership is new to this \n     important bilateral relationship. We believe this concept is \n     essential to increase the prospects for success and to ensure \n     that both nations buy into these programs and are committed \n     to make them succeed. In other words, that both accept \n     ownership.\n       Events in the coming five years, including national \n     elections in 2004 and their consequences, will determine the \n     fate of Indonesia's democracy and the nature of the new \n     leadership generation expected to emerge before the following \n     elections in 2009. Accordingly, we recommend that the United \n     States pledge $200 million annually in additional assistance \n     funds to this partnership during this five-year period. The \n     Commission believes that Indonesia would be a good candidate \n     for funding under the Millennium Challenge Account. Whatever \n     the source, it is important that these be add-on funds that \n     do not disrupt important ongoing assistance programs.\n       These additional funds would be used to strengthen existing \n     programs and initiate new programs in four critical fields:\n       1. Education--work with Indonesian officials to strengthen \n     the nation's educational system at all levels, including \n     Islamic schools, and rebuild ties with U.S. educational \n     institutions. Before the fall of Suharto, Indonesia's \n     experience with democratic systems and practices was limited \n     to a few years in the 1950s, so that most Indonesians living \n     today have had no direct experience with democracy. As a \n     result, Indonesia's democracy must be built from the ground \n     up. A key prerequisite for success is an informed electorate. \n     Education is the key to success and is also essential to give \n     greater depth to the management level in virtually all \n     sectors. We therefore attach special importance to education \n     and urge prompt, large-scale U.S. support.\n       2. Democratization--improve governance, speed and deepen \n     legal reform, strengthen parliament and the electoral system, \n     and help ensure the effectiveness of decentralization.\n       3. Economic Growth--improve the investment climate, \n     strengthen Indonesia's private sector, expand trade, \n     facilitate the resumption of full debt servicing.\n       4. Security--strengthen the police and, when practicable, \n     resume carefully crafted military education programs that \n     will strengthen those elements willing to promote reform.\n       In addition to these funding priorities, ongoing U.S. \n     assistance for emergency relief and improved health should be \n     continued. Bolstering the ethical rationale for such support \n     is the contribution it can make to reducing hardship and thus \n     limiting the grievances that can be used to incite cycles of \n     violence and repression.\n       Indonesia today offers a unique but temporary window of \n     opportunity for the United\n\n[[Page S12728]]\n\n     States to help this nation of 230 million people build an \n     effective democracy based on a civil society and a market \n     economy under the rule of law. The time to rise to the \n     occasion is now.\n\n  Strengthing U.S. Relations With Indonesia: Toward a Partnership for \n                       Human Resource Development\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Congressman Jim Leach, head of the East Asia Subcommittee \n     in the House of Representatives International Relations \n     Committee, said in a 2001 Congressional hearing that ``there \n     is no country in the world of such vital importance that is \n     less understood than Indonesia.'' He went on to say that ``it \n     is strongly in the interest of America and the world for \n     Indonesia to succeed.'' As members of the National Commission \n     on U.S.-Indonesian Relations, we share this view.\n       This important nation of 220 million people, occupying some \n     of the world's most strategic real estate, faces formidable \n     problems: a complicated political transition which has \n     produced three governments in as many years; complex and \n     politically sensitive economic problems left from the 1997-98 \n     financial crisis; ethnic and religious strife resulting in \n     thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of displaced \n     persons; continued armed rebellion in Aceh and Papau; and a \n     significant increase in violence by radical Muslims. The \n     October 2002 bombing in Bali, in which more than 200 people \n     were killed, was the most serious terrorist attack worldwide \n     since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. To \n     show their continuing capability, Indonesian militants \n     attacked the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in early August \n     2003 resulting in 14 deaths and 150 injured.\n       In coping with these problems, Indonesia is handicapped by \n     the legacy of more than 40 years of authoritarian rule--weak \n     institutions and poor administrative capabilities. \n     Nonetheless, the nation has made important progress. It has \n     shown a commitment to openness, development, political \n     stability, economic reform, and, since the Bali bombings, to \n     rooting out terrorists. This progress, the remaining \n     challenges, the stakes for U.S. national interests, and our \n     recommendations for U.S. policymakers are outlined in this \n     report.\n       Our broad conclusion is that the United States and \n     Indonesia should enter into a ``partnership'' to strengthen \n     Indonesia's fragile democracy, reduce the problems that lead \n     to radicalism, and improve this important bilateral \n     relationship. The basic development decisions must be made by \n     the Indonesians themselves, but U.S. assistance can be \n     critical to their success. Under the partnership the two \n     nations can work together on programs where their national \n     interests converge. This will enable U.S. policymakers to \n     recognize Indonesia's priorities, understand what the \n     Indonesians are willing to do, determine how the United \n     States might best assist, and monitor progress. The \n     partnership will also give Indonesia ``ownership'' of the \n     agreed programs and ensure that these programs have the \n     full support of both governments.\n       We believe there are few better investments for the United \n     States at this critical time than to help strengthen \n     democratic behavior and institutions in the world's largest \n     Muslim-majority nation and one which is striving to build a \n     viable democracy. The price of failure would be serious for \n     Indonesia, for the region, for the Muslim world, and, not \n     least, for the United States.\n\n\n                u.s.-indonesian relations in perspective\n\n     Why is Indonesia important to the United States?\n       Indonesia is the pivotal state in Southeast Asia. The \n     world's fifteenth largest and fourth most populous nation, it \n     exercises strong influence in Southeast Asia and plays a \n     constructive international role. It has huge natural \n     resources and a strategic location astride major sea lines of \n     communication--half of the world's merchant fleet capacity \n     passes through the Straits of Malacca, Sunda, and Lombok. \n     Including the oil and mineral sectors, Indonesia is home to \n     an estimated $25 billion in U.S. investment, with more than \n     300 major U.S. firms represented in the country.\n       There are two additional factors of great importance today: \n     Indonesia has by far the world's largest Muslim population, \n     and historically Indonesia's Muslims have been noted for \n     their moderation. It has the two largest Muslim social and \n     educational organizations in the world--the Nahdlatul Ulama \n     and Muhammadiyah--each of which is moderate and has more than \n     30 million members. Indonesia is one of the very few Muslim-\n     majority nations in which Islam is not the state religion. \n     Indonesian Islamic scholars have had a moderating impact on \n     debate within the Muslim world on the relationship between \n     religion and the state. This influence will be enhanced if \n     Indonesia succeeds in its efforts to develop a viable and \n     nonsectarian democratic system; and a stable and responsible \n     Indonesia is critical to regional stability. It is the anchor \n     of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a \n     key player in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the only \n     organization in the Asia-Pacific region that brings the \n     United States together with Japan, China, the ASEAN nations, \n     and others to discuss security issues. The cohesion and \n     effectiveness of ASEAN have eroded significantly due to \n     Indonesia's preoccupation with domestic crises. Instability \n     in Southeast Asia has already provided openings for Islamic \n     radicalism.\n       In short, an unstable, hostile or unpredictable Indonesia \n     would adversely affect U.S. interests and objectives, tilt \n     the international balance toward radical Islam, complicate \n     transit through strategic sea and air routes, hamper efforts \n     to combat piracy and drug trafficking, and weaken a \n     potentially constructive regional counterpoint to China.\n     What is the current U.S.-Indonesian relationship?\n       U.S. relations with Indonesia have been close for much of \n     the country's history. The United States played an important \n     and supportive role in Indonesia's transition to \n     independence, and the country was a reliable strategic \n     partner from the mid-1960s through the end of the Cold War. \n     Bilateral relations suffered during the late 1950s when the \n     United States intervened in domestic strife in Indonesia and \n     during the post-Suharto transition, which saw three \n     presidents in as many years. Although relations are generally \n     good today, there are negative undercurrents stemming from \n     differing demands and expectations over the war in Iraq and \n     its aftermath, priorities in the war on terrorism, and the \n     most appropriate steps in Indonesia's democratic transition.\n       Since September 11, 2001, U.S. strategic priorities have \n     been driven by the demands of the war on terrorism. \n     Washington was frustrated through much of 2002 by the limited \n     extent of Jakarta's commitment to support this war in \n     Southeast Asia and the reluctance of many Indonesians to \n     recognize that terrorism was an urgent internal problem. Such \n     frustrations were not unique to the U.S.-Indonesian \n     relationship, but similarly affected Jakarta's relations with \n     its neighbors in Southeast Asia.\n       The initial reaction of many Indonesians to the Bali \n     terrorist attacks of October 12, 2002, was that their \n     countrymen were incapable of such a horrible act. Some blamed \n     outsiders, including the CIA, which was accused of \n     precipitating the bombings in an effort to draw Indonesia \n     into the war on terrorism. The well-conducted police \n     investigation into the bombings and their aftermath (which by \n     mid-September 2003 had led to the arrest of more than 90 \n     suspected Indonesian terrorists) clearly showed that \n     terrorism is an Indonesian as well as an American problem.\n       The August 5, 2003 attack on the J.W. Marriott Hotel in \n     Jakarta by an Indonesian terrorist drove home the point. \n     Thirteen Indonesians and one foreigner were killed and 150 \n     people were injured in this noon-time car bomb attack on a \n     hotel in Indonesia's financial district known to be \n     frequented by Americans. The Indonesian reaction was one of \n     shock and anger perhaps even greater than the earlier \n     terrorist attack in distant Bali. The two largest Muslim \n     social and educational organizations in Indonesia, the \n     Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, promptly issued a joint \n     statement strongly condemning this ``heinous, ruthless and \n     uncivilized crime against humanity'' and called it an action \n     which ``belies religious values.'' The two organizations \n     called on the government to ``further strengthen the capacity \n     of security officials'' to combat terrorism. These themes \n     were also echoed in the press. Like the Bali attack, this \n     terrorist act was carried out by Indonesians, probably, \n     according to government officials, with encouragement and \n     support from the regional terrorist organization Jemaah \n     Islamiyah.\n       Indonesia's growing awareness of the problem and its \n     increased cooperation with U.S. and regional security \n     counterparts, plus the willingness of moderate Muslims \n     to speak out against radical extremists, have helped \n     improve bilateral relations. Improved communications \n     between the U.S. embassy and the Indonesian government are \n     also helping, as is the fact that the U.S. ambassador is \n     successfully developing contacts with a broad cross-\n     section of opinion leaders, including more traditional \n     Muslim elements.\n       Despite such progress, there are at least two notable areas \n     where significant problems in the relationship remain: The \n     August 2002 murder of two Americans and an Indonesian working \n     for a U.S. company in an ambush near Timika in Papua is a \n     major issue. The Indonesian police have implicated military \n     elements in the attack. The long-running investigation into \n     this deplorable incident, in which US FBI agents have \n     participated, has not led to any charges or prosecutions. \n     This will plague the relationship until a credible \n     investigation is completed and appropriate follow-on actions \n     are taken; and this incident is symptomatic of broader U.S. \n     concerns on acountability--a problem that requires special \n     attention. The Leahy Amendment and various U.S. policy \n     statements stress the need for accountability by senior \n     Indonesian military and police officers for human rights \n     abuses in East Timor and elsewhere. The amendment bans U.S. \n     military education and training programs (IMET) for \n     Indonesian officers until there is an accounting for these \n     actions. A small IMET program was included in the 2003 \n     Defense Department budget, which is not subject to the Leahy \n     Amendment, but there were indications in September 2003 that \n     these funds would not be used because of continued concern \n     over the slow pace of the Timika investigation.\n       The war in Iraq led to large demonstrations against the \n     United States and official and private criticism, but \n     government authorities took strong measures to prevent \n     outbreaks of violence. President Megawati, while criticizing \n     the coalition's lack of UN\n\n[[Page S12729]]\n\n     support, stressed that this U.S. action did not represent an \n     attack on Islam. Indonesians can be expected to continue to \n     watch developments in Iraq closely, but unless large-scale \n     fighting resumes or there is a prolonged and difficult direct \n     U.S. occupation, we do not expect this to become a major \n     issue in the bilateral relationship. Indonesians have in the \n     past complained about a perceived ``lack of balance'' in the \n     Middle East policy of the United States. They hope that, with \n     the end of the Saddam Hussein regime, the United States will \n     take a more active role in resolving basic problems in the \n     Middle East, particularly the plight of the Palestinians, and \n     that the U.S. government will strongly pursue implementation \n     of the ``roadmap.''\n       Other sticking points in the relationship from the \n     Indonesian perspective include: The January 16, 2003 \n     announcement that Indonesia had been added to the list of \n     nations whose males over 16 visiting the United States must \n     register with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and \n     be fingerprinted and photographed. Indonesians see this as \n     further evidence of religious profiling by the United States. \n     They also object strongly to what they see as the failure of \n     the U.S. government adequately to discuss the matter before \n     the rules were published in the Federal Register. This is \n     likely to be a continuing source of friction which will \n     discourage travel to the United States by students, \n     business representatives, and others, and add fuel to \n     anti-American sentiment; and Indonesian perceptions of \n     U.S. ``unilateralism'' and ``bellicosity.'' While \n     agreement with many U.S. criticisms of the problems facing \n     Indonesia, Indonesians resent what they see as America's \n     heavy-handed style and its demands that Indonesia must \n     take certain actions. One well-informed American scholar \n     has said the United States should ``demustify'' its \n     approach. It is important that the United States work with \n     the Indonesians to identify problems and agree on \n     approaches to solve those problems. A joint approach is \n     likely to be more effective than public exhortations or \n     the imposition of sanctions.\n       Top Indonesian officials have expressed deep appreciation \n     for quiet U.S. assistance in working out the Aceh ceasefire \n     in December 2002. Unfortunately, that agreement has not held \n     and fighting has resumed. Nonetheless, we believe that Aceh \n     should continue to have a high priority for the United \n     States, and that the U.S. government should be prepared to \n     offer additional help in ending the violence if this is \n     requested by the Indonesians. Similarly, recognizing that \n     responsibility for Papua lies with the Indonesian government, \n     we recommend that the United States also assist in reducing \n     tensions and violence in that area.\n     Why do we need to rethink U.S.-Indonesian relations now?\n       We hear a great deal about Indonesia's continuing problems \n     but much less about the real progress that has been achieved \n     during the past several years. This progress provides a good \n     base for expanded U.S. assistance in areas where Indonesia \n     wants and can effectively use our help to consolidate the \n     gains already made and to strengthen the base for democracy \n     and continued economic growth. The Commission sees \n     encouraging progress in five important areas:\n       The nation had a free and fair national election in 1999 \n     and peaceful political transitions in 1999 and 2001. Many key \n     elements necessary for a successfully democratic system are \n     in place--an active and independent legislature, a \n     functioning party system, a free and active press, and a \n     growing civil society.\n       Constitutional reform has gone much further than most \n     observers anticipated. Sovereignty for the first time is \n     vested in the people, a system of checks and balances has \n     been introduced, appointed seats for the military in elected \n     bodies will be eliminated at the time of the 2004 elections, \n     and in these elections the president and vice president will \n     for the first time be directly elected. A new Regional \n     Representative Council has been created to advance the \n     interests of the provinces, and a new Constitutional Court \n     and a Judicial Commission have been formed to strengthen the \n     legal structure.\n       Indonesia's decentralization--the largest in history--\n     transferred many central powers and two million civil \n     servants to some 400 local districts and towns on January 1, \n     2001. Despite initial misgivings, the process has gone \n     reasonably well, and some of the concerns about the potential \n     problems--increased corruption, double taxation--have proved \n     to be exaggerated. Moreover, while the process is still in \n     its early stages, there are already sign in some areas of \n     grassroots democracy and local leadership.\n       Macroeconomic conditions have improved significantly. The \n     rupiah is relatively stable, interest rates are down to \n     manageable levels, monetary policy is sound, the banking \n     system has been strengthened, asset recovery is proceeding, \n     and inflation has fallen from 80 percent at the peak of the \n     financial crisis to less than 10 percent. There has also been \n     progress in reducing the debt ratio, which is down from 102 \n     percent of GDP in 1999 to 67 percent in late 2003 according \n     to Indonesian official sources. Per capita income is \n     approaching 1997 pre-crisis levels, and the 13 percent of the \n     population living in absolute poverty, while still excessive, \n     is less than half the level in 1998. Citing ``good progress'' \n     in June 2003, the IMF announced a further release of $486 \n     million, raising the amount released under the Extended Fund \n     Facility arrangement to about $4 billion out of the $5 \n     billion total.\n       The government moved quickly after the Bali bombings to \n     revise internal security regulations to give the authorities \n     greater flexibility in moving against suspected terrorists. \n     The police, who welcomed support from Australia, the United \n     States and others, have arrested more than 90 Indonesians \n     suspected of complicity in terrorist activities, and \n     international cooperation is continuing following the \n     Marriott Hotel attack.\n       In short, Indonesia has made progress and is now at a \n     critical juncture in its democratic transition and economic \n     recovery. This is an opportune time for the United States to \n     rethink its approach to the relationship. If the democratic \n     transition is unsuccessful, Indonesia's political situation \n     will become less predictable, with increased risk of \n     exaggerated nationalism and/or Muslim radicalism. Less \n     likely, although impossible to discount, is a return to \n     authoritarian rule.\n       Such negative scenarios are by no means inevitable, and it \n     is therefore important for the United States to identify \n     policies and programs that will help strengthen the nation's \n     prospects for success. As members of the National Commission \n     on U.S.-Indonesian Relations, we see a need for broad, \n     consistent U.S. engagement with Indonesia in four priority \n     areas (while anticipating that the significant U.S. health \n     and humanitarian assistance programs will continue):\n       Education. Underlying all other areas is the urgent need to \n     help develop Indonesia's poorly functioning educational \n     system and significantly expand the pool of trained \n     administrators. This is an essential underpinning for a \n     successful democracy and for continued domestic economic and \n     social reform. Support for education was an important \n     component of U.S. policy in the 1960s and it made a major \n     contribution to Indonesia's rapid economic growth in the \n     1970s and 1980s. It is now time for a similar effort to \n     strengthen the country's democratization programs and \n     administrative capabilities.\n       Democratization. The United States is well placed to assist \n     Indonesia in its efforts to strengthen the electoral system, \n     improve civil governance, pursue legal reform, and extend \n     decentralization. Helping to ensure the emergency of \n     Indonesia as a democratic, moderate, Muslim-majority state \n     directly serves the long-term national interests of the \n     United States.\n       Economic growth. There are a variety of measures that the \n     U.S. government could undertake to alleviate Indonesia's \n     financial burden, help improve the climate for investment and \n     trade, and facilitate economic recovery. Encouraging a \n     resumption of foreign investment will be a major boost to \n     Indonesia's economy and contribute to social and political \n     stability.\n       Security. The United States can help improve the Indonesian \n     authorities' capabilities to guarantee security through \n     education for the police and, when conditions are \n     appropriate, for the military. Doing so will help reduce \n     abuses and will also contribute to social and political \n     stability, improve the investment climate, and coincide with \n     U.S. strategic objectives in the war on terrorism.\n       The Joint Statement issued by Presidents Bush and Megawati \n     following the Indonesian president's September 19, 2001 visit \n     to Washington provides a good basis for future relations \n     between the two nations. President Bush ``expressed his \n     conviction that Indonesia's transition to democracy is one of \n     the most significant developments of this era . . . [and] he \n     pledged his support for President Megawati's efforts to build \n     a stable, united, democratic and prosperous Indonesia.'' He \n     announced that the United States, in the ``spirit of their \n     shared commitment to promote reform and professionalization \n     of the military . . . would lift its embargo on commercial \n     sales of non-lethal defense articles for Indonesia'' subject \n     to the usual case-by-case review. The two presidents also \n     noted ``the importance of open markets and expanded trade for \n     economic growth . . . . ''\n       For her part, President Megawati ``condemned the barbaric \n     and indiscriminate acts'' of September 11 and ``pledged to \n     cooperate with the international community in combating \n     terrorism.'' She also ``reaffirmed her determination to \n     pursue a multidimensional approach'' to separatism in Aceh \n     and Papua and ``underscored her determination to improve \n     Indonesia's investment climate'' by ``strengthening the rule \n     of law, resolving outstanding investment disputes, and \n     protecting investors' assets and property.''\n\n\n             the partnership for human resource development\n\n       Ensuring a successful transition to democracy, stability, \n     and growth in Indonesia is not something that the United \n     States can do. The basic parameters must be set by Indonesia, \n     and the programs must be those with high priority for them as \n     well as for the United States. Open communication and regular \n     consultations are central to this. To ensure that both \n     countries are in full agreement on the course ahead, we \n     recommend creation of a formal coordinating mechanism to \n     facilitate dialogue on the wide range of concerns in the \n     bilateral relationship and to guide programs in the priority \n     areas outlined above. This mechanism--which might be\n\n[[Page S12730]]\n\n     termed a ``Partnership for Human Resource Development''--\n     would be a standing body of senior officials from both \n     nations which would meet at least once a year, alternating \n     between the two capitals. The basic purpose would be to \n     ensure that both countries accept ``ownership'' of the agreed \n     programs and understand their responsibilities.\n       Membership in the partnership on the U.S. government side \n     should come from the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, \n     Commerce, USAID, USTR, Members of Congress or their staff, \n     and other appropriate agencies. Specialists could be brought \n     in as needed on specific issues. Indonesian representation \n     should be comparable. To ensure that the designated members \n     participate fully and actively, we suggest participation not \n     be at the cabinet level but perhaps at the deputy assistant \n     secretary level, but the actual level should be set by the \n     two governments.\n       It has been suggested that the private sector also be \n     included in the partnership. To avoid the group becoming \n     unwieldy and the need to make difficult choices regarding \n     participation, we suggest that permanent private membership \n     in the partnership be limited to several broad organizations \n     focusing on the bilateral relationship such as the American \n     Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta, the Indonesia Committee of \n     the U.S.--ASEAN Business Council, the American-Indonesian \n     Chamber of Commerce in New York, and the United States-\n     Indonesia Society. The Indonesian side may wish to invite \n     participation by a similar Indonesian organization or \n     organizations. As issues requiring additional expertise \n     arise, other private sector representatives (teachers, \n     lawyers, NGO members and others) could be invited to \n     participate in partnership meetings on a case-by-case basis.\n       We do not envisage the creation of a large bureaucracy, but \n     we suggest it would be useful to have several working groups, \n     located in Jakarta, to handle day-to-day liaison. These might \n     include working groups on: civil governance and legal reform; \n     trade and investment; education and public affairs; military \n     relations; and police programs. USAID and the public \n     diplomacy section of the U.S. embassy could provide \n     leadership and continuity to these groups.\n       If the United States agrees to pursue such a partnership, \n     it should be aware of three basic factors:\n       1. Fixing Indonesia's problems will take many years. In \n     most cases it is not a matter of simply repairing something \n     which is broken. Many of Indonesia's problems go back to the \n     country's independence. The Indonesian military has been \n     engaged in politics, civilian activities, and independent \n     fund raising since the early days of the republic. Except \n     possibly for a few years in the 1950s, the nation has \n     never had an honest or credible legal or court system. The \n     bureaucracy has been inefficient from the start and there \n     has always been corruption, although it reached new \n     heights under Suharto. Knowledgeable Indonesians estimate \n     that it will take 10 to 15 years to get the military and \n     the legal system on track. We agree.\n       2. What the United States can do directly is limited. Many \n     of the basic reforms will have to come from within Indonesia, \n     and this underscores the need for a partnership. U.S. \n     exhortations, threats, and penalties are of minimal effect \n     and can be counter-productive. What the United States can do, \n     and do very well, is to train, encourage and support \n     Indonesians who can reform from within. This underscores our \n     strong emphasis in this report on education.\n       3. Indonesians are in a state of heightened sensitivity at \n     present because of what they view as U.S. ``unilateralism,'' \n     ``arrogance,'' and a tendency to lecture or threaten others. \n     They resent Congressional restrictions and demands that they \n     ``must'' take certain actions. It is important that the \n     United States consider the public diplomacy aspects of all \n     bilateral assistance programs.\n       Monitoring arrangements. As we are recommending a \n     substantial increase in the American commitment to Indonesia, \n     so too should Indonesia demonstrate its commitment to \n     internal reform and partnership with the United States in \n     order to ensure maximum effectiveness of the additional U.S. \n     assistance. As the details of U.S. assistance are worked out, \n     we believe benchmarks should be established by the \n     partnership to provide for verification of progress. The \n     ``Partnership for Human Resource Development'' can serve as a \n     forum for Americans and Indonesians to evaluate the progress \n     of the various programs and identify areas of success or \n     underperformance.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       Indonesia faces three critical challenges: (1) It is \n     striving to consolidate a fragile democratic system with \n     little experience and limited resources. If it fails it could \n     revert to authoritarianism or chaos. Some Indonesians already \n     speak nostalgically of the stability and economic progress of \n     the Suharto era; (2) Moderate Muslims, still a substantial \n     majority, are under challenge from a radical fringe which has \n     grown significantly during the past five years. The goal of \n     the radicals is to capitalize on domestic vulnerabilities and \n     international issues to win over or intimidate the moderate \n     majority; (3) The nation is striving, in the face of rising \n     economic nationalism, to work its way out of the economic \n     mess left by the Suharto regime. The outcome of these three \n     contests will be crucial to the future of Southeast Asia and \n     U.S. relations with the region.\n       The National Commission on U.S.-Indonesian Relations \n     recommends that the United States enter into a five-year \n     ``Partnership for Human Resource Development'' with Indonesia \n     in which the two nations agree to work together in the \n     following areas:\n       We strongly believe that our top priority should be to help \n     Indonesia in the field of education. We need urgently to help \n     train the trainers and reformers. We leave to experts on both \n     sides to work out specific programs, but we favor a major \n     effort to help improve Indonesia's educational system and \n     expand opportunities for education and training in Indonesia \n     and the United States.\n       The United States should support expanded programs for \n     legal reform.\n       The two nations should explore ways in which the United \n     States could help strengthen the Indonesian parliament, \n     including the establishment of cooperative arrangements with \n     the U.S. Congress.\n       The United States and Indonesia should cooperate on \n     programs to strengthen Indonesia's administrative services \n     through support to Indonesia's civil service and other \n     bodies.\n       The United States should initiate discussions with other \n     major donors to encourage the World Bank and the Asian \n     Development Bank to increase fast-disbursing loans tied \n     primarily to macroeconomic performance rather than to \n     structural reforms.\n       The United States should work with Indonesia to reduce \n     obstacles to foreign direct investment and, by offering \n     technical assistance and lowering barriers to key Indonesian \n     products, help Indonesia expand its exports to the United \n     States. It should press other developed countries to do the \n     same.\n       Indonesia, with U.S. cooperation, should revive the U.S.-\n     Indonesia Energy Dialogue and other forums that will \n     strengthen cooperation between the private sectors in the two \n     countries.\n       Working with Indonesian counterparts, the United States \n     should expand support for the Indonesian police, with \n     particular emphasis on education and training, and the \n     establishment of long-term institutional relationships.\n       The United States should set aside plans to resume the \n     International Military Education and Training program for \n     Indonesia until the political climate is more conducive on \n     both sides. The government should, however, continue to be \n     alert to ways to expand contacts with the TNI in order to \n     reduce its isolation.\n       If Indonesia wants U.S. help, the United States should \n     provide appropriate assistance and support in seeking \n     peaceful settlements in disputed or troubled areas.\n       U.S. public affairs should be significantly expanded to \n     create additional opportunities for information and cultural \n     programs.\n       The United States should take all possible measures to \n     reduce the delay in issuing visas for Indonesian students, \n     business representatives, scholars, and others with \n     legitimate reasons to visit the United States.\n       The Commission sees this new relationship as a partnership \n     and hopes accordingly that the Indonesian government, for its \n     part, will take steps to make these programs successful.\n       The Commission commends the U.S. embassy and USAID in \n     Jakarta and Washington for the excellent programs underway to \n     strengthen civil governance, decentralization, and the \n     electoral system. A good base has been built and the \n     Commission recommends that these programs be expanded and \n     augmented as noted in this report.\n       The Commission also recognizes and commends the efforts of \n     the U.S. diplomatic mission to broaden the mission's contacts \n     with political, media, religious and other leaders. We \n     congratulate the ambassador in particular for his efforts to \n     open dialogue with Muslim leaders, an area that has been \n     neglected. These programs are of increasing importance in \n     these difficult times, and the Commission calls on the U.S. \n     government to provide full support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12730-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12730-S12732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TROOP MORALE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today two news articles came to my \nattention regarding the recent survey conducted by the Stars and \nStripes newspaper on the level of troop morale in Iraq. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Stars and Stripes, Oct. 16, 2003]\n\n Ground Truth, Day 2: In Survey, Many in Iraq Call Morale Low; Leaders \n                        Say Job Is Getting Done\n\n                          (By Ward Sanderson)\n\n       What is the morale of U.S. troops in Iraq?\n       Answers vary. High-ranking visitors to the country, \n     including Department of Defense and congressional officials, \n     have said it is outstanding.\n       Some troops on the ground have begged to differ, writing to \n     Stars and Stripes and to others about what they call low \n     morale on their part and on the part of their units.\n       There was a correlation between such things as local \n     services and release dates on the one hand, and morale on the \n     other.\n       Stars and Stripes sent a team of reporters to Iraq to try \n     to ascertain the states of both conditions and morale. Troops \n     were asked about morale, among many other issues, in a\n\n[[Page S12731]]\n\n     17-point questionnaire, which was filled out and returned by \n     nearly 2,000 persons.\n       The results varied; sometimes dramatically:\n       Among the largest group surveyed, Army troops, the results \n     looked much like a bell curve. Twenty-seven percent said \n     their personal moral was ``high'' or ``very high.'' Thirty-\n     three percent said it was ``low'' or ``very low.'' The \n     largest percentage fell in the middle, saying it was \n     ``average.''\n       Among the second largest group, reservists and National \n     Guard members, the differences were much starker. Only 15 \n     percent said their own morale was ``high'' or ``very high,'' \n     while 48 percent said it was ``low'' or ``very low.''\n       Among the Marines, the next largest group 44 percent said \n     their morale was ``high'' or ``very high,'' and only 14 \n     percent said it was ``low'' or ``very low.''\n       Among airmen, the smallest of the four major groups \n     surveyed because fewer questionnaires were allowed to be \n     circulated to them, the results were also very positive. \n     Thirty-nine percent said their morale was ``high'' or ``very \n     high,'' and only 6 percent said it was ``low'' or ``very \n     low.''\n       Very few Navy servicemembers could be found to question in \n     Iraq.\n       The questionnaire findings can't be projected to all the \n     servicemembers in Iraq. Still, the reporting of ``lows'' \n     among the two largest groups surveyed, Army and Reserve/\n     National Guard, seemed significant. The views of these \n     troops, at least, appeared to contrast sharply with those of \n     the visiting VIPs.\n       Respondents to the survey were not given a definition of \n     morale. They responded according to what they interpreted the \n     word to mean. Some believe morale reflects the degree of \n     well-being felt by the servicemember. On the other hand, \n     commanders say that in measuring morale, they want to know if \n     the servicemember is following orders and getting the job \n     done.\n       Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. officer in Iraq, \n     said that low morale isn't an issue because troops are \n     fulfilling the mission.\n       ``Morale is . . . not necessarily giving them Baskin-\n     Robbins,'' he said in a Stars and Stripes interview. \n     ``Sometimes it's being able to train them hard and keep them \n     focused in a combat environment so they can survive.\n       ``So at its most fundamental level within our Army, taking \n     care of soldiers and their morale could have very few worldly \n     comforts. But the morale of the soldier is good. He's being \n     taken care of, he's accomplishing his mission, he's being \n     successful in the warfighting.''\n       Other military leaders say they are always looking at ways \n     to improve the morale of their troops. ``Morale begins with \n     caring leaders looking their soldiers in the eye,'' said Lt. \n     Col. Jim Cassella, a Pentagon spokesman. ``When senior \n     leaders visit the troops in Iraq, they relate that the troops \n     tell them that morale is good, a fact that's backed up by re-\n     enlistment and retention rates.''\n       (These rates have been acceptable or good for the services \n     overall. Figures for re-enlistments in Iraq are not available \n     yet, officials said. In the Stripes survey, half or more \n     respondents from the Army, Marines and Reserves said they \n     were unlikely to stay in the service. Officials say re-\n     enlistments normally drop after conflicts.)\n       Cassella said that leaders visiting Iraq seek out the \n     opinions of troops. Some say the views expressed may be \n     distorted as a result of the nature of the get-togethers, \n     ``dog and pony shows,'' in the words of combat engineer Pfc. \n     Roger Hunsaker.\n       ``When congressional delegations came through,'' said one \n     36-year-old artillery master sergeant who asked not to be \n     identified, commanders ``hand-picked the soldiers who would \n     go. They stacked the deck.''\n       Others on the ground in Iraq think top leaders are right \n     more times than they are given credit for.\n       ``I heard that reporters/politicians were trying to say \n     morale was down out here,'' Petty Officer Matthew W. Early \n     wrote on his questionnaire at Camp Get Some in southern Iraq. \n     ``What do people back home expect us to feel after a war? Are \n     we supposed to be as happy here as we are with our friends \n     and families back home? Hell no.\n       ``Of course, when confronted by reporters, we're going to \n     voice out opinions about our situation. Unfortunately, some \n     people like to complain about how they live or what they \n     don't have. The complaint concerning morale is the voice of \n     the minority, not the majority.''\n       In the Stripes survey, troops consistently rated their \n     unit's morale as lower than their own. John Kay, marketing \n     director for the Army Research Institute, said, ``Soldiers \n     always rate self [personal] morale higher than unit moral. \n     This is nothing new.''\n       Troops may wish to report what they perceive as the true \n     morale situation without getting themselves into trouble, a \n     way of saying, ``I'm OK, but the unit's not.''\n       Some of the gap can also be the result of hearing other \n     troops complain, compounding the impression that unit morale \n     is low, even if each complainer believes his or her own \n     morale is better.\n       ``Both are true,'' said Charles Moskos, a military \n     sociologist with Northwestern University.\n       The military studies morale regularly, but ``the further \n     you go up the chain in the officer corps, the reality of day-\n     to-day morale cannot register completely,'' said Lt. Col. \n     Daniel Smith, retired chief of research for the Center for \n     Defense Information. ``Whereas when you talk to the platoon \n     sergeants, platoon leaders and even company commanders, you \n     get a better sense of the true state of affairs. Do the \n     weapons work? Are they getting hot meals? Are they getting \n     enough rest? Are their leaders competent and not taking \n     unnecessary risks?''\n       Unlike some officials who have visited Iraq, Defense \n     Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, during a September stop in \n     Iraq, spoke not about morale per se, but about the importance \n     of the mission and about sacrifice.\n       ``You're people . . . who weren't drafted, you weren't \n     conscripted, you searched your souls and decided that you \n     wanted to step forward and serve your country,'' he told the \n     4th Infantry Division, according to a Pentagon transcript.\n       Another speech to air assault soldiers of the 101st \n     Airborne division echoed the sentiment:\n       ``The important thing I would also add is that every one of \n     you is a volunteer. You all asked to do this, and that is \n     impressive and it's appreciated.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 16, 2003]\n\n               Many Troops Dissatisfied, Iraq Poll Finds\n\n                  (By Bradley Graham and Dana Milbank)\n\n       A broad survey of U.S. troops in Iraq by a Pentagon-funded \n     newspaper found that half of those questioned described their \n     unit's morale as low and their training as insufficient, and \n     said they do not plan to reenlist.\n       The survey, conducted by the Stars and Stripes newspaper, \n     also recorded about a third of the respondents complaining \n     that their mission lacks clear definition and characterizing \n     the war in Iraq as of little or no value. Fully 40 percent \n     said the jobs they were doing had little or nothing to do \n     with their training.\n       The findings, drawn from 1,935 questionnaires presented to \n     U.S. service members throughout Iraq, conflict with \n     statements by military commanders and Bush administration \n     officials that portray the deployed troops as high-spirited \n     and generally well-prepared. Though not obtained through \n     scientific methods, the survey results suggest that a \n     combination of difficult conditions, complex missions and \n     prolonged tours in Iraq is wearing down a significant portion \n     of the U.S. force and threatening to provoke a sizable exodus \n     from military service.\n       In the first of a week-long series of articles, Stars and \n     Stripes said yesterday that it undertook the survey in August \n     after receiving scores of letters from troops who were upset \n     with one aspect or another of the Iraq operation. The \n     newspaper, which receives some funding from the Defense \n     Department but functions without editorial control by the \n     Pentagon, prepared 17 questions and sent three teams of \n     reporters to Iraq to conduct the survey and related \n     interviews at nearly 50 camps.\n       ``We conducted a `convenience survey,' meaning we gave it \n     to those who happened to be available at the time rather than \n     to a randomly selected cross section, so the results cannot \n     necessarily be projected as representing the whole \n     population,'' said David Mazzarella, the paper's editorial \n     director in Washington. ``But we still think the findings are \n     significant and make clear that the troops have a different \n     idea of things than what their leaders have been saying.''\n       Experts in public opinion and the military concurred that \n     the poll was not necessarily representative, but they \n     characterized it as a useful gauge of troops' sentiment. \n     ``The numbers are consistent with what I suspect is going on \n     there,'' said David Segal, a military sociologist at the \n     University of Maryland at College Park. ``I am getting a \n     sense that there is a high and increasing level of \n     demoralization and a growing sense of being in something they \n     don't understand and aren't sure the American people \n     understand.''\n       The paper quoted Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of \n     U.S. forces in Iraq, saying in a Sept. 9 interview for the \n     series that ``there is no morale problem.'' He said \n     complaints among troops are ``expected'' and part of ``the \n     Army's normal posture,'' whether the soldiers are deployed or \n     not.\n       ``We haven't had time to study the survey, but we take all \n     indicators of morale seriously,'' said Bryan Whitman, a \n     senior Pentagon spokesman. ``It's the reason we've instituted \n     several programs to address morale and welfare issues.'' A \n     White House spokesman had no comment.\n       Some military experts pointed to good news for the \n     administration in the survey. Military historian Eliot Cohen, \n     who serves on a Pentagon advisory panel, noted that the \n     proportion that said the war was worthwhile--67 percent--and \n     the proportion of troops that said they have a clearly \n     defined mission--64 percent--is amazingly high.'' He added \n     that complaints are typical. ``American troops have a God-\n     given right and tradition of grumbling,'' he said.\n       In the survey, 34 percent described their morale as low, \n     compared with 27 percent who described it as high and 37 \n     percent who said it was average; 49 percent described their \n     unit's morale as low, while 16 percent called it high.\n       In recent days, the Bush administration has launched a \n     campaign to blame the news media for portraying the situation \n     in Iraq in a negative light. Last week, Bush described the \n     military spirit as high and said that life in Iraq is ``a lot \n     better than you probably think. Just ask people who have been \n     there.''\n\n[[Page S12732]]\n\n       But Stars and Stripes raised questions about what those \n     visiting dignitaries saw in Iraq. ``Many soldiers, including \n     several officers, allege that VIP visits from the Pentagon \n     and Capitol Hill are only given hand-picked troops to meet \n     with during their tours of Iraq,'' the newspaper said in its \n     interview with Sanchez. ``The phrase `Dog and Pony Show' is \n     usually used. Some troops even go so far as to say they've \n     been ordered not to talk to VIPs because leaders are afraid \n     of what they might say.''\n       The newspaper also noted in that interview that its \n     reporters were told that some soldiers who had complained of \n     morale problems had faced disciplinary actions known as \n     Article 15s, which can result in reprimand, extra duties and \n     forfeiture of pay. Sanchez said he did not know of any such \n     punishments, but he added that they would have been handled \n     at a lower level.\n       The paper's project recorded significant differences in the \n     morale of various units, but overall found that Army troops \n     tended to sound more dissatisfied than Air Force personnel \n     and Marines, and that reservists were the most troubled.\n       Uncertainty about when they are returning home was a major \n     factor in dampening morale, according to the newspaper. The \n     interviews were conducted at a time when some reserve and \n     regular Army units were learning that their tours had been \n     extended. The Pentagon has since sought to provide a clearer \n     rotation plan and has begun granting troops two-week home \n     leaves.\n       Although Pentagon officials say they have seen no sign yet \n     of a rise in the number of troops deciding against \n     reenlisting, the survey suggested that such a surge may be \n     coming soon. A total of 49 percent of those questioned said \n     it was ``very unlikely'' or ``not likely'' that they would \n     remain in the military after they complete their current \n     obligations. In the past, enlistment rates tended to drop \n     after conflicts, but many defense experts and noncommissioned \n     officers have warned of the potential for a historically high \n     exodus, particularly of reservists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12732-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING ALBERTSON'S INCORPORATED OF BOISE, ID\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a quiet patriot \nfrom Idaho. Our National Guard and Reserve troops who have been called \nup to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq have left behind not only families, \nbut in many cases, full-time jobs. Many employers go the extra mile to \nprovide support to their deployed employees, their families, and \ncommunities. One such employer-patriot is Albertson's Incorporated, \nheadquartered in Boise, ID.\n  Albertson's Incorporated recently received recognition from the \nDepartment of Defense for its extraordinary ongoing efforts in support \nof deployed employees, and those employees' families. The National \nCommittee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR, has \nchosen Albertson's Incorporated as one of only four companies \nnationwide to receive the 2003 ESGR Home Front Award. The Department of \nDefense recognizes the efforts of these companies to take steps such as \nproviding pay differential, the continuation of benefits when their \nemployees are mobilized, and a willingness to advocate Guard and \nReserve service among their industry peers. With many employees \ncurrently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan, Albertson's has shown \ndedication to the values of freedom and democracy, and perseverance in \nlight of limited personnel resources. Albertson's has translated \npatriotic words into action, and shown that corporations as well as \nindividuals can lend a helping hand to the men and women of the Armed \nForces, their families, and our Nation as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12732-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF OFFICER JASON PRATT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I honor one of Nebraska's \nfinest who recently gave his life in the line of duty. His service and \nsacrifice are an inspiration to us all and a reminder of the \nappreciation we have for our law enforcement officers and first \nresponders.\n  Officer Jason Pratt began his career with the Omaha Police Department \nin 1996 at the age of 23. He served honorably for 7 years and 2 days \nbefore being tragically killed in the line of duty on September 11, \n2003. During his years on the force, his commitment and energy were \nrecognized several times by his fellow officers, community members and \nsuperiors.\n  In February of 1997, Officer Pratt began work as a patrol officer. By \nApril of that year--less than a year on the job--members of the \nLeavenworth Neighborhood Association were already noticing Jason for \nthe work he and his crew did in the area. Jason's dedication to service \ndid not wane and in May of 2001, he was recognized by the Neighborhood \nAssociation again for his efforts.\n  Jason followed that service with a year in the vice squad, a division \nof the intelligence unit. During this time, he kept family areas, such \nas neighborhood parks, safer for our families. Finally, he also spent \ntime in the emergency response unit, placing himself in extreme danger \non numerous occasions by taking high-risk offenders off the street.\n  Officer Pratt will be well remembered for being an officer who always \ncame as back up to help out other officers. In September of 2001, he \nassisted bike officers with a traffic stop that ultimately led to the \nsuspect being booked on a number of felony charges. In another \ninstance, in April of 2003, he was responding to a house fire where an \nadult and two children were trapped. Poor weather conditions delayed a \nsecond fire unit so Officer Pratt assisted firefighters in carrying \ngear up to the house. Because of his actions, there were no further \ninjuries that day.\n  Officer Pratt lost his life while trying to make our city safer. His \nsacrifices, and those of his family, are another reminder of the risks \ntaken by police officers across the Nation to keep our cities and towns \nsafe. Americans honor their commitment and we stand shoulder to \nshoulder with them when one is struck down.\n  I am proud to have witnessed the outpouring of support for his family \ngiven by the people of Omaha. His two children, Madison and Jordyn, and \nhis wife Stacy, have lost their father and husband and he can never be \nreplaced. But the people of Omaha have shown again and again that they \nwill do whatever necessary to help the Pratt family in the weeks, \nmonths and years to come. Officer Pratt will not be forgotten and all \nof Omaha will work to ensure his family is safe.\n  Jason Pratt died doing what he always wanted to do. He died \nprotecting his and our community through public service alongside his \nfriends and fellow officers. In his memory, those officers will \ncontinue to serve every day knowing that if he were still alive; he \nwould be standing at their side. I join with my fellow Nebraskans in \nthanking Officer Pratt and his family for all they have given to us and \npledging to remember his work and his life and the difference he made \nin our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12732-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12732-S12733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF MOTHER TERESA\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nof Mother Teresa and to acknowledge her upcoming beatification of the \nVatican. The process leading up to her beatification has been the \nshortest in modern history. In early 1999--less than 2 years after \nMother Teresa's death--Pope John Paul II waived the normal 5-year \nwaiting period and allowed the immediate opening of her canonization \nprocess. The rule has traditionally been used to allow for a more \nobjective look at a person's life and achievements. However, the life \nand works of Mother Teresa were so astounding that Pope John Paul II \nwas convinced that he did not need 5 years to objectively determine \nthat she should be beatified.\n  Mother Teresa, the ``Saint of the Gutters,'' was born in what is now \nMacedonia in 1910. She took her final vows as a nun in 1937, and in \n1946, while riding a train to the mountain town of Darjeeling to \nrecover from suspected tuberculosis, she received, as she says ``a call \nwithin a call'' from God to, ``serve Him among the poorest of the \npoor.'' And it is in this capacity that the world came to know of \nMother Teresa's endless charity and love for all human life. She \nconfronted this monumental task one hovel at a time. She created a \nreligious order to help the aged, the poor, the hungry, the sick, and \nthe disabled to live and die with dignity. She received approval from \nthe Pope to establish the Missionaries of Charity, which focused much \nof its attention on giving comfort to the dying. The year before she \ndied, Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity were operating 517 \nmissions in more than 100 countries. In addition, she opened schools, \norphanages, and homes for the needy, as well as homes for AIDS victims, \nand hospices.\n  Mother Teresa was a woman who fought passionately for dignity for all\n\n[[Page S12733]]\n\nhuman life--from the leper on the streets of Calcutta, to the ailing \nAIDS victim in New York, to the unborn child inside a mother's womb. \nHer passion for protecting all human life was clear when she spoke to \nMembers of Congress at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 1994. \nShe said,\n\n       I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is \n     abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct \n     killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. \n     And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, \n     how can we tell other people not to kill one another?\n\n  She continuously reminded people around the world of the plight of \nthose weakest in the world; those least able to protect themselves. In \n1979, she received the Nobel Peace Prize and accepted the award ``in \nthe name of the hungry, the naked, the homeless, of the crippled, of \nthe blind, of the lepers, of all those people who feel unwanted, \nunloved, uncared-for throughout society, people that have become a \nburden to society and are shunned by everyone.''\n  Mother Teresa touched the lives of those most in need in this world \nand she inspired others to service in every corner of the globe. \nCertainly the work she performed in her life was miraculous, and I have \nno doubt that those in need will continue to find solace and comfort in \nMother Teresa and the continuing work that her missions still perform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12733-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR IRAQIS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to discuss something that I \nconsider a major cornerstone to any free society--religious freedom.\n  I recently offered an amendment during the markup that would \ncondition the money going to the Coalition Provisional Authority, CPA, \nby ensuring the preservation of ``full rights to religious freedom for \nall individuals, including a prohibition on laws which would \ncriminalize blasphemy and apostasy.'' The first part of that phrase, \n``full rights to religious freedom for all individuals,'' is extremely \nimportant given the recent historical record on constitutions that \nestablished Islam as the official religion of the state. Pakistan is an \nIslamic Republic in which the constitution extends some rights to \ngroups to engage in their religious practices.\n  However, the constitution does not allow for the freedom of \nconscience of individual believers, either within different sects of \nIslam or for those wishing to convert. Therefore, the biggest danger \nmay be to those who do not subscribe to the prevailing interpretation \nof Islam. With the Afghan constitution just now coming to light, the \ninternational community and the Afghan people are slowly becoming aware \nthat their constitution will not preserve their individual right to \nbelieve what they wish.\n  On October 1, 2003, the New York Times published an op-ed piece \nwritten by members of the United States Commission on Religious Freedom \nwhich precisely outlined the significant importance of only supporting \na constitution that, and I quote, ``clearly and unequivocally enshrines \nhuman rights and religious freedom.'' We must not settle for anything \nless and we must not encourage the Afghan people to settle for any \nless. As stated in the article, ``After all, it is not just \nAfghanistan's future that is at stake. Iraqis are watching to see what \nminimum standards of individual rights will be acceptable to the United \nStates.''\n  In addition, the last part of the phrase which would prohibit \ncriminalization of blasphemy and apostasy is equally as important. As \nmuch as the constitution must be absolutely secular, those who would \nfreely renounce their faith, apostasy, or those who would speak out \nprofanely against religion, blasphemy, must have their rights \npreserved. The freedom of religion is more than just the ability to \npractice one's faith, but is central to other rights and freedoms, \nincluding a free press, public assembly, free speech or the right to \npetition the government. All of these freedoms will be circumscribed if \nreligious freedom is not part of an Iraqi constitution and a \nreconstituted Iraq.\n  My amendment, which also appears in the House language, would also \nrequire the President to submit a report to the Congress every 90 days \ndetailing efforts to make religious freedom a major tenet of the Iraqi \nconstitution. If Secretary Powell's recent statement is correct, then \nthere should be a constitution in six months. That would, at most, \nrequire two reports on the status of the constitution if completed \nwithin 6 months.\n  In my view, religious freedom is the bedrock on which freedom, hope \nand progress rest and should be a top priority as we discuss the many \nforeign policy issues at hand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times op-ed article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 2003]\n\n                        Silenced Again in Kabul\n\n                (By Preeta D. Bansal and Felice D. Gaer)\n\n       Washington.--American efforts to build a democratic, \n     tolerant Afghanistan are facing a serious challenge: the \n     draft of the Afghan constitution, which may be made public as \n     early as this week, does not yet provide for crucial human \n     rights protections, including freedom of thought, conscience \n     and religion. The United States and the international \n     community should insist that the draft presented by the \n     constitutional commission explicitly protect these core human \n     rights for all Afghans.\n       Despite reports to the contrary, the current draft versions \n     of the constitution enshrine particular schools of Islamic \n     law, or Shariah, that criminalize dissent and criticism of \n     Islam through blasphemy laws.\n       If this draft is ratified in December by the loya jirga, or \n     grand council, the freedoms of Afghan citizens would continue \n     to be in the hands of judges educated in Islamic law, rather \n     than in civil law. Official charges of blasphemy, apostasy or \n     other religious crimes could still be used to suppress \n     debate, just as they were under the Taliban.\n       Making changes in the draft is all the more important \n     because, as Afghanistan's Human Rights Commission and the \n     United Nations' Assistance Mission in Afghanistan have \n     reported, Afghan reformers seeking to express their views on \n     their new constitution have been hindered by threats, \n     harassment and even imprisonment. In one case, an editor and \n     a reporter have been charged with blasphemy for publishing an \n     article questioning the role of Islam in the state.\n       On our recent trip to Kabul as members of the bipartisan \n     United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, \n     we met many Muslims who recognize the compatibility of Islam \n     with human rights. Yet these Muslims are being intimidated \n     into silence by vocal and well-armed extremists.\n       Freedom-loving Afghans won't be able to rely on \n     conscientious judges to protect religious freedom without an \n     explicit reference to it in the constitution. Afghanistan's \n     chief justice, Fazl Hadi Shinwari, for example, has shown \n     little regard for those who disagree with his hard-line \n     interpretation of Islam. He told us that he accepted the \n     international standards protected by the Universal \n     Declaration on Human Rights--with three exceptions: freedom \n     of expression, freedom of religion and equality of the sexes. \n     ``This is the only law,'' the chief justice told us, pointing \n     to the Koran on his desk.\n       Even in a self-proclaimed Islamic republic, however, all \n     citizens, Muslims as well as non-Muslims, must be free to \n     debate the role of religion and to question prevailing \n     orthodoxies without fear of being subjected to trials, prison \n     or death. At a minimum, Afghan leaders should amend the draft \n     constitution to specifically ensure the human rights \n     guarantees that Afghanistan has already accepted and ratified \n     in six international treaties. Afterward, the United States \n     must ensure the safety of reformers who want to speak out at \n     the loya jirga to ensure that the constitution of Afghanistan \n     makes possible a free and just society based on the rule of \n     law.\n       While respecting that Afghans should determine their own \n     future, United States officials must not let a ``hands off'' \n     policy lead to political conditions that will embolden \n     repression and enable a few to hijack the future from the \n     many Afghans who hope to embrace freedom.\n       After all, it is not just Afghanistan's future that is at \n     stake. Iraqis are watching to see what minimum standards of \n     individual rights will be acceptable to the United States. \n     Unfortunately, the message that the Afghan draft constitution \n     is giving Iraq is the wrong one. We should instead send our \n     own message to President Hamid Karzai, to Afghan officials \n     and to the Afghan people: Americans will only support a state \n     with a constitution that clearly and unequivocally enshrines \n     human rights and religious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12733-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12733-S12734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COST ESTIMATE FOR S. 300\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for \ndesignating the week of October 19-25, 2003 as National Childhood Lead \nPoisoning Prevention Week. S. Res. 243, the resolution making next week \nNational Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, was cosponsored by \n44 of my colleagues and passed the Senate last night by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The need to combat the severe threat of lead poisoning to our \nchildren's health has never been greater. It is estimated that 25 \nmillion homes nationwide have lead hazards. Many of those homes were \nbuilt before 1950, when paint contained as much as 50 percent lead. \nPeeling chips and dust from deteriorating lead-based paint is one of \nthe most common sources of childhood lead poisoning. According to the \nlatest national health estimates, nearly one-half of a million children \nunder the age of 6 suffer from lead poisoning, with these children 8 \ntimes more likely to come from low-income working families than wealthy \nfamilies.\n  Unfortunately, except for severely poisoned children, there is no \nmedical treatment for this disease. Even then, treatment may only \nreduce the level of lead present in the body, not reverse the harm \nalready caused. Research shows that children with elevated blood lead \nlevels are seven times more likely to drop our of high school and 6 \ntimes more likely to have reading disabilities. And it costs an average \nof $10,000 more a year to educate a lead poisoned child.\n  We need to find the will and the resources to eradicate childhood \nlead poisoning in this country. Designating the last full week in \nOctober as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week will help \nshine a light on this terrible problem, energize the Federal Government \ninto playing a more effective role, and improve local, State and \nFederal cooperation in the process. With concerted effort, we can \neliminate the tragedy of childhood lead poisoning so that no family in \nour country has to live in unsafe housing. I am committed to addressing \nthis crisis, and believe this resolution can encourage communities to \nfocus on solving the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12734-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

We are fortunate to have his direction and look \nforward to the considerable progress his tenure and administration \npromises to produce. I thank the Senate for allowing me to pay tribute \nto our newest Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12734-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MARYLAND WATERMEN'S ASSOCIATION\n\n   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the \nMaryland Watermen's Association which is celebrating its 30th \nanniversary this year. I have had the opportunity to work closely with \nthe MWA and its members over the years on a number of important \nissues--from improving our commercial harbors and historic seaports to \nrestoring oyster reefs in Chesapeake Bay--and I have great respect for \nthe men and women who make their living working Maryland's waters.\n  For many people, Maryland's watermen conjure up romantic images of \nsolitary oystermen sailing the Chesapeake Bay in skipjacks and \nharvesting the Bay's bounty. Their independent lifestyle in the \noutdoors represents a significant part of the culture of the Chesapeake \nBay. But a Maryland waterman's life is not easy. It is arduous work \nharvesting crabs, clams, oysters and charter fishing. Watermen are \ndependent upon good weather and when storms prevent harvesting, there \nis no paycheck. Watermen also depend upon pollution-free water and \ndisease-free finfish and shellfish. The number of licensed, active \nwatermen has decreased by over 2,000 in 30 years. These stark realities \nmake Maryland's watermen strong and persistent advocates for the \nrestoration of Chesapeake Bay.\n  Representing the independent and hardworking watermen is no easy task \nparticularly in these times when their way of life is buffeted by so \nmany forces. However, since it was first established in 1973, the \nMaryland Watermen's Association has done a great job of representing \nthe interests of commercial watermen to the Maryland General Assembly \nand our congressional delegation. Under the leadership of Larry Simns, \nits president since 1973, and Betty Duty, its administrator, the \nassociation has been a forceful and effective advocate for Maryland's \ncommercial finfish and shellfish industries.\n  I extend an invitation for all to attend Chesapeake Appreciation \nDays, to be held at Sandy Point State Park, Saturday and Sunday, \nNovember 1 and 2. This celebration of the Chesapeake Bay and the \nwatermen who depend upon it is sponsored by the Maryland Watermen's \nAssociation. Chesapeake Appreciation Days is an excellent opportunity \nfor everyone to see exhibits and events which will teach about the \nBay's importance to all of us. It is a terrific way to gain an \nappreciation of the hard working members of the Maryland Watermen's \nAssociation over the last 30 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12734-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12734-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12734-S12735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S12735]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12734-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12734-S12735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S12735]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12735-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1092.

A bill to amend the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund \nof 2001 (Public Law 107-42; 49 U.S.C. 40101 note) to provide \ncompensation for the United States Citizens who were victims of a \nterrorist-related laboratory-confirmed anthrax infection in the United \nStates during the period beginning on September 13, 2001, through \nNovember 30, 2001, on the same basis as compensation is provided to \nvictims of the terrorist-related aircraft crashes on September 11, \n2001; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom South Dakota and Democratic leader. I thank him for his concern \nand his work on this issue.\n  Two years have passed since several anthrax letters were sent to a \nfew journalists and, obviously, to public officials, killing \ninadvertent victims. These are victims whose only sin, apparently, was \ndoing their jobs, and these attacks have left several other people sick \nand out of work.\n  The Senate and all who work here--the Senate family--are still \nadjusting to the aftermath of these attacks 2 years later. We see it in \nnew layers of security. We see it in new mail-handling procedures in \nwhich mail to Capitol Hill now is screened and irradiated before it is \ndelivered.\n  The U.S. Postal Service has had to develop and implement new safety \nmeasures to protect its customers and its workers. Meanwhile, nearly \ntwo dozen of our fellow Americans who merely came into contact with \nthese anthrax-laden letters have become the forgotten victims of \nterror. Some have suffered poor health, and some have not been able to \nreturn to work.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Daschle and my other good friends, \nSenators Lautenberg, Nelson of Florida, Feingold, Corzine, Mikulski, \nSarbanes, and Clinton, to introduce the Anthrax Victims Fund Fairness \nAct of 2003. This will allow these forgotten victims of terror and \ntheir families to seek help through the September 11 Victims \nCompensation Fund.\n  They need this help to pay for medical expenses and to provide for \nthemselves and their families if they have been unable to return to \nwork. They are our fellow citizens, and they were unwittingly on the \nfront lines when our new, shadowy struggle against terrorism began.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, we learned that \nthe United States was not impervious to acts of terrorism of the kinds \nthat have rained death and destruction on other societies far away. The \nattacks shocked the world and left the American people with the \nterrible knowledge that we could once again become victims, targets of \nterrorists at any time.\n  Only a few days after September 11, our worst fears were confirmed. \nBetween September 22 and November 14, nearly two dozen Americans from \nfive States and the District of Columbia became casualties of a \nsinister bioterrorism attack. Twenty-two Americans ranging in age from \n7 months to 94 years were stricken in these attacks of anthrax. It is a \nrare disease that had only afflicted a handful of Americans in the last \ncentury. We would ultimately learn that 11 people had been infected \nwith cutaneous or skin anthrax, and 11 contracted the more serious form \nof the disease called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Five of our \nfellow Americans died from these attacks.\n  The victims of the anthrax attacks vary in gender, race, religion, \nage, economic status, and locale. But they all have one thing in \ncommon: Everyone suffered. The targets were members of the news media, \nand two Members of the Senate, myself and Senator Daschle, but the \nvictims--not the targets, but the victims--who suffered the most were \nemployees of the U.S. Postal Service, the Department of State, news \norganizations, the Senate, and the aides, the children, and the senior \ncitizens whose mail came in contact with the anthrax-laden letters.\n  In the fall of 2001, I worked with Speaker Hastert, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Lott, Congressman Gephardt, Senators Hatch, Kohl, DeWine, \nSchumer, and Clinton to establish the September 11 Victims Compensation \nFund of 2001. This fund ensured that victims of the September 11 \nattacks would be eligible for compensation for the horrific losses they \nsuffered. After extensive negotiations with the Bush administration, we \nestablished the September 11 fund to provide victims an alternative to \nwhat would have been a lengthy battle in court.\n  Under the stewardship of Ken Feinberg, the Special Master of the \nSeptember 11 Victim Compensation Fund, and with the supervision of the \nDepartment of Justice, more than 1,000 of the 3,016 families of those \nwho died in the September 11 attacks and more than 1,000 of the unknown \nnumber who were injured have filed claims.\n  The fund, which has no cap, had paid out $633 million by September \n10, 2003, with an average award of about $1.6 million for death claims. \nIt is a dignified way of doing it.\n  As we reach the 2-year anniversary of the anthrax attacks, Congress \nshould do the same for those whose lives were harmed by these acts of \nbioterrorism\n\n[[Page S12740]]\n\nas we did for the victims of September 11. While we have taken \nsignificant steps to compensate the victims of the September 11 attacks \nand their families, no such action has been taken on behalf of the \nanthrax victims. Our legislation would remedy this.\n  Our bill would extend the deadline for filing claims with the fund by \na year and expand the eligibility to include laboratory-confirmed \nanthrax tests.\n  As we reach the two-year anniversary of the anthrax attacks, Congress \nshould do the same for those whose lives were harmed by these acts of \nbioterrorism as it did for the victims of September 11, 2001. While we \nhave taken significant steps to compensate the victims of the September \n11 attacks and their families, no such action has been taken on behalf \nof the anthrax victims. Our legislation would remedy this.\n  Our bill would extend the deadline for filing claims with the fund by \n1-year and expand the eligibility to include laboratory-confirmed \nanthrax cases.\n  The Centers for Disease Control, CDC, have confirmed 18 anthrax \ninfections, and an additional four are considered to have been \nconfirmed through other methods. Applicants would be subject to the \nsame criteria and restrictions as were set for the September 11 \nvictims. Eligible individuals who choose to file claims would then be \nconsidered by the Special Master who would make a final determination \non level of compensation within 120 days of receiving the claim. \nCompensation will be targeted to help the neediest victims and their \nfamilies. Any life insurance, death benefit, or other Government \npayment previously received by victims and their families would be \ntaken into account, and filing a claim would preclude other civil \nremedies.\n  Yesterday marked the 2-year anniversary of the opening of the letter \nthat spread anthrax throughout the Hart Senate Office Building, \nexposing 31 Senate employees to a highly potent and aerosolized form of \nanthrax and shutting down the Dirksen Senate Office Building for 2 \nweeks, the Hart Senate Office Building for 3 months and briefly closing \nthe United States Capitol, the symbol of democracy. Our staffs were \nfortunate to receive excellent care and guidance from the Sergeant at \nArms, the CDC, the attending physician, his dedicated staff of men and \nwomen and the Environmental Protection Agency, and none of the \nemployees of the Senate were ultimately infected. Those days are \nindelibly etched in our memories.\n  To this day--and this is the first time I have ever spoken on the \nfloor about the anthrax attack. I have to be honest, it is something \nthat has been on my mind, on the mind of my wife, our children, our \nfamilies, ever since that day.\n  Senator Daschle and I do not know what motivates somebody to target \nus and to endanger our staffs and so many others. Senator Daschle and I \nwere the targets of the Senate letters, but we were not stricken with \nanthrax, and we have made very clear that we would not be covered by \nthe terms of this legislation.\n  We will never know why we were singled out, but we do know what \nhappened to people who were totally innocent. The letters were not \naddressed to them as they were to us.\n  Eighteen of the victims were not as fortunate as were most of us in \nthe Senate family. While some did recover after receiving antibiotics, \nothers have had their lives changed forever. Some are stricken with \nailments, such as post-traumatic stress, depression and fatigue. They \ncontinue to suffer from the after-effects of the disease.\n  One postal worker who was infected with anthrax filed a $100 million \nsuit against the U.S. Postal Service in January 2003. He did not want \nto have to take his case to court, but he says he felt he had to after \nrepeated attempts to receive compensation and assistance in treating \nhis illness. Last month, on September 24, the widow of the first \nanthrax victim in Florida filed lawsuits seeking more than $50 million \nand alleging that insufficient security at the Army Medical Research \nInstitute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, MD, and negligent \nactions by companies with military contracts, caused her husband's \ndeath. This bill would help these and other victims without forcing \nthem to take their cases to the legal system.\n  The perpetrator or perpetrators of these acts of terrorism remain at \nlarge. I have no idea who directed these letters to Senator Daschle and \nmyself. The F.B.I. continues its search. These victims cannot wait \nuntil the search is over. They deserve help now and we owe it to them \nto provide it.\n  Yesterday I joined with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, both \nSenators from New York, and with others in introducing separate \nlegislation to extend and broaden the fund's coverage to cover the \nvictims of the 1993 World Trade Center attacks, the 1998 East African \nembassy attacks and the 2000 U.S.S. Cole attacks. I applaud Senator \nSpecter for his leadership in this area. All Americans who have been \nvictimized by acts of terrorism deserve our sympathy, our respect and \nour support.\n  Our hearts went out to the victims of these acts of terrorism and to \ntheir loved ones. Now they also need our help, and it is my hope that \nwe will do the right thing by these victims of terrorism.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 2 years ago, a letter containing about 1 \ngram of highly concentrated anthrax was opened in my office in the Hart \nSenate Office Building. Potentially deadly anthrax letters were also \nmailed, apparently by the same person or persons, to my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Patrick Leahy, and to several news organizations. \nTwo years later, all of those crimes remain unsolved.\n  The anthrax attack on the Senate remains the largest bioterrorism \nattack ever on U.S. soil. Here in the Senate my staff and members of \nSenator Feingold's staff were exposed to up to 3,000 times the lethal \ndose of anthrax.\n  The entire Hart Senate Office Building was closed for 3 months while \nscientists searched for a way to do something that had never been done \nbefore: To reclaim a building that had been badly contaminated by \nanthrax.\n  We all remember those times. Coming less than 5 weeks after the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, the anthrax attacks of 2001 sometimes \nmade it seem as if none of us was safe anywhere.\n  As traumatic as the anthrax attacks were for the people of Capitol \nHill, we were actually the fortunate ones. Before those deadly letters \narrived in the Senate, they traveled through the U.S. mail where they \nleft a deadly trail.\n  Five innocent people died and still more innocent people suffer today \nfrom serious health and debilitating problems resulting from their \nexposure to the anthrax letters. All too often, they are the forgotten \nvictims of the anthrax attacks on America. They are victims of \nterrorism, just as surely as are all of those who were killed or \ninjured in the September 11 terrorist attacks on America. This bill \nthat Senator Leahy are I are introducing today acknowledges that fact \nby allowing the victims of the anthrax attacks to participate in the \nSeptember 11 Victims Compensation Fund.\n  The rules for anthrax victims would be the same as the rules for \nvictims of the September 11 attacks: Before they can receive any \ncompensation from the fund, anthrax victims must first waive their \nright to file or participate in any lawsuit in State or Federal court \nfor damages relating to the anthrax attacks.\n  The legislation that my colleague and I are introducing today, and \nthat I am very proud to cosponsor, is narrow and specific: Only persons \nwho were exposed to anthrax during the attacks of 2001 and who have \nbeen diagnosed with a ``laboratory-confirmed anthrax infection'' may be \ncompensated from the fund. A ``laboratory-confirmed'' case may include \none in which elevated anthrax antibody levels are present, even if the \nanthrax bacteria cannot be detected. In at least one case, the anthrax \ndiagnosis was made late when, after introduction of antibiotics, the \nactual bacteria was no longer detectable in the bloodstream. In such \ncases, the highly elevated anthrax antibody levels confirm both the \nexposure and the diagnosis.\n  Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen worked for the U.S. Postal Service. \nThey were decent, hard-working men who pushed themselves and continued \nto go to work and church even as anthrax infections were killing them. \nThey and Robert Stevens, Kathy Nguyen, and Ottilie Lundgren all lost \ntheir lives in the anthrax attacks.\n\n[[Page S12741]]\n\nTheir families have suffered a devastating blow. This bill would allow \nthem to receive some small compensation for their losses without having \nto suffer through the additional trauma and long delays associated with \na lawsuit.\n  Leroy Richmond, Norma Wallace, and Ernesto Blanco should be spared a \nlong and difficult legal ordeal, too. They and others who suffered \nlaboratory-confirmed anthrax infections as a result of the 2001 attacks \ndeserve justice. They deserve the opportunity to participate in the \nsame compensation fund as the victims of September 11, as long as they \nare willing to abide by the same rules. This bill gives them that \nright, that option, if they choose to exercise it.\n  After that letter was opened in my office, the Senate put in place \nnew mail-screening procedures to prevent another similar attack on the \nCapitol complex. Nearly 2 years later, we no longer have to worry that \nterrorism can slip in here through the mail. Some days we even forget \nabout the anthrax attacks. But there are victims and victims' families \nwho cannot forget. The anthrax attacks of 2001 still haunt them every \nday. This bill will not restore their strength or return their loved \nones, but it will give them a small measure of compensation and perhaps \na small measure of peace. It will say clearly that whether it happens \nin September, October, or any other month, terrorism is terrorism and \nhere in America its victims will not have to suffer alone.\n  I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Leahy, with whom I have been \nworking on this bill now for nearly 2 years, for his remarkable \ncommitment to this cause. I urge all of our colleagues to join us in \nseeking justice for these forgotten victims of terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1742. A bill to amend title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nto provide for variable interest rates on student loans; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwould change the student borrower interest rate structure by continuing \nor establishing variable rates for all student loans on a going-forward \nbasis. More specifically, it would tie all future loan interest rates \nfor student loan borrowers to the bond equivalent rate for 91-day \nTreasury bills and would cap the loans at 7.75 percent. PLUS loans \nwould be capped at 8.5 percent.\n  Briefly, variable rates for all student loan borrowers would provide \nthe following: They will automatically ``refinance'' outstanding loans \nto current rates on a routine basis, thereby, avoiding the problems \nassociated with the refinancing of old loans under new rate structures. \nThey will mitigate the extraordinary costs to the Federal Government \ncurrently associated with the consolidation of student loans under a \nfixed rate structure. They will ensure that consolidation loans are \noffered to those borrowers who need them rather than as a loan of \nconvenience for those who no longer need Federal subsidies. They will \nallow savings which will ensure that Federal resources can be directed \nto those who have not yet had an opportunity to pursue or to complete \nan educational program thereby ensuring future access to higher \neducation. They will provide borrowers with the best rates available in \nthe market while also capping those rates to ensure that borrowers are \nnot adversely affected if rates rise beyond an acceptable level. And, \nthey will protect the Federal Treasury against extraordinary subsidies \nas interest rates rise above a preset fixed rate structure.\n  The Federal student loan programs have made it possible for millions \nof American students to attend college. The current program structure \nhas resulted in a highly reliable, low-cost source of funds for \nstudents and their families. But, the recent consolidation-\nreconsolidation loan situation shows that changes are needed.\n  The intent of the consolidation loan program was to provide an \nopportunity for borrowers with multiple loan holders and a high debt \nlevel to consolidate that debt with one holder and allow for a single \nmonthly payment. However, with recent interest rate drops, the number \nand volume of consolidation loans has increased dramatically. Some \nborrowers have consolidated their loans and locked in at a fixed rate \nonly to see the rates drop further and leave them with no way to access \nthe lower rates. And, recently, the well-publicized growth in the \nFederal consolidation loan program prompted the Congressional Budget \nOffice to project the estimated program costs for the current fiscal \nyear to triple from $3 billion to $9 billion.\n  There has been much talk about allowing borrowers to reconsolidate \ntheir loans at a lower rate. However, it appears that retroactive \nchanges to the law could undermine the predictability that makes it \npossible for lenders and investors to offer efficient pricing to \nstudents who need loans. Reconsolidation could diminish the quality and \nthe stability of the overall loan program which would hurt future \nstudent borrowers.\n  Currently, student loans, known as Stafford Loans, are payable on a \nvariable rate basis, a program feature that protects the Federal \nTreasury from sharp increases in costs. However, consolidation loans \nare made on a fixed rate basis, creating an incentive for borrowers to \n``consolidate'' their student loans even when they are not experiencing \nrepayment problems.\n  My legislation would prevent future borrowers from facing the \nsituation which confronts many of our borrowers today. It would \nestablish a variable interest rate and establish a reasonable cap on \nall student loans. It would level the playing field for future students \nand borrowers.\n  It appears clear that changes are needed.

A bill to prevent abuse of Government credit cards; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to help \ncurtail abuses of government-issued credit cards throughout the Federal \nGovernment. I am pleased to join Representative Wilson who is \nintroducing an identical measure in the House today and I thank him for \nhis interest and work on this important issue. I am also very glad to \nhave Senator Byrd co-sponsor my bill. He has been a staunch advocate \nfor improved management of government credit programs and I have been \nhonored to work with him on this issue in the past.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have been working for several \nyears to expose abuses of government purchase cards and travel cards, \nstarting with the largest user of government charge cards, the \nDepartment of Defense. Working with the GAO, former subcommittee \nChairman Horn in the House, and others, we have been able to uncover a \ndisturbing number of instances where DOD-issued credit cards have been \nabused. When I say abused, I mean government credit cards were used to \npay for everything from cars to Caribbean cruises. The list also \nincludes furniture, breast implants, and gentleman's clubs.\n  So what does all of this mean for the American taxpayer? In the case \nof government purchase cards, it means that hardworking Americans are \npaying for government employees' Christmas shopping. Purchase cards are \nintended to be used to purchase supplies or other items needed by a \ngovernment agency and are paid directly by the agency with taxpayer \nmoney. However, it is hard to justify payments on a sapphire ring, \nkitchen appliances, and gift certificates to department stores as \nnecessary office expenses. Astoundingly, these are examples of charges \nthat have been made and paid for out of the taxpayer's pocket with no \nquestions asked.\n  Government travel cards work differently, but are still subject to \nabuses that negatively impact the American public. They are issued to \nindividual employees for use on official travel. The employee must pay \nthe bill and is reimbursed by the agency. Unfortunately, government \ntravel cards are routinely issued to individuals who have a bad credit \nhistory or even a record of credit card fraud. This opens up the door \nfor abuse. Not only have travel cards been used for questionable travel \nexpenses, but travel cards have been used when employees are not on \nofficial travel to pay for items from gambling and prostitution to \ntickets for a pop music concert by the Backstreet Boys. Some employees \nhave committed fraud by repeatedly writing bad checks to pay travel \ncard bills and some have taken government funds in reimbursement for \ntravel expenses and not paid off their travel card bills.\n  When a travel card bill is not paid on time, the agency loses out on \nrebates that the agency would otherwise receive from the credit card \ncompany. These rebates add up. In fact, in fiscal year 2001, the \nFederal Government received $71 million in rebates, but this amount \ndeclined in fiscal year 2002 to $69.2 million mainly due to \ndelinquencies in paying off travel cards. We're talking real money and, \nespecially in a time of budgetary belt-tightening, this trend cannot be \nallowed to continue. In addition, since Bank of America took over the \nDOD charge card contract in 1998, it had to ``charge off'' over $61 \nmillion dollars in bad debt. The military service branches have \nrecovered less than $24 million of that amount, leaving almost $40 \nmillion in losses to the credit card company. In fact, the situation \ngot so bad that Bank of America considered dropping its account with \nDOD. Although actions by DOD to reduce delinquencies and recover bad \ndebt through methods like salary offsets have now improved the \nsituation somewhat, this scandal has left a black mark on the \nreputation of the Federal Government. Furthermore, these losses \ninflicted on credit card companies by Federal employees hurt the \nmillions of innocent Americans who are credit card customers by raising \nthe interest rates and fees the company must charge.\n\n  What we have learned through our investigation of the travel card and \npurchase card programs in the Department of Defense is that these \nabuses were allowed to occur as a result of weak internal controls. The \nrevelations about DOD sparked questions about the possibility of \nsimilar deficiencies in other departments. In fact, subsequent work \nwith the GAO and agency Inspectors General has uncovered weak internal \ncontrols in the travel card and purchase card programs of agencies like \nthe Department of Education, the Federal Aviation Administration, the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of the \nInterior, and the Department of Agriculture leading to wasteful and \nquestionable purchases with taxpayer dollars. We know about HUD \nemployees using agency purchase cards for personal shopping sprees at \nstores like Best Buy and JC Penny, FAA employees purchasing individual \nsubscriptions to Internet providers and gift cards from Home Depot, and \nDepartment of Agriculture employees using travel cards to buy a car and \nenroll in bartending school. The list goes on.\n\n[[Page S12743]]\n\n  Clearly, this is a problem that needs to be addressed government-\nwide. Ideally, Federal agencies would get their own houses in order. \nUnfortunately, the atrocious abuses that have been uncovered in the \ncharge card programs of agency after agency would likely never have \ncome to light without congressional oversight. In fact, the positive \ndevelopments we have seen so far in curtailing government credit card \nabuses have been the result of Congress cajoling the bureaucracy to put \ncontrols in place. The bill I am introducing today would require all \nagencies to promulgate regulations to establish safeguards and internal \ncontrols to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of Federal purchase cards \nand travel cards.\n  The GAO has now issued an Audit Guide for auditing and investigating \nthe internal control of government purchase card programs, which it \ndeveloped based on its experiences auditing various agencies purchase \ncard programs. This excellent guide outlines five standards for \ninternal control to curtail fraudulent, improper, and abusive \npurchases. These include: establishing a positive control environment \namong agency management and employees, providing for a risk assessment, \nimplementing control activities to enforce management directives and \nhelp ensure actions are taken to reduce risks, recording and \ncommunicating information to program managers and others who need it, \nand ongoing monitoring. My bill would go a long way to push agencies \ntoward the effective management approach GAO has outlined.\n  In fact, my bill requires agencies to establish policies for purchase \ncard programs, and travel card programs where applicable, that \nincorporate many of the specific recommendations GAO has made to \nvarious agencies as a result of its investigations. These include: \ntraining for cardholders as well as approving officials and agency \nprogram coordinators, establishing who is eligible to be a cardholder \nand limits on how much they can charge, limiting the number of cards \ndistributed to those who really need them, establishing requirements \nfor documentation and records to support each purchase, cancelling \ncards for employees who leave or transfer, and establishing penalties \nto hold card holders and approving officials accountable for misuse.\n\n  My bill also requires that credit checks be performed before issuing \na government charge card and that no one found to be not creditworthy \nbe issued a government credit card. In my opinion, it is absurb that \nthis is not standard practice. Government employees who could never get \na private credit card due to bad credit, bankrupty, or history of fraud \nwill no longer be handed a government charge card with no questions \nasked.\n  Finally, my bill would provide that the each agency Inspector General \nwill periodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase card and \ntravel card programs and perform periodic audits to identify potential \nfraudulent, improper, and abusive use of cards. We have had great \nsuccess working with Inspectors General using techniques like data \nmining to reveal instances of improper use of government charge cards. \nThe information continually provided to the head of each executive \nagency as well as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nand the Comptroller General by each agency IG will be an enormous help \nin strengthening and maintaining a rigious system of internal controls \nto prevent future instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with government \ncharge cards.\n  Due to aggressive congressional oversight and the efforts of talented \ninvestigators working for the GAO and agency IG's, we now know that \nweak internal control over agency purchase and travel card programs has \nlead to waste, fraud, and abuse across the Federal Government. It has \ncome to the point that Congress must intervene to require agencies to \nput in place the policies and procedures necessary to stop the misuse \nof taxpayer dollars and the abuse of the public trust. I wish I could \nsay this bill is a silver bullet and that once enacted, all the \nproblems with government credit cards will disappear, but I don't \npretend this is the case. Ultimately, it is up to agency officials and \nprogram managers to implement best practices for managing purchase card \nand travel card programs. To that end, I would encourage all agencies \nto take a close look at the GAO Audit Guide and use its approach. \nMeanwhile, continued congressional oversight will still be necessary. \nNevertheless, my bill will serve to kick-start the bureaucracy into \ntaking this problem seriously and I believe it will be a big step \ntoward putting the lid back on the Federal cookie jar. I know many of \nmy colleagues are equally appalled by the many tales of credit card \nfraud and abuse perpetrated on the American public and I would urge \nsenators to join me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate a Prisoner of War/Missing in Action \nNational Memorial at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, \nCalifornia; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Prisoner of \nWar/Missing in Action National Memorial Act of 2003. This bill would \ndesignate the POW/MIA memorial currently being built at Riverside \nNational Cemetery in California as the National POW/MIA Memorial. This \nmonument would be a memorial to all members of the Armed Forces who \nhave been held as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action.\n  We should always remember and pay tribute to the men and women who \nare fighting for our Nation now and have fought for our Nation in the \npast, including those who have never returned home. Over 89,000 members \nof the Armed Forces have been listed as missing since the American \nRevolution.\n  The families of these missing men and women have had to try to go on \nwith their lives without ever knowing what happened. Many of them have \nbeen unable to grieve for their loved ones as they typically would, and \nmany of them have been unable to have a proper burial. The families of \nour missing in action across the country should know that their nation \nremembers their loved one, and honors them by dedicating this national \nmemorial in Riverside, CA.\n  In addition to the missing soldiers, airmen, sailors, and others, \nthere have been over 586,000 members of the Armed Forces who have been \ntaken\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n\nprisoner since the American Revolution. In the 20th Century alone, \nthere were over 142,000 Americans taken as prisoners of war.\n  I would like to thank Congressman Ken Calvert, who introduced the \nHouse version of this bill in May. I commend him for his leadership in \nhonoring Americans missing in action and taken as prisoners of war.\n  There is no national memorial for both POWs and MIAs; there is not \neven a statue dedicated to their memory. It is time that the United \nStates recognize the sacrifice that these American POWs and MIAs have \nmade, and designate the memorial at the Riverside National Cemetery as \nthe National POW/MIA Memorial.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1747. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprovide for the regulation of all contact lenses as medical devices, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, to introduce an important piece of \nlegislation, which will help protect the health of contact lens \nwearers, by ensuring that all contact lenses satisfy the same \nregulatory requirements for approval.\n  Currently, non-corrective contact lenses, such as decorative lenses \nthat change eye color or have some design on them, are regulated under \nthe Food and Drug Administration's cosmetic authority. The problem is \nthis. The FDA does not review cosmetics for safety or effectiveness \nbefore they are sold to the public. This means that the FDA cannot \nrequire manufacturers to test non-corrective lenses for safety \nproblems, cannot set ``good manufacturing practices,'' and cannot even \nrequire that these lenses carry directions for safe use. This lack of \nFDA review and lack of established safety standards can lead to the \nmarketing of lenses that are neither safe nor suitable for wearing.\n  An article in the most recent issue of the medical journal Eye & \nContact Lens describes the cases of six people injured by the sale of \nunregulated colored contact lenses. As the article points out, four of \nthe six patients reside in the greater Cleveland area. This obviously \nconcerns me. But what concerns me more is that three of the five female \npatients were teenagers.\n  One such case involved a teenage girl from Cleveland who bought \ncolored contact lenses from a video rental store for the purpose of \nmatching her eyes with her dress. The lenses were sold without fitting \nor instructions. Prior to putting these lenses in her eyes, she had no \nprevious problems with her vision and had never worn contact lenses.\n  Shortly after wearing the colored contact lenses, she was urgently \nadmitted to a Cleveland hospital where it was determined that the \nvision in her left eye had become so poor that she could only make out \nhand motions. She stayed in the ICU for four days because that was the \nonly place where she could receive the treatment necessary for her eye. \nWorse yet, her doctor feared that she would not only lose her sight, \nbut that she might actually lose her eye.\n  In an effort to restore vision, her doctor recommended a corneal \ntransplant, which she underwent. Nearly two years after the infection \nstarted, her vision has not been fully restored. For the rest of her \nlife, this young girl will be at risk for rejection of the transplant, \ncataracts and glaucoma.\n  This type of injury can be prevented. The bill that Senator Kennedy \nand I are introducing today would allow non-corrective lenses to be \nreviewed before they are marketed and before they are accessible to \nyoung people. This bill, which has the endorsement of leading \norganizations in eye care--representing thousands of health care \nprofessionals and consumers and the contact lens industry--would \nclarify that all contact lenses are devices and are to be approved \nunder the FDA's device authority. Applying the medical device \nrequirements across-the-board to all contact lens manufacturers and \ndistributors would help ensure that all companies are held to the same \nimportant safety standards.\n  Our bill would be a positive step forward in helping to prevent \nunnecessary eye injuries. I urge my colleagues to support passage of \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1747\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) All contact lenses have significant effects on the eye \n     and pose serious potential health risks if improperly \n     manufactured or used without appropriate involvement of a \n     qualified eye care professional.\n       (2) Most contact lenses currently marketed in the United \n     States, including certain plano and decorative contact \n     lenses, have been approved as medical devices pursuant to \n     premarket approval applications or cleared pursuant to \n     premarket notifications by the Food and Drug Administration \n     (``FDA'').\n       (3) FDA has asserted medical device jurisdiction over most \n     corrective and noncorrective contact lenses as medical \n     devices currently marketed in the United States, including \n     certain plano and decorative contact lenses, so as to require \n     approval pursuant to premarket approval applications or \n     clearance pursuant to premarket notifications.\n       (4) All contact lenses can present risks if used without \n     the supervision of a qualified eye care professional. Eye \n     injuries in children and other consumers have been reported \n     for contact lenses that are regulated by FDA as medical \n     devices primarily when used without professional involvement, \n     and noncorrective contact lenses sold without approval or \n     clearance as medical devices have caused eye injuries in \n     children.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATION OF CERTAIN ARTICLES AS MEDICAL DEVICES.\n\n       Section 520 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 360j) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     subsection:\n\n                ``Regulation of Contact Lens as Devices\n\n       ``(n)(1) All contact lenses shall be deemed to be devices \n     under section 201(h).\n       ``(2) Paragraph 1 shall not be construed as having any \n     legal effect on any article that is not described in that \n     paragraph.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 1748. A bill to establish a program to award grants to improve and \nmaintain sites honoring Presidents of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Durbin \nand Senator Voinovich to introduce the Presidential Sites Improvement \nAct of 2003. This legislation would honor the great men that have \nserved as our former Chief Executives and have influenced the \ndevelopment of our great Nation. This act would create a new and \ninnovative partnership with public and private entities to preserve and \nmaintain Presidential sites, such as birthplaces, homes, memorials, and \ntombs. Preserving this heritage is vital to enabling our children and \ngrandchildren to learn about the leadership and infinite wisdom of our \npast Presidents.\n  We often forget that the best learning tool is that which a child can \ntouch, see, and relate. When a child boards a bus for a field trip to \nvisit historic sites, that is truly when hands-on learning takes place. \nVisiting the birthplace or home of the same individuals they heard \nabout or read about in the classroom provides a completely different \natmosphere to appreciate history. This learning can continue only \nthrough the preservation of the birthplaces, homes, memorials, and \ntombs of our former Presidents.\n  Family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, historical \nsocieties, historic preservation organizations, and other non-profit \norganizations own the majority of these sites. These entities often \nhave little funding and are unable to meet the demands of maintaining \nsuch important sites. Operating costs must be met before maintenance \nneeds, and slowly the sites deteriorate.\n  I have visited many of the Presidential historic sites throughout my \nhome State of Ohio--a state that has been home to eight Presidents. \nDuring one such visit at the Ulysses S. Grant house, I found it very \ndisturbing to see the discoloration and falling plaster due to water \ndamage. At the home of President Warren Harding, the famous front porch \nwhere then candidate Harding gave his campaign speeches actually began \nto pull away from the house. Fortunately, we were able to obtain\n\n[[Page S12746]]\n\nthe funding to prevent these two historic treasures from deteriorating \nfurther. However, by providing Federal assistance for maintenance \nprojects today, we can help prevent larger maintenance problems \ntomorrow.\n  These Presidential sites are far too important to let them slowly \ndecay. My legislation would authorize grants, administered by the \nNational Park Service, for maintenance and improvement projects on \nPresidential sites that are not federally owned or managed. A portion \nof the funds would be set aside for sites that are in need of emergency \nassistance. To administer this new program, this legislation would \nestablish a five-member committee, including the Director of the \nNational Park Service, a member of the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation, and a State historic preservation officer. This committee \nwould make grant recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior. Each \ngrant would require that half of the funds come from non-Federal \nsources. Up to $5 million would be made available annually.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in support of this legislation, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1748\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Sites \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are many sites honoring Presidents located \n     throughout the United States, including Presidential \n     birthplaces, homes, museums, burial sites, and tombs;\n       (2) most of the sites are owned, operated, and maintained \n     by non-Federal entities such as State and local agencies, \n     family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, \n     historical societies, historic preservation organizations, \n     and other nonprofit organizations;\n       (3) Presidential sites are often expensive to maintain;\n       (4) many Presidential sites are in need of capital, \n     technological, and interpretive display improvements for \n     which funding is insufficient or unavailable; and\n       (5) to promote understanding of the history of the United \n     States by recognizing and preserving historic sites linked to \n     Presidents of the United States, the Federal Government \n     should provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of \n     Presidential sites.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend various provisions of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act to relief for victims of identity theft, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are faced today with one of the \nfastest growing crimes in America, identity theft. Recent estimates \nplace the number of new identity theft victims at approximately 7 \nmillion in a single 12 month period--nearly 800 new victims per hour. \nAnother study found that victims spend an average of 600 hours \nrecovering from identity theft crimes, sometimes spanning several \nyears. Only three years ago, the average time spent addressing identity \ntheft was 175 hours. In addition to the lost time, victims spend an \naverage of $1,400 in their efforts to rectify the damage inflicted by \nidentity thieves. Identity theft is one crime for which the victims are \nvirtually on their own to resolve.\n  In most States, the burden is on the one harmed--and the only method \nby which an individual can attempt to repair their good name and credit \nis by pursuing civil action against creditors and debt collectors. \nToday, I will introduce PITFALL, the Prevent Identity\n\n[[Page S12747]]\n\nTheft From Affecting Lives and Livelihoods Act of 2003. PITFALL \naddresses identity theft after the fact--to help victims after the harm \nis inflicted.\n  The overriding goal of the legislation is to prevent creditors and \ndebt collectors, when existing laws fail to protect identity theft \nvictims, from harassing victims and further sabotaging their financial \nwell-being once a State's highest law enforcement officer has \nconclusively determined liabilities were fraudulently incurred, with no \nculpability on the part of the victim.\n  While there has been much discussion and action aimed at preventing \nidentity theft, it is time to focus on those individuals for which \nprevention is too late. Please join me in this effort to remove the \nburden from innocent victims in restoring peace and financial security \nto their lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1750. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and the \nRichard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to improve the nutrition \nand health of children in the United States; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill of \nsignificant importance to our Nation's health: The Better Eating for \nBetter Living Act of 2003.\n  Today, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes are responsible \nfor two-thirds of the deaths in the United States. The major risk \nfactors for these diseases and conditions are established in childhood \nthrough unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, obesity, and \ntobacco use. Obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in \nadolescents over the last 2 decades. Today 1 in 7 young people are \nobese and 1 in 3 are overweight. This is not a problem. This is a \ncrisis with potentially dire consequences that demands our immediate \nattention.\n  Obese children are twice as likely as non-obese children to become \nobese adults. Overweightness and obesity can result in physical, \npsychological, and social consequences, including heart disease, \ndiabetes, cancer, depression, decreased self-esteem, and \ndiscrimination. Obesity is a complex multi-factorial disease that is \ndifficult to prevent but even more difficult to treat. Our best bet at \nimproving the lives of children who currently are obese and preventing \nmore from joining the ranks is to encourage environments that foster \nhealthy eating and activity in our communities, in our homes, and in \nour schools.\n  It is the need to improve the nutritional environment of our schools \nthat I want to address today. Our school breakfast and lunch programs \nwere originally designed to combat hunger in our nation. They have been \nand continue to be a vital component of the food security safety net. \nHowever, today we have another problem: obesity and overweight, and the \nchild nutrition programs need to be updated to meet the needs of our \ncurrent health challenges while maintaining their role securing healthy \nfood for all children.\n  Only 2 percent of children currently consume a diet that meets the \nfive main recommendations for a healthy diet from the USDA Food Guide \nPyramid. Three out of four high school students in the U.S. do not eat \nthe recommended 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day \nand 3 out of 4 children consume more saturated fat than it recommended \nin the dietary Guidelines for Americans. Although the school lunch and \nschool breakfast programs have made great strides in improving health \nby meeting these guidelines, our work in creating healthy school \nenvironments is not yet done.\n  Since obesity is a complex issue, stemming the tide will take a \nmyriad of interventions. I commend Senators Harkin, Leahy, Kohl, Dole, \nand others who have introduced bills that would improve the Child \nNutrition programs and the children and schools they serve while \npreserving its mission to provide nutritionally sound meals to the \nyoung people who need them.\n  Today I am introducing another bill vital to improving our children's \nhealth: The Better Eating for Better Living Bill. This bill has four \nkey components.\n  First, the bill increases the reimbursement rates for school lunch. \nSchool food service directors have been expected to improve the quality \nof their meals without any concurrent funding increase for years, and \nit's time that changes. An additional 10 cents per meal may not sound \nlike much but it will offer school food service directors significantly \ngreater flexibility in purchasing quality food including leaner meats, \nfresh vegetables, and fresh fruits.\n  Second, the bill requires the secretary of agriculture to evaluate \nthe nutrition guidelines for school meals every five years. The science \nof nutrition is a dynamic and rapidly changing field. Guidelines are \nappropriately based on the best science of the time but as that science \nevolves, so should the guidelines regulating school meals. Our children \ndeserve the benefit of the most current science. Thus, updates are to \nbe based on current and sound scientific evidence, current public \nhealth concerns, and cultural appropriateness.\n  Next the bill will liberalize the current milk guidelines so as to \nonly require schools to require low fat or no fat milk as is \nappropriate for school-age children. Schools would have the option of \nproviding other milk products so long as they are cost and \nnutritionally equivalent.\n  Finally, serving healthy food is an important first step, but \naccompanying that food with adequate nutrition education is vital to \ngrowing a generation of healthy eaters and active adults. Thus, the \nbill provides increased funding for nutrition education. Specifically, \nit would provide guaranteed funding at the state level for \nimplementation and administration of the Team Nutrition Program. This \nis a program that has existed in statute for years, but because its \nadministration has rarely been funded, it has not been implemented. It \nis time we commit to nutrition education as part of making a strong \ncommitment to our children's health and well-being.\n  Now is the time to take action toward improving the health and well-\nbeing of our nations' youth. Let us implement these vital advances in \nthe child nutrition program now while we are reauthorizing the Child \nNutrition Act. The cost of improving the health of our children will be \nfar less than the cost of the health consequences to come if we do \nnothing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the Nation;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of\n\n[[Page S12749]]\n\n     society, and, therefore, every adult has the responsibility \n     to teach and model ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week beginning October 19, 2003, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week'';

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       Sec.  . (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) That on October 7, 2001, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations \n     in Afghanistan, designated as Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     that quickly caused the collapse of the Taliban regime, the \n     elimination of Afghanistan's terrorist infrastructure and the \n     capture of significant and numerous members of Al Qaeda;\n       (2) That on March 19, 2003, the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and its coalition allies launched military operations, \n     designated as Operation Iraqi Freedom, that quickly caused \n     the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, the elimination of \n     Iraq's terrorist infrastructure, the end of Iraq's illicit \n     and illegal programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     and the capture of significant international terrorists;\n       (3) That success in those two campaigns in the Global War \n     on Terrorism would not have been possible without the \n     dedication, courage, and service of the members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and their coalition partners;\n       (4) That throughout the proud military history of our \n     nation, we have recognized our brave men and women of the \n     Armed Forces by awarding them service medals for personal \n     bravery and other leadership actions and for their service in \n     military operations abroad and for support operations at home \n     and abroad;\n       (5) That historically the President has relied on senior \n     military officers to recommend the personal and theater \n     campaign\n\n[[Page S12752]]\n\n     medals and that, in keeping with these longstanding \n     traditions, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant \n     commanders, including General Tommy Franks, U.S. Army, former \n     Commander of the United States Central Command, recommended \n     the awards described below in recognition of the worldwide \n     nature of the current conflict;\n       (6) That following the advice of his senior military and \n     civilian defense leaders, President Bush, by Executive Order \n     13289 on March 12, 2003, established the Global War on \n     Terrorism Expeditionary Medal to be awarded to service \n     members who serve in military operations to combat terrorism \n     on or after September 11, 2001, including, but not limited to \n     actions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom, in such locations as Afghanistan, Iraq, the Republic \n     of the Philippines, and elsewhere in Southwest Asia, in \n     recognition of the sacrifice and contributions military \n     members make in the global war on terrorism;\n       (7) That eligibility for the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal is predicated on deployment abroad for 30 \n     days or more in support of Global War on Terrorism operations \n     on or after September 11, 2001;\n       (8) That by the same Executive Order, the President \n     established the Global War on Terrorism Service Medical \n     recognizing duty in Operation Noble Eagle and the homeland \n     defense mission against further terrorist attacks, and which \n     recognizes duty in support of military operations performed \n     in areas that do not qualify for the Global War on Terrorism \n     Expeditionary Medal; and\n       (9) That implementing regulations for eligibility have not \n     been issued by Secretary of Defense.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on the Award of Campaign Medal.--It \n     is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should, on an expedited basis, issue the necessary \n     regulations to implement these awards and ensure that any \n     person who renders qualifying service with the Armed Forces \n     in those phases of the Global War on Terrorism including \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom; and \n     Operation Noble Eagle should promptly receive these awards.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1875.

Mr. NICKLES proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1689, \nmaking emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan \nsecurity and reconstruction for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2004, and for other purposes; as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) When Saddam Hussein came to power in the 1970's Iraq \n     was a prosperous county with no foreign debt and significant \n     foreign cash reserves.\n       (2) Iraq's reserves were exhausted during the Iran-Iraq War \n     in the 1980's and Iraq became a debtor nation.\n       (3) Today, the debts incurred by Saddam Hussein's regime \n     are estimated to be as much as $150,000,000,000.\n       (4) A process has been put in place that will establish a \n     new representative Iraqi government based on a democratic \n     political system with a free market economy. The goal is a \n     prosperous Iraq that is not a threat to its neighbors.\n       (5) For Iraq to be prosperous it must rebuild. In the near \n     term the United States and other donor countries will provide \n     grants to begin the process. In the longer term Iraq must be \n     able to fully participate in the international financial \n     system.\n       (6) It is impossible for Iraq to borrow funds in \n     international financial markets based on its existing debt. \n     Eliminating that debt will make possible Iraq's continued \n     rebuilding toward a prosperous and stable nation. A \n     prosperous nation is less likely to be a threat to its \n     neighbors and to be a breeding ground for terrorists. A \n     prosperous Iraq is more likely to be a positive force in the \n     region and participant in the world economy.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that all countries that \n     hold debt from loans to the former Iraqi regime of Saddam \n     Hussein should be urged to forgive their debt.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1877.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A coalition of allied countries led by the United \n     States entered Iraq on March 19, 2003, to liberate the people \n     of Iraq from the tyrannical rule of Saddam Hussein and the \n     Baathist party and to remove a threat to global security and \n     stability.\n       (2) Achieving stability in Iraq will require substantial \n     monetary investments to develop a secure environment and \n     improve the physical infrastructure.\n       (3) A stable and prosperous Iraq is important to the peace \n     and economic well-being of the Middle East region and to all \n     nations.\n       (4) As of October 2003, the United States has provided the \n     majority of the personnel and financial contributions to the \n     effort to rebuild Iraq.\n       (5) Congress fully supports the commitment required by the \n     United States to establish a stable economic, social, and \n     political environment in Iraq.\n       (6) The President is currently striving to increase global \n     participation in the effort to stabilize and reconstruct \n     Iraq.\n       (7) While the United States should aid the people of Iraq \n     during the critical time of transition between tyranny and \n     democracy, the participation of the people of Iraq in the \n     reconstruction effort is essential for the success of such \n     effort.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) make every effort to increase the level of financial \n     commitment from other nations to improve the physical, \n     political, economic, and social infrastructure of Iraq; and\n       (2) seek to provide aid from the United States to Iraq in a \n     manner that promotes economic growth in Iraq and limits the \n     long-term cost to taxpayers in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1878.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 245 which was \nsubmitted yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  A resolution (S. Res. 245) designating the week beginning October 19, \n2003, as National Character Counts Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator Dodd \nto introduce a resolution regarding ``National Character Counts Week.'' \nOur resolution says the week of October 19 of this year will be known \nacross the country as ``National Character Counts Week.''\n  Nearly a century ago President Theodore Roosevelt said the following \nabout character:\n\n       Character, in the long run, is the decisive factor in the \n     life of an individual and of nations alike.\n\n  I would submit that character truly does transcend time as well as \nreligious, cultural, political, and socio-economic barriers. I believe \nour country is having a renewed focus on character and this sends a \nwonderful message to Americans, and will help those of us involved in \ncharacter education reinvigorate our efforts to get communities and \nschools involved.\n  I say that because a number of years ago we started this approach to \ncharacter education called ``Character Counts.'' Senators Nunn, Dodd, \nand I first introduced the resolution that has now passed the Senate on \ninnumerable occasions. The resolution simply declares that for all of \nAmerica, one week during the year will be known as ``National Character \nCounts Week.''\n  Frankly, we hear a lot about how we should help our young people \ngrowing up in this often difficult society. However, I believe the key \nis finding those ideas and programs that work. We all understand that \nthere are certain people who have the primary responsibility to care \nfor our children like mothers, fathers, siblings, and grandparents. We \nare not in any way talking about negating that responsibility of \nraising a child with good values. However, we have found the teachers \nin our schools have been yearning for something they could teach our \nchildren that for some reason had been eliminated from both the public \nand private school agenda curriculum. It is sometimes referred to as \ncharacter education.\n  I choose to speak about the ``Character Counts'' program that is \nbeing used in many public schools in our country, and certainly in my \nState of New Mexico where teachers embrace six pillars of character. \nThe values comprising the six pillars are everyday concepts that \nAmericans across this land wish their children would have and hope \nAmerica will keep. They are simply: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. They transcend \npolitical and social barriers and are central to the ideals on which \nthis Nation was built.\n  As a matter of fact, I think they are central and basic to any nation \nthat survives for any long period of history. As Plato once said:\n\n       A country without character is a country that's doomed and \n     the only way a country can have character is if the \n     individual citizens in the country have character.\n\n  I could speak for hours about the 200,000 New Mexico schoolchildren \nin public, private and parochial schools learning about good character. \nAbout 90 percent of the grade school children, and a significant \nportion of the others, are now participating in character education \nprograms that simply and profoundly bring them into contact with each \nof these pillars one month at a time.\n  So if you walk the halls of a grade school in Albuquerque, you might \nsee a sign outside that says, ``This Is Responsibility Month.'' And all \nthe young people will be discussing the concept of responsibility in \ntheir classrooms, and they will put up posters saying, ``Responsibility \nCounts.'' At the end of that month they may have an assembly where \nresponsibility will be discussed by all the kids, and awards will be \ngiven to those demonstrating the most responsibility. The next month it \nmight be ``respect.'' The month after that it might be ``caring.''\n  I could go on for quite some time talking about Character Counts in \nNew Mexico. The bottom line is that I believe it is working in New \nMexico and other parts of the country. Consequently, I think we need to \nsalute the efforts already underway and encourage even more character \neducation across our country.\n  So today, Senator Dodd and I are here to introduce a resolution to \naccomplish just that and hopefully our renewed effort will bring \ntogether even more communities to ensure that character education is a \npart of every child's life.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, in introducing a resolution declaring \nnext week ``National Character Counts Week.'' Senator Domenici and I \nhave worked together for many years on the issue of character education \nand hope that by designating a special week to this cause, students and \nteachers will come together to participate in character building \nactivities in their schools. In 1994, Senator Domenici and I \nestablished the Partnerships in Character Education Pilot Project and \nhave worked regularly since then to commemorate National Character \nCounts Week. I am pleased that we are continuing our efforts today to \nhelp expand States' and schools' abilities to make character education \na central part of every child's education.\n  Our schools may be built with the bricks of English, math and \nscience, but character education certainly is the mortar. Character \neducation means teaching students about such qualities as caring, \ncitizenship, fairness, respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, and \nother qualifies that their community values.\n  Character education provides students a context within which to \nlearn. If we view education simply as the imparting of knowledge to our \nchildren, then we will not only miss an opportunity, but will \njeopardize our future. Character education isn't a separate subject, \nbut part of a seamless garment\n\n[[Page S12756]]\n\nof learning. Taking this to heart, teachers at Duffy Elementary School \nin West Hartford, Connecticut, have incorporated the fundamentals of \ncharacter education into their schoolwide curriculum so that every \nchild has the opportunity to focus on one aspect of character education \nin each garde. In turn, these learning opportunities have translated \ninto action within the community.\n  Philip R. Smith Elementary School in South Windsor, Connecticut, was \nrecently named a National School of Character by the Character \nEducation Partnership for demonstrating outstanding character education \ninitiatives that yield positive results in student behavior, school \nclimate and academic performance. Their schoolwide approach has also \ntranslated into a number of community wide service projects. Annually, \nstudents organize and run a blood drive for the community and sponsor a \ntwo-month long clothing and can food drive for the homeless. In \nresponse to 9/11, students raised close to $1,500 in change for the Red \nCross.\n  Mr. President, character education programs work. Schools across the \ncountry that have adopted strong character education programs report \nbetter student performance, fewer discipline problems, and increased \nstudent involvement within the community. Children want direction--they \nwant to be taught right from wrong. The American public wants character \neducation in our schools, too. Studies show that about 90 percent of \nAmericans support schools teaching character education.\n  As all education policy should be, character education is bipartisan. \nThis year we have 28 cosponsors to our resolution, cosponsors on both \nsides of the aisle. Character education is also actively supported by a \nnumber of national education and youth organizations including 4-H, \nBoys and Girls Clubs of America and the Little League. Character \neducation can and is being incorporated into children's lives in and \noutside of the classroom.\n  This measure provides a helping hand to our schools and communities \nto ensure those children's future are bright and filled with \nopportunities and success. Character education not only cultivates \nminds, it nurtures hearts. While our children may be one-quarter of our \npopulation, they are 100 percent of our future.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table and any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 245) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 245), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 245\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the Nation requires that the \n     young people of the United States become an involved, caring \n     citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the Nation;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values which form the foundation of democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those who have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Character Counts \n     Week, during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations would focus on character education, would \n     be of great benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week beginning October 19, 2003, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to--\n       (A) embrace the elements of character identified by local \n     schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/16/senate-section/article/S12756-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12756-S12759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WESTERN SHOSHONE CLAIMS DISTRIBUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
