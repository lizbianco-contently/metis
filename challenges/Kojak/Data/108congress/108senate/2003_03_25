Today's prayer will be given again by our \nguest Chaplain, Rev. Campbell Gillon, of Georgetown Presbyterian Church \nin Washington, DC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4333-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n                                 prayer\n\n  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:\n  Gracious Father, Thy word declares, ``Be still and know that I am \nGod.'' (Psalm 46) Teach us that prayer is more a matter of attitude \nthan audibility. Guide our praying as it seeks not to bend Thee to our \nwill, but us to Thine. Grant us that alert, focusing stillness before \nthe Divine which is the necessary precondition to sharing the \npsalmist's certainty that Thou art indeed our refuge and strength, an \never-present help in trouble.\n  O Lord, help in trouble is what so many need. In this time of \nconflict, we pray for all risking life and limb as they bravely face \nthe hazards of war in a liberating cause. We remember their loved ones \nand families as they strive to cope with their uncertainty and \nheartache mingled with supportiveness and pride as they fear the worst \nor face the worst. Give wisdom and guidance to those on whom the \nburdens of decision rest: the Commander-in-Chief, his advisors and \nmilitary leadership. May the result of their actions be a liberation of \nthe oppressed, a day of reckoning for evil and the beginning of a new \nchapter of peace in that region.\n  Lord God, these are challenging times. Bless and empower the men and \nwomen of this Senate as they daily face their heavy responsibilities \nfor the secure good of this great Nation. May they draw strength from \nbeing still before the Eternal and knowing that Thou art God. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4333-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Ted Stevens led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4333-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nwill be voting on amendments to the budget resolution this morning. The \nchairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee have exchanged \ncopies of the only amendments that remain in order.\n  We have a number of amendments to dispose of prior to a final vote on \nthis resolution. With the cooperation of all Members, we will be able \nto move through the remaining amendments in an efficient and orderly \nmanner. It would be helpful if Members would remain in the Chamber \nduring voting. I warn Members in advance that, following the first \nvote, the remaining votes will be limited to 10 minutes. The practice \nof 10-minute votes is to allow a grace period of 5 minutes, that is a \ntotal of 15 minutes, after which these votes will be terminated. We \nwill not extend a vote beyond that time, and thus Members should not \nstray far from the Chamber.\n  As a reminder, the order entered into last Friday is that the Senate \nwill proceed to a final vote on the budget resolution no later than 4 \np.m. on Wednesday. Therefore, I advise my colleagues that we have a lot \nof work before us over the course of today and tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise very proudly today on behalf of \nthe men and women who serve this great Nation as members of the \nNational Guard and the Reserve units in all of our 50 States. We have \nan opportunity today to put ourselves, and I hope each of my colleagues \nin the Chamber will put themselves, in the shoes of these proud men and \nwomen who serve our country from the National Guard and the Reserves, \nto understand what it means not only when they are called up but when \nthey are at home waiting to serve their country.\n  Well over 20 percent of the Reserve and National Guardsmen in this \ncountry do not have health insurance when they are called up to active \nduty. We have to spend a tremendous amount of money simply getting them \nto a health condition that actually allows us to activate them and send \nthem into harm's way.\n  I think it is essential that this amendment be passed. I am proud to \nbe joined by Senators Landrieu, Feingold, Pryor, Mikulski, and Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I do not think it is too much to ask of this great \nNation to find them health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote in \nopposition to this amendment. I understand from the Armed Services \nCommittee they are opposed to this amendment. This amendment portends \nthat it would increase funding for this particular purpose, but it does \nnot. All any amendment says is, for this one function, we will increase \nit.\n  The Armed Services Committee has not requested this. The President \nhas not requested this. As a former National Guardsman who served, one \ndoes not receive health care for basically serving one weekend a month. \nWhen they are activated, they receive health care services.\n  This function would increase spending, as well as taxes. The cost is \nan estimated $7,000 or $8,000 per year per guardsman or reservist. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote be limited to 10 \nminutes on all subsequent votes and that the 10 minutes be strictly \nenforced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 324. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I inquire from the Presiding Officer, how \nmuch time elapsed on that rollcall?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just for the information of our colleagues, we are going \nto be tightening down substantially. I don't want people coming up and \nbeing mad at Senator Conrad and myself or Senator Frist or Senator \nDaschle if they missed a vote, but we are going to start cutting off \nthese votes, just for your information.\n  I yield to my colleague to call up the next amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided on this amendment--for all of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is already provided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to Senator Baucus.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 348\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I call up amendment 348.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 348.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that a prescription drug benefit is available to \n   all medicare beneficiaries on an equal basis, including those who \n        choose to remain in the current fee-for-service program)\n\n       On page 61, line 12, insert ``on an equal basis with \n     respect to benefit level regardless of whether such \n     beneficiaries remain in the traditional medicare fee-for-\n     service program under parts A and B of such title or enroll \n     in a private plan under the medicare program'' after \n     ``prescription drugs''.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask I be notified when I have consumed 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The administration's drug plan essentially abandons the \n89 percent of senior citizens who are now on fee-for-service. How? By \nproviding that seniors who stay in fee-for-service get catastrophic \nbenefits and a discount card but they do not get additional drug \nbenefits. However, if you are a senior and enroll in managed care, you \nare going to get a drug benefit, therefore, forcing seniors out of fee-\nfor-service, into managed care.\n  I might add this will also not save money. The managed care programs \nwe have in our country are costing more than fee-for-service. They are \ncosting more than the Federal Employees Health Benefit package. And \nseniors are dropping out of managed care because they are not getting \nthe benefits they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I urge Members to vote for this amendment which provides \nall seniors get the same drug benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Budget Committee should not be trying to write the \nprescription drug bill. Our colleague from Montana is on the Finance \nCommittee. That is where this bill should be written.\n  I yield to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, obviously, like on so many issues, I \nhappen to agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle. But \nwhere do you make this decision? You don't make it on the Budget \nCommittee. You make it on the Finance Committee.\n  I am committed to having a drug benefit for all seniors. We developed \nsuch a bill last year, so we have the capability of doing it. We are \ngoing to do it this year. I do not want this decision made here. I do \nnot want to curb the freedom of the Finance Committee.\n  I argued the same point on an issue that friends on the other side of \nthe aisle would have agreed with me, on a Medicaid issue, that would \nhave been in this budget that is not in the budget.\n  Leave these issues to a committee of competence, the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have an additional minute, I believe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only had 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 348.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of our colleagues, I am going to try \nto tighten this down closer and closer to 10 minutes, and we are going \nto cut people off. I don't want people to be upset, but we are going to \nhave to do this. We made a commitment to plow through these amendments. \nI told our colleagues that is what we are going to do, and that is what \nwe are going to do. So I urge my colleagues to stay on the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 411\n\n                   (Purpose: To provide a substitute)\n\n  Mr. President, this next amendment is a very important amendment. It \nis the substitute proposal offered by my colleague, Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a whole substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 411.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4337]]\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a substitute amendment that has \n$1.2 trillion less in deficits than the President's plan. It also \nprovides the funding for the war supplemental. It provides for \nadditional funding for homeland security of $80 billion over the \nbaseline. It provides $194 billion of additional funding for \nprescription drugs, which is still well short of what would be needed \nto give Americans the kind of coverage we, as Members of Congress, \nhave. It provides $73 billion to keep the promise made by Congress to \nStates on funding for that program. It provides $71 billion for \ntransportation infrastructure, $13 billion for veterans, and balances \nin 2011, as compared to the underlying resolution of balancing in 2012, \nand the President's budget which never balances.\n  Colleagues, I urge you to support this substitute which is the \npriorities of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague for having a \nproposal. Last year, we did not get to vote on a Democrat alternative; \ntoday, we will. It greatly increases taxes and greatly increases \nspending.\n  I call upon my colleague from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Democrat substitute increases taxes by \n$1.24 trillion over 10 years relative to the budget assumptions. It \nincreases total spending by $113 billion in 2004 over the budget \nassumptions and by $458 billion over the 10 years.\n  I think there is a clear difference pointed out between our budget \nand this budget from a philosophical standpoint. There is only $60 \nbillion in a growth package allowed under this budget. I think this \nbudget does not provide for the economic growth we need to get this \neconomy going so there will be jobs for our military people when they \nget home. Our budget provides for that; their budget does not.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CORPORATE TAX HAVEN LOOPHOLES\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that companies are taking \n     advantage of loopholes in the United States tax code to \n     direct taxable income to tax haven jurisdictions, some of \n     which have excessive bank secrecy laws and a poor record of \n     cooperation with United States civil and criminal tax \n     enforcement.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should act to stop companies from avoiding \n     paying their fair share of United States taxes by--\n       (1) addressing the problem of corporations that have \n     renounced their United States citizenship (``inverted'') by \n     relocating their headquarters to tax haven jurisdictions \n     while maintaining their primary offices and production or \n     service facilities in the United States; and\n       (2) addressing the problem of Bermuda-based insurance \n     companies that are using reinsurance agreements with their \n     subsidiaries to direct property and casualty insurance \n     premiums out of the United States into Bermuda to reduce \n     their United States taxes in a way that places United States \n     property and casualty insurance companies at a competitive \n     disadvantage.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while young men and women are putting their \nlives on the line for us, for our country, some corporations are \nstiffing our country, renouncing their citizenship, going through phony \nreincorporations in Bermuda. There are other tax haven countries, so-\ncalled inverting themselves in order to avoid taxes. This is one of the \nmost egregious of all of the tax haven abuses that we know about--just \na shell headquarters being opened, but all of the benefits of living in \nAmerica continue.\n  These corporations continue to use our roads, use our law \nenforcement, use our education system, and so forth.\n  It is unfair to the taxpayers who are left holding the bag. It is \nunfair to U.S. competitors. It is something we ought to end. I hope we \nwill end it today with the adoption of this amendment, particularly at \na time when young American men and women are giving their all for us.\n  It is time for Congress to get serious about closing tax haven \nloopholes. This amendment is aimed at closing two of those loopholes \nthat would raise $4.7 billion over 10 years. It proposes that we take \nhalf of that $4.7 billion to reduce the deficit over 10 years and half \nto increase funding over 10 years for the following education \ninitiatives: one, special education; two, after-school programs; and \nthree, school construction and modernization grants.\n  First, we need to stop corporate inversions, and do it in a way that \nwill not permit those that started the inversion pretense to enjoy \nbillions in future tax benefits that will continue to disadvantage \ntheir U.S. competitors. The companies targeted by this measure are \nthose which have, in essence, pretended to move their headquarters to a \ntax haven when, in reality, their primary offices and production or \nservice facilities remain right here in the United States. By opening \nshell headquarters in a tax haven, companies that got their start in \nthis country, do most of their work here, and benefit from U.S. roads, \nbanks, patents, computers, law enforcement, fair trade laws, its \neducated workforce, and much more, avoid contributing their fair share \nto pay for those benefits. A bill I have introduced along with Senators \nReid, Durbin, and Kennedy is designed to stop this abusive practice. \nLast year, the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed an almost identical \nbill and estimated that it would raise $4 billion over 10 years.\n  Second, we need to close the Bermuda reinsurance tax loophole. \nUtilizing the U.S. tax code, a number of Bermuda-based property and \ncasualty insurance companies are placing American-owned property and \ncasualty insurance companies at a severe competitive disadvantage by \nducking U.S. taxes that U.S. insurers are required to pay. Through \nreinsurance agreements\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\nwith their subsidiaries, Bermuda insurance companies operating in the \nUnited States are using their U.S. subsidiaries to send U.S. insurance \npremiums out of this country and into Bermuda, where interest can be \nearned on the premiums tax-free. By sending the premiums offshore, the \nU.S. subsidiary of the Bermuda parent is able to reduce the amount of \nits income in the United states and, accordingly, reduce its U.S. \ntaxes. Comparable U.S.-owned insurance companies cannot operate in the \nsame way and, as a result, operate on an uneven playing field. \nLegislation has been developed to correct this inequity and level the \nplaying field for U.S. property and casualty insurers. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation last year estimated the bill seeking to close \nthis tax haven loophole would produce about $700 million over ten \nyears.\n  These are not the only tax haven abuses we need to address; there are \nothers. We need to eliminate tax breaks for U.S. taxpayers that do \nbusiness in uncooperative tax havens that fail, in the judgment of the \nU.S. government, to provide information needed in U.S. tax enforcement \nefforts. Since the 9/11 tragedy, the importance of financial \ntransparency and cooperative information exchange among international \nlaw enforcement agencies has increased, not only to fight money \nlaundering and other crimes, but also to understand financial \ntransactions that my involve tax evasion or other illegal conduct. But \na handful of tax haven jurisdictions continue to employ secrecy laws \nthat impede U.S. tax enforcement or provide lackadaisical or \nineffective responses to U.S. requests for information needed in \ncriminal and civil tax matters. Legislation has been developed that \nwould restrict the tax benefits that a U.S. taxpayer could claim from \nbusiness transacted in one of these uncooperative jurisdictions. This \nlegislation would produce not only new tax revenues, but also a \npowerful incentive for the targeted jurisdictions to reform their \nabusive policies. The funds that would be raised by such a provision \nare not included in the $4.7 billion at issue in this amendment due to \nour inability to obtain a timely revenue estimate, but this tax haven \nissue--and others like it--need to be addressed.\n\n  We should use half of the $4.7 billion that would be raised by \nclosing the inversion and Bermuda reinsurance loopholes to reduce the \ndeficit and increase our commitment to education, which has been \nunderfunded in this budget resolution. The budget resolution proposes \nfunding that is almost $10 billion below the 2004 amount authorized in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act, and includes funding levels that will \nreduce funding for after school centers and eliminate over 40 education \nprograms, including programs relating to rural education, school \ncounselors and teaching standards. It also would provide no funds for \nschool modernization and construction grants and reduced funding for \nTeacher Quality State Grants, resulting in fewer teachers receiving the \nhigh-quality training they need.\n  This amendment would increase education funding by over $2 billion \nover ten years, and proposes that the funds be evenly divided between \nspecial education programs, afterschool programs and school \nconstruction and modernization.\n  The increased funding for special education will help to ensure that \nmore students with disabilities get the public education they deserve, \nand that school districts will have additional funds to provide needed \nservices without dipping even further into their general education \nbudgets. School superintendents, school board members, teachers and \nparents in my state of Michigan and all across America have attested to \nthe fact that the shortfall in federal support has placed a severe \nstrain on local education budgets. It is clear that additional \nresources are necessary to help provide a quality education to all \nspecial needs children.\n  Additional funds are also necessary to support after-school programs. \nThe development of our nation's children does not start and end in our \nnation's classrooms. It is important to give all children safe, \nenriching environments in which they can spend their time when the \nschool day ends. Juvenile crime hits its peak after children leave \nschool and before their parents arrive home. Between 5 and 15 million \nchildren have nowhere to go after school. Research indicates that \nbetween the hours of 3 and 7 p.m., children are more likely to engage \nin at-risk behavior, including abusing drugs or alcohol or engaging in \nsexual activity, or become the victims of crime. 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers provide after school educational, recreational, \ncultural, health and social services to youth in many communities. The \nadditional funds in this amendment will help to ensure that we do not \nleave these children behind when the school day ends.\n  We also are faced with startling statistics about the state of \nAmerica's public school facilities. Record enrollments and growing \ncommunities are causing severe overcrowding in many public schools. The \naverage public school facility in America is over 40 years old. \nApproximately 46 percent of all public schools lack the electrical and \ncommunication wiring necessary to utilize today's computer systems and \nto prepare our children for today's technologically-based society. \nRecent surveys by the General Accounting Office and the National \nCouncil for Education Statistics, NCES, have placed cost estimates of \nschool construction needs between $112 billion to $127 billion. Sixty \nto 70 percent of Michigan's schools reported having six or more \ninsufficient technology elements. In this Congress and the last I \nsupported grants and school bond tax provisions for the construction, \nrehabilitation, or repair of school facilities. The additional funds \nthis amendment provides will help to ensure that no student is denied \naccess to the Internet because a school does not have the physical \ninfrastructure to use computers or other technology.\n  Support for this amendment indicates support for three things--\nclosing two egregious tax haven loopholes, increasing funding for \neducation, and paying down the deficit.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 341.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, March 20, 2003 \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, over the last \nseveral years we worked hard to make veterans eligible for the \nconcurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability benefits.\n  Under current law, most veterans, except those who were disabled as a \nresult of combat, are prevented from receiving the pay and benefits \nthey have rightly earned while serving this Nation. This is something \nthe Armed Services Committee, with Senators Warner and Levin, worked on \nwith me last year, and we got this done. It was a big step forward, but \nwe need to do more.\n  My amendment adjusts the budget resolution to pay for phased-in \nconcurrent receipt for veterans with service-related disabilities rated \nat 60 percent or higher. Although it is not full concurrent receipt, \nthis one change would help tens of thousands of veterans.\n  I hope everyone supports this most worthy amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to support Senate amendment No. \n341, an amendment to provide partial concurrent receipt for veterans.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Nevada for his unwavering and \ntireless support of veterans throughout the country. My constituents \nare aware of his advocacy for full concurrent receipt and appreciate \nhis support.\n  Mr. President, as you know, our current military benefits system \nrequires disabled military retirees who have a service-connected \ndisability to deduct their disability compensation from the funds they \nwould otherwise receive as retirement pay. This requirement unfairly \nmerges two distinct programs and forces many disabled retirees to \nforfeit a significant portion of their well-deserved retirement pay.\n  The retirement benefit is an entitlement granted to all members of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces who dedicate 20 or more years to providing our \nNation's defenses. Disability compensation, on the other hand, is \nawarded as a compensation for personnel who are injured in the line of \nduty. I believe veterans should receive each payment separately. \nAllowing disabled veterans to receive their full military retired pay \nand disability compensation will restore fairness and common sense to \nU.S. military retirement policy.\n  Last year, President Bush signed compromise legislation that provides \nconcurrent receipt to two veterans groups: one, any retiree receiving \ndisability compensation, of at least 10 percent, whose disability was \ncombat-related and for which the retiree was awarded the Purple Heart; \nand two, any retiree with a service-connected disability rated at 60 \npercent or higher incurred as a direct result of armed conflict, while \nengaged in hazardous service, in the performance of duty under \nconditions simulating war, or through an instrumentality of war.\n  Although this compromise was an important first step, it remains an \ninsufficient remedy to a persisting inequity in our veterans benefits \nsystem. Senate Amendment No. 341 would expand concurrent receipt to \ninclude veterans who have a service-connected disability of at least 60 \npercent. This is another important step in what will continue to be a \nlong battle to provide concurrent receipt to all eligible veterans--a \nbattle that I remain committed to fighting.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his leadership on this \nissue. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and look \nforward to working with them to provide full concurrent receipt for all \nveterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, last year the Armed Services Committee \ndid a lot of good work in this field, and I compliment my colleague \nfrom Nevada and also the chairman from the Armed Services Committee and \nthe Senator from Michigan for the great work they did last year.\n  Concerning the pending amendment by my friend and colleague from \nNevada, we have no objection to accepting the amendment by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is time yielded back?\n  Mr. REID. It is.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield back the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 341.\n  The amendment (No. 341) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield to Senator Byrd for \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nminutes on each side on this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 412\n\n(Purpose: To foster greater debate in the Senate and to prevent further \nincreases in the deficit by striking the reconciliation instructions to \n                       the Committee on Finance)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 412.\n       On page 45, strike beginning with line 20 through page 46, \n     line 2.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my amendment will strike the reconciliation \ninstructions to the Finance Committee that would shield the President's \n$726 billion tax cut from a thorough debate in the Senate. To use \nreconciliation to increase the deficit is an abuse of the budget \nprocess.\n  The Budget Act framers did not contemplate that reconciliation would \never be used to produce $726 billion in tax cuts that would be financed \nthrough Social Security surpluses and an increasing debt. The Budget \nAct includes explicit and implicit language underscoring that the \npurpose of reconciliation is for deficit reduction.\n  If the reconciliation instructions were removed from the pending \nbudget resolution, the Senate could still pass any economic stimulus \nplan it chose. To limit debate on such legislation is irresponsible, \nparticularly when the administration has not even explained how it \nintends to pay for the cost of the war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if this budget resolution passes with these \nreconciliation instructions included, the American people, through \ntheir elected representatives in Congress, will be denied their right \nto have a full debate upon the budgetary priorities of the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and a vote to strike \nthe reconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee from this \nbudget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Budget Act is 25 years old and 22 \ntimes we have used reconciliation, and of that 22 times, 18 have had \ninstructions to change, alter, or amend tax laws, change, alter, or \namend programs such as Medicare, entitlement programs. We have done \nthat. It has become an integral part of the Budget Act of the United \nStates. Without that, you could take the Budget Act and say it is for \nnought. It would accomplish nothing.\n  It would be an exercise in debating and then later on we would have \nas much time as we wanted on every bill. There would be filibusters on \nevery bill and, as contemplated by the Framers, we would get no budget \nactivity in the United States.\n  Reconciliation includes minimum debate. Without minimum debate, \nnothing will be done of a budgetary nature for the United States. The \nSenator understands that. That is why he offers\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\nit. The budget will be a shell meaning nothing. I suggest we defeat the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 412.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, how could we in good conscience deny \nunemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed at the same time we \nare considering more than $1.3 trillion in additional tax cuts \ndisproportionately benefiting the wealthiest taxpayer? That is exactly \nwhat this budget does. This amendment will extend and expand \nunemployment benefits for the millions of workers who need them. It \nwill cost just $16 billion, about 1 percent of the cost of the tax cut. \nThat should not be too much to ask for those families who need our help \nthe most. More than 4 million Americans will be unemployed with no \nFederal benefits after June 1 under the current law. These men and \nwomen have worked hard for years, paid into the unemployment fund, and \nnow find themselves without a job through no fault of their own. They \nare victims of the stagnant economy, and the economic news is not \ngetting any better.\n  Where is our concern for these 4 million Americans? Where is our \nsense of fairness? I hope Members will support this amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. \n315 of which I am a proud cosponsor. The purpose of this amendment is \nto accommodate in the budget an extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits. Currently, extended unemployment insurance benefits are \nscheduled to expire at the end of May. Beginning June first, \nindividuals whose regular unemployment benefits expire will no longer \nbe eligible for extended benefits.\n  This amendment sets aside the necessary funds, $16 billion, to extend \nthe existing unemployment insurance benefits program for an additional \n6 months. That is estimated to provide assistance to between 2 to 2.5 \nmillion working Americans who have lost their job through no fault of \ntheir own. The amendment takes the money from the proposed $1.5 \ntrillion dollars in tax cuts. This raises the very fundamental question \nof what our priorities are.\n  I am convinced that we are going to still be in very difficult shape \nwhen the current extension of unemployment insurance benefits expires \nat the end of May, and I think we will need to extend it. There is \nlittle chance that the labor market will significantly improve for \nunemployed workers between now and the end of May. There is growing \nevidence that the labor market is still deteriorating. The Federal Open \nMarket Committee's most recent statement on interest rates concluded \nthat, ``recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing.''\n  That is an understatement. It was reported yesterday that the 4-week \naverage of initial jobless claims rose to a 10-month high of 429,500. \nLast month we lost 308,000 jobs and the unemployment rose last month to \n5.8 percent. The unemployment rate is higher today than when extended \nbenefits were first enacted in March 2002. Over 3.4 million Americans \nare drawing unemployment benefits today a 4-month high. It would take \nprivate sector job creation of over 100,000 per month, every month, for \nthe next 2-years, in order for the economy to recoup the 2.5 million \nprivate sector jobs that have been lost since President Bush took \noffice.\n  The labor market remains weak because the overall economy remains \nweak. Last week the Federal Reserve released a report stating that, \n``growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February. \n. . . Consumer spending remained weak,'' and ``business spending was \nvery soft, with little change in capital spending or hiring plans.'' \nLittle change in business hiring is horrible news for would be job \nseekers who are caught in what the New York Times called the ``Worst \nHiring Slump in 20 Years.'' And this hiring slump has been very tough \non those who are of moderate means. Witness the Baltimore Sun's recent \nstory entitled ``Jobs for poor few in a weak economy.''\n  You have a situation where people are unemployed: Over 8.5 million \nunemployed Americans, over 22 percent of which, 1.87 million, have been \nunemployed for more than 26 weeks, are looking for work, and can't find \na job because there are no jobs to be had. This is the highest \npercentage--of long-term unemployed our economy has witnessed since \n1992. In situations like this, the Congress has always provided \nextended unemployment benefits. In the last recession these benefits \nwere provided for 29 months. During the recession before that, they \nlasted for 33 months. In both of those recessions extended benefits \nwere discontinued only after a pronounced strengthening in the labor \nmarket.\n  Today these benefits are set to expire after only 15 months, well \nbefore the labor market has improved. If this happens, it will mark not \nonly a departure from prudent fiscal policy that has been implemented \nin a bipartisan fashion in the past but will also harm economic growth \nand hurt millions of Americans. Extended unemployment insurance \nbenefits, already enacted by the Congress, have assisted 4.7 million \nworkers and provided $12 billion of stimulus into the economy. Federal \nReserve Chairman Greenspan has testified that ``extended unemployment \ninsurance provided a timely boost to disposable income.''\n  This amendment will allow for up to an additional $16.3 billion in \nstimulus to be provided precisely to those Americans who need it the \nmost. In fact, that is why it is so effective as economic stimulus--\nthose who receive unemployment benefits, by definition, are in such a \nprecarious fiscal position that they must spend every dollar of \nbenefits, which are far less than what they used to earn in their \nprevious job. The $16 billion would allow for the program not only to \nbe extended as it is, but to provide for all Americans who qualify to \nreceive an additional 13 weeks of benefits. This would include the 1 \nmillion workers who have already exhausted their extended benefits. \nThese workers need help. They want to find work but cannot find a job \nbecause there are simply no jobs to be had.\n  I know that some of my colleagues oppose providing extended benefits \nfor more than 13 weeks to anyone. I have a differing view point. I \npoint out that at this state of the last recession, a minimum of 20 \nweeks of additional Federal benefits were provided for all Americans in \nevery State. Under normal circumstances with a growing labor market, \nthere is a strong case to be made that providing too long of a duration \nof unemployment insurance benefits would be harmful. However, in times \nwhen the labor market is weak and the job base is shrinking, the \nsituation is very different. Even Fed Chairman Greenspan acknowledged \nthis in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, stating: ``in \nperiods like this [a shrinking labor market], that the economic \nrestraints on the unemployment insurance system almost surely ought to \nbe eased.''\n  In the previous recession and jobless recovery, extended unemployment \ninsurance benefits lasted for 29 months and for much of that time \nprovided benefits for 26 to 33 weeks. In this recession and jobless \nrecovery, benefits are scheduled to expire after only 15 months and \nhave provided only 13 weeks of extended benefits to the vast majority \nof Americans. Even if you still cling to the idea that we should have \nno more than 13 additional weeks, passing this amendment does not \nitself extend these benefits. it only allows the Senate the flexibility \nto address this issue when the time comes without having a budget point \nof order raised. The amendment sets aside the necessary funds, $16.3 \nbillion--which I point out are more than covered by the $21 billion in \nthe unemployment insurance trust funds today--to provide for whatever \nform of extended benefits the Senate should chose to pass. Hold the \ndebate on how to structure the program until then. What we cannot \nafford to do today is to pass a budget that contains nothing to provide \nfor extension of benefits which may be critically needed in only a few \nmonths time.\n  Last year this issue was not properly dealt with, and as a result \nmillions of Americans suffered through the holiday season believing \nthat their benefits were going to expire. Yet when Congress reconvened, \nextended benefits were retroactively restored, 11 days after they had \nexpired. Let's not put\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\nthese people through this again. Let's act now and set aside in this \nbudget the resources necessary to do the job that we, in my view, will \nhave to do between now and the end of May.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are making good progress. I am a \nlittle concerned about bouncing around on which amendment is next.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. We have only voted \non this particular amendment two or three times, maybe four or five \ntimes if you go back to last year.\n  This would double the program from a 13-week program to a 26-week \nprogram. It would cost billions, $16.6 billion, I believe, in probably \na year. According to GAO, there is $6.6 billion of an $8 billion block \ngrant we gave to the States that they have not used. This is a very \nexpensive amendment, in my opinion, not well thought out, not \ncoordinated with States. High unemployment States already get up to 65 \nweeks in benefits under present law. This would extend it. It is very \nexpensive. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

We will have seen over a 333-\npercent increase in funding in special education in the last few years \nas a result of this amendment and others and a 90-percent increase in \nfunding in title I as a result of this amendment and others.\n  With this amendment, we will have again dramatically increased the \nfunding for both preschool and general education activities at the \nelementary and secondary level, and I believe we should have pretty \nmuch filled up the bucket in those accounts.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We were going to do it \nseparately, but to move things along I decided to combine them.\n  This is a 10-year proposal since much of this budget proposal covers \n10 years. It amounts to about $18 billion for afterschool programs and \n$24 billion for Head Start. As a result of this amendment, we would \nactually increase from 850,000 under this budget to 2.5 million the \nnumber of children who would take advantage of afterschool programs \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, 2,000 prosecutors and police chiefs have endorsed this \namendment.\n  On Head Start, we would go from roughly 850,000 kids to approximately \n1 million, 1.2 million. That is an increase of 20 percent over the next \n10 years for Head Start. We pay for it by reducing the tax cut of $1.73 \ntrillion by about $42 billion. It is a tiny fraction of that tax cut, \nto serve kids in preschool and the afterschool programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 23, 2003]\n\n                        Cutbacks to Our Children\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Under the shadow of war with Iraq, the House and the Senate \n     last week fought a series of skirmishes over the federal \n     budget for next year. One big, overriding question was at \n     stake: Would President Bush and the Republican majorities in \n     Congress step up to the costs of battle, of homeland defense \n     and of national obligations at home, or would they pass the \n     costs on to future generations?\n       The answer, sadly, is that youngsters yet to be born will \n     see their choices limited and their prospects blighted by the \n     decision of today's politicians to press ahead with an \n     unaffordable tax cut even while the costs of war and \n     reconstruction make earlier spending estimates wildly \n     unrealistic.\n       The possible doubling of the national debt in the next \n     decade will drive up interest costs that must be paid every \n     year--billions of dollars that will not be available for \n     Social Security; Medicare or any of the myriad \n     responsibilities of the government here and abroad.\n       But the squeeze is not all prospective. Some dangerous \n     economies are being forced this year--cutbacks that will have \n     long-term damaging consequences for American society.\n       This was brought home to me from an unexpected source in a \n     group interview last\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\n     week with six state attorneys general--four Democrats and two \n     Republicans--who were in Washington for a professional \n     conference. Their theme was one I had heard before, not just \n     from social workers, academics and supposed bleeding-heart \n     liberals but from police chiefs, prosecutors and other hard-\n     nosed denizens of the criminal justice system.\n       It is the irrefutable evidence that the most effective \n     anti-crime strategies--and the least expensive--are early \n     childhood education, after-school programs and serious \n     mentoring of youngsters who otherwise are almost certainly \n     fated to be dropouts, delinquents and, yes, prison inmates.\n       Larry Long, the South Dakota attorney general and a 30-year \n     career prosecutor, put it this way. ``I can tell you that by \n     the time kids of 12 or 14 are brought into the juvenile \n     justice system, they are lost. All I can do is warehouse \n     them--at huge expense. The sooner and faster we reach kids, \n     the better the chance of their being saved.''\n       Long and his counterparts from Colorado, Delaware, Maine, \n     Montana and New Mexico described what they are doing to reach \n     vulnerable youngsters--especially those being raised by \n     single mothers still in their teens--and to help those \n     parents stabilize lives often blighted by drugs or other \n     addictions. But they also confirmed that many of their \n     initiatives are on the chopping block, as states struggle \n     with declining revenue and runaway health care costs for the \n     elderly.\n       ``These are proven programs that work,'' said Montana \n     Attorney General Mike McGrath, ``but our budget crisis is so \n     severe we may not be able to meet the federal matching \n     requirement''--the dollars a state must put up to qualify for \n     a grant from Washington.\n       That is why they express such dismay at what they are \n     hearing out of the Washington budget proceedings. The \n     briefing paper that all the state law enforcement officials \n     were given by the advocacy group Fight Crime: Invest in Kids \n     spelled out some of the cuts included in the Bush budget.\n       Funds for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \n     after-school program would be cut from $1 billion to $600 \n     million. The memo to the attorneys general says that cutback \n     would take a half-million children each year out of a those \n     centers, even though unsupervised youngsters make the hours \n     from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. the peak time for serious and violent \n     juvenile crime.\n       The Bush budget increases Head Start funding by $148 \n     million, just about enough to keep pace with inflation, but \n     the program now serves only six out of 10 preschoolers who \n     are eligible. Several other early childhood block grants and \n     programs are ticketed for reduction or elimination.\n       The picture is similar for other Justice Department and \n     Education Department program aimed at preventing juvenile \n     delinquency.\n       ``This is so shortsighted,'' said Maine Attorney General \n     Steven Rowe. ``For $300 billion, one-fifth the [10-year] cost \n     of the new tax cut, we could fully fund all of these \n     programs'' for the next decade.\n       That kind of investment would not only save lives, the \n     attorneys general said. It would save money. ``We are \n     spending $75,000 a year every time we incarcerate someone \n     under 18,'' said Delaware Attorney General Jane Brady. ``We \n     have to jail them, educate them, counsel them and try to \n     rehabilitate them. It would be so much better to help them \n     while they are young.''\n       It's another example of the long-term costs will incur \n     today's budget decisions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 7, 2003]\n\n                             The 3 to 6 Gap\n\n                         (By E.J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       The phrase ``balancing work and family'' is abstract. \n     Here's the concrete part: Kids' school schedules are out of \n     sync with their parents' work schedules. It is plain dumb \n     that from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, we just \n     let kids loose.\n       Yes, many families make heroic efforts to deal with this \n     problem. But many others--especially in households that \n     desperately need two incomes--are put in a terrible dilemma. \n     Filling the 3 to 6 gap is one of our most urgent social \n     needs, a point made regularly by law enforcement officials.\n       Some politicians understand it, too. ``After-school \n     programs keep kids safe, help working families and improve \n     academic achievements,'' said the most prominent one of them \n     all. ``They engage students in service and ensure that youth \n     have access to anti-substance abuse programs. For America's \n     working parents, they provide the confidence that their \n     children are well cared for after the school day ends.''\n       Excellent points. President Bush made them in a letter he \n     wrote on Oct. 4, 2002, to a group called the Afterschool \n     Alliance. So why, exactly, has the president proposed to cut \n     federal spending on after-school care by 40 percent? Under \n     Bush's budget, federal spending on 21st Century Community \n     Learning Centers would drop from $1 billion this year to $600 \n     million next year.\n       Rep. George Miller, a California Democrat who worked with \n     Bush on the education bill, notes that the program now covers \n     about 1.5 million kids. The program's advocates estimate that \n     at least 500,000 would be affected by the cut.\n       This cut, alas, perfectly embodies what's wrong with the \n     way this administration is doing business. The dissonance \n     between the president's moderate, compassionate words and his \n     spending priorities is jarring.\n       Moreover, the federal government is pulling away from a \n     problem at exactly the moment when giant budget deficits are \n     forcing states to do less themselves. In Maryland, for \n     example, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, has \n     proposed cutting the Maryland After School Opportunity Fund \n     in half, from $10 million to $5 million. Afterschool Alliance \n     reports similar cuts in at least four other states and \n     expects more to follow.\n       Bush speaks constantly of making it easier for faith-based \n     groups to get federal funds. The 21st Century program was \n     opened to such organizations last year. Does it help faith-\n     based groups to let them into the program and then dry up the \n     funding?\n       Miller is not alone in suspecting that this program was \n     vulnerable because it happened to be one of former president \n     Bill Clinton's more popular initiatives. ``There's obviously \n     been a search-and-destroy mission against anything that was \n     Clinton,'' he says.\n       Oh, yes, Bush says we have to make these hard budget \n     choices, but he has refused to put a price tag on the war \n     with Iraq (it could easily run to $100 billion) and insists \n     we need his huge tax cuts for the wealthy. Let's see: We have \n     to cut $400 million from after-school program to pay for the \n     elimination of the dividends tax, which will eventually cost \n     the government $50 billion a year in revenue?\n       Most remarkable, the administration has justified this cut \n     as good government. It cites a recent study by Mathematica \n     Policy Research showing, as the administration's budget \n     documents put it, that ``the centers funded in the program's \n     first three years are not providing substantial academic \n     content and do not appear to have a positive impact on \n     students' behavior.''\n       The Mathematica study did find some positive effects from \n     the program, and some of its criticisms were disputed by \n     after school advocates. But let's assume that the report was \n     sound and that these programs would do well to beef up their \n     academic content. That's still no excuse for using a single \n     report as a rationale for cutting the federal government's \n     commitment to helping kids between the hours of 3 and 6. We \n     need to build on the after-school experience, not retreat. \n     And, by the way, does the administration have one standard \n     for social programs--a little bad news and they're slashed--\n     and another for tax cuts and, say, missile defense?\n       To challenge these cutbacks, I nominate a good Republican \n     known as The Terminator. Last fall, Arnold Schwarzenegger led \n     the fight for Proposition 49 in California, a ballot measure \n     that will eventually provide about $430 million for after-\n     school programs. It passed with 57 percent of the vote. ``My \n     hope is that, as goes California, so goes the rest of the \n     nation,'' he declared. Arnold, where your priorities are \n     concerned, your president is saying, ``Hasta la vista, \n     baby.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 2003]\n\n                             Heavy Lifting\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       He's at it again.\n       President Bush traveled to Nashville on Monday to talk, \n     among other things, about compassion, which is a topic this \n     president probably should leave alone. Mr. Bush's idea of \n     compassion tends to send a shiver of dread through those who \n     are disadvantaged.\n       But there he was in Nashville at the National Religious \n     Broadcasters convention, exhorting his audience to ``rally \n     the armies of compassion so that we can change America one \n     heart, one soul at a time.''\n       The president said religious organizations had a \n     responsibility to assist the poor and those who are \n     suffering, and to help alleviate the ``artificial divisions'' \n     of race and economics.\n       ``I welcome faith to help solve the nation's deepest \n     problems,'' he said.\n       If religious leaders take up the challenge they will have \n     to do some awfully heavy lifting, because Mr. Bush's domestic \n     policies--instead of easing suffering--are all but guaranteed \n     to provide an ever-swelling stream of people in need of help.\n       Everywhere you turn, support programs for the poor, the \n     ill, the disabled and the elderly are under attack. \n     Children's services are being battered. As Mr. Bush smiles \n     and talks about compassion, funding for programs large and \n     small is being squeezed, cut back, eliminated.\n       The day after, Mr. Bush's upbeat speech to the religious \n     broadcasters, The Times's Robert Pear revealed that the \n     administration was proposing a change in federal law that \n     would result in rent increases for thousands of poor people \n     receiving housing aid.\n       The administration has proposed a restructuring of Medicare \n     that would curtail, rather than enhance, delivery of health \n     services to the elderly.\n       In the $2.2 trillion budget that Mr. Bush sent to Congress \n     last week was an unconscionable proposal that would eliminate \n     after-school programs for 500,000 children. In the arena of \n     bad ideas, that one's a champion. It would result not just in \n     hardship, but tragedy. For one thing, the peak hours for \n     juvenile crime are 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., with the biggest, most \n     dangerous burst coming in the very first hour after school. \n     That is also the time of day in which most teenage girls \n     become pregnant.\n       Mr. Bush has proposed cuts in juvenile delinquency \n     programs, public housing assistance, children's health \n     insurance and on and on. He's even undermined the funding for \n     his \n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\n     own highly touted school reform program, the No Child Left \n     Behind Act.\n       Senator Edward Kennedy, who had worked closely with the \n     president on the school reform legislation, said yesterday, \n     ``As soon as the Klieg lights were off and the bunting came \n     down, the Bush administration turned its back on school \n     reform and America's children.''\n       Looming over this calculated assault on programs of crucial \n     importance to millions of Americans is Mr. Bush's colossal \n     accumulation of tax cuts for the wealthy and an endless \n     mountain range of federal budget deficits. The ideologues on \n     the right are close to realizing their dream of crippling \n     social services by starving the government of revenues.\n       Dr. J. Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for \n     Children in Poverty at Columbia University, said yesterday:\n       ``These cuts are tearing at what was emerging as a \n     bipartisan consensus at the end of the last administration \n     that the unfinished agenda on welfare reform was to create \n     the work and family supports necessary to continue to help \n     people move from welfare to work.''\n       Tip O'Neill once said of Ronald Reagan, ``He has no \n     concern, no regard, no care for the little man of America.''\n       George W. Bush is making the Gipper look like a softy.\n       Policies that affect the poor and working poor seldom get \n     sustained attention. In an atmosphere of terror and impending \n     war, Mr. Bush's approach to social services is getting even \n     shorter shrift than usual. The policies he is attempting to \n     put in place would largely overturn the notion we've had of a \n     federal responsibility for programs to help struggling \n     Americans. Mr. Bush would turn much of that responsibility \n     over to the states, which are struggling with backbreaking \n     budget problems of their own that are forcing drastic \n     reductions in state services.\n       The collective result would be a long-term abandonment of \n     the most needy among us. It's difficult to square that with \n     the idea of compassion, conservative or otherwise.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd (D-CT),\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The Afterschool Alliance is pleased to \n     endorse your proposed amendment to the fiscal year 2004 \n     Senate Budget Resolution providing the fully authorized \n     funding level for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \n     Program. More than 15 million school aged children lack a \n     safe, supervised place to spend their aftershcool hours--\n     where they can get academic support and have the opportunity \n     to take part in art, music, athletic and other enrichment \n     activities. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers \n     Program provides critical support to communities throughout \n     the nation to create and expand high quality afterschool \n     programming.\n       According to the law enforcement community, the afterschool \n     hours are when youth are most at risk. Juvenile crime triples \n     between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Studies show that \n     students who have no access to extracurricular activities are \n     much more likely to get involved with drug use and become \n     teen parents.\n       Beyond safety, high quality afterschool programs are \n     helping kids learn new skills and perform better in schools. \n     A study just released by The Afterschool Corporation reported \n     that 84 percent of principals in New York credited \n     afterschool programs with improved overall effectiveness of \n     their schools.\n       Afterschool programs are increasingly popular among parents \n     and other community leaders. Nine out of ten voters think \n     that all children should have access to afterschool programs. \n     Nationally, more than 50 percent of teens wish there were \n     more afterschool programs available as well. In other words, \n     afterschool programs work and are popular with the people who \n     need them most.\n       At a time when safety is high on everyone's list of \n     concerns, funding for the 21st Century Community Learning \n     Centers Program should continue to grow--not be the target of \n     deep cuts in the federal budget. The 40% cut proposed by the \n     President in his fiscal year 2004 budget would deny 570,000 \n     children and youth the afterschool programming they now \n     receive. It would hurt them, their families and their \n     communities. Support for the Dodd Afterschool/Headstart \n     amendment is a vote in favor of kids, working families and \n     local schools and communities.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judy Samelson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the thousands of sheriffs, \n     police chiefs, prosecutors and crime victims who constitute \n     the national anti-crime group Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, we \n     urge you to support amendments to the Fiscal Year 2004 budget \n     resolution that increase funding for key investments that can \n     keep kids from growing up to become criminals.\n       Specifically, we urge you to support the amendment offered \n     by Sen. Christopher Dodd to increase funding for Head Start \n     and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers and the \n     amendment offered by Sen. Jeff Bingaman to increase funding \n     for the Child Care and Development Block Grant by $4.6 \n     billion over five years (to the level in the tri-partisan \n     reauthorization bill reported out of the Finance Committee \n     last year), as well as any other amendments supporting \n     similar investments.\n       As leaders on the front-line in the battle against crime, \n     our members know that the best way to prevent crime is to \n     invest in programs that keep kids from becoming criminals in \n     the first place. Research and experience prove that crime and \n     violence can be greatly reduced through quality early \n     childhood and after-school programs.\n       For example, a study published in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association of the Chicago Child-Parent \n     Centers early childhood education program found that children \n     left out of the program were 70% more likely to be arrested \n     for a violent crime by age 18. A study of the Quantum \n     Opportunities after-school program showed that boys left out \n     of the program averaged six times more criminal convictions \n     in their high school years than the boys who attended the \n     after-school program.\n       Unfortunately, programs that support these types of \n     activities are drastically under-funded. Only six in ten \n     children eligible for Head Start can participate in the \n     program, only one in seven eligible for the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant can receive subsidies, and less than \n     5% of eligible kids can participate in Early Head Start. In \n     addition, 75% of the requests for 21st Century Community \n     Learning Centers after-school grants have to be turned down \n     due to a lack of funding, leaving more than 10 million \n     children and teens home alone after school on a regular \n     basis.\n       Investing in children is the most effective investment that \n     our nation can make in long-term growth, and will pay off in \n     crime reduction and other benefits for years to come. These \n     programs not only better the lives of children and prevent \n     crime, but also save money and help grow the economy in the \n     long run. The Chicago Child-Parent Centers saved the public \n     $7 for every $1 invested, and the Quantum Opportunities \n     program saved the public $3 for every $1 invested.\n       Please support crime-reducing amendments to the budget that \n     will provide more families with access to quality early \n     education and care and force fewer parents to leave their \n     child unattended during the peak hours of juvenile crime from \n     3-6 p.m.\n       If you have any questions, please contact us at 202-776-\n     0027 ext. 143.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sanford A. Newman,\n       President.\n     Miriam A. Rollin,\n       Federal Policy Director.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in the Head Start and early education \nprograms, we have increased those by 800 percent--800 percent--in the \nlast decade. In this budget, we have a significant increase in Head \nStart. In fact, we are putting so much money into Head Start already \nthat about 7 percent of the slots in Head Start are not even filled. We \nhave so much money in this program, in a number of parts of this \ncountry they cannot find the kids to put into the programs.\n  It is really inappropriate for us to fund it in a way which is \nexcessive. We are doing a strong and effective job in the area of \nfunding Head Start and early education programs. I hope we defeat this \namendment as spending which is unnecessary at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional \nseconds.\n  Kids are being----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  Mr. DODD. There is a huge need for this program in the country.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, March 20, 2003, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Native Americans and Alaskan Natives have \na guarantee under law and treaty that we provide health benefits to \nthem and to their families. They are not getting it today. In fact, we \nare falling dramatically short of the budget required to buy them the \nservices that they must now have. In fact, we are so short that we are \nnow under a life or limb test. Unless your life is threatened, unless \nyou may chance the loss of a limb, you are deferred treatment in most \nIndian health care facilities today.\n  This amendment would simply provide clinical services funding for any \ncurrent users--not for anybody who is currently ineligible, but only \nfor those who are eligible today. We must provide this health care \nunder the law. This amendment would do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, we \nwere prepared to offer a second-degree amendment, but at the request of \nthe minority leader we will not do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the second-degree amendment we have \nprepared be eligible to be considered as an amendment on or in relation \nto immediately following the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment. I understand there are a lot of problems in Indian \nHealth Service. We have some of those in my State as well. It doesn't \nsolve it by saying we should have an 86 percent increase in growth in \nthis function. I understand the demands and needs, but percentage-wise \nthis is too great.\n  The amendment to be offered by Senator Murkowski will have at least a \n10-percent increase. We have increased this function by millions of \ndollars in the last couple of years. I understand the demand.\n  I urge colleagues to vote no on this amendment and in favor of the \nsubsequent amendment to be offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In 1997, Congress \n     enacted a program to spend $30 million a year on research and \n     treatment on diabetes in the Native American community. This \n     amount was increased to $100 million a year in 2000 and \n     further increased to $150 million a year in 2002. This is a \n     500% increase since 1997. This priority focuses on prevention \n     and treatment for a major disease in the Native American \n     community.\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Daschle for \nhis concern about the health of American Indians. For many of us, it is \nnot really a front burner issue on our agendas as we face the war and \nso many other things, but to a lot of people whose health problems are \nbetween 5 and 10 times the national average, it is very important. So I \nthank Senator Daschle for doing that.\n  Unfortunately, the amount seemed to exceed what we are able to \nsupport. The amount under this amendment increases IHS by 10 percent, \nor $292 million, bringing the total funding for the Indian Health \nService to $3.208 million for facilities and services. In addition, it \nincludes a sense of the Senate that Congress recognizes the need for \nprevention and research for a major disease in the Native American \ncommunity, which is diabetes.\n  As the Chair might know, some tribes suffer a 50-percent rate of \ndiabetes among their members. Since 1997, Congress has increased Native \nAmerican diabetes research and treatment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In closing, this is a marked improvement over what we \nhave done. I wish it could have been more, and I do thank Senator \nDaschle for bringing this to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have great admiration for the Senator \nfrom Colorado. There is no one who is more sensitive to many of these \nissues than is he. He has led us well in the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  This amendment still leaves us over $2.6 billion short in providing \nhealth care services. Under the life and limb test: Your life has to be \nthreatened or you are going to lose a limb to even walk in the front \ndoor. We are going to be $2.6 billion below that level right now if \nthis amendment passes. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, this 10 percent is taken out of other Indian Health programs, \nother Indian education programs and other priorities. So we are really \ntaking----\n  Mr. NICKLES. No.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. One dollar out of one pocket and putting it in the \npocket of the other side, and we are not accommodating the real need or \nreal commitment in health care that is so desperately needed right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, it \nis taken out of general government, not out of any health service. I do \nnot know if a vote is necessary on this. I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n416.\n  The amendment (No. 416) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 318\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

PROVIDING GRANTS TO SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS IN \n                   THEIR EFFORTS TO PROTECT HOMELAND SECURITY AND \n                   PREVENT AND RESPOND TO ACTS OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our \n     Nation has asked State and local responders (firefighters, \n     law enforcement officers, and emergency personnel) to defend \n     Americans as never before on the front lines in the war \n     against terrorism;\n       (2) on March 17, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security, \n     in consultation with the Homeland Security Council, raised \n     the national threat level from an ``Elevated'' to ``High'' \n     risk of terrorist attack (Level Orange) because the \n     intelligence community believes that terrorists will attempt \n     multiple attacks against United States and Coalition targets \n     worldwide in the event of a military campaign against Saddam \n     Hussein led by the United States;\n       (3) Level Orange indicates a high probability of a \n     terrorist attack and requires additional precautions by first \n     responders at public events;\n       (4) this is the third time since the Federal Homeland \n     Security Advisory System was created on March 12, 2002, that \n     State and local first responders have been kept on Orange \n     Alert, including--\n       (A) September 10 to September 24, 2002; and\n       (B) February 7 to February 27, 2003;\n       (5) notwithstanding the periods listed under paragraph (4), \n     the Nation has continuously been at Yellow Alert (an \n     ``elevated'' threat level declared when there is a \n     significant risk of terrorist attacks), which has required \n     increased surveillance of critical locations for State and \n     local first responders;\n       (6) the National Governors' Association estimates that \n     States incurred about $7,000,000,000 in homeland security \n     costs in the past year for State and local first responders; \n     and\n       (7) as a result of the elevated and high national threat \n     alerts and other Federal homeland security requirements, \n     State and local governments have been subject to unfunded \n     Federal mandates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the funding levels in this resolution assume a total of \n     at least $6,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 for the Office \n     of Domestic Preparedness through the Department of Homeland \n     Security to provide direct funds to support first responders \n     nationwide in their efforts to protect homeland security and \n     to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the budget resolution now provides less \nfunding to our Nation's first responders in the next fiscal year than \nit does in the current one. My amendment, which is cosponsored by \nSenators Daschle, Reid, Biden, Schumer, Clinton, and Dayton, will \nincrease the level of direct funding for fiscal year 2004 for first \nresponders by $3 billion to support their efforts to protect homeland \nsecurity and respond to acts of terrorism. This will bring the total \nfunding for our State and local first responders to at least $6.5 \nbillion for the first fiscal year.\n  When one calls 9-1-1, they get the State and local; they do not get \nWashington. They need the money.\n  We offset this by reducing tax reductions by $3 billion for taxpayers \nwith annual incomes greater than $300,000, and we provide an additional \n$3 billion for deficit reduction. I hope we can support our Nation's \npolice officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel by passing this \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my good friend from Vermont has told us \nwhat the amendment provides in way of an increase in spending. But what \nhe did not tell us is it increases taxes by $6 billion over the period \nof 2004 through 2007. It increases the spending caps and it changes the \nreconciliation instructions.\n  What also is contained in this budget resolution is $28 billion in \ndiscretionary spending for the homeland security function. This \namendment is aimed at one small part of the budget resolution, and it \nincreases that account, though, by 85 percent.\n  Today, we have received from the President a supplemental budget \nrequest for homeland security asking for an additional $4.2 billion. \nThe administration is making a very strong effort, under the competent \nleadership of Secretary Tom Ridge, to have a coordinated national \nstrategy. While this amendment is well intended and we all support the \ngoal of strengthening our effort to deliver the safety and health \nassistance that is needed at the local levels, this amendment is \nunnecessary and the bill takes care of the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 318.\n  The clerk will call the roll\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, what we have is a very unfair system on \nreimbursement for beneficiaries. Here is a chart that shows the \nnational average is about $5,490 per beneficiary in reimbursement. \nThere are 34 States below that. My State of Iowa is $3,000 per \nbeneficiary per year; New Mexico, $3,700. You can see all these States \ndown here; we pay the same taxes, we pay the same Medicare taxes as \nevery other State, yet Iowa receives $4,300 per beneficiary less than \nthe top State in the Nation. All this amendment does is it provides $25 \nbillion over 10 years to the Finance Committee to bring up these \nStates. It does not take from the States at the top; it only adds to \nthe States at the bottom, and even some of the States at the top will \nbe helped because it helps the rural-urban inequity. So some of the \nStates at the top that have rural areas will actually benefit, but this \nbrings up the bottom States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I urge our colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. \nThis amendment doesn't do anything to help the rural areas. All it does \nis say let's increase, in the resolution, the amount from $400 billion \nto $425 billion in the area of Medicare. Under the resolution we \npassed, we said there would be $400 billion in the Medicare reserve \nfund to strengthen and enhance Medicare, improve access for \nbeneficiaries under that program to prescription drugs and promote \ngeographic equity payments.\n  That was included because Senator Grassley wanted to make sure we \ndealt with the inequities that were just described by my friend from \nIowa. We are going to address that when we take up Medicare in the \nFinance Committee, which is where it should be addressed, not on a \nbudget resolution that wouldn't have the impact. When we draft a \nMedicare bill that we are going to have on the floor this year, we can \ndeal with some of these inequities.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senator Dodd. It is an amendment that would increase the \nmandatory funding for childcare by approximately $900 million per year \nor $4.6 billion over 5 years. The amendment is paid for by lowering the \namount of the unreconciled tax cuts that are contemplated in the \npending budget. I emphasize, the unreconciled tax cuts. The issue is \nvery simple. We need to at least maintain current childcare services. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has done an estimate that determines we \nneed to raise the level of spending to the amount called for in the \namendment in order to maintain the current level of childcare services. \nThis is particularly important in light of the fact that we have the \nproposal by the administration, which many of us support, to increase \nwork-related requirements for welfare recipients. Clearly, if we are \ngoing to do that, the demand for childcare would increase.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. We \nhave increased childcare assistance by 250 percent since 1996. We \ndoubled the number of children in childcare programs. This budget \nresolution alone increases childcare assistance by 7.3 percent in the \nmandatory accounts, 10 percent in the discretionary accounts, for a $5 \nbillion increase. All of this has been done while welfare rolls have \ndropped by 54 percent. We are putting a dramatic increase in money in \nfewer children who are even qualified for the money which means, as a \npractical matter, that we are certainly making an extra effort in these \naccounts. This increase is excessive in light of the amount of the \nincreases already in the bill, which are dramatic in and of their own \nright.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 417. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 90 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Miller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 417) was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

GRANTS FOR FIREFIGHTERS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the funding levels in \n     this resolution assume that under section 33 of the Fire \n     Prevention and Control Act of 1974--\n       (1) not less than $1,000,000,000 will be used annually to \n     provide grants to local governments for the sole purpose of \n     hiring additional firefighters; and\n       (2) not less than $750,000,000 will be used annually to \n     provide grants to local governments for the purchase of \n     firefighter emergency response equipment and training.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is the FIRE Act. I introduced this with \nSenator DeWine in 1999. It became law in the year 2000. Senator Warner \nand I were able to get $100 million for our 20,000 fire departments \nacross the country. One million people serve in our fire services. We \nhad a number--about $750 million--which this budget rolls back to $500 \nmillion for these firefighters across the country for the basic \nhomeland security issues of first responders.\n  This amendment would restore that number to $750 million, and over 10 \nyears it would be $1 billion a year, which is paid for by reducing the \ntax cut.\n  I do not need to tell my colleagues how important this is to the \nmillion firefighters in 20,000 departments across this country. They \nneed equipment. They need personnel. Many of their members are off in \nthe Persian Gulf as I speak because they have been called up in the \nNational Guard and Reserve services. These dollars would provide for \nnew firefighters, replacements, as well as safety equipment. Two-thirds \nof all departments are badly understaffed and too many still do not \nhave the basic safety equipment. This amendment allows for those \nnumbers to be restored to the numbers we appropriated and agreed to \nlast year. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are all very concerned about making \nadequate funds available for this account, but we also have in the \nbudget--and Senators should recognize this--$28 billion in \ndiscretionary spending in the homeland security function of the budget \nresolution.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut did not let you know was--and I am \nsure he will be glad to admit this is the case--this amendment would \ncause taxes to go up. The amendment increases taxes by $23.7 billion \nover the period of time from 2004 to 2007. It increases the spending \ncaps, and it changes the reconciliation instructions.\n  We just received from the President today a supplemental budget \nrequest for homeland security in the amount of $4.2 billion. The \nPresident is giving strong leadership on this issue, trying to organize \na national strategy to help not only first responders, firefighters, \nand others, but have a national strategy for making our homeland safer \nand our people more secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I hope Senators will vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 419.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment because \nit fully funds the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law \nEnforcement Act, the Byrne Grant Program, named for a New York City \npolice officer, and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Act, by \nproviding a respective $650 million and $400 million in funding in \nfiscal year 2004.\n  In addition, this amendment raises the discretionary cap for fiscal \nyear 2003 by $1 billion and fiscal year 2004 by $2.5 billion to provide \ndirect homeland security first responder funding to localities and for \nhigh threat areas such as New York City through the Department of \nHomeland Security's Office of Domestic Preparedness. This amendment is \npaid for by the nonreconciliation part of the tax cut.\n  In addition, we are still not adequately funding homeland security \ndirectly where it needs to go to the people on the front lines in our \ncities. Just because we now have new terrorist threats does not mean we \ncan let our guard down when it comes to drug dealers, violent crimes, \nthe kinds of things that we have successfully dealt with over the last \ndecade.\n  I ask my colleagues to cast this vote for our police officers, our \nfirefighters, and our emergency responders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the resolution already provides $2.1 \nbillion for a variety of local law enforcement grant programs, as well \nas an additional $500 million at the Department of Homeland Security \nspecifically for grant programs to local law enforcement entities.\n  Under an arrangement at the Department, Governor Ridge has made clear \nthat discretionary funds going to the States are passed through to \nlocal governments and localities.\n  One thing the Senator did not point out was if this amendment is \nadopted, it is going to increase taxes by $9 billion over the period \nfrom 2003 to 2007. It will also increase the spending caps.\n  This resolution we have before us already provides for funding for \nthe strategy for making our homeland\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nsafer and our people more secure. I urge Senators to vote against this \namendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESERVE FUND TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       If legislation is reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Finance, or an amendment thereto is offered or a conference \n     report thereon is submitted that would extend the solvency of \n     the Social Security Trust Funds, the Chairman of the Senate \n     Committee on the Budget may revise the aggregates, functional \n     totals, allocations, and other appropriate levels and limits \n     in this resolution by up to $396,000,000,000 in budget \n     authority and outlays for the total of fiscal years 2003 and \n     through 2013.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, cutting taxes when you have a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus in the Treasury is one thing. Cutting taxes by $1.3 \ntrillion--which is where we are right now--when you do not have a \nsurplus but in fact you have a $300 billion deficit, and, added to \nthat, we are at war and we don't know how much it is going to cost, is \nnot good public policy.\n  The amendment at the desk reduces the reconciled tax cut to $350 \nbillion. It takes $120 billion of the tax cut outside of reconciliation \nand creates a Social Security reserve account. That Social Security \nreserve account will be for reforming Social Security. If we don't get \naround to doing it, the money will go to reduce the deficit. This \namendment has a $350 billion tax cut which is protected by budget \nreconciliation. The remaining funds will be used for a Social Security \nreserve fund.\n  This amendment is an amendment that was previously considered by the \nBudget Committee, which did not pass it, and we are offering it on the \nfloor now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment on which we voted on \nFriday. The amendment was defeated 62 to 38. Maybe it is another reason \nwe should have finished the entire bill on Friday, the initial bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. I have a couple of \ncomments about it.\n  The thing that is different about it, that now there is a Social \nSecurity reserve fund, that is bogus. There is no money going into the \nSocial Security reserve fund because on the other hand they say the \nmoney goes toward deficit reduction. It can't go into both.\n  This amendment would cut the growth package in half. It would cut the \ngrowth out of the growth package. We need to be growing our economy. \nOur economy is really going through a difficult time. The President has \na package that will help create jobs, put people to work, encourage \ninvestment, and encourage real growth in our economy. We need that. I \nam afraid if we pass this amendment, we will just be cutting it in half \nand end up with a package that is $323 billion of tax cuts over a total \nof $28 trillion over that 10-year period of time.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this amendment is a much needed \namendment. It repeals the Clinton tax increase on Social Security \nbenefits that passed by one vote in 1993. Before 1993, seniors were \ntaxed on 50 percent of their Social Security benefits if their incomes \nwere above $25,000 for individuals and $32,000 for couples. After the \nincrease, individuals who made over $34,000 and couples who made over \n$44,000 paid taxes on 85 percent of their Social Security income.\n  These figures have not been adjusted for inflation for the past 10 \nyears. The tax hike was unfair in 1993. It is unfair today. On the one \nhand, we tell the seniors to plan and save for retirement. On the other \nhand, we tax them for doing just that. That doesn't make any sense. We \nought to repeal this tax. Some of us have been trying to undo this \nmistake for 10 years. The amendment would allow the Finance Committee \nto finally finish the job. I urge support for the amendment to end this \nunfair tax on seniors and their Social Security benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let us be clear, the budget resolution \ndoes not make the determination for the Finance Committee on how this \nadditional tax cut will be used. This amendment is very simple. It \nincreases the tax cut by $146 billion. It does absolutely nothing about \nthe Social Security tax--nothing--because a budget resolution does not \nmake the specific determination. All we decide is what the instruction \nis to the Finance Committee for raising money and the Appropriations \nCommittee to spend money. So this has absolutely nothing to do with the \nSocial Security tax. The only effect of this amendment is to raise the \ntax cut $146 billion to over $1 trillion, all of it borrowed, every \npenny.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a number of times it has been indicated \nthat the various amendments have been to increase taxes. Let us just be \nclear that all the amendments heretofore have been to reduce the tax \ncut, not to increase taxes.\n  I now yield time to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 330\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, amendment No. 330 is at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     330.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, March 20, 2003, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Chafee, Senator Feinstein, and myself, and I thank Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Lincoln for joining us as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, if my colleagues are looking for a balanced approach \nto balancing the budget by 2009, this is it. If my colleagues are \nlooking for tax cuts that would be effective immediately, this \namendment does that.\n  This amendment takes the 10 and 20 percent bracket cuts and makes \nthem effective immediately. The estate tax exclusion is set permanently \nat $6 million per family. We grow the child credit. We eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. We allow small business to expense their equipment \npurchasing at $75,000 for this year and for next. We pay for that by \ndeferring further cuts in the 35 and 38.5 percent rate until we balance \nthe budget.\n  We also work on the spending side. We adopt the committee's increased \ndefense numbers. We use about an $80 billion offset with the \nPresident's numbers to actually add to domestic discretionary spending. \nWe put back in place controls that have been allowed to lapse: Pay-go \ncontrols and reinstatement controls. It is a good, balanced approach. \nWe would appreciate your support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I oppose the level and distribution \nof funding in this amendment, it is no worse than what is in the \ncurrent budget resolution, and it proposes a tax cut plan which is \nsuperior to the one before us. While it is a better alternative if it \nis substituted for the resolution before us, I would vote against it on \nfinal passage because it still underfunds too many of our nation's \npriorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield our time to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to \noppose this amendment. This is basically the Blue Dog budget in the \nHouse. The net impact: Versus our budget, there would be an increase of \n$1.25 trillion over the next 10 years. The growth package goes to $50 \nbillion. Here is the net effect. We are going to take $27.8 trillion \nfrom the American taxpayers over the next 10 years to run this \nGovernment. Mr. President, $50 billion represents .18 percent, less \nthan two-tenths of one penny; $323 billion is about one penny on the \ndollar. Surely to goodness this body can afford to give 1 cent on a \ndollar, 2 cents on a dollar, maybe .18 of a penny on a dollar back to \nthe American taxpayer. Do we have to keep all the $27.8 trillion?\n  On top of that, our friends on the other side want to add $990 \nbillion today. People are crying uncle. They need a little bit of help. \nWe are not helping very much. I ask my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The question is on agreeing \nto amendment No. 330.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe we are ready to consider and we \nwill accept the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On behalf of myself, Senator Chafee, and Senator \nCarper, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, and Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 422.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To extend the pay-as-you-go requirement)\n\n       On page 57, lines 3 through 5, strike ``as adjusted for any \n     changes in revenues or direct spending assumed by such \n     resolution'' and insert ``based on laws enacted on the date \n     of adoption of that resolution as adjusted for up to $350 \n     billion in revenues or direct spending assumed by section 104 \n     of this resolution''.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This is the pay-as-you-go amendment. We extend the pay-\nas-you-go system that has been in place since 1990 as adjusted for the \nreconciled levels just adopted in the Breaux amendment. This amendment \nsays tax cuts or entitlement spending increases, if they are beyond the \n$350 billion for which the Senate just voted, do have to be deficit \nneutral.\n  This is a system that has worked well since 1990. It has helped keep \ndeficits in check. It was suspended in times of surplus, and we got \nourselves into the current deficit jam. The budget resolution before \nthe Senate, however, creates a giant exception to pay-as-you-go for \neverything the budget assumes. Basically, it says pay-as-you-go, but \nfor the first $900 billion they are free, they are on the house.\n  They are not free. We should not take money from Social Security \nrevenues. We should not just bill our children's generation, robbing \nthem of their choices. We need to return to the ethic that we will pay \nfor what we get.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I thank the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for his willingness to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, there are bound to be a few people in \nthis body, and probably fewer in the country, who understand pay-go. I \ncompliment my colleague from Wisconsin. I am not sure the amendment is \nperfect, but I will work with him and others. I have no objection to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 422) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 421\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding to implement the No Child Left Behind Act \n                                in 2004)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nauthorized me to yield to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for \nthe next amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 421 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 421.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The amendment before the Senate stops at the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. It is an issue this Senate supports, the House and \nSenate supported, and the President signed it into law, putting in new \naccountability measures for all public schools. There were two promises \nin that bill: One that would require accountability for our students; \nsecond, that we will pay for the resources so they can meet the \nstandards we had set.\n  The amendment before the Senate puts $2 billion from the tax cut into \nthe No Child Left Behind Act so we can begin to follow up on the \npromise made by Senators in this body to the children in our country. \nThis is an extremely important amendment as many of our States are \nsuffering from very difficult budget crises. We cannot put on them \nanother unfunded mandate under the guise of No Child Left Behind. This \namendment makes sure we provide some of the resources that we required \nwhen we passed that bill a year and a half ago. I ask for all of our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have accepted a lot of education \namendments. I believe now, after consulting with Senator Gregg, \nchairman of the committee, we will even be beyond the education level \nas proposed by Senator Conrad in last year's budget for 2004.\n  We have no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 421) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 395\n\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield to Senator Dorgan for \namendment No. 395.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Dorgan is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. This amendment which I offer today with Senators Kerry, \nJeffords, Murray, Lautenberg, Clinton, Boxer, and Sarbanes, increases \nfunding for environmental protection and natural resource conservation. \nCleanup of brownfields, Superfund sites, MTBE, contaminated water \nsupplies are a national and a bipartisan objective. These environmental \nchallenges to public health stand as roadblocks to economic development \nand economic renewal across America. Addressing these issues with \nefficacy requires a constancy of purpose and funding. The amendment \ndoes just that.\n  In addition, this amendment provides resources to fund parks, open \nspace acquisition, wildlife habitat, and beach conservation. These \nshould not be shortchanged. They are investments in the future of \nAmerica, not just for today's generation but future generations. \nFunding for the amendment adds $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2004 and the \nsame amount in future years adjusted for inflation. The funding is \noffset by a corresponding reduction in the nonreconciled tax cut.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues to be sure we protect our \nenvironment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in debate last Friday we agreed to the \namendment of Senators Crapo and Sarbanes which added $3.5 billion. I \nthink that would be more than adequate. We are way over the President's \nbudget, considering that amendment.\n  I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, our brownfield legislation was very \nsuccessful. Nothing is adequately funded, but this comes very close to \nbeing adequately funded. We put out an amendment to include the \npetroleum sites which doubles the scope of the brownfields program.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I do not \nbelieve it is necessary to have this additional amount of money. I ask \nyou to defeat the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 423.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, outside of the education of children, \nAmerican families are most concerned about whether they have health \ninsurance coverage. President Bush, in his budget, requested of the \nCongress some $89 billion. In the budget before us now, it has only $50 \nbillion. This amendment brings the budget up to what President Bush had \nasked for. It makes no judgment about the form of any health insurance \nprogram. I am hopeful we can put this on our agenda and respond to an \noverwhelming concern of American families. This would provide an \nimportant downpayment to make sure we had some resources to begin that \nprocess.\n  I appreciate the fact that the chairman of the Budget Committee is \nwilling to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are very grateful to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for bringing this to our attention.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment for myself, \nSenators Boxer, Corzine, Chafee, Reed, Sarbanes, and Murray.\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\n  In short, if we believe that polluters should pay for the \ncontamination they cause, everybody ought to vote for this amendment. \nIt will restate the original taxes created to support the Superfund \ntrust fund as well as two additional taxes signed into law by President \nRonald Reagan in 1986. It also increases the total Federal revenues by \nat least $15 billion over 10 years and will reduce the deficit \naccordingly.\n  Without the tax, the general fund will have to contribute $1.5 \nbillion to continue the Superfund Program. We cannot afford that. But \nwe cannot abandon Superfund either.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the polluter-pays approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, of all the amendments we have been talking \nabout, this probably is the broadest tax increase of any of them. This \nis a tax increase on every business regardless of what business they \nare in, if their income tax shows $2 million or more. It has nothing to \ndo with polluters. It also has a tax increase of 9.7 percent per barrel \nin excise oil and somewhere between 50 cents and $10 a ton in \nfeedstocks. Right now we are getting the highest amount of cleanups and \nyet we have the lowest amount in the fund. It is really not needed now. \nThis is not polluters pay. This is not a tax on polluters. This is a \ntax on people who do not pollute. The responsible parties are being \nheld liable today.\n  We had a hearing on it in our Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThey are all being held responsible. They are cleaning up the \npollution. I urge a ``no'' vote on this tax increase proposal of \nSenator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired. The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 408.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment, offered by myself and \nSenator Bingaman, will restore funding for vocational education to its \n2003 appropriations level for the next 10 years. The chairman's mark \ncuts this program by 25 percent from its 2003 level.\n  We often talk about education, and many times we act as if every \nsingle child in this country is going to go to college and graduate \nschool, and we do not pay enough attention or give due regard to those \npeople who do the technical work that keeps this country going from day \nto day.\n  The President has proposed a new vocational educational program which \nwill place many new demands on the technical training infrastructure. \nThese lofty goals deserve an adequate investment. Slashing funding by \none-quarter will undermine the chances of our high schools and \ncommunity colleges being able to fulfill their obligations to these \nstudents. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to cast this vote in favor of \ntechnical vocational education and to support the infrastructure in our \nhigh schools and community colleges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CREGG. We are now participating in the theater of uncontrolled \nspending. We have already added to education--we are $4 billion above \nwhere the Democratic budget was last year. We have a spending bill \nwhich is presently $8 billion above the actual appropriation level for \nlast year. We are at a number which is 15.3 percent over what was spent \nlast year. We have added massive amounts of money into the educational \nspending accounts at a level which can only be concluded as being not \nonly reasonable but maybe even beyond our capacity to get the money out \nto the school districts and the people who are involved in this area.\n  To continue to add money to these educational accounts is really the \ntheater of uncontrolled spending. By ``theater,'' I mean in the term of \nshow because it is not substance any longer that we are dealing with; \nit is simply the purposes of show. Let's try to be fiscally responsible \nand defeat this amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 424. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask Senator Biden be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the cosponsors of this amendment:\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\nSenators Biden, Feinstein, DeWine, Hagel, Chafee, Smith, Jeffords, and \nKennedy.\n  My amendment would increase the foreign affairs account by $1.15 \nbillion, using section 920 of the budget as an offset. This would \nrestore foreign affairs spending to the amount requested by President \nBush.\n  We are engaged in a worldwide war against terrorism and a regional \nwar against Iraq. We should grant the Commander in Chief's funding \nrequests for the accounts that pay for our diplomats' assistance to key \nallies, food aid, nonproliferation efforts, public diplomacy, and other \ntools that will contribute to victory now and a better world later. I \nask the Senate to join me in restoring the funds the President has \nrequested.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by myself and my colleague from Indiana, Senator \nLugar, to restore the international affairs function 150 account to the \nPresident's request. I firmly believe that if we are to win the war \nagainst terror and decrease global poverty, we must use every tool at \nour disposal to do so.\n  At the constituent breakfasts I hold every Thursday in Washington, \nDC, for visiting Californians, I often ask: ``What percentage of the \nFederal Budget do you think we spend on foreign aid?'' The answers are \nfascinating and thought provoking: Some say 10 percent, others offer 15 \npercent, and even some think 20 percent is the right answer.\n  My constituents are surprised--even shocked--when I tell them that, \nin fact, the United States spends less than 1 percent of our budget on \nforeign aid. That is less than half of what it was just 15 years ago \nand it is barely 0.1 percent of GDP. The United States spends less than \n$30 a year for each of its citizens helping those in the developing \nworld, compared with a median per capita of $70 by other industrialized \nnations.\n  In fact, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, the United States in recent years ranks next to last among \n21 industrialized donor countries in per capita foreign assistance.\n  Most Americans, however, recognize the benefits of foreign aid and \nsupport a robust international assistance package. A survey conducted \nby the Program on International Policy Attitudes of the University of \nMaryland found that, on average, Americans believe that 14 percent is \nan appropriate percentage of the Federal budget for foreign aid.\n  While we are far from that mark, I was pleased that President Bush \nannounced last year before a summit in Monterrey, Mexico, an important \nnew initiative to begin to restore the foreign aid budget to the high \nwater mark of the cold war years and increase foreign assistance \nspending by $5 billion over the next 3 years\n  In announcing the program he stated,\n\n       The advancement of development is a central commitment of \n     American foreign policy . . . We work for prosperity and \n     opportunity because they are right. It's the right thing to \n     do. We also work for prosperity and opportunity because they \n     help defeat terror.\n\n  I and a bipartisan group of 35 other Senators wrote to President Bush \nto express our strong support for his initiative and to urge him to \nmake a substantial first commitment to that effort in his fiscal year \n2004 budget request.\n  That request, announced in February, contained $28.5 billion for the \ninternational affairs budget, including increased spending for the \nfight against HIV/AIDS and $1.3 billion for the proposed millennium \nchallenge account.\n  I was disappointed, then, that the budget resolution passed out of \nthe Budget Committee cut $1.15 billion from the President's request and \nreduced funding for the millennium challenge account to $300 million. \nSenator Lugar and I have drafted an amendment to restore the \nPresident's request of $28.5 billion.\n  In fact, I strongly believe that the United States should devote \nadditional funds above the President's request to the international \naffairs budget. However, under the current fiscal circumstances and in \nthe context of this budget, I understand that meeting the President's \nrequest is the best opportunity to make a statement about the \nimportance of increasing foreign assistance.\n  I understand that the offset used in this amendment--the function 920 \naccount--is not ideal, but we must move forward on our commitment to \nbuild a robust international affairs budget, and the Lugar/Feinstein \namendment is the best vehicle to do so at this time.\n  Restoring the President's international affairs budget request is key \nto protecting our national security and our standing as a leader in the \neffort to reduce global poverty. The Senate, by accepting this \namendment, will rise to the challenge.\n  As the men and women of our Armed Forces prepare to go into harm's \nway, we are reminded once again about the serious costs--in financial \nand human terms--of military conflict and postwar reconstruction. We \nwill be doing our soldiers, sailors, and airmen a grave disservice if \nwe do not make every effort to avoid the need for such conflicts in the \nfuture.\n  Our foreign aid budget, at a dramatically smaller cost and loss of \nlife, can protect our national interests and the safety and security of \nall Americans.\n  One of the tragic mistakes of the post-cold-war era was the fact that \nthe United States turned its back on Afghanistan after the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union. We shifted our attention elsewhere, and the Taliban \nand al-Qaida moved in. The Afghan people, especially women and girls, \nsuffered under a brutal dictatorship and terrorist camps flourished.\n  We are all aware of the consequences. We spent billions to remove the \nTaliban from power and it will cost billions more to rebuild \nAfghanistan. However costly an aid package would have been for the \npeople of Afghanistan at the end of the cold war, it certainly would \nnot have compared with the costs we have met so far.\n  No one doubts the strength of our Armed Forces. Our service men and \nwomen are the best in the world and the military component is key to \ndefeating al-Qaida and other international terrorist organizations. Yet \nour troops cannot do the job on their own and we will not win the war \non terror without making use of all the tools at our disposal to \nprovide safety and security for all Americans.\n  By fulfilling President Bush's request and increasing the foreign aid \nbudget, we will attack the conditions that foster terrorism in the \ndeveloping world: poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and illness.\n  Terrorists prey on the hopelessness, anger, fear, and alienation of \nthe poor and provide an easy way out of the misery of the developing \nworld. Foreign aid by providing education, health care, shelter, and \nfood promotes tolerance, understanding, and political stability.\n  Such attitudes and conditions are crucial if we are to help build \nprosperous democracies who will then become important allies and \npartners in facing a wide range of global challenges in addition to \nterrorism: Narcotics trafficking, the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction, aiding refugees, and building market economies. And we can \nbuild such allies far cheaper through a robust foreign aid budget than \nthrough costly military interventions.\n  Foreign aid not only protects our national security, it promotes the \nbest of America and American values and sustains our influence in the \nworld. Simply put, it brings out the best of who we are as a people.\n  Imagine a child in the developing world who attends a school built \nwith American assistance, who studies textbooks purchased with American \nassistance, and who eats a meal provided by American assistance. How \neffective will the words of terrorists be on such a child? How prone to \nanti-Americanism will that child be?\n  Former German Chancellor Helumt Kohl often spoke of his memories as a \nchild in postwar Germany, receiving soup off of an army truck from an \nAmerican soldier. This is what foreign aid does: It gives hope to those \nwho have none and shows them that Americans care.\n  In the days and weeks ahead, we will witness the power of our Armed \nForces. By passing this amendment, the Senate will demonstrate the \npower of American goodwill and our commitment to helping those in need \nand safeguarding our own interests. This is a significant first step \nfor the United States to reclaim its status as a leader in providing \nforeign assistance, and I look\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nforward to working with my colleagues and the administration to build \non this initiative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I urge everyone to vote for this \namendment. This would restore the President's number for the Millennium \nChallenge account. This account is very specific. It is to go for \neconomic assistance and improvements in undeveloped countries. I think \nall of us know that our budget in this area is surprisingly small. We \nrank next to last in industrialized countries. As Mr. Lugar has so ably \npointed out, the Iraq war should show us the need, indeed, is great.\n  I hope everyone on this side of the aisle will vote to restore this \n$1.15 billion and offset it with the account 920.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment and urge its support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 400) was agreed to.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for the \npurpose of offering an amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Which amendment is this?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the budget resolution before us eliminates \n46 important education programs, programs such as rural education, \ndropout prevention, arts education, the Carol M. White Physical \nEducation for Progress, Gifted and Talented, Ready To Learn, the \nNational Writing Project, Parental Assistance Information Centers, a \nnumber of them--46 programs that have been broadly supported by both \nthe House and the Senate on the Republican and Democratic sides.\n  These are programs that go to meet certain specific kinds of needs \nlike rural education, where small schools do not have the wherewithal \nto get in grants. They do not have the economies of scale. They have \nspecific transportation needs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator is \nentitled to be heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what this amendment will do--it does not \nadd any money. It simply restores these programs. It would be $2.2 \nbillion the first year, $24 billion over 10 years, offset by a \nreduction in the tax cut. All it does is simply restore the programs.\n  I assume some of these will be restored as we go through the process. \nBut if we don't have it in the budget, that means we are going to take \nit out of title I, we are going to take it out of special education, \nand other areas. Let's put the money in there now to pay for these \nprograms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as the Senator from Iowa well knows, this \nbill does not eliminate any programs. As the Senator from Iowa well \nknows, this bill sets a number, a gross number, that we will spend on \neducation. However, what the Senator from Iowa doesn't appear to know \nis that this bill is already $8.1 billion above where his bill was when \nhe reported it out of committee just 3 months ago.\n  I am wondering why we need to continue to put money into programs to\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\nwhich there is a significant commitment already. It is time to bring \ndown the curtain on this theater of spending.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we all know, consumer confidence is at \nits record lowest level in 10 years. There are 300,000 Americans who \nlost their jobs in February alone--2.5 million in the last 2 years. \nState and local governments are in trouble. Families and businesses are \nhaving trouble. We are running Federal deficits as far as the eye can \nsee. And we are at war.\n  My amendment tries to avoid saddling the next generations with debt \nby offering a $150 billion tax cut to average Americans over the course \nof the next 2 years, contemplating a payroll tax holiday, paid for in \nthe outyears.\n  It will strengthen our economy by putting money as a stimulus into \nthe pockets of Americans now. And it does not take a dime out of Social \nSecurity or Medicare.\n  We can give every American worker $750 this year. If you are married \nwith children and are both working, you would get $1,500, which is more \nthan with the Bush tax cut, without any of the negative impact in the \nlong run.\n  It does not raise taxes. It simply avoids going forward with the \nworst components of the President's proposal. It is not a tax increase; \nit is simply not giving the cut, which is unwise and nonstimulative and \ntakes from our children.\n  I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts would not only gut the growth package, it would gut the \namended growth package, the Breaux bill. It cuts it in half. I urge our \ncolleagues to vote no.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, for anyone to believe repealing a tax cut already \nsigned into law is not a tax increase is a serious mistake.\n  Second, this is a provision that would cut payroll taxes. To suggest \nthat will not undermine the strength of the Social Security trust fund \nis also a mistake. We cannot pretend that payroll taxes do not go into \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  And third, if my colleagues are really concerned about deficits, then \nwe need to do two things: We need to encourage economic growth, and \nthis amendment will not do that; second, we need to control spending.\n  As my colleague from New Hampshire has made clear, we are in a \ntheater of spending right now: increasing spending, increasing debts, \nand deficits. This isn't the approach we should be taking.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 397.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Smith, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 285.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, March 19, 2003, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, this amendment, which is a bipartisan \namendment, cosponsored by Senator Biden of Delaware, Senator Snowe of \nMaine, Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Bayh of Indiana, and myself is \nsimply a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that when we come back with a\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\ntax proposal, it ought to increase the deductibility of college \ntuition.\n  As you know, we worked 2 years ago and this year for the first time \ntuition is deductible, $3,000. It goes up to $4,000 in 2004.\n  This amendment is a sense of the Senate, a bipartisan amendment that \nurges that tuition deductibility be raised from $3,000 to $8,000 in the \nyear 2003, and from $4,000 to $12,000 in the year 2004 and the years \nthereafter. The high cost of tuition, we know, is a huge burden, \nparticularly on middle-class families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as Senator Conrad and I both stated a \ncouple times, we do not write the tax bill. That is going to be up to \nthe Finance Committee. That being said, we have no objection and are \nhappy to accept the amendment by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 285) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nBayh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 426\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on low income programs and \n          the income tax on certain Social Security benefits)\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk for \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh], for himself, Mr. \n     Schumer, and Mrs. Lincoln, proposes an amendment numbered \n     426.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue with the reading of \nthe amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on low income programs and \n          the income tax on certain Social Security benefits)\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME \n                   PROGRAMS AND THE INCOME TAX ON CERTAIN SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY BENEFITS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the final budget \n     conference report should not include any net reduction in \n     funding below current baseline levels for programs that \n     assist low income working families, and that repeal of the \n     1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits can be \n     accommodated within the revenue totals and instructions of \n     this resolution, in a manner that does not reduce the \n     solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part \n     A of Medicare.).\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator \nSchumer, and Senator Lincoln. This expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits should be \nrepealed. It is similar to the amendment offered by Senator Bunning \nbecause it accomplishes this objective in a more fiscally responsive \nway because it instructs the Finance Committee to accomplish this \nwithin the context of the current tax cut rather than adding to it.\n  It helps Social Security beneficiaries, it cuts taxes, and it does so \nin a fiscally responsible way. I ask for its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, we already dealt with whether we should \ntax Social Security. I call upon my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, this is an absolute zero amendment. It \nis a sense of the Senate, which means nothing in law. The amendment we \nvoted on earlier had the direct effect on $146 billion which is the \namount of money that would have been reduced from the tax base if we \ndid what we said we were going to do on the Social Security reduction \nfrom 85 percent to 50 percent, with the instructions to the Finance \nCommittee to do just that. This amendment does absolutely nothing to \ncorrect that situation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, the pending amendment offered by our \ncolleague from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, proposes to create a sense of the \nSenate which is precatory and thus not germane. This language is not \ngermane to the measure now before the Senate. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  Mr. BAYH. To offer any language that is precatory pursuant to section \n904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the \napplicable sessions of that act for purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I thank my colleagues for their \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 101 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Miller\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is a very important amendment \nthat would restore $678 million to workforce training programs that is \nvital to America in a time of high unemployment. The underlying bill \nbasically cuts these funds and, instead, gives them to a tax cut for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  What is really important for us to understand is that we have had \nreport after report that in the Information Technology area there are \nmore jobs to be had if we had skilled workers who had the training to \nwork in this areas, and the same is true for the nursing and health \ncare fields. According to the American Hospital Association there are \nover 126,000 openings in nursing, yet we are cutting the training \nprograms that could retrain thousands of unemployed workers who could \nfill these openings. By cutting funding for workforce training, we are \neliminating the opportunity for 65,000 Americans to receive training.\n  So where do these jobs go instead, I know because I have had \nfirsthand experience as an employer. You go find the workers and \nsometimes they are from overseas. So by cutting workforce training, we \nare sending a message that instead of retraining our dislocated and \nunemployed workers we would rather have the Department of Labor issue \nmore labor certifications so that these jobs can be filled by \nforeigners.\n  Please vote for this amendment to restore the funds so that the \nworkforce level in this country will at least be at 2002 levels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, this amendment would increase spending \nby $678 million. I might mention, we have $6.6 billion of $8 billion in \na block grant that has not even been used yet by the States.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, much has been made about deficits. I \njust want to know what the Senate has accomplished today--I should \nargue, what the Democrats have tried to accomplish.\n  As you can see from these charts, this is a list of the Democratic \namendments that were voted on today. They add up to a 10-year cost of \n$666 billion in brand new Federal spending, for which, as you can see \nby these votes, the vast majority of Democrats voted. If this amendment \nis agreed to, at least on the Democratic side, that number will go to \n$675 billion in new spending over the next 10 years.\n  Compare that to what we want to do, which is a very modest reduction \nin taxes over those 10 years, and you see the same spending priorities \nversus giving money back to taxpayers--the same amount of money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  We had not gotten up to $726 billion. We had it paid for until you--\n--\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 382.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning funding for \n                 children's graduate medical education)\n\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILDREN'S GRADUATE \n                   MEDICAL EDUCATION.\n\n         (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n         (1) children's hospitals provide excellent care for \n     children;\n         (2) the importance of children's hospitals extends to the \n     health care of all children throughout the United States;\n         (3) making up only 1 percent of all hospitals, \n     independent children's hospitals train almost 30 percent of \n     all pediatricians and 50 percent of all pediatric \n     specialists;\n         (4) children's hospitals provide over 50 percent of the \n     hospital care in the United States for children with serious \n     illness, including needing cardiatric surgery, children with \n     cancer, and children with cerebral palsy; and\n         (5) children's hospitals are important centers for \n     pediatric research and the major pipeline for future \n     pediatric researchers.\n         (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, for fiscal year 2004, children's graduate medical \n     education should be funded at $305,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support my Sense of \nthe Senate amendment, advocating full fiscal year 2004 funding--$305 \nmillion--for children's hospitals graduate medical education programs.\n  This funding for pediatric GME is a vital part of our efforts to \nprotect children's health. Today, children's hospitals--though they \nrepresent only one percent of all hospitals--train 30 percent of all \npediatricians and 50 percent of all pediatric specialists. And, they \nalso provide hospital care to almost 50 percent of seriously ill \nchildren. Furthermore, children's hospitals serve as the healthcare \nsafety net for low-income children in their respective communities and \nare often the sole regional providers of many critical pediatric \nservices.\n  These children's hospitals are often the only source of many \npediatric specialty services. And it is their graduate training \nprograms that make these services possible. Funding for this training--\nfunding for pediatric graduate medical education--helps provide our \nNation with highly qualified pediatricians, who can properly treat and \ncare for our children when they are sick.\n  Congress took a remarkable step when it fully funded this program in \nFY2002 and again in FY2003. Now, for the first time, the independent \nchildren's hospitals have the same Federal support for their teaching \nprograms that other teaching hospitals were receiving through Medicare. \nIt has saved many children's hospitals from being forced to reduce \ntheir physician training or cut other services.\n  Clearly, funding for GME in children's hospitals is a sound \ninvestment in children's health and provides stability for the future \nof the pediatric workforce. Please join me in support of continued full \nfunding for children's hospitals graduate medical education.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 354) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 355\n\n  Mr. DeWine.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR CRIMINAL \n                   JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) bipartisan efforts have led to success in the fight \n     against crime and improvements in the administration of \n     justice;\n       (2) Congress steadily increased funding for crime \n     identification technologies between 1994 and 2003; and\n       (3) a strong commitment to improve crime identification \n     technologies is still needed.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funding levels in this resolution assume that the \n     programs authorized under the Crime Identification Technology \n     Act of 1998 to improve the justice system will be fully \n     funded at the levels authorized for each of the fiscal years \n     2004 through 2007.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in support \nof an amendment that Senator Leahy and I are offering to express the \nSense of the Senate that we should fund the Crime Identification \nTechnology Act at its authorized level of $250 million through the year \n2007.\n  CITA provides State and local law enforcement with the much-needed \nresources to make improvements in anti-crime technology. CITA has \nstreamlined a patchwork of Federal funding programs, giving the \nDepartment of Justice greater flexibility to make grant awards to \nStates and localities for their specific anti-crime technology needs. \nWhat we are talking about is DNA items. We are talking about \nballistics. We are talking about all kinds of crime technology items \nthat really go to the heart and soul of our fight against crime today.\n  This single Federal funding stream allows States and localities to \nmake improvements in 17 different areas relating to crime-fighting \ntechnology, including automated fingerprint background checks, \nballistics testing, DNA-testing, domestic violence information systems, \nand automated criminal history systems.\n  Quick and efficient access to information is crucial to solving and \npreventing crimes and protecting our communities. And access to state-\nof-the-art technology means access to information. Whether it's \nmatching fingerprints or DNA samples or bullets from a gun, law \nenforcement personnel--police officers and prosecutors and scientists \nin crime labs--all rely on technology to do their jobs.\n  America can no longer afford to fight 21st Century crime with 20th \nCentury tools and technology. This amendment would demonstrate our \nsupport for giving our State and local law enforcement access to the \npractical tools they need to do their jobs. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Ohio for \nhis amendment. I urge my colleagues to accept it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are willing to take the amendment on this side as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 355) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 427\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Hatch and Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Hatch and \n     Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 427.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that of the functional \n  totals in this resolution assume that up to $20,000,000 from funds \ndesignated, but not obligated, for travel and administrative expenses, \n  from drug interdiction activities should be used for drug addiction \n treatment programs that utilize substances that block the craving for \n heroin and that are newly approved for such use by the Food and Drug \n                            Administration)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR DRUG \n                   TREATMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in \n     this resolution assume that up to $20,000,000 from funds \n     designated, but not obligated, for travel and administrative \n     expenses, from drug interdiction activities should be used \n     for service-oriented targeted grants for the utilization of \n     substances that block the craving for heroin and that are \n     newly approved for such use by the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nstating that $20 million in drug interdiction funds shall be used for \ndrug addiction treatment programs that utilize substances that block \nthe craving for heroin and that are newly approved for such use by the \nFDA.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of a bipartisan \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that Senator Levin and I are offering. \nHere is what the amendment does:\n  We ask that it be the sense of the Senate that up to $20 million of \nany unused travel or other administrative funds designated, but not \nobligated, for drug interdiction activities be used for a grant program \nthat helps disseminate innovative anti-heroin medications recently \napproved by the FDA.\n  Not one penny of drug interdiction funds will be taken away; our \namendment only asks the Senate to go on record as supporting the use of \nunobligated drug interdiction travel or administrative funds to help \ndistribute and get out the word on a new class of drug addiction \ntreatments.\n  This amendment builds upon the Drug Addiction Treatment Act that \nallows qualified doctors the ability to treat a limited number of \nheroin addicts in an office setting. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nwill send a signal to the private sector to invest in developing new \ndrug treatments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Hatch and I have \noffered, which the Senate has adopted, is a life-saving amendment. It \nwill help to mend broken lives and shattered families that are living \nwith the scourge of drug addiction and are struggling to rid themselves \nof this dreadful disease. Our sense of the Senate amendment supports \n$20 million in fiscal year 2004 for drug treatment programs that \nutilize a newly FDA approved substance called buprenorphine, which \nblocks the craving for heroin.\n  The costs of substance abuse treatment are minimal when compared to \nthe resulting savings. According to a national study of treatment \nprograms that are funded by HHS's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, \nthe average savings per individual in the year after treatment was \napproximately $9,200--more than three times the average cost of one \ntreatment period. Another study by the RAND Corporation found that \ntreatment is 10 times more cost effective than interdiction in reducing \nsocietal costs of certain illegal drugs.\n  The U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has estimated \nthat 57 percent of those who need drug treatment do not receive it, \ndespite its proven cost effectiveness over criminal justice approaches \nin reducing drug abuse and related social costs. Another ONDCP study, \nreleased in January of 2002, found that illegal drugs drain $160 \nbillion a year from the American economy; and that the majority of \nthese costs, $98.5 billion, stem from lost productivity due to drug-\nrelated illnesses and deaths, as well as incarcerations and work hours \nmissed by victims of crime. The report also found that illegal drug use \ncost the health-care industry $12.9 billion in 1998. The $20 million \nassumed in our amendment pales in comparison to these sums, yet this \nmodest funding will reap huge benefits in lowering illicit drug use, by \nproviding funding for up to 60 new drug treatment projects, utilizing \nnew FDA approved substances that block the craving of heroin.\n  Again, I am pleased that the Senate has adopted our much-needed \namendment. It has the potential of opening the door to tens of \nthousands of individuals who seek to rid themselves of their addiction \nto heroin, through the use of the anti-addiction medication called \nbuprenorphine, which was approved last year by the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 427) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just before the last amendment, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania held up a series of charts purporting to be \ntotal spending advocated by our side of the aisle during the budget \nconsideration. I have no idea where he got those numbers from because \nthey bear no relationship to what has been offered on this side.\n  No. 1, we did not offer a package of spending increases. We offered a \nseries of amendments that were offered one at a time to increase \nresources for education, for homeland security, for national defense, \nand a series of other national priorities. Again, they were not offered \nas a package.\n  Even if one were to consider them a package, they do not add up to \n$675 billion or $650 billion or $400 billion or $300 billion. It is \n$231 billion--$231 billion--all of it paid for by reducing the size of \nthe tax cuts being proposed by the other side. The President proposed \n$1.6 trillion in tax cuts. The budget resolution offered over $1.3 \ntrillion out of the committee. It was over $1.3 trillion.\n  The budget substitute I offered on our side reduced the deficit \nincluded in the President's budget by over $1.2 trillion. Yes, we had \nsome additional spending, very modest. Over the 10 years, we would go \nto a total spending as a percentage of GDP at 19.3 percent compared to \nthe budget resolution offered by our colleagues on the other side of \n18.8 percent, so slightly more spending over the years for education, \nfor homeland security, for national defense, and we paid for the war in \nour substitute.\n  This series of charts that were held up by the Senator from \nPennsylvania bear no relationship in fact to amendments that were \noffered today by our side. I repeat, those amendments were not offered \nas a package. They were offered individually. Even if you count them \nall, they add up to $231 billion. Again, you cannot do that either \nbecause they were not offered as a package. Many of them were defeated. \nSo if you offer a subsequent amendment, you cannot then add that to a \ndefeated amendment.\n  I do not know where he ever came up with the number $675 billion \nbecause it bears absolutely no relationship to what occurred today.\n  I thought it was important to set the record straight, Mr. President. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I might later go into what the amendments \nwere. I think right now I would like to complete this day. It has been \na long day, but a productive day at least, working our way through the \namendments.\n  For the information of our colleagues, I believe there are eight \namendments still pending on the Democratic side. We worked through 32 \namendments. We still have a few amendments pending on the Republican \nside. I am not sure if any of those will require a rollcall vote--\npossibly one or two, maybe more, but I doubt it. So we are well \npositioned to complete action, as we committed to do, by 4 o'clock \ntomorrow afternoon.\n  I thank all of our colleagues. I think the tenor of the debate was \npositive. I did not agree with the outcome on one or two of the \namendments, but that is part of the legislative process.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 425\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to comment briefly on my vote \nagainst Senator Harkin's amendment this afternoon. I do so because I \nwas faced with a very difficult decision. I care very deeply about the \neducation programs that would be funded through this amendment, \nprograms that include afterschool programs and vocational education \nprograms. These are\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\ncritical programs in schools across my State, and I hope we find a way \nto fund them.\n  But I am forced to vote against this amendment because of another \nconcern--my concern with mounting deficits.\n  The budget resolution brought before us includes tax cuts that total \n$1.3 trillion. The budget also proposes that $725 billion of these tax \ncuts be enacted immediately, under the reconciliation process.\n  Two years ago, we passed a $1.3 trillion tax cut. I supported that \ntax cut. But those were different times. We had a surplus. We did not \nforesee the significant decline in revenues, or the deficits that \nfollowed.\n  This is not the time to reduce revenues by $725 billion. It would \nhurt our budget and our economy.\n  Why is $725 billion in tax cuts inappropriate at this time?\n  The most crucial problem is that it is not paid for. The budget \nresolution brought before us forecasts enormous deficits for almost the \nnext decade. Reducing revenues by $725 billion adds to the already \nmounting deficits.\n  In order to prevent the passage of tax cuts that would drive up the \ndeficit and hurt our economy, I believe that we must reduce the size of \nthis tax cut.\n  I joined three of my colleagues in a letter that laid out these \nconcerns--we pledged that we would not agree to tax cuts above $350 \nbillion. This is crucial. The Budget Committee approved $725 billion in \ntax cuts, and brought it to the Senate floor. Along with my colleagues, \nI promised to vote to bring this number down by $375 billion.\n  In a narrowly divided Senate, it is important that both parties work \ntogether to come up with the appropriate spending and revenue targets \nfor the budget. That is why I worked with both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Together, we came up with a target of $350 billion for \nthis tax cut, and we agreed that we would all stick to that number.\n  As part of our commitment to try to reduce the size of the tax cut \napproved by the Budget Committee, we also agreed that we would not try \nto reduce the size of the tax cut below $350 billion. That means I am \nforced to make difficult decisions. In order to keep my commitment to a \nmore responsible tax cut, I have to vote against funding priorities \nlike the one presented by Senator Harkin.\n  During tough times, we must make tough choices. I chose to commit to \na responsible tax cut. A tax cut that will prevent worsening deficits \nthat would hurt our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4372-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \nhero--to one of the first Americans to have fallen in combat in Iraq \nand make the ultimate sacrifice. His name: Jose Gutierrez, a lance \ncorporal in the United States Marine Corps. He was just 22 years old.\n  Corporal Gutierrez arrived in the United States when he was a 16 year \nold orphan, having left poverty-stricken circumstances in Guatemala \nCity and a country racked by a brutal civil war.\n  He traveled over 2,000 miles by foot, north through Mexico, in search \nof a better life here in the United States.\n  Like so many immigrants, his past was soon eclipsed by his new life \nas an American. He was taken in by the Mosquera family of Lomita, CA. \nNora and Max Mosquera had begun helping immigrant foster children when \ntheir own children had grown.\n  ``He joined the Marines to pay back a little of what he'd gotten from \nthe U.S.,'' Max Mosquera said. ``For him it was a question of honor.''\n  A tall and quiet young man who enjoyed soccer and chess, Jose learned \nEnglish quickly and had plans to study architecture.\n  He became an infantry rifleman with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine \nRegiment. He enlisted exactly 1 year ago, on March 25, 2002, and \narrived at Camp Pendleton, CA, in early September.\n  Corporal Gutierrez died in battle, around 4 a.m. on Friday. He was \nstruck by enemy fire while fighting alongside fellow marines near the \nsouthern Iraqi port city of Umm al Qasr.\n  ``He was such a good kid,'' remembered Robert Nobles, a physical \neducation teacher at North High in Torrance, where Corporal Gutierrez \ngraduated in 2000.\n  I have been told that news of his death has resonated throughout \nGuatemala. Every major newspaper, radio and TV station carried his \nstory. He has been portrayed as a brave and selfless young man--which \nhe most certainly was.\n  I have also heard that it has been difficult to locate his one blood \nrelative, his sister, who still lives in poverty in Guatemala City. The \nsister is arranging to have his body sent back to Guatemala, whereas a \nsocial worker in Los Angeles, Wendy Perlera, an acquaintance of \nCorporal Gutierrez, wants to bring his body back to L.A.\n  Wherever Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez is finally laid to rest--in \nthe country of his birth or the country which he was willing to give \nhis life for--he will not be forgotten.\n  Our thought and our prayers are with his family--with his sister in \nGuatemala and with the Mosquera family, who provided him with the \nemotional and financial support to pursue his dreams.\n  The fact that he died so young--just 22--is tragic. Indeed, the loss \nof any young life is a tragedy. The fact that he was willing to fight--\nand die--for his adopted homeland, has earned him the lasting \nadmiration of Americans everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4372-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 8, \n2001, in Valencia, CA. A Sikh liquor store shopkeeper was severely \nbeaten by two men. The men first entered the store and asked the \nvictim, ``Are you Osama bin Laden?'' He tried to explain that he was a \nSikh and had no association with Bin Laden. The men struck him \nrepeatedly with metal poles, causing serious head injuries. The \nshopkeeper managed to escape his attackers after pushing a shelf over \non top of them, knocking them down.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4372-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4372-S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the designation of \nMarch 25, 2003, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of \nCelebration of Greek and American Democracy.\n  As in previous years, I welcome the opportunity to honor the \ndemocratic values and lasting friendship that bind our nations. Our \ncommon struggle to protect freedom and democracy at home and around the \nworld has forged a strong partnership between Greece and the United \nStates, a partnership which is critical to meeting today's challenges.\n  On the international front, Greece has played an important role in \nOperation Enduring Freedom and is now working with its European Union \npartners to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Greece continues \nto be a leader in bringing stability to the Balkans and in guiding the \ncountries of this former region of conflict toward the community of \ndemocracies in Europe. Greece has been a steadfast ally in the fight \nagainst international terrorism, responding to every request for \nassistance in tracking and disrupting terrorist networks.\n  Greece has been actively pursuing security on the home front as well. \nIn the last year, we welcomed the arrest in\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nGreece of 19 suspected members of ``November 17,'' a terrorist group \nresponsible for approximately 120 criminal acts over a 27-year period, \nincluding the murder of Greeks, Americans, and citizens of other \ncountries. For too many years, this case remained unsolved and the \ncriminals unpunished. I am heartened by the efforts of the Government \nof Greece to move quickly to prosecute the suspects. The authorities in \nGreece must now accelerate efforts to bring charges against those \nsuspects responsible for the 1983 killing of CAPT George Tsantes, USN, \nwho is survived by his wife Thalia Panos; his sons George K. Tsantes, \nIII, and Nicolas P. Tsantes; and by his daughter Stephanie Tsantes, a \ndistinguished citizen of the State of Delaware. Prosecution of this and \nother such cases will, I hope, bring a measure of closure and justice \nto all the families of the victims of ``November 17.''\n  Greece is now preparing to host the Summer Olympics in 2004--a \nchallenge under the best of circumstances, a Herculean task in today's \nsecurity environment. Working with the international community, \nincluding the United States, Greece has made unprecedented efforts to \nprovide for safe and secure Olympic Games in 2004. And it has done so \nwith great attention to preserving its 3,000 year-old cultural \npatrimony, the glory of the Hellenic past and present.\n  Greece has wisely chosen the theme ``Our Europe: Sharing the Future \nin a Community of Values'' to define its current term in the rotating \nPresidency of the European Union. In emphasizing the enlargement and \ntransformation of the European Union, Greece will lead the efforts to \ncreate an even stronger European partner of the United States, a \npartner committed to protecting and promoting the fundamental values of \nfreedom and democracy.\n  In designating March 25, 2003, as Greek Independence Day: A National \nDay of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, we honor both a \nproud heritage and our commitment to continued partnership and \ncooperation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today we honor the 182nd anniversary of \nthe independence of Greece. Nearly two centuries ago a band of \ndetermined and courageous Greek patriots rose against tremendous odds \nto end nearly four centuries of oppressive foreign domination of their \nhomeland. Their arduous struggle continued for 8 years, until \nindependence was at last secured in 1829, and the first steps were \ntaken toward the establishment of the modern Greek state.\n  Our Founding Fathers drew heavily on the political experience and \nphilosophy of the ancient Greeks, who first developed the principles of \ndemocratic government that vest the supreme governing authority in the \npeople. Barely a generation later, Greek patriots turned to the \nAmerican Revolution for inspiration, seeing in the success of the new \nAmerican Republic the promise of their own future.\n  For nearly 200 years, the American and Greek peoples have shared a \nprofound commitment to democratic principles, and have worked to create \nsocieties built on these principles. The United States and Greece have \nstood together in every major struggle for freedom and democracy: \nthrough two devastating World Wars, and through the long decades of the \ncold war. Today they are joined in the fight against terrorism, notably \nas Greece moves in cooperation with U.S. and international law \nenforcement agencies to root out and dismantle the November 17 \nterrorist organization and bring its members to justice.\n  Greece today is a vigorous and prosperous democracy, a solid partner \nof the United States, a full member of NATO and of the European Union. \nCurrently serving as President of the EU, Greece has focused its \nefforts on promoting peace and stability in the Balkans and the Eastern \nMediterranean. For many nations in these regions seeking to develop \nviable economic systems and democratic institutions, Greece serves as a \nmodel. Greece has worked hard and with extraordinary success in recent \nyears to expand cross-cultural understanding and reduce longstanding \ntensions in the Greek-Turkish relationship. Indeed, in recognition of \nits expanding role in the world community, Greece was chosen to host \nthe next Olympic games, which are scheduled to take place in Athens in \n2004 and which will bring millions of visitors to Greece from all over \nthe world.\n  There is another essential aspect to the U.S.-Greece partnership: the \ndistinctive contributions that Greek Americans have made to every \naspect of our Nation's life, in the arts, in business, in science, in \nmedicine, in scholarship. Greek immigrant families to this country \nbrought with them the traditional values of commitment to family and \nchurch, hard work and education, and Greek Americans have carried these \nvalues forward; they have helped to strengthen and invigorate \ncommunities everywhere across the land.\n  Greek Independence Day is a time of celebration, and also a moment \nfor reflection. We see the many ways in which our country and Greece \nare drawn together, and we see how the past and the present are joined. \nThinking back to the first steps toward Greek independence, on March \n25, 1821, we are mindful of the long and twisting road traveled; of the \ncourage and sacrifice of those who have worked over the decades to make \nGreece the democratic and prosperous nation it is today; of the \nfundamental importance in our lives of the democratic institutions, \nfirst conceived and created by the ancient Greeks, that are the bedrock \nof our society and the guarantee of freedom for peoples around the \nworld.\n  Never have these institutions been more important to us. We revere \nand rejoice in them, and we commit ourselves once again to making them \nour legacy to the generations yet to come.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 182nd \nanniversary of Greek Independence that will be celebrated on Tuesday, \nMarch 25. It was on this day, March 25, 1821, that Greek patriots rose \nup against their Ottoman subjugators and began an 8-year struggle that \nculminated in a new Greek Republic in 1829.\n  On this day, it is fitting that we reflect on the enormous \ncontributions the Greek people have made to the modern world. The \nlegacy of the ancient Greeks, in the fields of philosophy, literature, \ndrama, sculpture, and architecture, continues to influence our beliefs, \nour values, and our concept of art. Our own democratic principles have \ntheir very foundation in the practices of the ancient Greece republic. \nIndeed, the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which \nthe supreme power to govern was vested in the people.\n  Greek ideology also had a profound effect on our Founding Fathers, \nwho modeled the American Government upon the principles of Greek \ndemocracy. Thomas Jefferson studied the Greek classics in his youth and \nwas inspired by their philosophy throughout his life, most dramatically \nwhen he crafted the Declaration of Independence. When formulating his \nvision for this country, Jefferson specifically referred to the \nintegrated assertions, theories, and aims of the classic Greek world.\n  Our admiration for Greece continues into the modern day. Greece and \nthe United States are at the forefront of the effort for freedom, \ndemocracy, peace, stability, and human rights, forging a close bond \nbetween the two Nations. We share a partnership with Greece in NATO, \nand our countries are linked forever by close family relationships \nbetween our peoples. Our Nation looks forward to working closely with \nGreece in the coming years as we examine ways to bring full peace, \nstability, and prosperity to all the nations of Europe and the world.\n  As we celebrate Greek independence, we remember the history of those \nwho sacrificed their lives to preserve freedom and democracy. We value \nour friendship and continuing partnership with the Government and \npeople of Greece, and we commit to work together to provide greater \nopportunity and more freedoms for the citizens of the world. And we \njoin the world in anticipating the momentous 2004 Summer Olympic Games, \nwhich will be held in Athens, the birthplace of the Olympic tradition.\n  I am proud to join many of my colleagues as a cosponsor of Senate \nResolution 214 which designates March 25, 2003 ``Greek Independence \nDay: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.'' I \ngive Greek\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nAmericans my best wishes as they celebrate Greece's independence.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two Oregon-based \nhumanitarian organizations that are preparing to offer aid to the Iraqi \ncitizens who may be displaced or who are facing hardships as a \nconsequence of Saddam Hussein's intransigence and military events in \nIraq.\n  Mercy Corps, an international relief and development organization, \nexists to alleviate suffering, poverty and oppression around the world. \nSince 1979, Mercy Corps has provided more than $640 million in \nassistance to 75 nations. Mercy Corps primarily works in countries in \ntransition from war or natural disaster or in the midst of extreme \neconomic or social transition. This group offers humanitarian \nassistance not only to meet basic needs, but helps lay the foundation \nfor peace by building local capacity and a just, inclusive civil \nsociety.\n  Mercy Corps is already mobilizing an expanded relief effort that will \ndeliver $20 million in aid to Iraq. Relief supplies for as many as \n700,000 displaced people will include crucial water, food, sanitation \nsupplies, shelter, medical care and basic items like blankets and \ncooking supplies. Mercy Corps is already delivering critical medical \ncare, shelter and reconstruction services to thousands of displaced \npeople in northern Iraq.\n  In addition, Mercy Corps is working with a consortium of other \ninternational partners, including the UN, to coordinate efforts to \nalleviate any humanitarian crisis that might arise in Iraq.\n  Representatives of northwest Medical Teams International (NWMTI), \nalso headquartered in Portland, are meeting this week with Defense \nSecretary Donald Rumsfeld to focus on the delivery and distribution of \nmedical care, food, clean water and shelter for displaced Iraqis. \nNorthwest Medical Teams International seeks to demonstrate the love of \nChrist to those in crisis by sending volunteer medical and response \nteams, distributing humanitarian aid, and providing community \ndevelopment programs and children's ministries. In particular, the \norganization provides assistance to vulnerable people suffering from \nthe consequences of war, famine, epidemics, poverty, physical illness, \ndeformities and natural disasters. Since 1979, NWMTI has sent teams or \nsupplies to more than 40 countries.\n  Northwest Medical Teams has a staff physician in Iraq, and three \nlocal medical volunteers will be joining him to provide life-saving \naid. The agency also has $40,000 in medicines to send with the team and \nwill send $20,000 to procure supplies locally in Iraq. The volunteers \nwill serve thousands of displaced people at three camps as soon as the \nareas are secure.\n  Northwest Medical Teams is also preparing to provide medicines, \nblankets and tents to large groups of Iraqis who might become displaced \ndue to the ongoing armed engagement.\n  Both of these organizations have had volunteers and staff working in \nnorthern Iraq since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4374-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       CHILDREN AND HEALTHCARE WEEK IN GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, many children face illnesses \nrequiring a hospital visit. This can be a frightening experience and \nunderscores the need to provide quality pediatric health services, \nwhile easing the stress children and their families feel. To do just \nthat, the Greenville Hospital System Children's Hospital in South \nCarolina is celebrating Children and Healthcare Week the week of March \n24th with a number of valuable activities.\n  Among the scheduled events are: continuing education classes for \nmedical residents and support staff, an awards ceremony to honor local \nindividuals who have dedicated their lives to pediatric care, a special \ntribute service to honor children, and special staff appreciation \nactivities conducted by community volunteers. Lack of quality health \ncare should never be an impediment to the long-term success of our \nchildren, and I commend Greenville's dedication to this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4374-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO RAYTHEON COMPANY EMPLOYEES IN LOUISVILLE\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to the 262 employees of Raytheon Company in Louisville, KY, for \ntheir vital role in strengthening our Nation's defense.\n  Americans remember the terrorist attack on the USS Cole on October \n12, 2000. On that tragic day we lost 17 of our best sailors and 39 more \nwere injured by a small boat laden with explosives that hit the USS \nCole as it was refueling in a Yemeni port. The Cole is now a symbol of \nour Nation's fight against terrorism to many Americans. The destroyer \nhas since been repaired and has rejoined its fleet.\n  The employees of Raytheon in Louisville have been working hard to \nprevent future attacks against our ships in the U.S. Navy and in the \nnavies of our allies across the globe. Raytheon produces the Phalanx \nBlock 1B Close In Weapon System. Phalanx is a rapid-fire, fully \ncomputerized radar and 20-mm gun system that is designed to prevent \nattacks similar to the Cole tragedy. The Phalanx protects our crews and \nships by identifying and shooting down threats from small gunboats, \nanti-ship missiles, helicopters, floating mines, and many other \nthreats.\n  This week Raytheon delivered a Phalanx Block 1B system to the USS \nCole as part of a U.S. Navy effort to upgrade its defense systems \nonboard its ships. The men and women of Raytheon work hard to produce \nthe best system possible to protect our crews and our ships. Mr. \nPresident, I am proud of the employees of Raytheon in Louisville for \ncontinuing to give the men and women serving our country the best \npossible defense to protect the USS Cole and other ships against future \nattacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4374-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4374-S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO EDWARD ZIGLER, PH.D.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant, and a wonderful friend and colleague, Dr. \nEdward Zigler, who has recently retired after 40 years as a professor \nof psychology at Yale University.\n  Dr. Zigler has been a tireless advocate for children for many years, \nand has successfully been able to take his scientific research and \napply it to society's greatest problems. Because of his expertise and \nhis commitment to our Nation's children, he has been asked to assist \nevery Presidential administration since the time of President Lyndon \nJohnson. From 1970 to 1972, Dr. Zigler was the first director of the \nU.S. Office of Child Development (now the Administration on Children, \nYouth, and Families) and Chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.\n  He is a true visionary leader who has transformed national and State \npolicies in early childhood development.\n  Edward Zigler is a Sterling Professor of Psychology, Emeritus, head \nof the psychology section of Yale's Child Study Center at the School of \nMedicine, and director of Yale's Center in Child Development and Social \nPolicy. He is the author, co-author, and editor of hundreds of \nscholarly publications and has conducted extensive studies on topics \nrelated to normal child development, child psychopathology, and mental \nretardation. He is the founder of the School of the 21st Century, which \nhas been adopted by more than 1300 schools nationwide.\n  Ed Zigler is a true pioneer in the effort to promote childhood \ndevelopment. He is the father of Head Start and has been deeply \ninvolved with every twist and turn the program has taken over the last \n38 years. He recently completed work with policymakers and the \nadministration to revise the Head Start Program Performance Standards, \nestablish Early Head Start for very young children and their families, \nand design a research agenda. He is now working with Head Start \nleadership to develop assessment measures and to expand comprehensive \nearly childhood services geared toward the development of the whole \nchild to all children not yet enrolled in school.\n  In his ongoing role as an advisor on the Head Start Program, he has \nworked with several Secretaries of: Education; Health and Human \nServices, Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW); and Labor, including \nSecretary Bennett in the Reagan administration\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\nand Secretary Riley in the Clinton administration. Currently, he is on \nSecretary Tommy Thompson's Head Start Research Committee. The fact that \nhis counsel has been sought consistently by both parties through the \nyears service serves as a testament to maintain his nonpartisan focus \non what research indicates is best for children.\n  Dr. Zigler has transformed State policies for children as well as \nnational policies. He has worked with the State of Connecticut for \ndecades and played a critical role in the establishment of Connecticut \nquality school readiness programs for low-income children. He and his \ncolleagues have repeatedly surveyed child care standards in the states \nas well as preschool programs to raise awareness of the importance of \nquality and to guide policy makers in establishing better programs.\n  Dr. Zigler regularly testified as an expert witness before \ncongressional committees and has served as a consultant to a number of \nCabinet-rank officers. In February of 2002, he testified as an expert \nwitness before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension \nin a hearing examining the science and practice of early childhood \ndevelopment and related policies. He was a member of the Advisory \nCommittee on Head Start Quality and Expansion and of the planning \ncommittee for the Early Head Start program for families and children \nages zero to three. Dr. Zigler is currently serving as the Honorary \nChair of the National Advisory Panel for the Head Start 2010 Project.\n  Dr. Zigler's many honors include awards from the American \nPsychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nSociety for Research in Child Development, the American Academy of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy on Mental \nRetardation, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, the National \nHead Start Association, the Heinz Foundation, and Teachers College, \nColumbia University. He has also received honorary degrees from Park \nUniversity in Missouri and McGill University in Canada.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Zigler has successfully combined his \ncommitment to scholarly research and his commitment to public service. \nThroughout the decades, Dr. Zigler has never lost sight of what he \nbelieved was his true calling: improving the lives of all children, \nparticularly poor children. His greatest passion has always been \nhelping the most underprivileged among us.\n  I am pleased to honor him this day and to express my gratitude for \nall he has done and continues to do on behalf of our Nation's most \nvulnerable citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4375-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH D. NOLAN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise before you today to honor the \nlife and decorated naval career of Captain Joseph D. Nolan, who passed \naway late last year. The journey that he and his wife Betty traveled \nthrough the U.S. Navy extended from Virginia to the shores of Korea and \nVietnam, and it finally came to rest in the deserts of New Mexico. \nThroughout his 30 years of service Captain Nolan wore the uniform of \nthe U.S. Navy with pride and honor, and his dedication was recognized \nby the Silver Star amongst many others. The quantity and quality of his \nservice stand as a model for all Americans to emulate as this young \nnation enters its fourth century.\n  Joseph Nolan's roots in my home State run deep. Joe graduated from \nBoston College then went on to receive his master's degree from Boston \nTeachers College, where his masters thesis focused on Oliver LaFarge's \n``Laughing Boy.'' After graduating from the Officer Candidate School in \nNewport, Rhode Island, Joe was commissioned in January 1952. His first \ntour of duty was as CIC officer on-board the USS Preston where he \nreceived the Naval Commendation Medal with Combat ``V'' for his combat \naction in Korea. He continued to serve in destroyer types as Operations \nOfficer and Gunnery Officer of the USS Cross and matriculated into the \nRegular Navy in August 1955.\n  Officer Nolan assumed the role of aide to the Shipyard Commander in \nhis first tour of shore duty at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Here, \nhe received orders to return to sea duty as Executive Officer of the \nUSS Snyder based in New York. Following the decommissioning of the USS \nSnyder, Nolan reported to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Operational Control \nCenter for 2\\1/2\\ years and attended the Air Command and Staff College \nat Maxwell AFB, Alabama throughout 1964 and 1965. Upon completion of \nthe Air Command and Staff College, Nolan served as Senior Naval Advisor \nin the ``I'' Corps area of Vietnam and as Commander Task Group 115.1 in \nOperation Market Time. For his combat action Nolan was awarded the \nVietnamese Cross for Gallantry and Legion of Merit with Combat ``V.'' \nNolan assumed command of the USS New in December 1966 in Portsmouth, \nVA.\n  After gaining the rank of captain, Captain Nolan was given command of \nthe USS Halsey and later became the commanding officer of the Naval \nDestroyer School and then Surface Warfare Officer School, in Newport. \nIn his final tour of duty Captain Nolan moved to Albuquerque, NM, to \nwork for the Defense Nuclear Agency at Kirtland Air Force Base. In 1982 \nCaptain Nolan retired after 30 years of service with the United States \nNavy.\n  Proud as he was of his professional military career, Joe Nolan's life \nencompassed much more than his service to country; he was a man of \naction who consumed the works of J. Frank Dobie and Eugene Manlove \nRhodes and he came to love Western art. While I am saddened by his \npassing and the grief it visits upon his family and friends, I am proud \nto stand here today and share with the Nation my regard for the truly \nAmerican life lived by Captain Joseph Nolan. We are humbled by his loss \nbut we are better for his time here on earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4375-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communication was laid before the Senate, together with \naccompanying papers, reports, and documents, and was referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1726.

A bill to clarify the status of the Young Men's Christian \nAssociation Retirement Fund for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill of \ncritical importance to the over 90,000 participants and beneficiaries \nof the YMCA pension plan. This issue affects the 656 hard-working YMCA \nemployees in Kentucky that initially brought this problem to my \nattention.\n  With its presence felt in more than 10,000 communities nationwide, \nYMCA is the Nation's largest community service organization. Each year \nYMCA employees deliver important health and social services to over \n17.9 million Americans. The YMCA mission to ``put Christian principles \nin practice through programs that build healthy spirit for mind, body, \nfor all'' is indeed a very noble endeavor. YMCAs serve people of all \nfaiths, incomes, ages, and race. This generous organization never turns \npeople away for inability to pay.\n  YMCA's strength is in both its dedicated employees and the people \nthey bring together through its service. Each local YMCA is tailored to \nthe specific needs of the community in which it serves. The employees \nof the YMCA do God's work each day. This bill ensures that they will \ncontinue to receive the pensions they have earned and deserve.\n  With over $3 billion in assets, the YMCA pension plan has been in \nplace for over 80 years. The plan has always been considered as a \n``church pension plan.'' There are no problems with the operation of \nthe plan and the IRS has said it is in full compliance--with one \npossible exception.\n  Generally, in order to be considered a ``church plan'' the sponsoring \norganization must be affiliated with a specific church. Traditionally, \nthe YMCA has not affiliated with any one church, but has instead \nidentified with a ``Christian affiliation.'' This bill would clarify \nthat the plan will continue to be a ``church plan'' despite the fact \nthat the YMCA is not limited to one specific church or religious \ndenomination. It is important that Congress clarifies this technicality \nto ensure that the beneficiaries of the YMCA pension plan receive the \nbenefits they have earned and deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 700. A bill to provide for the promotion of democracy, human \nrights, and rule of law in the Republic of Belarus and for the \nconsolidation and strengthening of Belarus sovereignty and \nindependence; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Co-Chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, I have closely monitored \ndevelopments in the Republic of Belarus and informed my Senate \ncolleagues of disturbing trends in that nation. I have met with members \nof this fledgling democratic opposition who, at great personal risk, \ndare to speak out against the repressive regime led by Alexander \nLukashenka. I have met with the courageous wives whose husbands \ndisappeared because they stood up to the regime and would not be \nsilent. Against the backdrop of this climate of fear, the powers of the \nstate have been brought to bear against independent journalists, trade \nunionists, and other voices of dissent.\n  Increasingly, Belarus has been driven into self-imposed isolation \nunder Lukashenka devoid of legitimate leadership or accountability. A \nlittle over a year ago I addressed the Senate to voice concern over \nreported arms deals between the regime and rouge states, including \nIraq. It appears that such sales have taken on greater importance as \nthe Belarusian economy spirals downward.\n  While some might be tempted to dismiss Belarus as an anomaly, the \nstakes are too high and the costs too great to ignore. Accordingly, \ntoday, I am introducing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2003, which is \ndesigned to help put an end to repression and human rights violations \nin Belarus and to promote Belarus' entry into a democratic Euro-\nAtlantic community of nations.\n  As a participating State in the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, OSCE, Belarus has accepted a series of norms in \nthe areas of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. As Europe's \nlast dictator, Lukashenka continues to brashly trample the fundamental \nrights of his own people and their culture.\n  As I alluded to earlier, independent media, non-governmental \norganizations, trade unions and the democratic opposition have had to \noperate under extremely difficult conditions, often facing serious \nmistreatment and an orchestrated campaign of harassment. Despite the \nrepressions there are courageous individuals who support democracy have \nnot been silenced. Two weeks ago, for example, Alexander Yarashuk, the \nleader of the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions, called on \nLukashenka to immediately cease backing Saddam. Moreover, just last \nweek, on March 12, thousands gathered peacefully in a central Minsk \nsquare to protest deteriorating economic and social conditions in \nBelarus. Four of the rally's organizers--Andrei Sannikov, Ludmila \nGryaznova, Dmitry Bondarenko and Leonid Malakhov--were given 15 day \njail sentences for ``participation in unauthorized mass actions.''\n  Despite calls for change within Belarus, and considerable prodding \nfrom the international community, Lukashenka has shown no desire to \ndeviate from his path of authoritarianism and personal profit at the \nexpense of his own people. A few months ago, Lukashenka, who \neffectively controls the Belarusisn parliament, signed into law a new, \nrepressive religion law. Local elections held earlier this month \nfollowed the pattern of Belarus' 2000 parliamentary and 2001 \npresidential elections--they were a joke. Control of election \ncommissions, denials of registration for opposition candidates, ``early \nvoting'' and outright falsifications were the norm.\n  The Belarus Democracy Act of 2003 would authorize additional \nassistance for democracy-building activities such as support for NGOs, \nindependent media, including radio and television broadcasting to \nBelarus, and international exchanges. It also encourages free and fair \nparliamentary elections, which have been notably absent in Belarus. \nThis bill would also deny high-ranking officials of the Lukashenka \nregime entry into the United States. Additionally, strategic exports to \nthe Belarusian Government would be prohibited, as well as U.S. \nGovernment financing except for humanitarian goods and agricultural or \nmedical products. The U.S. executive directors of the international \nfinancial institutions would be encouraged to vote against financial \nassistance to the Government of Belarus except for loans and assistance \nfor humanitarian needs. The bill would also require reports from the \nPresident concerning the sale of delivery of weapons or weapons-related \ntechnologies from Belarus to rouge states, including Iraq and North \nKorea.\n  I am very pleased that the Ranking Member of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, Senator Biden, is an original cosponsor of this measure. His \nsupport will ensure that we proceed on a bipartisan basis as we work to \nensure the timely adoption and implementation of this legislation.\n  The goal of the Belarus Democracy Act is to assist Belarus in \nbecoming a genuine European state, in which respect for human rights \nand democracy is the norm and in which the long-suffering Belarusian \npeople are able to overcome the legacy of dictatorship--past and \npresent. Adoption and implementation of the Belarus Democracy Act will \noffer a ray of hope that the current period of political, economic and \nsocial stagnation will indeed end. The people of Belarus deserve a \nchance for a brighter future free of repression and fear.\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Belarus Democracy Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Belarus Democracy Act of \n     2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States supports the promotion of democracy, \n     respect for human rights, and the rule of law in the Republic \n     of Belarus consistent with its commitments as a participating \n     state of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE).\n       (2) The United States has a vital interest in the \n     independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Belarus and \n     its integration into the European community of democracies.\n       (3) The last parliamentary election in Belarus deemed to be \n     free and fair by the international community was conducted in \n     1995 from which emerged the 13th Supreme Soviet whose \n     democratically and constitutionally derived authorities and \n     powers have been usurped by the authoritarian regime of \n     Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenka.\n       (4) In November 1996, Lukashenka orchestrated an illegal \n     and unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a \n     new constitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, the \n     13th Supreme Soviet, install a largely powerless National \n     Assembly, and extend his term of office to 2001.\n       (5) In May 1999, democratic forces in Belarus challenged \n     Lukashenka's unconstitutional extension of his presidential \n     term by staging alternative presidential elections which were \n     met with repression.\n       (6) Democratic forces in Belarus have organized peaceful \n     demonstrations against the Lukashenka regime in cities and \n     towns throughout Belarus which led to beatings, mass arrests, \n     and extended incarcerations.\n       (7) Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, and Yuri Zakharenka, \n     who have been leaders and supporters of the democratic forces \n     in Belarus, and Dmitry Zavadsky, a journalist known for his \n     critical reporting in Belarus, have disappeared and are \n     presumed dead.\n       (8) Former Belarus Government officials have come forward \n     with credible allegations and evidence that top officials of \n     the Lukashenka regime were involved in the disappearances.\n       (9) The Lukashenka regime systematically harasses and \n     represses the independent media and independent trade unions, \n     imprisons independent journalists, and actively suppresses \n     freedom of speech and expression.\n       (10) The Lukashenka regime harasses the autocephalic \n     Belarusian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the \n     Jewish community, the Hindu Lights of Kalyasa community, \n     evangelical Protestant churches (such as Baptist and \n     Pentecostal groups), and other minority religious groups.\n       (11) The Law on Religious Freedom and Religious \n     Organizations, passed by the National Assembly and signed by \n     Lukashenka on October 31, 2002, establishes one of the most \n     repressive legal regimes in the OSCE region, severely \n     limiting religious freedom and placing excessively burdensome \n     government controls on religious practice.\n       (12) The United States, the European Union, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Parliamentary Assembly, \n     and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly have not recognized the \n     National Assembly.\n       (13) The parliamentary elections of October 15, 2000, \n     conducted in the absence of a democratic election law, were \n     illegitimate, unconstitutional, and plagued by violent human \n     rights abuses committed by the Lukashenka regime, and have \n     been determined by the OSCE to be nondemocratic.\n       (14) The presidential election of September 9, 2001, was \n     determined by the OSCE and other observers to be \n     fundamentally unfair, to have failed to meet OSCE commitments \n     for democratic elections formulated in the 1990 Copenhagen \n     Document, and to have featured significant and abusive \n     misconduct by the Lukashenka regime, including--\n       (A) the harassment, arrest, and imprisonment of opposition \n     members;\n       (B) the denial of equal and fair access by opposition \n     candidates to state-controlled media;\n       (C) the seizure of equipment and property of independent \n     nongovernmental organizations and press organizations, and \n     the harassment of their staff and management;\n       (D) voting and vote counting procedures that were not \n     transparent; and\n       (E) a campaign of intimidation directed against opposition \n     activists, domestic election observation organizations, and \n     opposition and independent media, and a libelous media \n     campaign against international observers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means--\n       (1) the Committee on International Relations of the House \n     of Representatives; and\n       (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 701. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage contributions of capital gain real property made for \nconservation purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I re-introduced the Rural Heritage \nConservation Act, along with my good friend Senator Grassley from Iowa. \nI would like to say a few words about why this bill is so important to \nmy home state of Montana and to the Nation.\n  We are losing precious agricultural and ranch lands at a record pace. \nFarming and ranching are the backbone of my state, comprising the \nlargest sector of my state's economy. Not only do these farms and \nranches provide Montana and the Nation with the highest quality food \nand fiber, they also provide wildlife habitat, open space and peace of \nmind. It is imperative that we help our hard-working farmers and \nranchers preserve this precious heritage and their way-of-life.\n  Conservation easements have been tremendously successful in \npreserving open space and wildlife habitat. Unfortunately, the way \ncurrent tax law is structured makes it difficult for farmers and \nranchers, who generally don't have much income, to take advantage of \nthe tax benefits associated with donating conservation easements. \nThey've been left behind by this important conservation tool. That's \nwhy I introduced the Rural Heritage Conservation Act. My bill will \nprovide targeted income tax relief to small farmers and ranchers who \nwish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified conservation \neasement.\n  The Rural Heritage Conservation Act would allow eligible farmers and \nranchers to increase the amounts of deduction that may be taken \ncurrently for charitable contributions of qualified conservation \neasements by raising the Adjusted Gross Income limitations to 100 \npercent and extending the carryover period from 5 years to 15 years. In \nthe case of all of the landowners, the AGI limitation would be raised \nfrom 30 percent to 50 percent.\n  This is a win-win situation--farmers and ranchers will be able to \npreserve their important agricultural and ranching lands for future \ngenerations, while continuing to operate their businesses and stay on \ntheir land. It's a purely voluntary, incentive-based way to promote \nconservation. It will allow us to bring people together. Landowners, \nconservationists, the federal government, and local communities all can \nwork together to preserve our precious natural resources.\n  This legislation is vitally important to Montana, and to every other \nstate in\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nthe Nation where important agricultural or ranching lands are being \nlost to rapid development, and a way-of-life is disappearing. I ask my \ncolleagues to join with me and Senator Grassley to pass this bill as \nsoon as possible and send it to the President's desk. We have to act \nnow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 702. A bill to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement \nAct to revise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator \nAkaka joins me in sponsoring this measure.\n  The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law \nin 1988, and has been reauthorized every four years since that time.\n  The Act provides authority for a range of programs and services \ndesigned to improve the health care status of the Native people of \nHawaii.\n  With the enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act \nand the establishment of Native Hawaiian health care systems on most of \nthe islands that make up the State of Hawaii, we have witnessed \nsignificant improvements in the health status of Native Hawaiians, but \nas the findings of unmet needs and health disparities set forth in this \nbill make clear, we still have a long way to go.\n  For instance, Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality \nrates in the State of Hawaii--rates that are 21 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State male population and 64 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State female population. Nationally, Native \nHawaiians have the third highest mortality rate as a result of breast \ncancer.\n  With respect to diabetes, in 2000, Native Hawaiians had the highest \nmortality rate associated with diabetes in the State--a rate which is \n138 percent higher than the statewide rate for all racial groups.\n  When it comes to heart disease, the mortality rate of Native \nHawaiians associated with heart disease is 68 percent higher than the \nrate for the entire State, and the mortality rate for hypertension is \n84 percent higher than that for the entire State.\n  These statistics on the health status of Native Hawaiians are but a \nsmall part of the long list of data that makes clear that our objective \nof assuring that the Native people of Hawaii attain some parity of good \nhealth comparable to that of the larger U.S. population has not yet \nbeen achieved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 703. A bill to designate the regional headquarters building for \nthe National Park Service under construction in Omaha, Nebraska, as the \n``Carl T. Curtis National Park Service Midwest Regional Headquarters \nBuilding''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF CARL T. CURTIS NATIONAL PARK \n                   SERVICE MIDWEST REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS BUILDING.\n\n       The regional headquarters building for the National Park \n     Service under construction in Omaha, Nebraska, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Carl T. Curtis National Park Service \n     Midwest Regional Headquarters Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the regional \n     headquarters building referred to in section 1 shall be \n     deemed to be a reference to the Carl T. Curtis National Park \n     Service Midwest Regional Headquarters Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 704. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to increase the \namount of the death gratuity payable with respect to decreased members \nof the Armed forces; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of my self and Senator Warner that will provide increased \nsupport for the families of those brave men and women in the armed \nforces who make the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation. The \nbill I introduce will raise the amount paid to the next-of-kin of \nmilitary personnel killed while on active duty from $6,000 to $12,000. \nFurther, it makes this increase retroactive to September 11, 2001.\n  Like all Americans, I have been greatly saddened by the loss of life \nin recent days during our operations in Iraq. While all of us \nunderstand the dangers whenever the Commander-in-Chief sends our troops \ninto harm's way, that does not lessen the shock and sadness we all have \nfelt as we learn of the loss of lives and see the cruel video of \nAmerican POWs held in Iraq.\n  In the initial days of the war, two Marines with ties to Main lost \nheir lives. Both Captain Jay Aubin and Corporal Brian Kennedy, who \nperished in a helicopter crash in the Kuwaiti desert, have parents \nliving in Maine. I came to this floor yesterday to express my \ncondolences to their families, and declare my commitment to ensuring \nthat their sacrifice is remembered.\n  I can think of no better way to honor their memories, and the \nmemories of other Americans who have given their lives, than to ensure \nthat their loved ones receive the care that they need and deserve. The \nlast time that the death gratuity was raise was in 1991, during the \nperiod of the last Gulf War. At that time, it was increased from $3,000 \nto 6,000. It well past time for the Congress to move forward and \nincrease this amount to better recognize the sacrifices of these \nfamilies.\n  The death gratuity is commonly provided within 72 hours to the family \nof the servicemember who is killed while on active duty. This amount, \nwhile a small solace to a grieving family, assist them with their \nimmediate financial needs. It is our obligation as a Nation to ensure \nthat those families receive every support we can provide during such a \nterrible time.

Res. 97\n\n       Whereas on March 18, 2003, Fidel Castro and the Government \n     of Cuba began an island-wide campaign to arrest and jail \n     dozens of prominent democracy activists and critics of the \n     repressive regime;\n       Whereas since March 18, 2003, the Cuban police have \n     arrested more than 100 Cubans for engaging in free speech \n     under Law 88, the Law for the Protection of National \n     Independence and the Economy of Cuba, which is a notorious \n     law passed 3 years ago by the communist county;\n       Whereas the imprisoned political opponents of Castro \n     include librarians, journalists, and others who have \n     supported the Varela Project, which seeks to bring free \n     speech, open elections, and democracy to the island nation;\n       Whereas Fidel Castro has seized the opportunity to expand \n     his brutal oppression of the Cuban people while the attention \n     of the United States and other nations around the world is \n     focused on the war in Iraq; and\n       Whereas the failure to condemn the Cuban Government's \n     renewed political repression of democracy activists will \n     undermine the opportunity for freedom on the island: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the recent arrests and other intimidation \n     tactics against democracy activists by the Castro regime;\n       (2) calls on the Cuban Government to immediately release \n     those imprisoned and held during this most recent crackdown \n     for activities the government wrongly deems ``subversive, \n     counter-revolutionary, and provocative'';\n       (3) reaffirms Senate Resolution 272, 107th Congress, agreed \n     to June 10, 2002, which was agreed to without opposition and \n     which called for, among other things, amnesty for all \n     political prisoners;\n       (4) praises the bravery of those Cubans who, because they \n     practiced free speech and signed the Varela Project petition, \n     have been targeted in this most recent government crackdown; \n     and\n       (5) urges the President to demand the immediate release of \n     these prisoners and to take all appropriate steps to secure \n     their immediate release.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 29--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n    REGARDING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE \n   REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND THE NEED TO ASSURE THAT UNITED STATES TRADE \n  ACTIONS DO NOT RESULT IN GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS OR UNITED STATES JOB \n                                 LOSSES\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea is a vital ally of the United \n     States in Asia;\n       Whereas the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula \n     require the strongest possible alliance between the United \n     States and the Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas Hynix Semiconductor Inc. is a major Korean and \n     global semiconductor manufacturer;\n       Whereas Hynix Semiconductor Inc. has invested over \n     $1,000,000,000 in its facilities in Eugene, Oregon, and is \n     increasing that investment;\n       Whereas Hynix Semiconductor Inc. employs over 1,000 highly \n     skilled and compensated Americans at its facilities in \n     Eugene, Oregon;\n       Whereas these jobs are particularly valuable to Oregon and \n     the United States economy at a time of economic uncertainty;\n       Whereas semiconductor trade between the United States and \n     the Republic of Korea is currently the subject of trade \n     remedy proceedings and continuing review by the United States \n     Trade Representative;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea has, as a result of the \n     currency crisis in the mid-1990s, implemented economic \n     reforms;\n       Whereas as a result of those reforms the Government of \n     South Korea is no longer involved in commercial lending \n     decisions; and\n       Whereas the Government of South Korea has affirmed that it \n     has had no role in the economic restructurings of Hynix \n     Semiconductor Inc.: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government should act carefully and \n     judiciously with regard to issues involving semiconductor \n     trade between the United States and the Republic of Korea to \n     assure that trade disputes do not create geopolitical or \n     economic tensions between the United States and the Republic \n     of Korea, and do not result in the loss of highly skilled \n     American jobs, including jobs at United States facilities of \n     Korean semiconductor manufacturers;\n       (2) the Secretary of Commerce should review carefully and \n     objectively all the facts surrounding the financial \n     restructuring of Hynix Semiconductor Inc. in light of \n     economic reforms which have taken place in South Korea in \n     recent years, and avoid taking any action which will threaten \n     the jobs of American workers in the semiconductor industry or \n     threaten future investment in Hynix Semiconductor Inc.'s \n     facility in Eugene, Oregon; and\n       (3) the United States Trade Representative should seek to \n     address issues involving semiconductor trade between the \n     United States and the Republic of Korea through consultation \n     after full review of the facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4382-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4382-S4383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 411.

I really thought the tone today reflected the \nbest of the Senate. These were real debates on real substance and \nconducted in a way that I think we can all be proud.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for helping to set that tone and also for \nhis\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nparticipation in the organization of these amendments so that \ncolleagues could know what was happening, what was going to happen \nnext. I thought it went very well.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and very much \nappreciate his cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/25/senate-section/article/S4395-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
