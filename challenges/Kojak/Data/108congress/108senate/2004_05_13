Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on two other \nissues.\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\nOne has to do with the event yesterday, which was very tough for many \nof us, and that was the opportunity to review the photos related to the \nprisoner abuse scandal.\n  I thank the Department of Defense for their responsiveness so as to \ngive everyone in this body the opportunity to view those pictures. As \nhas been said by so many, the photos are appalling and offensive to \nAmerica's sense of humanity. Many of the images we saw were consistent \nwith those that have already appeared in the press. They are pictures \nand images of abusive behavior. There were a lot of photos. Others do \nnot show prisoner abuse but do expose the character of those under \ninvestigation.\n  The new material supports my belief that we must act swiftly and we \nmust fully investigate the incidents of this prisoner abuse at Abu \nGhraib prison to assure that justice is served. It is the mark of \nAmerica, and that mark will be demonstrated by this swift justice. We \nmust find out who is responsible for the abuses that occurred and hold \nthem accountable. And indeed we will.\n  At the same time, we must all remember to separate this incident from \nthe outstanding, remarkable work so many thousands and thousands and \nthousands of our brothers and sisters and men and women and children \nare carrying out in uniform right now in Iraq and indeed in Afghanistan \nand around the world. It is tremendous work, fighting for the liberty \nand the democracy we all cherish. It is truly disheartening to see that \nthe actions of a few--a few--have really tarnished the reputations and \nprofessionalism of our Nation's Armed Forces. So let's never ever \nforget the tremendous work the men and women in uniform are doing for \nus right now, each and every day, and today.\n\n  I am pleased to learn Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and General Myers \nhave traveled to Baghdad to get a better sense of what is happening on \nthe ground in Iraq and to ensure corrective actions are being taken to \nprevent such prisoner abuse from ever happening again. I think it is \nimportant that they are there to boost the morale of the thousands of \nAmerican troops who are serving so nobly and courageously in Iraq. This \nis the right and proper thing for our Nation's senior defense civilian \nand senior military leader to be doing.\n  I do again want to assure our colleagues that the American people \nexpect, and the Senate will deliver by having its committees of \njurisdiction continue their inquiries into this matter and work \ndiligently with the executive branch to ensure that justice prevails \nand that such acts never ever occur again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5384-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on a final issue, I want to comment on an \nissue that is dear to my heart. It stems from the fact that if you have \nhealth insurance in this country today you do better than if you don't. \nThis week is a week that addresses the issues of the uninsured, both in \nthis body, in the Congress, in the executive branch--indeed, all over \nthe country.\n  Last October I appointed a task force on health care costs and the \nuninsured, and earlier this week the task force, led by our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Judd Gregg, unveiled its \nrecommendations. I thank Senator Gregg for his tremendous work and each \nof the team members for the work they put in, both studying this issue \nand then fashioning a plan and proposal in a document which helps all \nof us in this body understand but also gives us a direction to address \nthis huge problem.\n  Helping the uninsured gain more access to affordable, quality health \ncare is one of the most critical and the most complex and most \nfundamental challenges in domestic policy that face us today.\n  Under Senator Gregg's leadership, the task force has developed a \ndetailed, pragmatic, and systematic way of addressing this issue.\n  They cast a wide net to gather input from a broad range of resources. \nTheir recommendations offer a serious and substantial framework to \ntackle what to many people seems to be an intractable problem of \nuninsurance in America.\n  The first thing is so obvious when you look at what the task force \npresented. The uninsured is not just a single sector. It is not just a \npiece of pie on a pie chart. It is a very complex group. It is a \ndiverse mix. They include the chronically uninsured poor, the working \nuninsured, college students, and other young, healthy adults who simply \nchoose not to get health care insurance. That complexity explains why \nit is impossible to have a one-size-that-fits-all approach, and, thus, \nthe task force has drafted distinct recommendations for each of these \ndifferent cohorts.\n  America offers the best health care in the world. We have the very \nbest trained physicians, the very best trained nurses, top researchers, \ntop medical research, and topnotch medical research facilities in the \ncountry doing the very best research with vast numbers of new and \nimproved medical technology and prescription drugs. But in spite of the \nvery best of health care, we have these chasms, these huge gaps, with \nthe uninsured.\n  We have worked hard to find definitive solutions in the past. But \nstill the number of uninsured in this country continues to climb. \nForty-three million people are uninsured. Of those, 21 million people \nare without insurance for a year or more.\n  We have this coupled or working in parallel with the spiraling upward \nhealth care costs. For the second straight year, health care spending \ngrew significantly faster than the rate of growth of the gross domestic \nproduct by a whopping $1.6 trillion. The cost is caused by a whole \nrange of factors.\n  We have improvements in technology, which we understand. We have \nfrivolous lawsuits. Many doctors are having to conduct and practice \ndefensive medicine where they overprescribe in terms of diagnostic \ntests, really just to protect themselves in the event there is an \noverly aggressive lawyer who is going to be going after them.\n  The liability insurance rates continue to rise. With these increased \npremiums, doctors pay as much as $400,000 for liability insurance such \nas a neurosurgeon, even if he has never been sued before in the past. \nIt ultimately simply has to get passed on to the system itself, and \nthat drives up everybody's health care costs.\n  We have medical information gaps that cause costly insufficiencies \ntoday. A lot of times doctors don't have access to up-to-date \ninformation on patients who come into the emergency room because the \nrecord for that patient may be at another hospital or in another town \nor in the basement of that hospital.\n  We can address that by improving our information technology and \ninvesting appropriately in electronic medical records.\n  Individuals don't have the same tax advantages if they are out \nworking by themselves than they do if they are working with a large \ncompany. That inequity of the individual market has consequences that \naffect the uninsured in a way that is detrimental. Health care is \nexpensive for small companies today.\n  There are initiatives we can take in this body to address the fact \nthat small companies' access is really disproportionate in providing \nhealth care, in part, because of the types of packages that are \navailable to them and, in part, because of the tax treatment.\n  We have to find a way to address this escalating cost at the same \ntime we are addressing the issue of the uninsured. The task force \nmaterials will be shared with our caucus, and hopefully a number of \nthese issues will be addressed and debated and brought to the floor in \nthe appropriate form so we can really accomplish reducing the number of \nuninsured in this country.\n  I close by once again thanking Senator Gregg and the members of the \ntask force. Their recommendations are enlightening and they are \npromising. They give us a great template from which to operate as we go \nforward.\n  I am optimistic that by working together in this body we can produce \ngood ideas, we can significantly increase the number of Americans \ncovered, and we can keep health care in America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5384-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

JEFF ALLEN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, tomorrow is a very special day for two \nlittle twin brothers in Rapid City, South Dakota. Ethan and Abraham \nAllen turn 2 tomorrow. Among the people who will be there to celebrate \nwith them is their father, Lt. Jeff Allen.\n  Lt. Allen came closer than he likes to think to not seeing his sons' \nbirthday. On April 6, he was in a convoy near Mosul, traveling south \nthrough Iraq, when a homemade bomb exploded under his Humvee. The \nexplosion filled the calves on both of Lt. Allen's legs with shrapnel. \nHis right ear drum was shattered, the retina in his right eye was torn, \nand he suffered serious lacerations on his face. He had been in Iraq \nfor just under a month.\n  Like more than 40 percent of the American troops in Iraq today, Lt. \nAllen is a reservist. He is a nurse anesthetist with the Army Reserve's \n348th Combat Support unit. When he is not on active duty, he works at \nRapid City Regional Hospital. Like so many others civilian and \nmilitary--he was in Iraq trying to save lives.\n  Before he arrived home on Monday night, Lt. Allen spent a month at \nBrooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where he underwent three \nsurgeries, including skin grafts to his legs. He's likely to need more \nsurgery, but doctors are hopeful about his recovery. He and his wife, \nAndrea, have been married for 6 years. He has been in the Army Reserve \nfor 5 years.\n  At the beginning of our life as a nation, Thomas Paine said, ``If \nthere must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my children may have \npeace.'' America is fortunate today that we still have people, like Lt. \nJeff Allen, who are willing to sacrifice so much and risk their lives \nso that their children will know peace. As he and his wife prepare to \ncelebrate their sons' birthdays, we thank Lt. Allen and wish him a full \nand speedy recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5385-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5385-S5386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SPURRING AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN RURAL AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last month the Department of Commerce \nreported that my home State of South Dakota had the Nation's second-\nhighest rate of growth in per-capita personal income during 2003.\n  This surely comes as welcome news to many South Dakotans who have \nstruggled to make ends meet during our Nation's recent economic \ndownturn.\n  But now is not the time for us to congratulate ourselves. Too many \nAmericans still can't find work. Too many Americans still don't have \nhealth insurance. And of those lucky enough to have health insurance, \ntoo many Americans can barely afford it.\n  Last Thursday, Alan Greenspan warned that rising deficits threaten \nthe long-term stability of our economy and he is right.\n  We need sound fiscal policies that preserve and protect the health of \nour economy. We must do everything we can to ensure that the economic \nrecovery finally takes hold, and that the benefits of the recovery \nextend to all Americans, not just to a privileged few.\n  Unfortunately, even after last year's encouraging growth in personal \nincome, South Dakotans still tend to earn far less than the national \naverage, and the same is true for many other rural States in our \nregion.\n  Even worse, average income figures conceal wide disparities in wealth \nbetween those at the top and those at the bottom even within our \nStates. Sadly, rates of poverty in many parts of rural America are \nworse than we find in countries we often consider to be ``developing.'' \nThis is a quiet national crisis that we must address.\n  To reduce the prosperity gap between rural States and the rest of the \nNation, Congress has created a variety of Federal programs designed \nspecifically to promote rural economic development.\n  Unfortunately, the administration proposes to cut many of these \nprograms, despite the positive results they have achieved. Instead of \npulling the rug out from under those who need our help the most, we \nshould be supporting programs that provide a helping hand to farmers, \nranchers, and small businesspeople in rural areas.\n  With our help, they can bring the benefits of economic recovery to \nmore Americans than ever before.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of this economy. According to the \nSmall Business Administration, or SBA, businesses with 500 or fewer \nemployees are responsible for roughly three-quarters of net job \ncreation in this country. In my State, and in many other rural States, \nthis figure is even higher.\n  According to the FDIC the 7(a) program is one of the single largest \nsources of long-term capital to small businesses in this country. By \nproviding lenders a guarantee against default by small borrowers, it \nprovides capital to those borrowers on more favorable terms than they \ncould get anywhere else.\n  This is not a big-government handout, as some might be tempted to \nclaim. It is a helping hand from the government to the invisible hand \nof the market.\n  So I was disappointed in January when the SBA was forced to \ntemporarily suspend its most successful small business loan program, \nthe 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program, because the Bush administration failed \nto support sufficient operating funds.\n  Unfortunately, this is the most recent manifestation of the \nadministration's history of underfunding successful small business \nprograms. According to the FDIC, the 7(a) program is one of the single \nlargest sources of long-term capital to small businesses in the \ncountry.\n  By providing lenders a guarantee against default by small borrowers, \nit provides capital to those borrowers on more favorable terms than \nthey get anywhere else. This is not a big government handout as some \nmight be tempted to claim. It is a helping hand from the government to \nthe invisible hand of the market. With the funds acquired through the \n7(a) program, small businesspeople are free to expand their operations \nas they see fit, and their positive record of job creation shows \nplainly that they know how to do so effectively.\n  For all of its rhetoric about supporting small business, how much did \nthe Bush administration devote to this key program in the proposed \nbudget for the upcoming year?\n  Not one dollar. The administration actually proposes to eliminate the \nfunding for the 7(a) program--in effect, doing away with the single \nmost helpful nudge the Government can provide to these businesses. In \nmy view, this is not the way to boost job creation.\n  The abandonment of the 7(a) program is not an isolated case. It is \npart of a larger pattern of cuts to programs that always have assisted \nsmall business especially.\n  Consider the SBA's Microloan Program. Under this program, the SBA \nprovides funds to qualified nonprofit organizations which then make up \nloans of up to $35,000 to new and existing small business. According to \nthe SBA, the average loan is around $10,500. The nonprofit lenders that \nparticipate in the program also provide management and technical \nassistance to borrowers to ensure that they have the skills necessary \nto succeed. Since the Microloan Program was established in 1992, it has \nfacilitated more than 12,500 loans with $102 billion. Despite the fact \nthat the borrowers who benefit from this program tend to have \nrelatively low credit ratings which makes them unattractive to \ncommercial lenders, the program has had only one loss to date. Few \ngovernment programs can match that record of success. And few provide \nas much value to able entrepreneurs. Regrettably, the administration \nhas proposed eliminating this program, as well.\n  Another critical area that has been shortchanged is the small \nbusiness outreach in Indian country. Native Americans continue to \nsuffer from rates of unemployment far greater than those that existed \nin America even during the Great Depression. Part of this problem stems \nfrom the lack of an active small business community in much of Indian \ncountry and a lack of resources to help stimulate the creation of such \na community.\n  Years of experience with efforts to reduce poverty in Indian country \nhave taught us that market-based, business-oriented approaches hold the \ngreatest promise for success. But the market will not eliminate poverty \non its own in Indian country. The neglect by the Federal Government has \ngone on far too long. The poverty is too extreme, too deep rooted.\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\n  We need special outreach efforts dedicated to bringing new business \nskills and financial resources to Native-American communities. But \nthese efforts have fallen victim to the administration's budget \npriorities. For the second year in a row, the administration has \nproposed to eliminate all funding for Native-American business \noutreach.\n  The list of small business programs on the chopping block is too long \nto mention here. Cumulatively, the SBA has already seen its resources \nreduced by this administration by 25 percent, giving it the unfortunate \ndistinction of being the most cut of all 26 Federal agencies. This, to \nme, does not demonstrate a commitment to economic development in job \ncreation. We need to restore adequate funding to the SBA.\n\n  While the SBA's budget has suffered the deepest cuts under the \nadministration, it is not the only agency that has seen its small \nbusiness and rural development programs cut. The Treasury Department \noversees a fund that provides capital to community development \nfinancial institutions, or CDFIs. These are specialized private sector \ninstitutions that provide financial products and services to people and \ncommunities underserved by traditional financial markets.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that every dollar it invests in a \nCDFI leverages 12 non-Federal or private sector dollars.\n  There are 13 CDFIs in South Dakota, and they do enormous good. The \nLakota Fund is one that operates on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. \nThe two counties that make up the reservation are the twenty-sixth and \nsecond poorest counties in America. Few areas need economic development \nas badly as Pine Ridge.\n  When the Lakota Fund began lending in 1986, there were 40 businesses \non the reservation, and most of them were owned by nontribal members. \nToday, thanks in large measure to the financial and technical \nassistance delivered by the Lakota Fund, Pine Ridge has nearly 100 \nbusinesses, and many of them are owned by members of the Oglala Sioux \nTribe.\n  If the more than 800 CDFIs around the United States had more funds to \nlend, there is no telling how much good they could achieve. But instead \nof helping CDFIs meet the growing demand for their services, the \nadministration has underfunded them dramatically. This year, like last \nyear, it requested only three-fifths of what the CDFIs received in \n2002.\n  The President's proposed budget cuts also provide cuts in the 2002 \nFarm Bill. Democrats worked alongside Republicans to establish new \ninitiatives under the Department of Agriculture to bring new jobs and \nopportunities to rural communities. When the President signed the Farm \nBill into law, many people believed those programs would become a \nreality. I believed the President when he expressed his support for \nthose programs with the stroke of his pen. But since then, many of \nthese programs have languished due to inaction or even opposition by \nthe White House.\n  From my State and several neighboring States, including Iowa, \nMinnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota, the establishment of a Northern \nGreat Plains Regional Authority was one of the most exciting features \nof the Farm Bill. This authority was modeled on the successful \nAppalachian Regional Commission, which demonstrated the power of a \nregional approach to economic development.\n  Unfortunately, nearly 3 years after its creation, the Northern Great \nPlains Regional Authority has yet to fulfill even a fraction of its \npromise, in large part because the administration has not fulfilled the \nresponsibilities to the Authority. The administration failed to appoint \nFederal and tribal cochairs to lead the Authority, and it has failed to \nsupport any funding for the Authority's activities.\n  Other programs in the Farm Bill are also neglected. The Rural \nBusiness Investment Program, which is supposed to provide millions of \ndollars to private companies willing to invest and leverage that money \nin rural areas, has not been implemented even though the Farm Bill was \nenacted over 2 years ago.\n  The same goes for the Rural Strategic Investment Program which was \ndesigned to help rural areas develop plans to attract new investment.\n  And the list of underfunded programs goes on and on. They include \ncuts to firefighter assistance grants, coupled with proposed changes in \nthe eligibility criteria to favor urban areas; cuts in assistance for \nrural hospitals, where costs are rising fast--many rural hospitals are \nalready in danger of having to close their doors; cuts to USDA \ncommunity facility loans, which help finance construction of fire \nhalls, clinics, daycare centers, senior centers, and critical community \nfacilities; cuts to rural housing loans; cuts to rural electric \ncontribution and telecommunication programs.\n\n  It is hard to understand how we can slash and eliminate programs that \nare designed specifically to strengthen the economy of rural America \nand then claim to be champions of rural communities and small business.\n  Unfortunately, the President's two-word solution to the economic \nstruggles of rural America is the same two-word answer he offers on \nvirtually every other problem: tax cuts. In the face of exploding \ndeficits and rising health care costs that threaten the long-term \nsustainability of our economy, the President continues to insist on the \nwrong kinds of tax cuts.\n  Many of us support tax cuts if they are smart, if they are targeted, \nif they are fair, if they are affordable. The right kinds of tax cuts \ncan help stimulate the economy during times of economic distress.\n  That is why some of us introduced S. 2245 to create a small business \nhealth tax credit that would reduce the burden of health costs on small \nbusiness and enable them to retain and hire more workers. That is also \nwhy we worked to reach a compromise on the estate tax that would exempt \nall but the very richest Americans and fully exempt farms, ranches, and \nsmall businesses that parents pass on to their children.\n  But tax cuts cannot be our only weapon in the battle against rural \npoverty. Independent analysis shows the vast majority of small \nbusinesses receive little or no benefit from the President's tax cuts.\n  And let us not forget that these cuts have a cost, or as Chairman \nGreenspan put it, ``The free lunch has still to be invented.''\n  In order to help finance his tax cuts, the President has proposed \ncutting or eliminating program after program designed to help small \nbusiness and residents of rural America.\n  If the choice is between ruinously expensive tax cuts that \noverwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and proven, cost-\neffective, and desperately needed economic development programs for \nrural America, I think the answer should be clear. We should stick with \nwhat works. We should invest in the targeted, proven solutions we know \nwill bring new prosperity to Main Street, not just to Wall Street.\n  We need to continue to support programs designed to improve the \nquality of life in rural America, and we need to uphold our common \ncommitment to ensuring that those programs succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5386-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was deeply saddened last Christmas \nevening to learn that Alaska had lost a true hero. Officer John Watson, \nan 18-year veteran of the police force, was the Kenai Police \nDepartment's longest-serving officer. He served with distinction, \nearning numerous commendations and citations throughout his career. He \nwas a dedicated public servant, taken from us in the line of duty. He \nwill be missed by his family, friends, and the community he served.\n  The stories I have heard since his passing have demonstrated his \nstrength of character and his impact on the community.\n  Nearly 2,000 peace officers, emergency personnel, State officials, \nand community members remembered Officer Watson at a service held in \nhis honor. I think John's pastor said it best when he remembered \nOfficer Watson as someone who ``throughout his life walked the talk, \nprotecting and serving.''\n  Officer Watson is the first Kenai police officer to be taken from us \nin the line of duty. Understandably, our community has been stunned by \nthis loss. But it is my hope we can reflect upon John's life and renew \nour commitment to the causes he defined and that defined him: \nparticularly, his dedication to public service and his willingness to \nhelp his fellow citizens. That will be a most fitting tribute to the \nlife he spent protecting others, if we remember him in that way.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to John's wife Kathy, his daughter, \nand six stepchildren. They have been, and will continue to be, in our \nthoughts and prayers, and in all Alaskans' prayers, since he has \npassed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this evening, in a candlelight vigil at \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial on Judiciary Square, \nthousands of law enforcement officers from all corners of our Nation \nwill come together. Many will be accompanied by their spouses, some by \ntheir children. Law enforcement is truly a family business.\n  Tonight, we will come together to honor 362 heroes whose names were \ninscribed on that marble wall last month. These heroes are law \nenforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Mr. \nPresident, 145 of those officers lost their lives just last year.\n  I rise this morning to pay tribute to the men and women whose names \nare inscribed on that wall. I rise to lend my support to their \nsurvivors and to their colleagues.\n  The 362 individuals we will honor tonight were each distinct \nindividuals. Together, they represent all of the diversity that is \nAmerica. Together, they shared a commitment to service that is central \nto the tradition of American law enforcement.\n  This commitment to service means spending Christmas Day in the patrol \ncar instead of with family. It means working on your spouse's birthday, \nchecking on the welfare of others.\n  The officer's name is John Patrick Watson. On Christmas Day, 2003, he \nwent to work, leaving behind his beloved wife Kathy on her birthday, to \ndo the job he loved, which was protecting the people of Kenai, AK. That \nhad been his job for 18 years.\n  That Christmas night, answering a call for a ``welfare check,'' \nOfficer Watson would become the first member of the Kenai Police \nDepartment to lose his life in the line of duty.\n  Officer Watson was shot to death with his own weapon, allegedly by \nthe individual on whose welfare he was checking.\n  The individuals who will be remembered this evening at the memorial \nare regarded as heroes, not for the way they died but for the way they \nlived. So let us not dwell on how Officer Watson lost his life but on \nthe way he lived it.\n  During the memorial services in the city of Kenai, Chief Chuck Kopp \nrecounted another call, 3 years earlier, which began with the words: \n``My name is Officer Watson and I am here to help.''\n  Officer Watson was responding to aid a woman who almost died from a \nsleeping pill overdose. The woman, writing after Officer Watson's \ntragic death, stated that she did not remember much of what had \noccurred that night, but the peace she felt as his unshaken voice \nreached her is something she will never forget.\n  The woman whose life Officer Watson saved, ironically, never had an \nopportunity to thank him during his lifetime. In a letter that was read \nduring Officer Watson's memorial service, the woman wrote:\n\n       Please know that with every breath I take, I thank you. . . \n     . I will make every day count. Your time and energy were not \n     wasted.\n\n  I never had the opportunity to meet Officer John Watson. It is \ntroubling to me that in spite of his many good works, only in death \nhave his many contributions been recognized on the Senate floor.\n  So to Kathy, to John's children, and to the members of his family in \nMichigan, I say that John Watson's time and energy were certainly not \nwasted. He trained nearly every member of the Kenai Police Department. \nHe was a pillar of the community, devoted to his church and to God, a \nbear of a man with a smile for everyone.\n  John Watson was an Alaskan by choice rather than by birth, but he \nwill remain forever in our hearts as a true Alaskan hero. For in valor, \nthere is hope.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized \nfor 5 minutes under the previous order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5387-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5387-S5389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to address the growing problem \nof the uninsured in America. This week is Cover the Uninsured Week. It \nis not only appropriate but necessary that we take this time to \nacknowledge the tragedy of American families living without health \ninsurance, and often, as a result, without adequate health care. \nSolving this problem is going to take a lot more than talk; it is going \nto take decisive action by the Congress and, very importantly, by the \nadministration.\n  The number of Americans without health insurance continues to grow. \nIn 2002, 15 percent of our population--over 43 million Americans--were \nuninsured. Since the year 2000, 3.8 million more Americans have become \nuninsured. While Wisconsin is doing better than the national average, \nwe still had nearly 474,000 people uninsured in 2002--almost 10 percent \nof our population.\n  More than half of the nonelderly uninsured are full-time workers or \ntheir spouses and children. It makes no sense to blame this staggering \nfigure just on business. Good businesspeople want to provide health \ninsurance to their employees. They know the value of a workforce that \nis receiving necessary preventive health care. They know the bottom-\nline productivity losses that occur when workers have to struggle with \nthe costs of a serious illness in their families, and they are, in \ngreat part, family members themselves, often relying on the same \ninsurance coverages as their employees, never wanting to see someone \nthey work with suffer because they cannot afford adequate health care.\n  Businesses want to offer solid, affordable health insurance to their \nemployees, but it is getting harder to find every year.\n  As premiums increase at double-digit rates every year, employers are \nforced to drop coverage or pass on more costs to their workers in the \nform of higher cost sharing, deductibles, and copays.\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nToo often employees' wage increases are more than consumed by the \nhigher health care costs they face.\n  This crisis affects everyone. A recent study by the Kaiser Commission \nestimates the United States could spend $41 billion for uncompensated \ncare for the uninsured in 2004. Eighty-five percent of that will be \npaid by Federal, State, and local governments using taxpayer funds. \nThis issue has reached a crisis point. Yet it has been 8 years since \nCongress enacted meaningful health insurance reform. Further, this is \nnot a partisan crisis. It is a national crisis. It will take a national \nsolution, bipartisan and resolute, ambitious and courageous. That means \nwe will need to reorder pet projects and other priorities in order to \ndevote significant new resources to covering the uninsured. That means \nwe need to give up political rivalries and partisanship in order to \nconsider any good idea, regardless from which side of the aisle it \ncomes. It means we need decisive leadership and commitment from the \ntop; namely, from the President himself.\n  So far we haven't seen much of that. The proposals the President has \nput forward would barely scratch the surface and some would create more \nproblems than they solve. With over 43 million Americans uninsured, \nless than 3 million will be covered by his proposals, and they offer \nnothing to stem the rising health care cost problems we face. The \nAmerican people deserve a more serious effort.\n  When the President makes something a priority, we see action. When \nthe President wanted tax cuts, he pushed two massive bills through \nCongress. When the President wanted authorization for war in Iraq, he \nsuccessfully argued long and hard, not only here but all over the \nworld, for the authority he needed. If the President wants to make the \nuninsured a priority, he has the influence, the control, and the \nposition to make it happen.\n  I know there is no silver bullet for dealing with the cost of health \ncare. It will take a variety of solutions to expand coverage to the \nuninsured and help reign in the skyrocketing cost of health care. And \nit will take a combination of market and government-based solutions. We \nshould look at proposals like tax credits to help small businesses \nafford health insurance, expansion of Government programs that work, \nlike Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nincreased funding for community health centers, encouraging more \npurchasing pools, and the greater use of technology to improve quality \nand cut costs.\n  Whatever the combinations are, it is time to have this debate. This \nadministration needs to step up and provide leadership. We cannot \nignore the crisis or wish it away. We cannot waste more time on sound-\nbite solutions that do nothing to solve the problem. We need to fight \nthe plague of the uninsured the way we have fought other threats to our \nway of life and our basic values. This fight we desperately need to \nwin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Wisconsin \nfor his remarks. I will be giving a similar presentation, but I think \nthere is not a more important domestic issue, one that is impacting the \nquality of life for middle-income and moderate-income Americans more \nthan almost anything in their private financial affairs. Obviously, it \nis having a major impact on business and the quality of our economy. I \ndon't think there is a more important issue for us to debate and to \nachieve those necessary elements that will change the terms and \nconditions so we can address the 44 million uninsured, but also provide \nthe kind of underlying support for the quality of life for Americans we \nhave come to expect. This is the priority domestic issue.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator for his remarks. I hope I can \nbe as eloquent.\n  I do want to make sure I speak out on this issue. I have been talking \nconsistently about the state of our economy, particularly the squeeze \nmiddle-class Americans have. Health care costs are absolutely at the \ntop of that list, but we see it in tuition costs at colleges and \nuniversities, property taxes, gasoline prices, and energy prices. There \nare a number of things that are impinging the ability of middle-income \nand moderate-income families to navigate the American economy. But none \nof those is more troubling than both the access and the affordability \nof health care.\n  Today there are roughly 44 million Americans without health coverage. \nThose who do have health coverage are seeing increases in their costs. \nParticularly those who are part of group programs see that costs rise \nexponentially. We are seeing that carry through into the challenges in \nour budgetary policies in Washington with regard to Medicare and \nMedicaid. Costs are truly phenomenal.\n  The average cost of a family health insurance policy today is roughly \n$10,000 a year. A study released this week by the Kerry campaign shows \nthere has been a $2,700 increase in the average annual family premium \nper year over the last 3 years for those who have insurance, 4 times \nthe rate at which family income has grown in the last 4 years.\n  I have to say this is a particularly troubling issue for those folks \nin the State of New Jersey, because we have had the highest rate of \npremium increase of any State in the Nation. I am hearing a lot of \ncomplaints back home. This is unsustainable and needs to be addressed. \nFor the Senate, representing the people of our States, to not have a \nserious debate about the uninsured, with all of the pressures on the \nmiddle class, is hard for me to understand.\n  We used to take for granted that if you had a good job, guaranteed \nhealth benefits came along with the job. This is not the way it is \ntoday. In fact, you would usually be able to count on those health \ninsurance benefits through retirement. That is no longer a certainty. \nEmployers, on the other hand, have seen their costs rising 10 or 15 \npercent. We have a chart that shows how, over the period of time from \n1996 to 2003, we have seen a surge in health care costs. For the third \nyear in a row we have had double-digit increases in the cost of \npremiums for health care insurance. When employers have seen their \ncosts rise, they have taken an obvious strategic step and shifted the \ncost to their employees, eliminated coverage for retirees, or \neliminated coverage altogether for employees, or had all kinds of cost-\nsharing arrangements. It is amazing how the burden has shifted \nincreasingly to working families.\n  Eighty-one percent of the uninsured, those 44 million, are actually \npeople who are working. A lot of times you think it is folks who are \nunemployed or somehow are not connected to the economy. Eighty-one \npercent of the uninsured are in working families, people who have jobs.\n  Competitive pressure among employers to drop coverage is growing \nbecause it is such an important cost element in their overall means of \ndoing business. We have to take steps to address the health care \ncoverage and affordability crisis. Fewer and fewer people can afford to \nmaintain the coverage they have; fewer and fewer businesses can afford \nto. It is time we actually get on with it.\n  To give you one example, the average annual premium for a standard \nplan for a healthy, nonsmoking 25-year-old in New Jersey is almost \n$5,000.\n  That is the average--$5,000 for a single individual. Just to contrast \nthat with some of the initiatives we see out of the administration, \nwhich I find remarkably unacceptable and limited to addressing this \nproblem, President Bush has proposed giving a $1,000 to $3,000 tax \ncredit to low to moderate income-tax paying individuals and families. A \n$1,000 tax credit for a single individual earning $15,000 a year would \nleave that single 25-year-old I just mentioned paying 30 percent of the \ngross income to purchase coverage.\n  How does that work? What kind of help is that? A $5,000 premium, you \nget a $1,000 tax credit, and you make $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, and 30 \npercent of the income pays for coverage. This is the kind of problem \nwith which individuals are dealing. You can do that across the income \nand age spectrum, and it is an enormous issue.\n  The President's tax credit proposal simply falls far short of \noffering the whole health care coverage for 44 million Americans. In \nfact, an independent study by Ken Thorpe of Emory University finds that \nthe President's proposal would provide coverage to only 2.1 million of \nthat 44 million uninsured. That\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nis over 10 years, by the way. So we are making no dent whatsoever. It \nwould not even cover the 3.8 million who lost coverage since President \nBush came into office.\n  Furthermore, the CBO determined the President's associated health \nplan proposal would actually increase health care premiums for a \nmajority of employees working in small firms and would cause about \n10,000 individuals to lose their coverage. So the second element of the \nPresident's proposal, beyond the tax credit, is going to actually \nincrease the uninsured and increase premiums. It is hard to see how \nthat will be helpful in this overall health care crisis.\n  We could begin to address these difficult issues by acting on health \ncare in the way that a number of people put forward and, most \nparticularly, Senator Kerry has put forward. His plan would reduce \nhealth care costs for those with health insurance and expand coverage \nto 27 million Americans who currently lack it. Senator Kerry's \ncommonsense proposal builds on existing successful health care programs \nsuch as SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance Program; mandates \ncoverage for all children; and provides incentives to States to expand \ncoverage to uninsured adults. The Kerry plan would not only expand \naccess to health coverage, it would reduce premiums by about 10 percent \nfor those with insurance. He does this by making the Federal Government \na secondary insurer, whenever an individual's health care costs exceed \n$50,000 in a year. So it is a catastrophic backstop that the Federal \nGovernment takes up and covers 75 percent of those costs above that \nlevel. It would reduce costs by 10 percent for everybody who has \ninsurance. It is a very simple but important concept to add to the \nexpansion of coverage the Senator has talked about.\n  We can provide coverage to more than half of those currently \nuninsured through these steps. I think we must take those programs and \neven expand them to make sure everybody has coverage. Expanding health \ncoverage is not cheap, but the cost of refusing to expand access to \nhealth insurance is enormous as well, and it affects every one of us. \nWe all pay more for health care because hospitals and other providers \nare forced to increase prices to compensate for those without coverage \nwho use the services. They are mandated to do that at hospitals. We all \npay higher State and local taxes to compensate providers who provide \nprecare to those without coverage. We all know that. Emergency rooms, \ncharity care--all of those places where we build up these costs. It is \nimportant that we understand the cost-benefit of actually having health \ninsurance programs that work to take care of that and to eliminate some \nof those costs.\n\n  According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, we \nspent $41 billion in this Nation last year for uncompensated care for \nthe uninsured. We hear about it from our hospitals, local providers. \nThey give out care, and the total is $41 billion, according to the \nKaiser Commission. The annual cost, by the way, of that program I just \ntalked about with the Kerry proposal is $35 billion. So you have a \ncost-benefit tradeoff. If you could take care of the uninsured, you \ncould take a big bite out of that $41 billion of uncompensated care. We \nwould have to spend the money. Some folks would say we don't have the \nbudget room. We don't have the budget room to pay for the $41 billion \nthat we have. I think we can make major inroads if we work on it.\n  There are savings to be had if we are prepared to do it. I think \nmaking sure that we move on to preventive care, in conjunction with \nhealth care access, will make a huge difference in making sure that \npeople deal with diabetes before it is chronic and critical, deal with \nhypertension before it is chronic and critical. All of these things \nwill make a huge difference. People will deal with these in the normal \ncourse of preventive care as opposed to emergency or critical or \nchronic problems.\n  Madam President, there is a lot to be dealt with on this topic of \naccess to health care in this country. We need to have that debate. \nSenator Kerry has laid down an incredibly important proposal--one that \nis self-financed by the costs that it would defray from the \nunreimbursed costs going through the system. We need to address these \n44 million Americans and address the pressure that middle-class, \nmoderate Americans are feeling every day as they see this 13-percent \nincrease in health care.\n  I hope we can have a real debate on this floor so that we can move \nforward to take care of those 44 million uninsured and not have \nproposals that are dead on arrival, that have no real impact, maybe \naddressing 2 million of the 44 million and not even dealing with the \nnumbers that are increasing. As we sit here and talk about it today, \n3.8 million new Americans have gone on the uninsured rolls since this \nadministration has been in office. We need to address that problem and \nthe other 40 million that are without health insurance. There are \nproposals that make sense. It is time to address it. I hope we can have \nthat debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes remaining on your side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I come to the floor, first of all, to \nthank my colleagues for pointing out what is happening in every State \nin America today. People are struggling to get health care. My mother \nused to say, ``If you have your health, you have everything.'' I \nthought, as a child, what does she mean? Now, as I get older, I realize \nshe is right because when your family gets stricken with a disease, \nwith a problem that makes them hurt and unproductive, your world really \nfalls apart.\n  So, clearly, health care is a very big issue as we go into this \nelection season. It should be a big issue every day here. We don't see \nthe majority bringing up any kind of legislation to make life easier \nfor people, in terms of their health care. We cannot even get enough \nvotes to extend unemployment compensation for people who have been \nunemployed. So it is something for the people of America to think \nabout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5389-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5389-S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, since the war in Iraq, I have been \ncoming to the floor to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, heroes from my \nState. Today, I do that. Unfortunately, there are well over a hundred \ngone in our State. Today, I want to pay tribute to the 10 young \nAmericans killed since April 26. All of them are either from California \nor based in California.\n  SSG Abraham D. Penamedina, age 32, died April 27 when his patrol came \nunder sniper fire in Baghdad. He was from Los Angeles.\n  LCpl Aaron Austin, age 21, died April 26, due to hostile fire in Al \nAnbar Province. He was assigned to Camp Pendleton.\n  SGT Adam Estep, age 23, died April 21, when a rocket-propelled \ngrenade hit his patrol in Baghdad. He was from Campbell, CA.\n  SPC James Beckstrand, age 27, was from Escondido, CA. He died in \nBaghdad while part of a dismounted improvised explosive device sweep \npatrol when a vehicle approached his unit and the driver detonated a \nbomb.\n  SPC Trevor Wine, age 22, died May 1, from injuries sustained on April \n30, when his convoy vehicle hit an improvised explosive device in \nTikrit. He was from Orange, CA.\n  SPC Ramon Ojeda, age 22, died May 1, when his convoy was attacked in \nAl Amarah. He was from Ramona, CA.\n  PFC Lyndon Marcus, Jr., age 21, was from Long Beach, CA. He died May \n3, in Balad, Iraq, when his military vehicle rolled over into a canal.\n  SGT Marvin Sprayberry III, age 21, died May 3, in Balad, Iraq, when \nhis military vehicle rolled over into a canal. He was from Tehachapi, \nCA.\n  Cpl Jeffrey Green, age 20, was assigned to Camp Pendleton, CA. He was \nfound deceased on May 5, in the Euphrates River in Al Anbar Province. \nThe cause of his death is under investigation.\n  Cpl Dustin Schrage, age 20, was found deceased on May 6, in Al Anbar \nProvince. The cause of his death is under investigation. He was from \nCamp Pendleton, CA.\n  Madam President, 172 soldiers, who were either from California or \nbased in California, have been killed by serving their country in Iraq. \nI pray for these young Americans. I pray for their families. I pray for \ntheir friends.\n  My heart goes out to all of our soldiers, to all of them. It is \nbecause of\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nmy love for them and the country's love for them as they face danger at \nevery turn that I call on this administration to finally get a doable, \nbelievable, well-thought-out plan and exit strategy for our troops.\n  From day 1, we really scorned the international community. The \ncoalition the President talks about, when we really look at the \nnumbers, we are still carrying the burden of well over 90 percent, \nprobably 95 percent, both in the number of troops there and in the cost \nto our taxpayers, which is ever increasing.\n  Our troops were told they would be liberators, not occupiers. It has \nnot gone the way they were promised. Even their stays in Iraq have been \nextended and extended. They are exhausted.\n  I was pleased that my amendment to repay counties and cities that are \npaying the full salaries of guardsmen and reservists--at least \nreimburse them for 50 percent of the cost--was adopted.\n  Because, in my opinion, this administration never had a plan from day \n1, except for a brilliant military strategy which worked very well in \nthe invasion part of this war, I believe our troops are in grave \ndanger. Because nothing was expected to happen to them that has \nhappened to them, they did not even have the equipment, they did not \neven have the training they needed. They are underequipped, they are \nill trained, and that leads me to the prison scandal.\n  I saw those photos yesterday, and I still cannot get them out of my \nmind. I did not see them all because I physically and mentally could \nnot see any more of them, about 15 minutes' worth of the photos.\n\n  What has made our country great has been our constant and consistent \nsupport for human rights. What has made our country great has been our \nrespect for humanity. We have been a beacon of hope, not a beacon of \nfear, in the world. People have always looked up to America. We have \nbeen mighty, we have been strong, and we have been firm. Nobody is as \nstrong as we are. No one can touch us militarily. That is clear.\n  We have never, ever had a scandal like this where our people who say \nthey were under direct orders did such despicable, brutal, terrifying \nacts against other human beings. People say there are despicable acts \nhappening on so many sides, and they are so right. There are acts that \nare beyond description, such as what happened to young Mr. Berg and \nDanny Pearl. Does it make us any stronger, any more a leader to turn \nour backs on years of human rights, years of Geneva Conventions? Does \nit make us better? Does it make us stronger? Or does it make us more \nlike them, those who have no respect for humanity?\n  This is America. When I was a little girl, my parents said: We are \ndifferent than everyone else. If someone hurts us, we will fight back, \nbut we will do it within the context of humanity.\n  Those acts that I saw against other human beings--some women, some \nwho were never even charged with anything but were just being \ndetained--the most horrendous sexual humiliation and, in some cases, \nattacks, I can tell you, most of us would have fainted if it was done \nto us, fainted rather than be conscious, rather than be knowing, rather \nthan be debased. Most of us would want to be dead.\n  Our President must take responsibility. He is the Commander in Chief. \nPresident Truman did not say, ``The buck stops anywhere else.'' It \nstops at the desk of the President. He is the head of the military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, landing on a carrier in good times is \nunderstandable. Many Presidents have done that. Unfortunately, for this \none, he had a sign that said ``Mission Accomplished,'' and that was not \nto be. I understand wanting to land on a carrier in dress in good \ntimes.\n  By the way, that was a moment when the whole world was with us, and \nhe could have again engaged the international community, but he said \nno. They did not support us in the invasion, and they were not going to \nhave any of the contracts. It was going to be kept for the people in \nthis country, the Halliburtons, essentially. No, we could not share the \nglory of the moment--a horrific mistake, I think, when history is \nwritten.\n  I do not fault a President for landing on a carrier in good times. I \ndo not fault a President--all of them have done it--for marching in \nparades with the heroes, the people who chose to fight for their \ncountry. Every one of us loves to stand for them, every one of us feels \nstronger, every one of us feels taller, every one of us feels proud. I \ndo not fault the President for wanting to stand next to heroes, many of \nwhom signed up. I do not blame him. But when things go wrong, that is \nthe time when a real leader steps forward. A real leader would stop his \nordinary schedule. A real leader would not be climbing into a campaign \nbus. This is my opinion, and this is my country, and this is what I \nthink. A real leader, when faced with a crisis such as this, would stop \neverything.\n  We do not know how far up this goes. Today I read Secretary Rumsfeld \ntold the committee he felt the rules of the prison were fine. After I \ncame out of seeing those photographs, I said to myself and then I \nverbalized it to some of my colleagues, I do not want those photos seen \nby anyone in this country who has a pulse and a heart, but I have \nchanged my mind.\n  If Secretary Rumsfeld says he thought the rules in the prison were \nfine, then I want the people of America to see what happened under the \nrules of those prisons. We cannot baby the people. We must allow them \nto see what has happened.\n  It is a sad day in America when I am in a car with my 9-year-old \ngrandson and I have to turn the radio off of even a music station \nbecause I fear they might have a news break and he is going to hear \nsomething that is going to make him frightened.\n  It is a hard time for our country, but we have had these hard times \nbefore. We have had the hard times domestically. We have had the hard \ntimes during war. After 9/11, I think the heart of this country was \nbroken. We are facing a new enemy. It is going to be a long-term \nbattle. I gave the President full authority to go get those people, the \nal-Qaida. Instead of doing that, he made a u-turn and went into Iraq \nwith no plan, and we are paying a price.\n  Those young people who are saying they were not trained, we will find \nout if that is a fact, but these are tough times. The thing that keeps \nme going is the greatness of the American people, the wisdom of the \nAmerican people, the strength of our Constitution and our ability to \nface these things head on. That is where I will close today.\n  The American people need to see the truth. They are told by Secretary \nRumsfeld that what went on in that prison, that the rules of engagement \nin that prison, were fine with him.\n  I want to clarify that. He did not say what went on in the prison was \nfine with him. He said the rules that governed the prison were fine \nwith him. What I am saying is those rules that allowed this behavior, \none prisoner being pulled by a belt over and over again, his head \nslammed against a steel door, his hands behind his back, others being \nforced into positions that I will not describe, being harmed in the \nmost vulnerable ways imaginable. No, I did not want people to see it, \nbut now I fear they must see it.\n  All the talk about the privacy of the people, absolutely if they see \nit they cannot see faces. That is for sure.\n  I did not expect to be here today even talking about this. I came to \ntalk about another subject, but when I heard the Secretary of Defense \ndefend the rules of that prison I felt I had to come and tell the \npeople of this country, and the good people of my State who have sent \nme here twice, I think they need to see it for themselves.\n  Do not take my word for it. Do not take the word of another Senator \nwho says, oh, God, they are making such a fuss over this; what is all \nthe outrage about. That is another reason they should see the pictures. \nDo not believe me. Do not believe that other Senator. Believe your \neyes, believe what you see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5391-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5391-S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, it gives me great pleasure to join \nwith my colleagues today and talk about something that happened 50 \nyears ago, which has been a difficult and important journey that we \nhave been on. On May 17, 1954, Dwight Eisenhower was President of the \nUnited States and the Supreme Court of the United States issued an \nopinion that changed the country. It was Brown v. the Board of \nEducation. The Brown was the Reverend Oliver Brown of Topeka, KS, my \nhometown.\n  The case of Brown v. the Board of Education was the case that ended \nsegregation in our schools and in our society. It was really the \nbeginning legal case that moved that forward.\n  On Monday, we will dedicate in Topeka, KS, the school that was the \nbasis for the complaint. It is the Monroe School. It will be dedicated \nas a national historical site, a national park. The President will be \nthere. A number of different dignitaries will be there to celebrate and \nsay where we have been over the last 50 years after we ended \nsegregation in this country in 1954 and where we are going.\n  It is going to be a beautiful occasion. It is a momentous occasion. \nIt is an important occasion. We have been on a journey during that \nperiod of time of the 50 years. It has been a rocky road since that \ntime period. It was certainly difficult before that time period. It has \nnot always been going in the right direction, but at the end of the day \nwe have been going in the overall right direction.\n  We are on a journey. What is the destination? Well, I think the best \nplace to look is to Martin Luther King's words. He said:\n\n       The end is reconciliation; the end is redemption; the end \n     is the creation of the beloved community.\n\n  These are words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King spoken on \nDecember 3, 1956, after the completion of the Montgomery bus boycott. \nThese words symbolize the goal of this great Nation, a goal that is \nechoed throughout our history: The end is reconciliation; the end is \nredemption; the end is the creation of the beloved community.\n  In this quote, Dr. King, who was and remains a prophet to the Nation, \nis speaking of a time in which all people in the United States will be \nable to live together harmoniously, reconciled with one another and \nwith God, as one people under God.\n  Today we look back on the history of our Nation and take note of how \nfar we have come as a people. We are reminded that we owe a great debt \nto those who have fought valiantly for the freedoms we easily take for \ngranted.\n  On the eve of the 50th anniversary of this case, it is fitting that \ntoday the Senate takes time to honor the Brown case, the Brown family, \nwhich is one of the greatest civil rights cases in our Nation's history \nand one that changed the way in which we view equality under the law in \nour society. More than any other case, Brown sets this Nation on a path \nof ensuring freedom and equality in America.\n  The United States is a nation that symbolizes the essence of freedom, \nequality, and democracy. These principles are embedded in the documents \nthat established this country. Yet as a young nation, America had not \nyet bestowed these ideals upon African Americans who resided in this \ncountry. Though progress was made after the Civil War, America had yet \nto realize her true potential as a nation built on freedom and equality \nfor all. It was not until the landmark Supreme Court decision of Brown \nwas rendered that our country was ushered into a symbol of freedom and \ndemocracy of what Dr. King did so eloquently describe as the beloved \ncommunity.\n\n  May 17, 2004, marks the 50th anniversary of the Brown decision which \neffectively ended school segregation in America. However, the history \nof desegregation of our public school system started before Brown in \nsuch cases as Murray v. Maryland and Sweatt v. Painter. It was the \nBrown case that caught fire and changed the course of American history \nin the way in which we view equality in the eyes of the law.\n  Before Brown, many States in this country held and enforced racially \nsegregated laws which was an atrocious practice. Many individuals cited \nthe 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case, and I note that while the Court got \nit right in Brown, the Court has gotten it wrong in the last two. \nCourts are not infallible institutions. They are made of people such as \nwe are. They make good decisions and they make bad situations. They \nmade a bad decision in Plessy that was the law of the land for 50 years \nafter it--a little more than 50 years. They made a bad decision in the \nDred Scott decision--the Fugitive Slave Act that was applicable across \nthe land until, really, the Civil War. They make good decisions and \nthey make bad decisions.\n  The Plessy case, which was a bad decision, sanctioned the separate \nbut equal doctrine as the grounds for keeping school segregation legal.\n  During that time, there were court cases that challenged this \nseparate but equal doctrine because the schools for African American \nchildren were substandard facilities with out-of-date textbooks and \noften no basic school supplies. In fact, in Kansas, alone, there were \n11 school integration cases dating from 1881 to 1949, prior to Brown.\n  By 1950, African-American parents began to renew their efforts to \nchallenge State laws that only permitted their children to attend \ncertain schools, and as a result, they organized through the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People the NAACP, an \norganization founded in 1909 to address the issue of the unequal and \ndiscriminatory treatment experienced by African Americans throughout \nthe country.\n  It was at this time that Rev. Oliver L. Brown, a citizen of Topeka, \nKansas became part of the NAACP strategy to file suit against various \nschool boards on behalf of African American parents and their children. \nThis effort was led first by Charles Houston and later by Thurgood \nMarshall.\n  On February 28, 1951, Rev. Brown, along with 13 parents and 20 \nchildren, filed a lawsuit against the Topeka School Board on behalf of \nhis 7-year-old daughter, Linda.\n  Like other young African Americans, Linda had to cross a set of \nrailroad tracks and board a bus that took her to the ``colored'' school \non the opposite side of the city from where she lived--even though a \nschool for white children was located only a few blocks from her home.\n  The case was taken to the District Court of Kansas, but the ruling \nwas not beneficial to Rev. Brown and the others. The court admitted \nthat segregated schools gave African American children a feeling of \ninferiority, but felt that they must uphold the decisions of Plessy vs. \nFerguson, which stated that separate but equal is still equal, and \nsubsequently, ruled in favor of the Board of Education.\n  On October 1, 1951, Rev. Brown's team appealed the case to the \nSupreme Court, where the Brown case was combined with other NAACP cases \nfrom Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, DC, which was \nlater, heard separately. These combined cases became known as Oliver L. \nBrown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka, et al.\n  There were many notable African Americans who helped to bring these \ncases to the United States Supreme Court; however, none so famous as \nSupreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who valiantly defended the \nrights of not only Linda Brown and the other defendants in the case, \nbut of an entire race of individuals who were treated as second class \ncitizens.\n  During the course of the trial, Thurgood Marshall used expert \nwitnesses in child psychology and referenced the detrimental impact \nthat segregation in our Nation's School System had on African American \nchildren.\n  He also referenced the cases of Sweatt v. Painter, and McLaurin v. \nOklahoma, both of which made a lot of progress in the desegregation of \ncolleges and universities when the court ruled that the restrictions of \nAfrican Americans actually hinder their learning.\n  He argued that younger children were equally hindered by segregation, \nand therefore there was no logical argument that could justify ruling \nagainst segregation in higher learning, and uphold the Plessy v. \nFerguson case when referring to elementary and secondary schools.\n  On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court rendered its decision to rule \nracial segregation in schools unconstitutional.\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court found the ``separate but equal'' doctrine to \nbe in violation of the 14th amendment of the United States \nConstitution, which states, among other things, that:\n\n       No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge \n     the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United \n     States.\n\n  When the court ruled, in 1954, that school segregation laws were \nunconstitutional, the Supreme Court demolished the legal foundation on \nwhich racial segregation stood. The court's opinion, written and \ndelivered by Chief Justice Earl Warren, also served as a stirring moral \nindictment of racial segregation, and an eloquent challenge to America \nto cast off its prejudices and extend its promises of life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness to all citizens, regardless of race or \ncolor.\n  Today, I am proud to join with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to \nhonor this magnificent case in our Nation's history.\n  I am encouraged that with this case, this Nation was able to move one \nstep closer to that ``beloved community'' Dr. King referenced, where \nredemption through reconciliation can occur. Therefore, the importance \nof this case does not solely reside in the law, but equally sheds light \non our responsibility to humanity and upon our ability to reconcile our \ndifferences, with one another and through that process seek redemption, \nand achieve the creation of the ``beloved community.''\n  As we celebrate Brown today and next week, we are one step closer to \nthat goal for our country and I invite our Nation to join with us in \ncelebrating this magnificent case that stirred a Nation's consciousness \nand was the basis for shattering segregation in our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Celebrating a Landmark Decision in the Civil Rights Movement: the \n50th Anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education Decision\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, from Civil War to the war against racism, \nKansas has been a battleground in the fight for equality. Oliver Brown \nwas a soldier in this struggle, as he courageously fought to prove that \nseparate among the people of this great Nation is not equal.\n  The watershed case that bears his name stands for all time as an \nimportant victory in the civil rights movement. On Monday, May 17, \n2004, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of this momentous \ndecision. And in Topeka, KS, we will gather to dedicate Monroe \nElementary School as the Brown v. Topeka Board of Education National \nHistoric site. This new addition to the National Park Service will \nafford us the proper setting to fully reflect on what this decision has \nmeant to our Nation, and will provide future visitors with a more \ncomplete understanding of how Linda Brown's struggle changed the course \nof our Nation's history.\n  The Monroe Elementary School, purchased in 1877 by the Topeka Board \nof Education, was one of the four segregated elementary schools for \nAfrican American children in Topeka. The current building is actually \nthe third Monroe school to stand there, built in 1926.\n  Monroe was a good school, built by the same architect who built other \nschools in Topeka, including those reserved for white children. And the \nteachers were well-trained, many of whom had advanced degrees. This \nwasn't a case of substandard facilities, or a lack of educational \nopportunities for Linda Brown and her classmates. This was simply \ninjustice under the law, and the need to right a grievous wrong.\n  The Brown Foundation, under the leadership of Cheryl Brown Henderson, \nhas worked diligently to preserve the bricks and mortar that were a \npart of this historic case. Far more than just a building, however, \nthis site represents the genesis of the movement to strike down our \nNation's segregationist policy.\n  Thanks to his daughter Cheryl's efforts, and those of countless \nothers, Monroe Elementary was designated a National Historic Landmark \nin 1991. I, along with Senator Robert J. Dole and Senator Nancy Landon \nKassebaum, am proud to have supported legislation creating the Brown v. \nBoard of Education National Historic site, which was signed into law by \nPresident George Bush in 1992.\n  As stated in the legislation, the purposes of this important site \nare:\n\n       To preserve, protect, and interpret the places that \n     contributed materially to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court \n     decision which ended segregation in public education, to \n     interpret the role of the Brown case in the civil rights \n     movement, and to assist in the preservation and \n     interpretation of related resources within the city of Topeka \n     that further the understanding of the civil rights movement.\n\n  That bill challenged us to properly commemorate and interpret this \nhistory, and ensure that the story of Linda Brown and the thousands of \nother children who were denied access to white elementary schools is \ntold. This new site has met every expectation of ours, and pays proper \ntribute to the struggle for civil rights. As we dedicate the Brown v. \nBoard of Education National Historic site, what was once a building \ndesigned to educate a few, now stands ready to educate us all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I came to speak on other matters, but I \nthought it would be helpful to straighten out some things, where maybe \nthose who are watching or who have heard might have a misapprehension \nas to the position that the Secretary of Defense has taken.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff are in Baghdad today. I have heard it said that the Secretary \ndefended the rules of engagement for the Abu Ghraib prison, with \npossibly a misunderstanding that he approved or somehow condoned what \nwent on and what has been revealed in the shocking photos of abuse we \nhave seen.\n  Let's be clear on one thing. The rules of engagement are very clear, \nand the rules of engagement do not permit or tolerate the kind of \nabuses we have seen depicted in the Abu Ghraib prison. This is a real \ndifference between a free, democratic country with respect for human \nrights observing the Geneva Convention, and those who do not. It has \nbeen stated on the Senate floor that we are no better than the Saddam \nHussein government that was running the prisons. That is an unnecessary \nslanderous attack on the men and women of the military who do believe, \nby and large--99.999 percent--in the standards we set.\n  The difference in our country is that when we see these evidences of \nabuse we move to do something about them. Investigations began in \nJanuary. The first criminal indictments were handed down near the end \nof March. We are proceeding with the prosecution of those who have been \nshown to be engaged, and we will follow that up the chain of command if \nsomebody gave orders that were interpreted to permit this kind of \nbehavior. This is a real difference--and I think it is important for \nAmericans and people throughout the world to realize that there is a \ndifference.\n  It was said earlier this morning that the President took a U-turn \naway from dealing with terrorism and went into Iraq. Let me remind my \ncolleagues and the people of the United States that, after viewing the \nintelligence, 77 Senators said we need to do something about Iraq \nbecause it is a dangerous country, harboring terrorists. We didn't take \na U-turn. We went into Iraq because it was one of the great dangers to \nthe world, in terms of harboring terrorists.\n  David Kay, who was leading the Iraqi Survey Group, made many \ninspections over there. He didn't find large caches of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Nobody said we would. What he did say when he came back \nwas the situation in Iraq was far more dangerous than we even knew \nbecause terrorist gangs were roaming Iraq. Iraq had produced and used \nchemical or biological weapons on its own people and on the Iranians, \nand this was a dangerous territory. We have seen in recent days how \ndangerous it has become because of al-Zarqawi, a colleague-in-arms of \nOsama bin Laden, set up 2 to 3 years ago, and Ansar al-Islam, which is \nthe deadly, vicious terrorist organization that beheaded Nicholas Berg.\n  If the world needs to know the difference, the difference is when \nthere are abuses such as putting a chain around the neck of an Iraqi \nprisoner, we are going to prosecute people. In Iraq, al-Zarqawi can cut \nthe head off an innocent American hostage and I have\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nyet to hear any outcry or outrage from the people in that region. There \nis a real difference.\n  But we ought to be worried about young people hearing about \nhostages--innocent hostages--being beheaded. Daniel Pearl of the Wall \nStreet Journal was beheaded.\n  These are the people we are dealing with. This is why this matter is \nimportant. This battle is not won. It is going to be a battle not of \nmonths, maybe not even of years, and maybe decades. But the world is \ngoing to be safer, and we are going to be safer in the United States if \nwe can continue the battle President Bush has laid out to carry the war \non terrorism to those countries that harbor terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5393-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I came here to recognize and commend the \ngreat work of Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy on crafting an IDEA \nbill. They produced a solid, thoughtful, bipartisan bill which protects \nthe educational rights of children with special needs while at the same \ntime making IDEA more workable for parents, teachers, school \nadministrators, and school districts.\n  I think we all agree IDEA was a great idea. It helped open doors for \nmany children with special needs since it was enacted in 1975. Yet \nthere is no question that significant problems exist.\n  As I traveled through Missouri and talked with educators, teachers, \nadministrators, parents, and school board members, I heard all kinds of \nproblems with IDEA. Over the years, these teachers, principals, and \nadministrators in Missouri have told me IDEA has become a morass of \nrules, of regulations and litigation that truly limit access and in \nsome instances actually hinder learning--not just for children with \ndisabilities but for all children. That is simply not acceptable.\n  Educators are struggling under a crushing procedural and paperwork \nburden imposed by IDEA, contributing to what is becoming a chronic \nshortage of quality teachers in special education in Missouri and \nnationwide. Special education teachers are leaving the profession--not \nout of frustration with the children whom they are there to serve, but \nout of frustration with the overwhelming and unnecessary paperwork and \nthe regulatory burdens they face. Without a qualified teacher, a child \nwith a disability cannot receive a free, appropriate public education.\n  Most special educators report they have to spend 20 to 50 percent of \ntheir time on paperwork. More time spent on paperwork is less time \nspent with students or preparing lesson plans for students. It is as \nsimple as that. We cannot continue to let IDEA interfere with the time \neducators can devote to the children they serve because we all know a \nmisdirected focus on paperwork, on procedures, and on bureaucracy \nfrustrates teachers and fails to give children the education they need.\n  In addition, over the years IDEA has encouraged and fostered \nadversarial relationships between school districts, staff, and parents. \nTime, money, and resources exhausted in costly litigation would be far \nbetter spent on instruction for children. Taking limited dollars away \nfrom children with disabilities and redirecting them to attorneys to \nfight long and costly battles is simply counterproductive. It does not \nhelp the education of our children--all children, special children and \nother children in the schools.\n  These are a few of the concerns I have heard from Missouri educators \nover the years. But the thing I like about Missouri educators is they \ndon't simply tell me what the problem is; they show me how to fix it. \nMaybe that is one of the reasons they call Missouri the ``Show Me'' \nState.\n  The Missouri School Board Association's Special Education Advocacy \nCouncil, working in partnership with the Missouri Council of \nAdministrators of Special Education, developed a list of thoughtful, \nsolid, and detailed recommendations to improve IDEA and inject a little \nbit of good old-fashioned commonsense reform to IDEA.\n  In fact, the Missouri Special Education Advocacy Council examined the \nIDEA statute line by line and told me exactly where and how we improve \nthe statute by refocusing special education on educating children with \nspecial needs rather than simply complying with a system of complex \nregulations and mountains of paperwork and red tape.\n  I am pleased many of the recommendations made by MSBA's Special \nEducation Advocacy Council have been incorporated in S. 1248. The \nnumerous paperwork and regulatory reforms in the bill will go a long \nway to free special educators' time to spend with their students and in \npreparing effective instruction plans. In addition, this bill contains \nmany provisions to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents \nand school districts.\n  I thank both Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for including these \ncritical reforms in the Senate bill. This bill will improve and \nstrengthen IDEA and extend the promise of quality education for a new \ngeneration of children with special needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  There is one other thing I want to address. I want to talk a minute \nabout funding IDEA. We heard a lot of talk yesterday about the broken \npromises. The authorization for IDEA said the Federal Government is \ngoing to provide 40 percent of the cost of IDEA. Over 19 years, funding \nfor IDEA has increased from $251,000 in 1977 to $2.3 billion in 1996.\n  Our side took control of Congress in 1995, and over the course of \nthat time period, the Republican Congress has increased funding for \nIDEA by 224 percent since 1996. That was done through the \nappropriations process.\n  If the President's budget is enacted, it will have increased funding \nfor IDEA by 376 percent. The average per-pupil expenditure has \nincreased from 7 percent to almost 20 percent. If you include the \nPresident's budget request for this year, IDEA funding since 2001 will \nhave increased $4.7 billion--75 percent in this President's budget.\n  In comparison, in the 1980s IDEA was one of the spending \nappropriations categories that did not increase. In fact, in many of \nthose years the Federal Government covered less than the States' \naverage per-pupil expenditure for children with disabilities than it \nhad the year before. I am proud of our leadership in this Congress \nwhich has made steady progress toward finally trying to reach the 40-\npercent level authorized in 1975. We have made great strides toward \nfulfilling the commitment. I know the people in education are very \nappreciative of those increases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5393-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BROWN v.

I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Stay Put Rule\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to commend the bill managers for reaching a \nbipartisan compromise on this important issue. Recognizing the \nsubstantial challenges the current law has posed to many schools and \nschool districts, this bill seeks to strike a very difficult balance \nbetween the interests of disabled children and their families and the \nschools and school districts. However, despite the substantial \nimprovements this legislation makes over current law, issues of concern \nremain among a number of interested parties, including education groups \nin Arizona.\n  I am also concerned about some of the unintended consequences that \nhave arisen as a result of the Federal restrictions placed on school \ndistricts concerning the manner in which they are allowed to discipline \nstudents with special needs. For example, an Arizona school district \nrecently identified a number of students involved in the sale and \ndistribution of illegal drugs on school property, a very serious \nincident that placed the other students and the teachers at that school \nat great risk. All of the students involved in the incident were \nexpelled, with the exception of one student who has a mild disability.\n  I recognize the Senator from New Hampshire already has worked to \ninclude language in this bill to reverse the ``stay put rule,'' which \nschools, school districts, and the Arizona Superintendent of Education, \nTom Horne, have expressed substantial frustration over. I want to \ncommend the sponsor's efforts and hope to work with him to ensure that \nschools are not prevented from taking action to discipline children as \nappropriate, including those enrolled in IDEA. I know this issue is \nalso of concern to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I would also like to congratulate the senior Senator from \nNew Hampshire for his success in getting this legislation this far \nthrough hard work and bipartisanship. We recognize that securing \nconsensus necessitated compromise on a position we all share: that \nschools should be able to maintain a single standard for discipline. \nLike Senator McCain, I am very pleased that this legislation repeals \nthe ``stay-put rule,'' a major priority of Superintendent Horne and \nother education leaders in our state.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. IDEA is centered on an \nindividualized approach to educating children with special needs. \nDisciplining those students whose actions endanger other students and \nfaculty also should be done on an individual basis--a one size-fits-all \nFederal approach to discipline disregards the individual nature of the \nactions of the students involved, and is not the best approach.\n  Another issue that concerns schools and administrators in Arizona is \nSection 616, regarding monitoring, technical assistance, and \nenforcement. It would allow the Secretary of Education to refer a case \nto the Department of Justice if the Secretary determines the State has \nshown a ``significant lack of progress'' or is in ``substantial \nnoncompliance'' or ``egregious noncompliance'' with IDEA. Schools from \nacross Arizona are concerned that the language in this bill is too \nvague and could lead to excessively burdensome litigation if a State is \nlabeled to be ``significantly noncompliant'' or ``egregiously \nnoncompliant.''\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly understand the concern that this provision could \nhave unintended consequences. I hope that in conference this language \ncan be clarified to focus on the achievement of outcomes through the \ndevelopment of a sound remedial plan, overseen by the Department of \nEducation. Many of us have expressed concern over the cumbersome \nlitigation sometimes associated with IDEA. This language could make the \nstatus quo worse--tying up critical personnel and diverting scarce \nresources, without ensuring positive outcomes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have also heard substantial concern from groups in \nArizona regarding language that may compel states to pay for lawsuits \nagainst State or local education entities. I know these concerns also \nhave been expressed to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. The Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions, perhaps drawing on his experience as a Governor, has been \neloquent in detailing the burdens this Federal statute has placed on \nStates. I trust that as the final bill language is crafted, he and his \ncolleagues will be striving to ensure that the need to provide parents \nwith appropriate mechanisms for vindicating their due process rights \nwill be balanced appropriately against the imperative not to impose \nexcessive new burdens on state governments.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand your concerns and will take them to \nconference.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the sponsor of this important legislation and \ngreatly appreciate his willingness to ensure that these important \nissues are addressed as this measure continues through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, first I commend my colleagues on the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for all of your \nhard work on this important piece of legislation and for bringing a \nbipartisan bill before the full Senate.\n  When the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, or IDEA, was \nenacted in 1975 it brought with it the promise that children with \ndisabilities would have access to the same quality education as \nnondisabled students. Over the last 30 years, IDEA has advanced the \ninclusion of students with disabilities into general education \nclassrooms and has given nearly 6 million students nationwide access to \nservices that address their special needs.\n  When Congress passed IDEA nearly 30 years ago, they committed to \nproviding states with 40 percent of the funding necessary to implement \nthis law. Much to my dismay, Congress has failed our schools and the \nstudents they serve by providing them with a meager 19 percent of the \nfunding as of fiscal year 2004. It was my hope that this current \nreauthorization would include mandatory full funding for IDEA because I \nbelieve that schools have waited long enough for the Federal Government \nto fulfill the promise made to them so many years ago.\n  I was proud to support an amendment proposed by my colleague from \nIowa yesterday, which would have provided mandatory full funding of \nIDEA. Unfortunately, the amendment failed by a small margin. I \nsupported another amendment, however, offered by my colleague from New \nHampshire to provide full discretionary funding for IDEA, which passed \nthe Senate. I am proud that the Senate made full funding for IDEA a \npriority, and I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout \nthe appropriations process to make full funding a reality.\n  There are several important aspects of this bill, which will improve \nthe educational experience of students, parents, and teachers. I am \npleased that this bill will reduce the paperwork burden on teachers. I \nhave heard from many special education teachers in my State of Arkansas \nthat spend an inordinate amount of time on paperwork and this \nlegislation would provide them with welcome relief so that they can \nfocus on student performance.\n  This bill will also streamline discipline procedures, which I believe \nwill make schools safer and provide school administrators with \nincreased flexibility. Additionally, it will improve parental \ninvolvement by creating parent and community information centers with \nthe objective of encouraging parents and schools to work together and \nresolve disputes in a smooth and efficient way. I am also pleased that \nthis bill provides more resources to schools to better train teachers \nand parents. This provision is of particular importance to Arkansas \nwhere school districts are trying to give financial assistance to \nteachers for continuing education but are struggling because they face \ntough budget times.\n  I would also like to reinforce that every single child's learning \nexperience is impacted by their community and school environment. Let \nus not forget that children with disabilities contribute an \nextraordinary amount to that learning environment. Students with \ndisabilities deserve every opportunity to achieve educational success \nso that they can take on productive jobs and lead independent lives. \nIDEA is a critical law in ensuring that these opportunities are \navailable, and I believe the bill before the Senate today\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nwill help educators, parents, and students achieve success in the \nclassroom and beyond.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, regulations applying IDEA are complex, and \nI applaud the work of my colleagues in trying to make these regulations \na little easier for students, parents, and schools. This bill is a \nclear signal that the Senate is concerned about the welfare of our \nchildren with special needs.\n  S. 1248 helps our students by providing early access to services and \nsupport while working to reduce the misidentification of nondisabled \nchildren. This bill aims to make things easier for parents by allowing \nparents and schools to make changes to a student's individualized \neducation plan, IEP, without calling an entire IEP meeting. S. 1248 \nshould also help to relieve the burden on schools that are often \nassociated with special education regulations. It includes provisions \nto improve discipline and school safety, reduce paperwork, and simplify \nfunding for grants to State agencies.\n  Mr. President, as you know, when IDEA was signed into law, Congress \ncommitted to contribute up to 40 percent of the costs associated with \nspecial education. We have failed miserably in this. One important \nprovision in this bill is a plan to authorize the Congress to fund its \n40 percent portion completely by the year 2011. I am pleased to report \nour success in the Senate and pledge my commitment to seeing the \nFederal Government contributes its full share.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1248, the IDEA Reauthorization Act.\n  A concerned Utah parent called one of the school districts yesterday \nto ask for help. Her son is being released from a 24-hour mental health \nfacility. He is not ready for a regular class setting, but there isn't \nroom for him to be accommodated in a self-contained setting even though \nthat school district is trying to provide a quality education for all \nstudents, including those with special needs.\n  ``We love them, even though sometimes they burn us out,'' said one of \nour outstanding (and overworked) special education teachers. She is \ndedicated to these children who are guaranteed an education under IDEA, \nthe Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act.\n  All students identified for special education present unique \nchallenges. There are students with specific learning disabilities that \nare mild to moderate. Of these, many will be successfully educated and \nhave futures filled with higher education or specialized technical \ntraining, careers, and families. Even many of the students with \nprofound, significant disabilities will become wage earners, thanks to \na great nation that understands and upholds the right of all students \nto an education. Utah is particularly successful with those students \nbecause of strong family and community-based support. Though they may \nnever be able to live in complete independence, they realize an \nexcellent measure of accomplishment and contribution.\n  Of major concern are students such as the young teen who just walked \nout the front door of the mental health facility. He is among a growing \nnumber of students with severe emotional problems. Their disabilities \nmay prevent them from becoming wage earners, good parents, and \nresponsible citizens. Many will end up in prison. Unfortunately, there \nis a lot of lost potential here. But they will not be lost if we can \ntap into their potential.\n  With this important reauthorization, I have had the benefit of input \nfrom various groups and individuals, including my own Disability \nAdvisory Committee in Utah, made up of State and local officials and \nrepresentatives from organizations specializing in disability advocacy. \nThe Utah State Legislature has been in the forefront of the debate \nabout the Federal funding of education as they continue to take the \nresponsibility of providing an education to every child in my State.\n  Funding special education is an important priority. I believe that \nthe Federal Government's responsibility is to do its utmost, through \nthe appropriations process, to direct funds to the States, who are \ncertainly in the best position to decide how best to utilize these \nfunds. Although appropriations for IDEA part B grants to states have \nincreased significantly over the last 9 years, funding still falls \nshort of the amount that would be necessary to provide maximum grants \nto all States.\n  I agree that we need to put IDEA on the path of full funding with the \ngoal of reaching the Federal Government's promise of 40 percent. While \nfunding since 1996 has quadrupled, we are only halfway there. For this \nreason, I supported Chairman Judd Gregg's funding amendment, passed by \na vote of 96-1 yesterday, that sets increasing discretionary \nauthorizations for special education grants to States so that Congress \nwill be on track to meet 100 percent of the full funding commitment by \n2011.\n  I am heartened that we have the support of the appropriators to reach \nthe commitment. I am satisfied that the President will keep education \nas one of his highest priorities. Be assured that I will be keeping a \nwatchful eye on this funding as we review it every year. If we fall \nshort, I will be prepared to revisit this issue. It is not fair for \nStates and localities to be saddled with Federal mandates they can ill \nafford. Congress should live up to its commitment, which I believe we \nhave with passage of the Gregg amendment and assurances of our \nappropriators.\n  While I am on the topic of the unwise burdens the Federal Government \nimposes on States, I would be remiss if I did not emphasize the \ntremendous costs of overregulation. Paperwork saps valuable time away \nfrom educators and diverts their number one focus: educating Utah's \nstudents. Senator Rick Santorum's amendment will give States the \nopportunity to reduce paperwork burdens associated with IDEA \nrequirements and increase the resources available for improving results \nfor children with disabilities. That is why I strongly support it.\n  Indeed, reduction in paperwork is also a priority for the teachers. \nWe need to encourage individuals to become qualified special education \nteachers. Take for example Utah--which is unquestionably a great place \nto live. Even there, it is difficult to find teachers to fill these \ncrucial positions. It is even more difficult in rural districts.\n  I am confident that under IDEA reauthorization, we can address these \ndeficiencies by reducing paperwork, providing resources for recruitment \nof new teachers and for training, and making classrooms safer.\n  The IDEA reauthorization, albeit imperfect, provides a pathway to \nsuccess for our greatest asset: all of America's children.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nbefore us to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct--IDEA. I want to start by thanking my fellow committee members and \ntheir staff for all of their hard work in putting together the \nbipartisan legislation we are considering today. While we may still \nhave some disagreements about the bill, getting to this point in a \nbipartisan way is no small achievement, and I know we are all better \nfor it.\n  Today, nothing pleases me more than to introduce, with my many of my \ncolleagues, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act \nof 2003. This bill will ensure that students with disabilities get the \nservices they are entitled to while providing school systems with a \ngreater degree of flexibility in implementing the law.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2003 \nemphasizes accountability and improved results, improves monitoring and \nenforcement of the law, and works to reduce litigation by providing new \nopportunities for parents and schools to address concerns and disputes. \nThe bill reduces paperwork by streamlining State and local paperwork \nrequirements and clarifying that no information is required in an \nindividualized education plan--IEP--beyond what Federal law requires. \nLike No Child Left Behind, this bill increases and improves \nopportunities for parental involvement and supports teachers in \nbecoming ``highly qualified'' to do their jobs.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act provides \nearlier access to services and supports for infants, toddlers and \npreschoolers with disabilities. It also properly puts added emphasis on \ntransition services so that special education students leave the system \nready to be full productive citizens, whether they choose to go on to \ncollege or a job.\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\n  These are the things that the Senate bill does. Sadly, there is one \nglaring provision missing. This bill does not contain a provision to \nprovide mandatory full-funding of IDEA; A provision that my colleagues \nSenator Harkin and Hagel tried to get incorporated into the bill \nyesterday.\n  Almost 30 years ago, Congress passed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act to help States provide all children with \ndisabilities with a free, appropriate public education in the least \nrestrictive environment possible. Since that time, this law has made an \nincredible difference in the lives of millions of American children and \ntheir families.\n  When we passed the law, we not only promised to bring special \neducation students into the regular school system, we made a commitment \nto cover 40 percent of the State cost of servicing students with \nspecial needs over time. Thirty years later, we have yet to make good \non this commitment. Today the Federal Government supports just over 18 \npercent of the cost of the program. That is not even half of the 40 \npercent we promised 29 years ago.\n  In order to rectify this situation, Senators Harkin and Hagel put \ntogether an amendment mandating full funding of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. This amendment failed yesterday 56-41. This \nsaddens and frustrates me. Had it passed, I believe this amendment \nwould have proven to have been the most important provision in this \nbill.\n  States and municipalities are bearing more than their share of \nresponsibility for meeting disabled students' needs. In Connecticut, \nthe State typically covers 32 percent of the costs of special \neducation, local school districts cover 61 percent of the costs of \nspecial education, and the Federal Government covers only 7 percent.\n  Certainly States and municipalities are paying more than their share \nof special education costs. They need our help. Senator Harkin's and \nHagel's amendment provided an opportunity to give them the help that \nthey need.\n  Only mandatory full-funding of IDEA would demonstrate this body's \ncommitment to universal access to education for all children, while \nhelping entire communities ease their tax burden. As I have said \nbefore, I cannot accept the argument that because our economy is \nfaltering, or we are a Nation at war, we cannot provide our children \nand their families with the critical educational resources they need. \nInvestment in education is no less important in a weak economy or while \nour Nation is at war.\n  Education needs to be viewed as a national priority. In fact, \neducation is the key to a healthy democracy, and absolutely essential \nto our long-term national and economic security.\n  Like Senators Harkin and Hagel, I support the idea of mandatory full-\nfunding because it is good for students, families, schools, \nmunicipalities, states and the average American taxpayer. The funding \nfight on IDEA has been a long one over the years and I believe that \nschools have already waited to long.\n  Fundamentally, this is a good bill--one that will help guarantee the \nfull potential of all our children while assisting school districts in \ntheir efforts to deliver special education services in an efficient \nmanner. That is why I will support the underlying bill. Thank you.\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act--IDEA--reauthorization legislation that \nthe Senate is considering today. I want to note for the record that I \nwould have voted for this important legislation but for a death in the \nfamily that required me to be home.\n  First of all, I commend Chairman Judd Gregg and Senator Ted Kennedy \nfor working in a bipartisan manner to craft this important reform \nlegislation. Children with disabilities ought to have the same access \nto a quality education as any other student. Since its enactment in \n1975, IDEA has helped do this by ensuring that children with \ndisabilities have access to a quality education. S. 1248 will make \nneeded improvements to IDEA by improving services for these children, \nexpanding parental involvement, and providing much needed support for \nspecial education teachers.\n  Under current law, IDEA's complicated regulations have detracted from \nthe success of the program. For too long, IDEA has focused on the \nprocess rather than the outcome. That is why I support simplifying the \nlaw's burdensome due-process requirements, which have created excessive \namounts of paperwork for teachers. This duplicative paperwork has taken \nteachers' valuable time away from teaching in the classroom, and \nsometimes has even driven special education teachers out of the \nclassroom. I believe that this legislation will reduce the paperwork \nburden for teachers and thus allow teachers to do their job--teaching \nchildren.\n  This legislation also helps reduce misidentification of non-disabled \nchildren. Misidentification of special education students has fueled \ngrowing IDEA cost. S. 1248 provides reform by allowing for the \ndevelopment of new approaches to determine whether students have \nspecific learning disabilities by clarifying that schools are not \nlimited to using IQ-achievement tests and by providing funds for \ntraining school personnel to prevent over-identification and \nmisidentification of children.\n  I am, however, disappointed by the failure to pass an important \namendment, which I co-authored. This amendment would have provided for \nannual increases in IDEA funding of $2.2 billion, allowing the program \nto reach full federal funding levels by 2011. When IDEA was enacted in \n1975, the Federal Government promised to pay 40 percent of the costs of \neducating children with disabilities. Currently, however, the Federal \nGovernment contributes only 19 percent, placing an unfair and serious \nfinancial burden on States and local school districts. Due to Congress' \nfailure to fully fund IDEA, school districts, especially those in rural \nareas, are forced to take funds from their general budgets to operate \nspecial education programs. As a result, schools have been forced to \ncut important educational programs and delay infrastructure \nimprovements. I have met with teachers and students from rural \nMinnesota and know how tight school budgets there are already. This \namendment would have brought much needed fiscal relief to Minnesota \nschools.\n  But, I do commend my Republican colleagues and the President for \ntheir support of IDEA funding. The most dramatic increases in IDEA \nfunding have all occurred under Republican control of Congress and, in \nrecent years, a Republican White House. Since FY 2001, IDEA funding \nwill have increased by $4.7 billion or 75 percent. The Republican \nCongress has already increased funding for IDEA by 224 percent since \n1996. If the President's FY 05 budget is enacted, it will have \nincreased by 376 percent. I encourage my colleagues to support \nincreased funding so that we keep our promise to fully fund \nIDEA.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote for the IDEA Improvement Act \nto reauthorize special education--even though I am disappointed that \nthe Senate didn't pass the Harkin-Hagel full-funding amendment. This is \na down payment. There are some good policy changes in this bill, and I \nthink we should move the reauthorization process forward. But I will \ncontinue to fight for full funding of special education. It is the \nsingle most important thing we can do for children.\n  I am going to vote for this bill because it takes some big steps \nforward, and it is a good compromise. As a member of the HELP \nCommittee, I am proud to say that we reached bipartisan agreements on \nsome very complicated policy issues. It simplifies complicated rules \nand procedures and makes it easier for schools and parents to \nnavigate--not litigate. And it allows schools to help students who need \nspecial attention, but not necessarily special education. I have talked \nto Marylanders about this. The women of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority see \ntheir children being racially sidelined--pushed into special education, \nwhen what they really need is special attention. I am so pleased that \nwe are doing something in this bill to stop racial sidelining.\n  Yet, I have some concerns about the bill. My biggest concern is that \nthis bill doesn't fully fund special education. I have heard from \nteachers, principals, and school superintendents who want to know where \nthe resources will come from. This year, the Bush budget provides a $1 \nbillion increase for\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\nspecial ed. That may sound like a lot, but at that pace, we will never \nreach full funding. The Federal Government is supposed to pay 40 \npercent of the cost of special education. Yet, it has never paid more \nthan 19 percent. In Maryland, the Federal Government only pays an \naverage of 11 percent. That means local districts must make up the \ndifference by skimping on special ed, by cutting from other education \nprograms, or by raising taxes.\n  I don't want to force States and local school districts to forage for \nfunds, cut back on teacher training, or delay school repairs because \nthe Federal Government has failed to live up to its commitment to \nspecial education. Full funding would free up money in local budgets \nfor hiring more teachers, buying new textbooks and technology, and \nrepairing old school buildings. It would give teachers the training and \nsupport they need. It would help students with disabilities and their \nfamilies by providing enough funding for special education programs so \nparents can have one less thing to worry about, and students get the \nopportunities they deserve.\n  Everywhere I go in Maryland, I hear about special education. I hear \nabout it in urban, rural, and suburban communities; from Democrats and \nRepublicans; and from parents and teachers. They tell me that the \nFederal Government is not living up to its promise, that special \neducation costs about 18% of the average school budget, that schools \nare suffering, and that parents are worried.\n  Parents of children with special needs are under a lot of stress. \nThey are worried about their jobs. They are terrified of losing their \nhealthcare when costs keep ballooning. Many are holding down more than \none job just to make ends meet. Or they are trying to find daycare for \ntheir kids, and elder care for their own parents. They are racing from \ncarpools to work and back again. The Federal Government shouldn't add \nto their worries by not living up to its obligations. With the Federal \nGovernment not paying its share of special ed, these parents have real \nquestions in their minds: Will my child have a good teacher? Will the \nclasses have up-to-date textbooks? Will they be learning what they need \nto know?\n  Parents of disabled children face such a tough burden already. Caring \nfor a child with special needs can be exhausting. School should not be \none of the many things they worry about--particularly when the laws are \nalready on the books to guarantee their child a public school \neducation. The bottom line is the Federal Government is shortchanging \nthese parents by not paying its share of special ed costs.\n  I have heard from parents. They have other concerns, too, besides the \nmoney. They are concerned that this bill rolls back the guarantee of a \nquality education, by getting rid of short-term goals on education \nplans and scaling back safeguards. I agree that we need to simplify \nthis law to make it easier for schools and parents to navigate. I am \nglad that this bill makes some crucial improvements. Yet, I want to do \nwhat is best for families and schools. Ninety percent of school \ndistricts are out of compliance with the Federal law. I know schools \nand teachers want to do what is best for students with special needs--\nand if they had the resources, they would. But we need to protect the \nrights of families to fight for what is best for their children--for \nthe times when the school falls short. Instead of rolling back \nprotections for students, we should provide the resources so that \nschools can give students the services they need to succeed with their \nclassmates in public schools.\n  Special education has made such a huge difference in the lives of \nstudents with disabilities. I will vote for this bill because it is so \nimportant to reauthorize special education. But I will keep fighting \nfor full funding because I don't want special education to be a hollow \npromise.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues on \nthe passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement \nAct, to reauthorize programs under the Individuals with Disability \nEducation Act--IDEA.\n  In 1975, Congress enacted legislation to help States meet their \nobligation to provide education to all American children including \nthose with disabilities. Children, regardless of their disability, \ndeserve and ought to receive a quality education. IDEA assists States \nin meeting this goal by providing important federal funds.\n  In 2002, approximately 6.5 million children with disabilities \nbenefitted from IDEA. Nevertheless, much work remains for Congress to \nfulfill its promise of fully funding 40 percent of the estimated \nimplementation costs. With passage of this important legislation, we \nhave advanced yet another step toward meeting the needs of America's \nchildren with disabilities.\n  As I travel across Oregon and talk to school administrators about the \nchallenges they face, they routinely tell me about the financial burden \nof IDEA. They also tell me of their firm belief in the spirit of this \nlegislation and want to provide the best education possible for their \nspecial needs students. This requires adequate Federal funding.\n  For many years, Congress did not fulfill its promise, with \nsignificant consequences to schools and students across the country. \nIDEA spending was one of the few appropriations that did not grow \nduring the 1980s. In fact, in some cases, the Federal government \nactually covered less of the States' average per pupil expenditure than \nthe previous year.\n  What many may not realize is that when we provide funding for \nstudents with special needs, we benefit all students. Across the \nNation, and particularly in Oregon, States are struggling to provide \nfunding for our schools. When schools are forced to make up the Federal \nportion of IDEA funds, they are forced to take funding from other \nimportant education programs. When we fulfill our cost sharing \ncommitment to IDEA programs, there are more dollars available for \nteacher training, new books, and computers for all students. In effect, \nschools are forced to choose some students over others, and it is a \nchoice they should not have to make.\n  I am proud to report that IDEA funding is back on track--and has \nincreased by almost 225 percent since 1996. If the President's budget \nis approved this year, funding for IDEA will have increased by almost \n400 percent. This clearly demonstrates both Congress' and the \nPresident's continued commitment toward full funding.\n  For children with disabilities, IDEA has opened the door to greater \neducational opportunities. It has served as the cornerstone for greater \nparticipation in our society for people with disabilities. The only way \nto ensure that our promise to provide every opportunity for students \nwith disabilities, and help them achieve their full potential, is to \ngive our schools the dollars they need. I look forward to President \nBush signing this legislation into law.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of final passage \nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, IDEA. I \nwould like to thank the leadership for their hard work on this issue \nand for making it a priority. This legislation is critical for children \nwith disabilities.\n  We have a special responsibility to vulnerable populations such as \ndisabled children. We must ensure that all children, including those \nwith special needs, are given the best education possible. By \nreauthorizing this law today, educational opportunities and outcomes \nfor children with disabilities have been strengthened greatly. We have \nestablished high expectations for real educational results for disabled \nchildren.\n  The purpose of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is to \nensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a \nfree appropriate public education that includes special education and \nrelated services to meet their unique needs. More than two decades ago, \nwhen I was just in my first term as a Senator, we said to our schools, \n``When it comes to disabled children, exclusion from public education \nis unacceptable.'' But the Federal Government has never paid its proper \nshare of the cost of the special education mandate it imposed on States \nand schools.\n  With the reauthorization of IDEA today, the Senate has reaffirmed its \nfunding commitment to children with disabilities. But more than just \nincreasing the funding for this program, the Senate has ensured better \nresults\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nfor students with special needs, reduced the paperwork burden for \nteachers and school officials, and maximized parental involvement and \nchoice.\n  Prior to the passage of IDEA in 1975, many students with disabilities \nwere provided an inadequate education or none at all. Our society has \nmade great advancements in the way that we deal with the disabled. We \nhave finally realized that disabled children need better results, and \nthat parents need better information and options.\n  The IDEA reauthorization signals another important step for education \nreform in the United States. This law will undoubtedly improve academic \nresults for children with disabilities, and it is for this reason that \nI am supporting this legislation. I would also ask that the leadership \non both sides continue to work together to get this bill to the \nPresident. Unnecessary delay could disrupt the delivery of important \nlegislative gains for children with special needs and the school \ndistricts that provide their educational opportunities.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just want to take a few minutes to \nexpress my deep disappointment that the Senate has once again failed to \nkeep our promises to adequately fund our schools. The Senate's \ninability to pass the Harkin-Hagel amendment yesterday is an outrage. \nThe amendment would have put us on a 6-year track to finally fulfill \nthe Federal Government's promise to fully fund the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act--a promise made to our schoolchildren and our local \ndistricts 30 years ago.\n  The key with the Harkin-Hagel amendment--which I was very proud to \ncosponsor--was that it made the funding mandatory. It would have \nfinally mandated that within 6 years, the Government fulfill its \npromise to cover 40 percent of the costs of educating special needs \nchildren in this country. Nationally, at current spending levels, the \nFederal Government only covers about 19 percent of the costs--and in \nNew York, the figures are much lower than that. Some districts in New \nYork spend nearly one-fifth of their overall school budgets providing \nquality special education programs. Yet for many districts, Federal \nfunding only covers 8 or 9 percent of these costs.\n  I have talked to school superintendents all over the State about the \nbudget crunches they are in--crunches that are exacerbated by the \neconomy, tight State budgets, and year after year of being shortchanged \nby the Federal Government. Last month, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity \nin New York reported that New York State will need $9.5 billion more \nfor education funding over the next 4 years, but it has not yet been \nrevealed where that money will come from. Schools across the State are \nstruggling to balance their budgets--and are often forced to raise \nlocal property taxes to fund the Federal mandates we place on them.\n  The administration's proposal would increase IDEA funding by only $1 \nbillion this year. At that rate of increase, we won't reach full \nfunding until 2028--50 years after we promised it to our districts. \nUnder the administration's budget, New York State will receive \napproximately $729 million in fiscal year 2005 funding. If we were at \nfull funding, New York would be getting $1.49 billion next year. Under \nthe Harkin-Hagel amendment, New York could expect $807 million in \nfiscal year 2005, and steady, solid increases in the subsequent 5 years \nto get the State to the full amount.\n  My office did an analysis, using data from the Congressional Research \nService, the National Education Association, and the Department of \nEducation, comparing the administration's fiscal year 2005 funding \nproposal to what various regions of the State would be receiving in \n2005 under full funding. The shortfalls were shocking:\n  New York City will be shortchanged $303 million under the \nadministration's budget. Under full funding, they could expect $565 \nmillion, but they are only going to get $262 million.\n  Schools in Western New York, which includes Buffalo, will be \nshortchanged $58 million. They should be getting $108 million, but will \nonly see $50 million.\n  In Central New York, the region which includes Syracuse and the \nsurrounding counties, schools will be shortchanged $43 million. They \nwill get $37 million instead of $80 million.\n  In the Lower Hudson Valley, just north of the city, schools will get \n$45 million instead of $96 million.\n  Schools in the Rochester/Finger Lakes region will get $43 million \ninstead of $93 million.\n  Schools in the Southern Tier of the State will be shortchanged $13 \nmillion. They will see $11 million instead of the $24 million they were \npromised by Congress in 1975.\n  The Senate had a real opportunity yesterday to make a difference in \nthe lives of the families we are here to protect and represent. But I \nam ashamed that only 56 of us stepped up to the plate. For all the \nrhetoric we have heard over the last several years about the importance \nof making a true commitment to our kids, it is nothing more than \nschoolyard banter if we don't fund our promises.\n  We can make no better investment than providing a high-quality \neducation for all of our kids--ensuring they have access to the best \nteachers, cutting-edge curricula and books, and access to the special \nservices they need to learn, advance and become productive members of \nsociety.\n  Yesterday we had a chance to make it right. Our schools simply asked \nfor the funding they were promised to provide kids with the services \nthey need, and 41 Members of this body said no. We will be back. We \nwill keep coming back, and we will keep fighting the fight until our \nkids and our schools get what they were promised and what they deserve.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I believe that this legislation is the \nnext step toward ensuring that all children with disabilities receive \nthe education and services they deserve. I am pleased to lend my \nsupport to the passage of S. 1248, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Improvement Act of 2003. This legislation has been carefully \ncrafted to balance the concerns and wishes of students, parents, \nteachers, principals, and superintendents.\n  As a new member to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, it has been a pleasure to be involved in this \nreauthorization from the very beginning. I have worked hard to ensure \nthat the needs of the children, parents, teachers, and administrators \nin my home State of Nevada have been met. I have heard from Nevadans \nthe problems they face when dealing with the complexities of IDEA and \nbelieve this bill addresses many, if not all, of their concerns.\n  During one of my rural tours, I had the opportunity to stop in \nMinden, NV, which is located in the Douglas County School District. As \npart of my time there, I went to a school to meet with parents, \nteachers, students, and the superintendent of the school district. \nWhile many topics and issues were discussed during that time, the one \nthat has stuck out the most in my mind is IDEA. The superintendent told \nme stories and gave examples of the difficult time he and his staff \nhave had in dealing with the complexities of IDEA, especially the \nregulations related to discipline. It finally got so bad the Nevada \nState Department of Education had to put out a handbook to describe the \nregulations.\n  Just recently, the superintendent for Washoe County School District \nwas in town, and he shared with me many issues of importance for his \nschools, including funding for IDEA. He told me that while additional \nfunding for No Child Left Behind programs would be nice, funding for \nIDEA was much more important to the financial well-being of his \ndistrict. We talked about the recent press regarding charges that No \nChild Left Behind is an unfunded mandate, but he replied that there is \nno greater unfunded mandate and burden on the financial state of \ndistricts than IDEA.\n  It is with these experiences in mind that I come to the floor today \nto discuss S. 1248, the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nImprovement Act of 2003. I am particularly pleased to see that this \nlegislation focuses on the goal of improving the academic achievement \nand long-term goals of these students rather than burdensome \nadministrative checklists. In 1954, the United States Congress made it \nclear that ``all children'' included racial minorities, and in 1975 we \nexpanded this to include children with disabilities by ensuring that \nall children receive a free and appropriate public education. This \nlegislation complements the work done with the No Child Left Behind \nAct, and helps ensure that no child is left behind.\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the focus of IDEA has moved away from providing \nstudents with disabilities a quality education and towards ensuring \nthat teachers, schools, and districts are simply in compliance with the \nlaw. The current accountability provisions in IDEA focus more on \ncompliance in terms of paperwork and lawsuits, rather than on student \nperformance and outcomes. I believe that S. 1248 changes the direction \nthat IDEA is moving by simplifying the paperwork requirements, giving \nStates greater flexibility, and making the process of disciplining \nstudents with individualized education plans, commonly known as IEPs, \neasier.\n  Changes contained in S. 1248 will simplify the IEP process for \nparents and teachers, while maintaining the flexibility both parties \nneed to include additional information, outcomes, and goals for \nindividual students. The IEP process had become a burdensome and time-\nconsuming endeavor for all parties that often produced little for the \nchild involved. Rather than focusing on short-term objectives for every \nchild, the Senate bill requires that IEPs contain only long-term goals \nand objectives that are focused on the child's academic achievement and \nfunctional performance goals for the school year. This change \nrecognizes that not all children will make great strides on the \nacademic side of the equation, but may excel in their functional \nachievements. I know that some parents in Nevada have expressed concern \nover this change, but I believe this will be more beneficial to \nindividual children by eliminating a one-size-fits-all approach for \nIEPs.\n  Another area of great concern to parents, teachers, and \nadministrators has been the discipline provisions contained in IDEA. \nThe Senate version simplifies the framework for schools to administer \nIDEA but also ensures the rights and the safety of all children. In \nNevada I have heard from numerous school principals, superintendents, \nand teachers about the difficulties they have when it comes to \ndisciplining a disabled student. They have complained not only about \nthe dual-discipline system created by IDEA but also about the \nincredibly complex rules and regulations they must follow if a disabled \nstudent does violate school rules. The Senate language will allow \nschools to suspend a child with a disability who violates a code of \nconduct and withhold services during the suspension. Schools would be \nallowed to discipline a child with a disability in the same manner as a \nchild without a disability for school code violations so long as the \nviolation was not related to the child's disability. An agreement has \nalso been reached with regards to offenses related to weapons and drugs \nfor children with disabilities. While this language is a great \nimprovement on current law, I still have concerns about the complexity \nof these provisions and the continued burden faced by teachers and \nprincipals in completing paperwork and fighting lawsuits related to \ndiscipline.\n  That said, this legislation also makes great strides in other areas, \nsuch as providing special education teachers the initial training they \nneed and the ongoing educational support and assistance required in the \nclassroom every day. Parents will no longer be faced with reams of \npaper every time they go to a meeting with their child's teacher. \nChildren will be taught by highly qualified teachers and receive the \nservices they need to succeed in school. Students will also be provided \nwith important transition services as they leave high school and enter \neither the workforce or postsecondary education opportunities.\n\n  I have heard from many parents in Nevada who believe their child's \nteachers and principals are overburdened with paperwork related to \ntheir child's education. They also have felt bombarded with notices \nexplaining to them their right to sue school districts if they do not \nbelieve their son or daughter has received the services necessary for \nhe or she to succeed. This legislation, I believe, strikes that \ndelicate balance between parents who believe they are getting too much \ninformation and those who believe they are not getting enough. I am \nalways careful not to have too great an impact on the important \nrelationship between a parent and a teacher from Washington, DC.\n  The issue of Federal funding for IDEA has been an issue of huge \nconcern not only to my constituents, but to every school district in \nthe country. Every school district in Nevada has contacted me with a \nvery legitimate concern in that the Federal Government has never lived \nup to the promise it made in 1975 to provide 40 percent of the excess \ncost to educate a child with a disability. Currently, the Government is \nproviding funding that pays for about 20 percent of the excess cost to \neducate children with disabilities. I completely agree that the Federal \nGovernment must live up to its promise to provide this crucial funding \nto our schools. IDEA is truly an unfunded mandate. However, I believe \nwe must continue to fund these programs on the discretionary side of \nthe budget and not move funding to the mandatory side of the budget. \nMoving funding to the mandatory side of the budget places it in the \nsame category as Medicare and Social Security and above other education \nprograms. I do not believe it is right to make IDEA an entitlement and \nelevate it above other, equally important, Federal education programs.\n  Not only would IDEA funding be placed in a higher category than other \neducation programs, but moving funding to the mandatory side of the \nbudget has the potential to increase the deficit. We cannot afford to \ncontinue deficit spending and place the burden of our unrestricted \nspending on the backs of our children. I believe we must work to make \nIDEA funding a true priority both during the budget process and the \nappropriations process. We should work to increase funding at large \nlevels every year to reach the 40-percent marker.\n  In addition, funding for IDEA has substantially increased over the \npast 4 years. In fact, assuming the President's $1 billion increase for \nthis year is approved, funding has increased by $4.7 billion, or 75 \npercent, since 2001. Since 1996, when Republican's took over control of \nCongress, funding for IDEA has increased by 224 percent, yes, 224 \npercent. If the President's $1 billion increase is approved for this \nyear, funding will have increased by 376 percent in less than 10 years. \nNevada has seen funding nearly double in the past 4 years. Since 2001, \nfunding has increased by 84 percent, one of the largest increases in \nthe country. While I recognize we are only at half of our promised \nlevel of funding, it is clear that Congress is making great strides to \nliving up to its promise.\n  I hope we can continue the great progress we have made on this \nimportant legislation and appoint conferees to work out our differences \nwith the House-passed legislation. This issue is too important to fall \nvictim to partisan politics. We cannot allow children with disabilities \nto be held hostage because of the partisan atmosphere of the Senate.\n  Finally, I thank both Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for their \nhard work on this legislation and dedication to this important issue. I \nlook forward to working with both of them on future reauthorizations in \nthe HELP Committee this year.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, for their work on a very important piece \nof legislation that is so vital to many parents, teachers, school \nadministrators, and most importantly, children in the State of Arkansas \nand across this country. It is especially important that on issues such \nas this we have bipartisan cooperation, and I thank my colleagues for \nensuring that cooperation and the quick action we have seen on the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act yesterday and today.\n  I have heard from many of my constituents about IDEA, and they have \nexpressed a wide range of concerns about various aspects of the \nlegislation, from discipline, to due process, to funding, to \nindividualized education programs. And we all know that no one got \neverything they wanted from this reauthorization. But that is the \nnature of compromise. That is the nature of legislating in this body. \nIt is my hope that we can find more opportunities to work in the \nbipartisan manner that Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg demonstrated \nin managing this bill.\n  Just to remind my colleagues, though I know they do not need \nreminding, because so many of them hear\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\nthe same concerns I do from their home States, we cannot overstate how \nimportant IDEA is to so many and how it touches the lives of our \nchildren every day. I would like to relate the comments of one of my \nconstituents, Tracey Smith, of Springdale, AR.\n  Ms. Smith's son, Kyle, is an 8-year-old who has been the beneficiary \nof IDEA since 2000. Kyle's family moved from Texas to Arkansas during \nthe middle of a school year, and Ms. Smith called me to talk about how \nIDEA has helped Kyle and to talk about some of her concerns with the \npending reauthorization. She stressed how important yearly IEPs were \nfor her son and how short-term goals were so vital to her son's long-\nterm achievement. It is important that IEPs continue to be revisited on \na yearly basis, and I am encouraged that we have managed to ensure this \nimportant aspect of special education will remain in the Senate \nlegislation.\n  Furthermore, Ms. Smith was nervous that people in Washington, who do \nnot experience on a day-to-day basis the trials parents and children \nhave to face, would not understand how changes we make affect their \ndaily lives. IDEA has provided much-needed flexibility for parents, and \nthis legislation continues in that manner. As Ms. Smith told me:\n\n       As a parent I appreciate and value the freedom that IDEA \n     gives parents and educators to address an individual child's \n     needs.\n\n  And that is what this is about, individual children and individual \nparents. It is about addressing their educational needs and concerns, \naddressing their daily struggles in the hopes that we can make their \nlives a little more normal, even if it is only for 1 day. I admire \nparents like Tracey Smith, and I commend her for having the courage to \nremind us of the effect we have on persons we may not always know.\n  I know there will be many issues related to civil rights, discipline, \ndue process, and highly qualified teachers to address in the conference \nwith the House of Representatives. I hope they are resolved in the same \nbipartisan manner in which this bill was crafted in the Senate and with \nparents and children in mind. We have worked hard to ensure civil \nrights protections for children and parents, and I hope they are not \ndiminished. We have worked hard to craft discipline provisions that \nprotect all of our children while understanding disabled children have \nspecial needs, and I hope we can continue to ensure the safety of our \nschools. We have worked hard to include protections for due process, \nand I hope any differences are resolved to ensure parents know and \nunderstand their rights under the law without giving unfair advantage \nto any one party. We have worked hard to make sure our children have \nproper instruction, and I hope we continue to ensure proper instruction \nwithout discouraging individuals from entering the field of special \neducation. Most of all, I hope we have a finished product that all \nparents, educators, and, most importantly, children can benefit from.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, and I am pleased with the progress we have \nmade in the past couple of days in regards to funding, ensuring \nservices to our military families and homeless and foster children, and \nreducing burdensome paperwork for our teachers. I am, however, \ndisappointed that we failed to make full funding mandatory. Senators \nHarkin and Hagel have worked very hard to ensure the Federal Government \nlives up to the promises we made to our disabled children, parents, and \nschools almost 30 years ago. I was very pleased to join in that worthy \ncause, and I will continue to work with my friends on both sides of the \naisle until we meet our commitments. As we in this body are all aware, \nfunding is not always the answer, and it is never the only answer. But \nmany times we see that inadequately funding the mandates we force on \nStates and local districts are such a large piece of the puzzle. We \ncannot honestly say we are doing all we can to advance education for \ndisabled children unless we meet those funding commitments. It doesn't \ndo us any good to educate some and leave others behind. Instead of \nproviding opportunity for many of our children, we are closing doors to \nthem. Instead of educating and instructing future productive citizens, \nwe are, in some cases, neglecting those who will become dependent on \nGovernment and those who will live a life of despair.\n  I believe fully funding IDEA is not just a commitment we have made, \nbut also an investment in our children. By appropriating the necessary \nfunds to fully fund IDEA, we can provide our teachers the tools and \nresources they need to do what they do best--educate all of our \nchildren to the extent that they not only participate in but contribute \nto society. It is an investment we should and we can afford to make. \nSeveral of my colleagues made the point that by making full funding \nmandatory, Congress would somehow lose the ability to revisit and \nchange the adjustments we have made in this legislation. I disagree. I \nwould ask my colleagues, when has Congress failed to address \nproblematic aspects of any piece of legislation when it was so \nwarranted? When has the Congress given up oversight of any area of \nresponsibility? I would venture to guess that mandatory funding of IDEA \nwould not prevent this body from revisiting IDEA if and when it becomes \nnecessary.\n  We have made progress toward living up to our commitments in recent \nyears. We should be proud of that progress. In fact, when IDEA was \nbrought into existence in 1975, Congress funded less than 7 percent of \nthe excess costs to schools for special education. In 2004, we funded \nclose to 19 percent of excess costs. We have made progress, no one \ndenies that, but as the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, so eloquently \npointed out: We should not be concerned with what we have done. We \nshould be concerned with what we will do now to reach our commitments. \nI commend this body for realizing we need to do more for special \neducation. But if we continue to make piecemeal increases in IDEA, we \nwill never reach full funding under current law. I hope in the coming \nmonths and years we can make progress toward fulfilling the 40 percent \ncommitment. We can do better. We can do more. And I commend and thank \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their leadership and \ncommitment to this issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1975, Congress made the historic \ndecision to require all public schools to accept and educate children \nwith disabilities in the least restrictive environment. That law still \nserves as the basis for the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct.\n  As part of the original law, Congress acknowledged that the Federal \nGovernment would need to contribute 40 percent of the extra costs of \neducating students with disabilities. Sadly, we do not seem to have a \nvery good track record. Today--30 years after that critically important \nlegislation was enacted--the Federal Government pays less than 20 \npercent of the additional cost.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senators Hagel and Harkin, for offering the \namendment to move the Federal share to 40 percent over 6 years. This \namendment is an appropriate and overdue response to our schools who are \nliving up to their end of the bargain, and I was pleased to support it. \nUnfortunately, the amendment failed by a slim margin.\n  National organizations--ranging from teachers' groups to the \ndisability rights movement to education advocacy groups--have urged \nthis body to support the Hagel-Harkin amendment. There is broad and \ndeep recognition that mandatory full funding is the right thing to do \nand that this is the right time to do it. Our schools need this \nfunding.\n  I got a letter this week from the Superintendent of the Orion \nCommunity Unit Schools asking me to support IDEA. He says, ``Please \nunderstand that reauthorization is imperative for the financial \nstability of the public schools in Illinois.'' The Orion school \ndistrict is in the top 5 percent of Illinois schools academically. It \nhas cut its budget each of the last 2 years by 3.4 percent. And yet \nOrion has been placed on the financial early warning list.\n  Two years ago, this Congress enacted the No Child Left Behind Act. \nThe purpose of that law is to close the achievement gap. For too many \nof our children, especially those who have disabilities, we had become \ncomplacent about lowered expectations. I voted for that law because I \nbelieve every child, including those with disabilities, can succeed.\n  But lower teacher ratios, qualified teachers, specialists, tutoring, \nearly\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nintervention--all of these proven means to improved academic \nachievement require resources. It is hard for me to understand how we \ncan say that we as a nation expect 100 percent proficiency in basic \nacademic skills, but we can not afford to fully fund No Child Left \nBehind. We expect all but the most severely cognitively disabled \nstudents to meet Adequate Yearly Progress, but we cannot afford to \nfully fund IDEA. We expect our schools and teachers to work effectively \nwith children who face every adversity, but we can't afford to provide \nfederal education funding at promised levels. Meanwhile we find somehow \nthat we can afford to hand out tax breaks to the wealthiest and most \nadvantaged among us.\n  Congress meant what it said in 1975 with the enactment of IDEA. \nChildren with disabilities have the right to a free and appropriate \neducation. And we meant what we said in 2001. Every child is expected \nto learn. Both laws affirm that access to a quality education is a \ncivil right in this country.\n  I am disappointed that we were not able to pass the Hagel-Harkin \namendment. But I strongly support the underlying bill. This \nreauthorization will do much for students with disabilities, their \nfamilies, and the schools they learn in. But it is up to the Congress \nof 2004 to fulfill the promise of the Congress of 1974. It is time for \nthis body to put its money where its mouth is.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1248, \nand would like to thank Chairman Gregg and Senator Kennedy for working \nin such a cooperative and bipartisan way on this important legislation.\n  I strongly believe in every child's right to a free, appropriate \npublic education, and I appreciate the leadership you both have shown \nin working to ensure that this reauthorization bill protects that \nright. I believe the bill before us today is better than the House bill \ndue largely to your commitment.\n  This bill ensures that children with special needs receive a free, \nappropriate public education while supporting teachers and other school \nstaff, strengthening monitoring and enforcement, involving parents more \nthoroughly in the education of their children, resolving disputes \nequitably, and improving the transition between school and beyond.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill includes several provisions \nthat I supported. The first I sponsored with Senator Sessions, and it \nis embodied in S. 1321. This provision will channel $25 million \ndirectly to local school districts to help children with emotional and \nbehavioral disabilities. This program will support investments in \npositive behavioral supports, whole school interventions, and improve \nthe quality of interim alternative educational settings. These funds \nwill help schools invest in professional development, provide for early \ninterventions, and fund whole-school interventions that train school \nadministrators, support staff, and parents to help students with \ndisabilities succeed.\n  This bill also includes provisions of the Personnel Excellence for \nChildren with Disabilities Act, which I was proud to cosponsor. This \nact creates two new grant programs to support personnel preparation--\none to help schools recruit and retain new special education teachers, \nand another to better prepare general education teachers to work with \nchildren with special needs.\n  New York faces a major shortage of qualified special education \nteachers, and I believe it is critical to dedicate resources to \nrecruiting, retaining, and providing ongoing professional development \nfor all teachers--general education and special education. These funds \nwill go a long way to achieving this goal.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment that I \noffered yesterday to include the Department of Education as a key \npartner in the planning and execution of the National Children's Study. \nThis study will be the most comprehensive examination of children's \nhealth ever conducted in this country. It is critical that schools, \nwhere children spend more time than anywhere other than their homes, be \nincluded in this analysis. By including the Department of Education we \nwill gain valuable insight into the role that environmental factors \nplay in contributing to developmental disabilities.\n  While I am so pleased with all of the provisions I have mentioned, I \nam deeply disappointed that Senator Harkin's amendment to provide \nmandatory full funding for IDEA failed yesterday. This amendment has \nstrong bi-partisan support, thanks to the leadership of Senator Hagel \non the Republican side, and it represents the only true mechanism to \nensure that Congress keeps the promise it made in 1975. Back then, \nCongress vowed to provide 40 percent of the cost of educating children \nwith special needs. To date, we have never even come close. By relying \non discretionary funding we are virtually guaranteeing that we will \nnever achieve the 40 percent threshold. And it is our children and \nlocal taxpayers who pay the price. So I will continue to work with \nSenator Harkin, Senator Hagel, Senator Kennedy and my other colleagues \nto ensure that one day we achieve the victory we were not able to \nyesterday.\n  In one of my first experiences out of school, I was tasked by the \nChildren's Defense Fund with reconciling census data with school \nenrollment. This project developed out of a realization that many \nchildren who were living in a given community were not enrolled in \nschool. As I went door to door and talked to the families, I quickly \nrealized that the children left out were the ones with special needs.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 fixed that \nproblem. It promised every child--regardless of their needs--a free, \nappropriate public education. Today, we are strengthening that law and, \nmore importantly, that promise.\n  As a Senator from New York, I continue to hear stories about how \ncritical IDEA is for children with disabilities. One parent recently \ncame to my office to visit with his son who suffered brain trauma and \nnow has cerebral palsy and other developmental disabilities. Kevin \nattends elementary school in the Port Washington School District in \nLong Island. Because of his special needs, he receives daily one-on-one \ninstruction from a licensed teacher's assistant, 10 hours of speech \ntherapy and three sessions of occupational therapy each week. This \ninvestment would have been unheard of 30 years ago. But today, Kevin is \nable to keep up with his courses in a mainstream 5th grade classroom \nsetting. His success is possible because of IDEA and Kevin is on course \nto successfully pass the 5th grade and graduate into 6th.\n  Kevin's story should remind us all why this bill is so important. \nSimply put, it ensures that both teachers and parents have the tools \nthey need to help children with disabilities succeed. So I urge all of \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting S. 1248. And as this bill moves \nforward I hope my colleagues will continue to maintain the best \ninterest of our children and uphold the spirit and intent of the \noriginal law.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, by reauthorizing IDEA, the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, today, the Senate reaffirms America's \ncommitment to ensure that every child is given the opportunity to \ndevelop his other God-given talents and abilities to their fullest \npotential.\n  I commend our colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy, for \ntheir diligence and bipartisan leadership. This bill demonstrates that \nthe Senate can indeed do good and important work when both sides are \nwilling to listen to each other and make principled compromises.\n  IDEA is more than simply an education program; it is one of our \nNation's most important civil rights programs. Because of this law, \nAmerica now provides real educational opportunities for children who, \nin an earlier time, might never even have attended a school.\n  It is not only the children who benefit; all Americans benefit when \nwe develop the potential of every American.\n  This bill strengthens America's commitment to ensure that every \nstudent has access to a free and appropriate education. It holds \naccountable for helping each child achieve his or her potential at the \nsame time it reduces the paperwork burden on schools and increases \nlocal flexibility.\n  This bill makes it easier for parents to participate in their \nchildren's education and improves the process for resolving disputes.\n  It provides resources to make sure that special education teachers \nand\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nother personnel are well trained and well supported.\n  It strengthens early intervention and preschool services, to make \nsure that children with disabilities get the best possible start in \nschool. It also creates a stronger bridge between high school and post-\nsecondary education or employment, to help young people with \ndisabilities become full contributing members of American society.\n  WE know that schools often face challenges in meeting IDEA's \nrequirements. We also know that man parents of children with \ndisabilities consider the law complicated, and they sometimes don't \nknow where to turn for help. It is my hope that improvements in this \nbill will make the law easier to understand and follow for everyone \ninvolved--parents, teachers and school administrators. I also hope that \nDemocrats and Republicans will continue to work together to make \nadditional improvements and changes in the future.\n  But even the best laws cannot work if they are not funded. I am \ngreatly disappointed that our Republican colleagues have refused to \nadequately fund this law.\n  It has been 29 years since the Federal Government promised to provide \n40 percent of the cost of special education in America, yet we still \nprovide only 19 percent of those costs. But schools have to provide the \nservices--even if Congress doesn't provide the funds. This places \ntremendous pressure on local school districts to shortchange other \neducation programs, and can create unnecessary tensions between \nfamilies of children with special needs, and other families.\n\n  The bipartisan Harkin-Hagel amendment would have guaranteed full \nfunding for IDEA. When we first considered that idea, the Republican \nleadership told us, ``That's a great idea--but first we have to reform \nthe program.'' So we worked with our colleagues to make those reforms. \nYet most of our Republican colleagues still refused to support full \nfunding.\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans' idea of meeting us halfway seems to \nbe to create a program but not fund it--to pass an authorization bill \nbut then refuse to pay for it. They would rather spend the money on \nmore tax breaks for millionaires. I think that is a shame. I urge the \nPresident and our Republican colleagues to reconsider their priorities \nand work with us in good faith to honor the Federal Government's \npromise to provide 40 percent of all special education funding. As I \nhave said before, real reforms require real resources.\n  I have spoken with many teachers and parents in South Dakota who tell \nme that, in an ideal world, every child would have an individual \neducation plan. Every child has strengths and abilities, just as every \nchild faces challenges. And every child benefits when the adults in his \nor her life work together to develop those strengths and abilities, and \nhelp them deal with their challenges. This bill provides a blueprint to \nmake sure that young people in greatest need of such individualized \nattention and instruction get those opportunities. It is a bipartisan \nvictory for those children, their families, and all Americans.\n  There are significant differences between the House and Senate bills \nthat will need to be resolved if Congress is to complete action on this \nlegislation. Senator Kennedy has informed me that he hopes to work out \na preconference agreement on several key issues. I will support him in \nthis effort and look forward to working with the majority leader to \nmake progress on this important legislative issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Today, the Senate moves a large step closer to guaranteeing that \nchildren with disabilities can obtain the education they need in order \nto reach their full potential. Today is a victory for disabled \nchildren, a victory for the parents of these children, and a victory \nfor our country. Today we renew our commitment to the education of \nevery child in the nation.\n  We know that disabled does not mean unable. Children with \ndisabilities have the same dreams as every other child in America--to \ngrow up and lead a happy and productive life. We know that IDEA helps \nthem fulfill that dream.\n  IDEA says children cannot be cast aside or locked away just because \nthey have a disability. Those days are gone in America--hopefully \nforever.\n  Children with disabilities have rights like every other child in \nAmerica, including the right to join other children in public schools \nso they can learn and prepare themselves for the future.\n  This law is about disabled children and their rights. It is about \ntheir hope and dream of living independent and productive lives. It is \nabout parents who love their children and fight for them every day \nagainst a world that's too often inflexible and unwilling to help them \nmeet their children's needs. It is about teachers who see the potential \nin a disabled child, but don't have the support or training they need \nto keep it alive.\n  That is what this law is about. It is our statement as a nation that \nthese children matter and that we will do our part to help their \nparents and teachers and communities meet their education goals. That \nis why the government should make an iron-clad commitment to provide \nthe resources for special education. That is why it is important to \ndevelop a solid education plan for each child, to chart the progress, \nand to hold schools accountable when they fall short. It sounds like No \nChild Left Behind, and it is--``No Child'' means ``No Disabled Child \ntoo.''\n  Later this month, we observe the 50th anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt's historic decision in Brown v. the Board of Education, which \nstruck down school segregation by race and said that all children have \nequal access to education under the Constitution. But it was not until \nthe passage of the Education for the Handicapped Act in 1975 that the \nBrown decision had real meaning for children with disabilities.\n  Only then did we finally end school segregation by disability, and \nopen the doors of public schools to disabled children. Only then did \nthe nation's four million disabled children begin to have the same \nopportunities as other children to develop their talents, share their \ngifts, and lead productive lives.\n  We must never go back to the days when disabled children were \nexcluded from public education, when few if any preschool children with \ndisabilities received services, and when the disabled were passed off \nto institutions and substandard schools where they were out of sight \nand out of mind.\n  We've made tremendous progress since those dark days. Today, six and \na half million children with disabilities receive special education \nservices. Almost all of them--96 percent--are learning alongside their \nnon-disabled peers. The number of young children with early development \nproblems who receive childhood services has tripled since 1975.\n  The opportunities for further progress are boundless. We know far \nmore about disability today than a quarter century ago. We understand \nthe various disabilities of children, and how to help them all to learn \nand achieve. We are learning more each day about the enabling power of \ntechnology to help disabled children lead independent lives--it lets \nthem communicate, explore the world on the Internet, move in ways we \ncouldn't have imagined 5 years ago, much less in 1975 when the law was \nfirst enacted.\n  This legislation builds on the enormous progress we have already made \nby recognizing that in several key areas, we must do better.\n  We must do better in bringing the law's promise to all disabled \nstudents in all schools. That means fully enforcing the law in every \nschool district in the country.\n  A GAO analysis of compliance shows that from educational services to \ntransition support, students are not getting what they are entitled to.\n  Even when noncompliance is identified, the Federal response is \nintolerably slow. Some States violated the law for more than a decade \nbefore the Department of Education intervened.\n  This failure has real world consequences for real children struggling \nto get an education. I have with me today almost 2,000 letters from \nparents across the Nation whose disabled children have been denied \ntheir educational rights under IDEA.\n  This legislation will improve enforcement of IDEA at every level. It \nrequires a State-Federal partnership to design a better monitoring \nsystem to hold States more accountable.\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\n  We must also improve services for children nearing graduation, so \nthey can leave school with the skills and continuing support they need \nto succeed. For persons with disabilities, the adult world offers \nlittle help to meet the challenges of daily life.\n  It is vital for these steps to be taken in school, so that all \nchildren with disabilities can be reached before they enter the job \nmarket and the confusing maze of adult services.\n  At best, only a little over half of students leaving special \neducation have jobs or are continuing their education 5 years later. \nOften, they are transferred into the welfare system, with no \nrecognition of their potential.\n  Our bill places a major focus on early planning for that all-\nimportant transition, and better coordination with other Federal \nprograms such as vocational rehabilitation and our Ticket to Work \nprogram, to link students to more options and maximize prospects for \ntheir independence. Welfare can't be the only option for students with \ndisabilities when they graduate from school.\n  Finally, we must do more to help special education teachers--to \nrecruit them, to train them, and to support them in this challenging \nfield. They are the men and women we depend on everyday to stand up and \nsay to our children: You can do it. You can succeed.\n  We also help special education teachers by reducing the unnecessary \npaperwork that distracts teachers from focusing on students. It creates \nbetter ways for parents, teachers, and school administrators to work \ntogether to meet children's needs without resorting to litigation, and \nprovides more flexibility to parents to develop their child's education \nprogram by teleconferencing and video conferencing.\n  The legislation authorizes new funds to improve the quality of \nalternative placements, and to provide better behavioral supports \nthrough whole school interventions.\n  The legislation provides more flexibility for schools to discipline \nstudents, with safeguards so that discipline is not used as an excuse \nto halt educational services, and is not used to exclude or segregate \ndisabled children because of the failure of the school to provide for \nthe educational needs of the child.\n  Our ultimate goal should be to support disabled children, not punish \nthem for what they can't control.\n  I thank the many persons who have brought us successfully to this \nday.\n  First and foremost, I commend the thousands of parents who met with \nMembers and staff, sent letters, made a phone call, and participated in \nother ways in making this legislation possible. They have been citizen \nleaders at their very best, and have opened our eyes to their cause and \nlet us into their lives, and we are proud of all they have \naccomplished.\n  Here in the Senate, I commend Chairman Gregg for his leadership on \nthis legislation over the years, and for all he has done to bring this \nimportant reauthorization before the Senate. All of us are grateful to \nAnnie White on his staff as well, for her dedication to making this \nbipartisan process work--and work, and work, and work.\n  I commend the majority leader for scheduling the consideration of \nthis legislation as soon as it was ready for action by the full Senate. \nBecause of his willingness to act so quickly, we have a realistic \nopportunity to enact this important legislation into law this year. I \nalso commend the distinguished minority leader for making consideration \nof this legislation possible and for his leadership on this and so many \nother issues of importance to the Nation and giving it the priority he \nhas.\n  I also commend Senator Sessions and John Little with his staff for \ntheir bipartisan effort in dealing with the discipline issue, which has \nneedlessly plagued the debate on IDEA for so long.\n  Senator Clinton deserves great credit for her work to ensure that new \nfunds are provided to improve the quality of alternative student \nplacements, to provide more effective behavioral supports for students, \nand to see that all schools are safe schools.\n  Senator Harkin is always at the forefront of the movement for equal \nrights for all persons with disabilities, including children, and he \nhas led the effort for full funding of IDEA.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 4 more minutes.\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Jeffords worked effectively on this \nlegislation to improve early childhood programs. They have been two \npioneers in the development of the legislation since the very \nbeginning, and they have been absolutely tireless in pursuing positive, \nconstructive, responsive changes in these programs. They are both \nleaders on children's programs in the Senate.\n  Senator Reed improved the training and recruitment of special \neducation teachers. Senator Bingaman fought for strong enforcement of \ncivil rights protections for every disabled student. Senator Mikulski \nstrengthened support for students making the transition from schools to \ncareers. Senator Murray improved the provisions on enforcement and the \nmonitoring of the law and for caring for those children who are moving, \nwho are in transition.\n  I commend as well, the many members of our staffs, who have worked \nlong and hard and well for the past 2 years. Our thanks go to Bethany \nLittle, formerly with Senator Murray's staff; Jamie Fasteau, with \nSenator Murray's staff; Carmel Martin, formerly with Senator Bingaman's \nstaff; Michael Yudin, with Senator Bingaman; Catherine Brown, with \nSenator Clinton; Justin King, with Senator Jeffords; Mary Giliberti and \nEric Fatemi, with Senator Harkin; Rebecca Litt, with Senator Mikulski; \nElyse Wasch, with Senator Reed; Maryellen McGuire, with Senator Dodd; \nDenzie McGoire and Bill Lucia, with Senator Gregg; Todd Haiken, with \nSenator Bingaman; and Dennis Borum, with Senator Reid.\n  Our thanks also go out to the hundreds of disability and education \nadvocates across the country who worked so hard on this legislation.\n  I especially thank Jeremy Buzzell, Michael Dannenberg, Charlotte \nBurrows, Jim Manley, Jane Oates, Roberto Rodriguez, Kent Mitchell, \nDanica Petroshius and Michael Myers on my staff for their skillful work \nand dedication, and above all Connie Garner for all she has done for \nchildren with disabilities and their families and for never letting us \nforget what this debate and this law is really about.\n  This bill represents our best bipartisan effort, and I look forward \nto its immediate and imminent passage and strong support from both \nsides of the aisle. As we move forward today to reconcile our \ndifferences with the House of Representatives, I hope we retain that \nsame bipartisan spirit and quickly resolve our differences in this \nCongress and have this signed into law to benefit the children, the \nparents, and our country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his help, assistance, and tireless effort in making \nsure this bill moved forward, and in an extremely constructive way. We \nhave had considerable success in this committee in passing out of the \ncommittee a number of major pieces of legislation that have been \nbipartisan. Even in this time, as we head into a Presidential election, \nwhen there is a bit of tension and some slowdown in legislative \nactivity due to the differences of opinion, which are being highlighted \nboth substantively and politically, we have been able to make progress \nnot only on special education but on other bills, such as the pension \nbill, which we passed and, hopefully fairly soon, on the bioshield \nbill, which is a critical piece of legislation. And that is in the last \ncouple months.\n  The special education bill is one this committee has attended to over \nthe years and has tried to improve. It is a very intense piece of \nlegislation in the sense that the parents and children who are affected \nby it are immediately impacted by everything we do. Clearly, the school \nsystems, which try to respond to the needs of these children, and often \nhave very complicated and difficult issues to resolve, are also \nimmediately impacted.\n  Therefore, I am glad we have been able to reach what is clearly a \nbipartisan and very positive and aggressive bill in moving forward on \nthe issue of giving special needs children adequate education and \nappropriate education, to which they have a right and which, obviously, \nwe all want to accomplish.\n  The bill has received strong support from across the board. It is \nsupported\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nby the Council of Chief State School Officers, the American Association \nof School Administrators, Great City Schools, the National Association \nof State Directors of Special Education, the Council for Exceptional \nChildren, the National Center for Learning Disabilities, the \nAssociation for the Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and \nVisually Impaired.\n  I think it is important to note those different groups that represent \ndifferent constituencies because sometimes there is tension between \nthose groups as to how special needs children should be addressed and \nhow they should be educated.\n\n  As Senator Kennedy has so effectively highlighted, the bill creates a \nnumber of initiatives with which we are trying to address improvement \nof the educational system as it reaches out to these children. The \nfirst area that is the most fundamental area of change is what the \nchildren are learning. Unfortunately, the present law that has evolved \nover time has become an inputs exercise. In fact, there are something \nlike 819 items which must be checked off in every school district for \nevery child relative to the special needs of that child and how they \nare educated. We came to the conclusion that this was not getting to \nthe bottom line.\n  The bottom line is, are these children learning? Is their life \nimproving? Are they being given the tools they need in order to \nparticipate in society? The bill moves significantly from being an \ninputs-tested bill to being an outputs-tested bill, to looking at \nimprovement in academic results as being the primary mode under which \nwe evaluate whether the bill is working relative to the children it is \nsupposed to impact.\n  Secondly, it is the teacher who is the key player in this effort. \nTeachers who undertake teaching special needs children are \nextraordinary people. They are giving of themselves in an immense way. \nI had the chance, when I headed up a center that dealt with children \nwho had severe disabilities, to constantly be amazed at the commitment \nof these individuals who are basically, 24 hours a day--at least in our \ninstitution--trying to assist the children as they work through their \npersonal problems but also work toward learning more. What we have \ntried to do is give teachers some new tools and relieve them of some of \nthe bureaucratic burden. That is especially important.\n  It is estimated that the average special needs teacher may spend as \nmuch as a day and a half each week just doing paperwork. We tried to \nreduce that and give the teachers the professional support they need \nand the assistance to make sure they are qualified to deal with these \nchildren who have very complex and difficult issues.\n  Thirdly, we attempt to facilitate a better relationship between \nparents and the schools. Unfortunately, there is a natural tension. It \nhas developed over time. Sometimes it becomes quite aggravated. It not \nonly goes to the schools, it goes to the parents of other children in \nthe school and the property-tax payers in the community. There is no \nreason a parent of a special needs child should find themselves in a \nconfrontational situation as they try to get what is the appropriate \neducation for their children. We have developed a whole series of \ninitiatives to try to, for better or worse, create dispute resolution \nin a more comfortable manner rather than a confrontational and \nlitigious manner. This is important to the parent and to the school \nsystem. It will mean resources, instead of being focused on hiring \nattorneys and confrontation in the courtroom or confrontation in a \nformal legal setting, can be focused on actually educating the child in \nthe classroom. That is the bottom line.\n  Fourth, the bill gives schools the tools they need to ensure that all \nthe children are safe. As Senator Kennedy mentioned, discipline has \nalways been a very difficult issue relative to IDEA, relative to \nspecial needs children. Disruption in the classroom is one of the \nprimary concerns you hear when talking with teachers and faculty in \nrelation to how special needs children are handled and dealt with in \nthe classroom. In this bill we try to address that. We have made \nsignificant progress.\n\n  I need to especially point out the work of Senator Sessions who \nfocused on this issue, and in a very constructive way moved the process \nforward, so we have an excellent piece of legislation in this area.\n  Lastly, we do have, as part of the amendments which passed yesterday, \na glide path to full funding under the discretionary accounts, which is \nthe proper way it should be done. In the history of dramatic increases \nin funding in this account, as was mentioned by Senator Bond, a 376-\npercent increase is the fastest growing funding increase of any \nspending item in the Federal budget on a percentage basis over the last \nfew years. The commitment is there and now the authorization is locked \nin to get us to full funding in 6 to 7 years.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. I expect it to receive very \nstrong support. It didn't come about through luck and just out of the \nblue. It came about because a lot of people spent a lot of time over a \nsignificant period in constructing it and listening and bringing the \npeople who were involved to the table to discuss it.\n  I especially thank some of those folks because most of this work is \ndone by our staff, and they do an extraordinary job. Let me mention a \ncouple. Senator Kennedy has mentioned them also on his side of the \naisle.\n  Specifically with Senator Sessions, there was John Little of his \nstaff who worked so hard on the discipline issue. Senator Alexander and \nhis staff; Kristin Bannerman, worked very hard on providing State and \nschool districts greater flexibility. Of course, from Senator Kennedy \nand his staff there is Michael Myers, who is staff director, and Connie \nGarner, who was already mentioned, who has been a major player. And \nJeremy Buzzell, we very much appreciate his effort.\n  On my staff, I have some extraordinary people who have done \nincredible work and deserve a great amount of accolades for this bill \ngetting to this point: Annie White, who is truly a specialist in this \narea; Denzel McGuire, an extraordinary leader on all educational \nissues; and Bill Lucia, who is equally strong on these issues. I have \nhad the very good fortune to have an exceptional staff--and, of course, \nmy staff director Sharon Soderstrom, who does an exceptional job on all \nissues. We are very lucky to have these folks working for us.\n  As a result of their efforts, we have been able to produce what I \nbelieve is an exceptional and a positive work product which is \nconsistent with the efforts of this committee generally, as I \nmentioned.\n  I thought I might read some of the things we have been able to pass \nout of this committee this year, this Congress, to reflect on how \nconstructive we have been, even in a time of some considerable \npartisanship. We have done the genetics nondiscrimination bill; the \ngenerics drug bill, which reduces the cost of generics; special \neducation; the community services block grant; the Workforce Investment \nAct, if we can get that to conference; we have the trauma care bill; \nthe medical devices bill; the child abuse prevention and treatment \nbill; the childcare block grant; the Smallpox Emergency Personnel \nProtection Act; pediatric drug research authority; Organ Donation and \nRecovery Act; and the Birth Defects Act. That is just a few of the \npieces of legislation we have been able to produce out of this \ncommittee in a bipartisan effort.\n  I certainly appreciate the assistance of Senator Kennedy undertaking \nand accomplishing this very strong record.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. We have other \nspeakers coming, but I want to read into the Record what difference \nthis law has made, which really tells the story.\n  This is a letter from Lyssa Bookman from Galloway, OH. This is a \nletter we received, actually, a few weeks ago. I pointed out earlier \nthat we have over 3,000 letters on this legislation, very thoughtful \nletters, enormously compelling, extremely moving; in many instances, \ninspiring. I will just read from this letter:\n\n       IDEA is necessary for all children. My personal experience \n     started long before my daughter was of school age. She was \n     diagnosed with Leukemia at nine months old.\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n     Due to her treatments she has long-term cognitive side \n     effects. I have had to beg to get any services for her. I \n     have never had to hire an attorney but have had to tell the \n     building principal and superintendent of schools that they \n     left me with no choice but to file suit against the district \n     of the IDEA laws. As soon as I mentioned it I had what I was \n     after. All my daughter needs is extra time to complete tests \n     and assignments. If the law was not in place, I would not \n     have a leg to stand on and my daughter would have been \n     miserable in school. Homeschooling would have been my only \n     option. She is now a fifth grade student in a gifted class \n     with a 504 plan giving the slight modification of extra \n     time. Without IDEA, she would not be able to handle the \n     pressures placed on a gifted student. Learning \n     disabilities and giftedness can go hand in hand and with \n     IDEA the giftedness can shine and the disability overcome. \n     IDEA gives the disabled child that chance to shine and \n     takes one worry out of the parents' minds. Thank you for \n     your efforts for the kids. They are the future.\n\n  I have another letter from Cathie Davis of Tennessee. She writes:\n\n       We moved to Monroe County, Tennessee where we will remain \n     until Angel graduates high school. Angel was the first \n     hearing impaired special needs student to enter their school \n     system and they have gone above and beyond to see to it that \n     Angel receives the best education possible. They provided her \n     with an interpreter, Joyce Boyles who has been with her since \n     the second grade. Mrs. Boyles put together a group they call \n     singing hands as a way of teaching the other students how to \n     communicate with Angel as opposed to only teaching Angel to \n     communicate with them. These students (all hearing) along \n     with Angel have been invited to perform at many events \n     throughout the State of Tennessee, signing the words to songs \n     such as ``I'm Proud to be an American'' by Lee Greenwood. \n     Angel has made all ``A's'' and ``B's'' on the sliding grade \n     scale and as of this year, without the aid of any Special Ed \n     classes and on a regular grading scale, she has maintained a \n     ``C'' average.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the kind of mail we have received. There are \nothers, obviously, who have not had as much success under the old bill. \nWe tried to address those issues in the current legislation.\n  Here is another parent who wrote. Her name is Denice Cronin, from \nHouston, TX. She wrote:\n\n       IDEA gave me the rights to ask for testing outside of the \n     school by an unbiased professional, paid for by the school. \n     Based on these findings, the school adjusted their style of \n     teaching and Bonnie again excelled. I still had to seek \n     outside teachings to ensure her success. The Texas Reading \n     Institute of Texas saved my daughter's sanity, as well as my \n     son's.\n       Today, she is a healthy 7th grade A-B student, still \n     classified as learning disabled. She attends, completes and \n     excels in the ``normal'' classroom. She even passes the TAKs \n     instead of taking the ``alternative testing.'' Should she run \n     into a setback, we have the rights and laws in place, due to \n     IDEA, to protect and ensure she continues to receive a ``fair \n     and complete education''.\n\n  In the past, these children were stored away in back rooms, even if \nthey were lucky enough to get into the school some years ago. We \nmentioned several who have been able to benefit from the bill. We are \nconvinced that with the changes we have made in the legislation, many \nmore families will be able to do so as well.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time during \nthe quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nPennsylvania is expected momentarily. Let me read a hopeful letter from \nCarolyn Wright, from Spokane, WA, which we received earlier this year:\n\n       My son, Aaron, attends his neighborhood elementary school. \n     He is in the same first-grade class as the boy who lives next \n     door. Sometimes after school Aaron and the neighbor boy play \n     together. They play Nintendo, sometimes ``boxing,'' or they \n     play catch.\n       None of that is unusual except that Aaron has Down \n     Syndrome. If it weren't for the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) Aaron would not be in class with his \n     neighbor. He would not get his chance to hold the flag during \n     the Pledge of Allegiance. He would not have the opportunity \n     to tell his friends that he has a cat or to learn that \n     ``Joey'' has a dog. IDEA has helped Aaron be a part of his \n     school community.\n       Math is a difficult subject for Aaron so he has a different \n     curriculum than other first graders and he is taught in the \n     special education classroom along with other students who \n     struggle with math. However, Aaron likes to read so he joins \n     the first-grade reading group to improve his reading skills. \n     Each area of Aaron's curriculum has been addressed so that he \n     is in the least restrictive environment possible that will \n     facilitate his learning.\n       Whenever Aaron's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) needs \n     revision, my husband and I are included in the discussion \n     with the multi-disciplinary team. Placement options are \n     discussed along with specific skill areas that need to be \n     addressed, keeping in mind Aaron's position as a member of \n     the community as well as his place in school. As part of the \n     IEP team we determine what curriculum will best meet Aaron's \n     needs.\n       We are very grateful to have IDEA. Because of IDEA Aaron is \n     a member of his neighborhood community and he is learning the \n     skills he needs to be independent. He may never be able to \n     live entirely independently but he will have a job and he \n     will contribute to society.\n\n  That is what this legislation is all about, Mr. President. We wish \nAaron great luck. We believe there are many other ``Aarons'' in the \ncountry who will continue to benefit. We hope to do it in a better way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3149, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send a modification to amendment No. \n3149 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3149), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Amend section 609 of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, as amended by section 101 of the bill, to read \n     as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 609. PAPERWORK REDUCTION.\n\n       ``(a) Report to Congress.--The Comptroller General shall \n     conduct a review of Federal, State, and local requirements \n     relating to the education of children with disabilities to \n     determine which requirements result in excessive paperwork \n     completion burdens for teachers, related services providers, \n     and school administrators, and shall report to Congress not \n     later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of \n     2003 regarding such review along with strategic proposals for \n     reducing the paperwork burdens on teachers.\n       ``(b) Paperwork Reduction Demonstration.--\n       ``(1) Pilot program.--\n       ``(A) Purpose.--The purpose of this subsection is to \n     provide an opportunity for States to identify ways to reduce \n     paperwork burdens and other administrative duties that are \n     directly associated with the requirements of this Act, in \n     order to increase the time and resources available for \n     instruction and other activities aimed at improving \n     educational and functional results for children with \n     disabilities.\n       ``(B) Authorization.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In order to carry out the purpose of \n     this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to grant waivers \n     of statutory requirements of, or regulatory requirements \n     relating to, this part for a period of time not to exceed 4 \n     years with respect to not more than 15 States based on \n     proposals submitted by States to reduce excessive paperwork \n     and noninstructional time burdens that do not assist in \n     improving educational and functional results for children \n     with disabilities.\n       ``(ii) Exception.--The Secretary shall not waive any \n     statutory requirements of, or regulatory requirements \n     relating to, applicable civil rights requirements.\n       ``(iii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to--\n\n       ``(I) affect the right of a child with a disability to \n     receive a free appropriate public education under this part; \n     and\n       ``(II) permit a State or local educational agency to waive \n     procedural safeguards under section 615.\n\n       ``(C) Proposal.--\n       ``(i) In general.--A State desiring to participate in the \n     program under this subsection shall submit a proposal to the \n     Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary \n     may reasonably require.\n       ``(ii) Content.--The proposal shall include--\n\n       ``(I) a list of any statutory requirements of, or \n     regulatory requirements relating to, this part that the State \n     desires the Secretary to waive or change, in whole or in \n     part; and\n       ``(II) a list of any State requirements that the State \n     proposes to waive or change, in whole or in part, to carry \n     out a waiver granted to the State by the Secretary.\n\n       ``(D) Termination of waiver.--The Secretary shall terminate \n     a State's waiver under this subsection if the Secretary \n     determines that the State--\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n       ``(i) has failed to make satisfactory progress in meeting \n     the indicators described in section 616; or\n       ``(ii) has failed to appropriately implement its waiver.\n       ``(2) Report.--Beginning 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2003, the Secretary shall include in the \n     annual report to Congress submitted pursuant to section 426 \n     of the Department of Education Organization Act information \n     related to the effectiveness of waivers granted under \n     paragraph (1), including any specific recommendations for \n     broader implementation of such waivers, in--\n       ``(A) reducing--\n       ``(i) the paperwork burden on teachers, principals, \n     administrators, and related service providers; and\n       ``(ii) noninstructional time spent by teachers in complying \n     with this part;\n       ``(B) enhancing longer-term educational planning;\n       ``(C) improving positive outcomes for children with \n     disabilities;\n       ``(D) promoting collaboration between IEP Team members; and\n       ``(E) ensuring satisfaction of family members.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thomas be added as a cosponsor \nto my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I first and foremost thank Senator Gregg \nand Senator Kennedy for their willingness to work with me on this \namendment. This is an amendment that comes from the many visits I had \nin public schools across Pennsylvania where I heard from special \neducation teachers, in particular, and administrators about the \nenormous amount of paperwork that special education teachers have to \ndeal with and how it is a point of great dissatisfaction among those \nteachers, as well as a factor in what they believe is limiting their \ntime and limiting the quality of the education children who are covered \nunder IDEA receive. As a result, I wanted to create an opportunity for \nStates to, through a pilot, do some innovation and, working with the \nDepartment of Education, try to reduce the amount of paperwork our \nteachers have to go through.\n  This is a serious problem in trying to recruit and retain special \neducation teachers. In fact, the most recent figure I have is that in \nthe 1999-2000 school year, there were 12,000 special education \nopenings. The principal reason for that was the enormous paperwork \nburden, the frustration that comes with having to deal with the \n``bureaucracy'' and ``redtape,'' as it has been put to me on more than \none occasion. These positions, for the most part, were left vacant or \nfilled by substitutes who did not have the qualifications necessary to \nteach these students who have special needs.\n  I suggest we are trying to address a problem that is out there, not \ntrying to limit the quality of the education of children with special \nneeds, but actually getting more qualified teachers into the classrooms \nto deal with this population that does have extraordinary needs, in \nsome cases, but without the extraordinary amount of paperwork that \ncomes with meeting those needs.\n  We have worked closely with the NEA. In fact, the NEA has endorsed \nthis amendment. They say:\n\n       Paperwork reduction in IDEA is one of the highest \n     priorities of our members. We commend you for your \n     acknowledgment that excessive paperwork not only takes \n     valuable instruction time away from students, but is a \n     critical component of the retention crisis we face in the \n     field of special education.\n\n  This is an important issue for teachers and should be an important \nissue for those parents and children in the special education system.\n  This is a way to keep qualified teachers, to have them spend more \nquality time and better time with children in the classroom. What we \nhave done is set up a pilot program. The pilot program, under the \nmodification I just sent to the desk, is for 15 States. The goal is to \nincrease instructional time and to improve the results of children with \nspecial needs.\n  Again, the idea here is to create an opportunity for innovation, an \nopportunity for States to not waive any provisions of this act. \nParticularly I know the concern Senator Kennedy and many have that the \nSecretary of Education cannot waive in a request from the States any \napplicable civil rights requirements. I had some parents meet with me \nlast week, and they were very concerned about this amendment and how it \nwould affect their child and their ability to get what was entitled to \nthem as far as education under IDEA.\n\n  Let me make it clear: Nothing in this demonstration can create a \nwaiver of any applicable civil rights requirements, and nothing in this \ndemonstration will affect the right of a child with a disability to \nreceive free appropriate public education. That, to me, is something at \nthe heart, something I know the parents want and, obviously, the NEA \nshould be concerned about it, as I am sure they are. I want to make it \nclear that what we are talking about is things that do not really add \nto the bottom line: quality of kids' education.\n  I am excited that Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg have agreed. I \nunderstand the House has a similar amendment to this amendment that has \na 10-State demonstration project. We have talked with the House, with \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Gregg. I think we have an agreement that \nthis 15-State demonstration is a good number and is a number we can all \nagree will stay in conference.\n  This program will be part of this new authorization and will create \nan opportunity for States--I am certainly hopeful that Pennsylvania \nwill be one of the States that will be participating in this \ndemonstration--to be innovative to improve the quality of education for \nchildren with disabilities and be a plus for them as well as teachers \nand school districts as a whole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reducing the paperwork burdens within IDEA \nis one of the Senate's top priorities in reauthorizing this important \nlaw.\n  We want to empower teachers to spend more time with their students in \nthe classroom, rather than spending endless hours filling out forms \nthat do not lead to a better education for students.\n  This bill already contains a number of excellent provisions aimed at \ncutting down on unnecessary paperwork for both teachers and parents. \nFor instance, S. 1248 streamlines state and local requirements to \nensure that paperwork focuses on improved educational and functional \nresults for children with disabilities.\n  It clarifies that no information is required in an IEP beyond what \nFederal law requires.\n  It eliminates the requirements that IEPs must include benchmarks and \nshort-term objectives that generate more paperwork, but requires a \ndescription of how progress is measured, including quarterly reports to \nparents.\n  It reduces the number of times that procedural safeguards notices \nmust be sent out to parents to once per year, unless their parent \nregisters a complaint or requests a copy.\n  It ensures that State regulations are consistent with IDEA and that \nany state-imposed requirements or paperwork reporting are clearly \nidentified to local educational agencies.\n  And it requires the Secretary to develop model forms, review \npaperwork requirements and provide Congress with proposals to reduce \nthe paperwork burden on teachers.\n  This is a great start on reducing paperwork for teachers, parents, \nand administrators.\n  However, we need to do more.\n  The amount of paperwork special education teachers are required to \ncomplete is burdensome, takes valuable time away from the classroom, \nand undermines the goal of providing the best quality education \npossible to all children.\n  Let me give you some statistics to illustrate this problem.\n  According to a recent study by the Council for Exceptional Children, \na majority of special educators estimate that they spend a day or more \neach week on paperwork, and 83 percent report spending half to one and \na half days per week in IEP-related meetings.\n  Special education teachers spend an average of 5 hours per week on \npaperwork, compared to general education teachers who spend an average \nof 2 hours per week on paperwork. The average length of an \nindividualized education program, or IEP, one of the biggest sources of \npaperwork, is between 8 and 16 pages. Fifty-three percent of special \neducation teachers report that, to a great extent, their routine duties \nand paperwork interfere with their interaction with their students.\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\n  Special educators spend more time on paperwork than grading papers, \ncommunicating with parents, sharing expertise with colleagues, \nsupervising paraprofessionals and attending individualized education \nprogram meetings combined.\n  While special educators spend the majority of their time on paperwork \nfilling out compliance and documentation-related paperwork, general \neducators spend most of their time completing instructionally relevant \npaperwork such as tracking students' academic progress across the \ncurriculum.\n  With these overwhelming paperwork burdens on teachers, we need to ask \nourselves what kind of effect they are having on our special education \nsystem.\n  Special education teachers feel excessive paperwork interferes with \ntheir ability to serve children with disabilities more effectively. The \nstudy of personnel needs in special education, SPENSE, sponsored by \nOSEP reveals that special education teachers often cite required forms \nand administrative paperwork as an area of dissatisfaction with their \nworking conditions.\n\n  The excessive amount of paperwork currently inherent in the process \noverwhelms and burdens teachers, robbing them of time to educate their \nstudents. It also makes it more difficult for school districts to \nretain and recruit highly qualified special education teachers.\n  Studies from the Department of Education show that the nation is \nfacing a significant shortage of special education teachers, and many \nspecial educators leaving the field cite the burden of unnecessary \npaperwork as one of the primary reasons for their departure.\n  Simply put, teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States \nshould be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that \ndo not lead to improved educational outcomes for children with \ndisabilities.\n  Therefore, I support the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwhich authorizes a pilot program allowing States to demonstrate \ninnovative and creative measures to reduce the paperwork burden.\n  The Secretary of Education would be authorized to grant waivers of \npaperwork requirements to 15 States based on proposals submitted by \nStates for reducing paperwork.\n  The goal is to increase instructional time and resources and improve \nresults for students with disabilities.\n  This pilot program is not meant to decrease any of the rights \nchildren have under the Act, but is intended to allow those States who \nchoose to participate to think creatively and innovatively about how to \nbest meet the demands of the Act while reducing the paperwork burden so \nschool personnel can focus on educating children with disabilities.\n  In fact, we clearly state that the Secretary of Education may not \nwaive any applicable civil rights requirements or procedural safeguards \nunder Section 615, and nothing in the demo will affect the right of a \nchild with a disability to receive a free appropriate public education, \nFAPE.\n  The amendment also includes a rigorous reporting requirement to \nensure that the Secretary reports to Congress about the success of this \nprogram in reducing unnecessary paperwork while preserving the rights \nof children served under the Act.\n  The National Education Association, made up of 2.7 million teachers, \nsupports this amendment. The NEA says that paperwork reduction in IDEA \nis one of the highest priorities of its members.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment, so that our Nation's \nteachers can spend more time on providing high quality education \nservices to our Nation's children with disabilities--rather than on \nfilling out mounds of unnecessary paperwork.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that Senator Santorum \nand I were able to reach agreement on this amendment. The Paperwork \nReduction Demo would provide up to 15 States with the opportunity to \ndevelop innovative methods of reducing burdensome paperwork so that \nteachers can spend more time teaching and improving educational and \nfunctional outcomes for children with disabilities. At the same time, \nit protects a child's right to a free appropriate public education, and \nthe procedural safeguards necessary to ensure this right.\n  IDEA is sometimes seen as a controversial piece of legislation. It is \na unique blend of civil rights law and State grant program, and as a \nresult, often pits the constitutional rights of children with \ndisabilities to a free appropriate public education against the \nflexibility teachers need to teach. I believe this amendment strikes a \ngood, fair balance.\n  As we reauthorize IDEA, it is important to note that next week, this \ncountry will be celebrating 50 years of public school desegregation. In \nthe landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education, Chief Justice \nWarren wrote that ``in the field of public education, the doctrine of \n`separate but equal' has no place.'' This decision literally opened the \ndoors of our public schools to all children, regardless of race.\n  The doors to a public education, however, did not open quite so \nquickly for children with disabilities. Twenty years after the decision \nin Brown, children with disabilities were still being segregated.\n  In the 1970s schools in America educated only one in five students \nwith disabilities. More than 1 million students were excluded from \npublic schools, and another 3.5 million did not receive appropriate \nservices. Many States had laws excluding certain students, including \nthose who were blind, deaf, or labeled. ``emotionally disturbed'' or \n``mentally retarded.'' The likelihood of exclusive was significantly \ngreater for children with disabilities living in low-income, ethnic and \nracial minority, or rural communities.\n  Parents, however, began asserting their children's rights to attend \npublic schools, using the same equal protection arguments used on \nbehalf of the African American children in Brown: the 14th amendment of \nthe U.S. Constitution guarantees their children and equal protection \nunder the law. Congress responded, and in 1975, enacted the Education \nfor All Handicapped Children Act, now known as IDEA.\n  Recognizing the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under \nthe law, Congress created the statutory right to a free appropriate \npublic education in the least restrictive environment.\n  I believe we all recognize the challenges of providing teachers with \nenough flexibility so they can do their job while ensuring that the \nconstitutional protections afforded to children with disabilities \nremain intact.\n  We also must continue to hold our States accountable for educational \noutcomes of our children. I think this amendment meets that challenge, \nand I am pleased to support it.\n  I think the underlying bill, S. 1248, also achieves the goal of \nbalancing the interests of our teachers and schools with the interests \nof improving achievement for and protecting the right of children with \ndisabilities and their families.\n  This bill makes it simpler for teachers and schools to teach children \nwith disabilities in many ways. For example, the bill: simplifies the \ndiscipline provisions and makes it easier for schools to administer the \nlaw; provides new opportunities for schools and parents to resolve \ndisputes equitably; substantially reduces paperwork in many ways, \nincluding, of course, by allowing a number of States to waive paperwork \nburdens in accordance with this amendment; increases local flexibility \nand control of resources by allowing school districts that are in \ncompliance with the law to use from 8 percent up to 25 percent of their \nFederal funds for local priorities; and authorizes local school \ndistricts to use up to 15 percent of their Federal IDEA funds to \nsupport students without disabilities in grades K-12 who require \nadditional academic and behavioral supports to succeed in the general \neducation curriculum.\n  The bill also makes significant improvements for children and their \nfamilies. For example, it; emphasizes the goal of improving academic \nachievement and functional performance within a child's IEP; ensures \nthat children with disabilities are included in the accountability \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind provides the Secretary of \nEducation and the States with greater authority and tools to implement, \nmonitor, and enforce the law; provides resources to States to support \nteacher\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\npreparation and professional development program; improves parental \ninvolvement; improves transition services to help students begin \nplanning for life after high school; provides earlier access to \nservices; improves early intervention and preschool programs; and \nensures positive behavioral interventions and supports are in place for \na child whose behavior impedes the child's ability to learn.\n  We must ensure that children with disabilities have access to, and \nsucceed in, the general education curriculum. I am disappointed that \nthis body did not approve full funding of IDEA, but I believe this bill \ngoes a long way in providing the tools, resources, and the flexibility \nto achieve this goal. I am pleased to support this bill and this \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment \nbecause it will give States the flexibility they need to reduce special \neducation paperwork.\n  We have heard from many teachers that they must take too much time \nout of their busy days to complete IDEA paperwork requirements. \nTeachers would rather spend that time in the classroom teaching their \nstudents.\n  We have heard these concerns loud and clear, and we have responded \nwith changes to make things easier for both parents and teachers. This \nbill reduces paperwork and meetings by: Streamlining educational \nplanning and procedural requirements; simplifying the Federal \napplication process; encouraging the use of technology; clarifying that \nno paperwork is required beyond what is in the Federal law; and \nrequiring the Department of Education to develop model forms.\n  These changes will go a long way to simplifying the work of special \neducation teachers and giving them more time to do what they do best--\nteach children. These changes will also make it possible for more \nparents to participate in their child's education.\n  This amendment will give a limited number of States the opportunity \nto do even more to address paperwork by giving them flexibility to \nwaive paperwork requirements. But today the Senate needs to make it \nabsolutely clear that this flexibility does not include waiving Civil \nRights protections for disabled students.\n  Civil Rights are the very heart of the IDEA. The right to go to a \npublic school, the right to learn alongside one's peers, the right to \nan appropriate education, and the right to due process, are fundamental \nto this law and we cannot allow waivers to trade these rights in \nexchange for less paperwork.\n  In July 2002, President Bush's Commission on Excellence in Special \nEducation gave Congress and the President its recommendations for \nimproving results for disabled students. This commission offered many \nsuggestions for reducing paperwork in special education and allowing \nthese waivers was one of them.\n  But the chair of the President's commission was absolutely clear that \npaperwork reduction should not threaten civil rights. Listen to what \nthe chair, Governor Terry Branstad of Iowa, had to say when he \ntestified before the House on the IDEA and the commission's report:\n\n     `` . . . [A]s we are trying to reduce the paperwork, \n     streamline it, and make it more efficient, we . . . want to . \n     . . protect their civil rights.''\n\n  We must ensure that States live up to the full intent of the \ncommission's recommendation--to balance paperwork reduction with civil \nrights protections.\n  The chair of the President's commission is not alone in his concern \nfor protecting civil rights while reducing paperwork. The National \nCouncil on Disability--the Federal agency responsible for advising \nPresident and Congress on issues affecting the disabled--says that, if \nnot done carefully, waivers may have unintended consequences. According \nto the National Council on Disability:\n\n     Waivers threaten educational quality because instruction and \n     achievement are measured by documenting progress.\n\n     Waivers threaten civil rights because compliance with the law \n     must be documented.\n\n  Let me first speak to the issue of paperwork and educational quality. \nAsk any teacher how he or she begins the day before the students \narrive. They begin by reviewing a lesson plan that sets the goals for \nthe day and describes how those goals will be reached. They develop \ntests for their students to see if they are meeting those goals. These \nlesson plans, goals, and tests are based on a thoughtful and \ncomprehensive curriculum. This is all paperwork--paperwork that is \nnecessary to ensure quality instruction for every student.\n  Quality instruction for disabled students is no different. Special \neducation paperwork ensures that schools think carefully about how best \nto educate a disabled student, then document their plan, and then \ndocument progress. Does any of that paperwork sound unnecessary?\n  If States interpret these waivers as a license to set aside these \nimportant pieces of a disabled child's education, we have completely \nundermined the focus on academic and functional achievement in this \nbill.\n  Just like the National Council on Disability, I also have expressed \nmy great concern about protecting civil rights if States are given too \nmuch flexibility. In my opening statement, I addressed the issue of \nnoncompliance with this law. All across this country, nearly 30 years \nafter this law was first passed, many disabled children still are \ndenied their right to a public education. Year after year, the majority \nof States fail to implement the IDEA and are found out of compliance \nwith its most basic requirements.\n  Reports from the Department of Education show just how rampant \nnoncompliance with the IDEA is. From 2000 to 2003: 76 percent of States \ndid not appropriately resolve complaints; 71 percent of States lacked \neffective systems to monitor and enforce the law; 71 percent of States \ndid not educated disabled children with their peers; and 65 percent of \nStates did not appropriately prepare students for post-school \nemployment and independent living.\n  These States already blatantly disregard the requirements of the \nIDEA. Imagine what would happen if these States are given waivers \nwithout the clear limitations set forth in this amendment, if they \ncould feel free to waive any requirement in the name of paperwork \nreduction. The impact of unlimited paperwork waivers on disabled \nstudents in States like these could be devastating.\n  Even with detailed requirements for education plans and other \npaperwork under current law, look at what is happening to disabled \nchildren all across the nation.\n  The Richer family from Oregon writes that their school made the \ndecision to shorten their son's school day by 3 hours--without asking \nthe parents first. The same school district completed their son's \neducation plan and assigned him to a classroom without including his \nparents in the decision.\n  The Johnson family from new Jersey writes that it took 18 months to \nget an appropriate educational plan written for their child, and the \nschool still will not provide the speech therapy and counseling \nservices written on that plan.\n  These are true stories, just like the hundreds of other true stories \nthat parents have sent to me. This is why it must be made absolutely \nclear that these waivers are not a free pass out of accountability or a \nway to erode individualized education plans that are the cornerstone of \nthe IDEA.\n  Look at any other field--the legal field, the medical field, or \nbusiness. In these fields, if it wasn't documented, it wasn't done. \nInsurers don't pay doctors when they don't document the care they \nprovided. Clients don't pay lawyers if they do not document the hours \nspent on a case. And businesses don't provide their services without a \ncontract. In every part of life, documentation is the way we guarantee \nthat people did what they promised to do. It is not too much to ask \nthat schools do the same so we can be sure they are complying with the \nlaw and giving every disabled child an appropriate education.\n  I know that we demand a lot of our teachers. We ask them to not only \neducate our children to become productive citizens, but also to be \ncounselors, mentors, and role models. And, yes, we ask them to do \npaperwork on top of that.\n  Should the Senate do everything it can to make it easier for special \neducation teachers to focus on the needs of students instead of \nfocusing on paperwork? Absolutely--but not at the cost of educational \naccountability and civil\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\nrights for students with disabilities. Not if it undermines the \nfoundations of the IDEA. Without the limitations set forth in this \namendment, waivers may have the unintended consequence of allowing \nStates to experiment with the civil rights of millions of disabled \nstudents for years to come.\n  I do not object to giving States the chance to creatively address the \nissue of paperwork. This amendment offers States an exciting \nopportunity to make sure that teachers have more time to plan, take \nprofessional development courses, or provide extra help to students. \nGiving teachers more time means giving them a chance to do what they \nlove most: focus on the needs of students.\n  But the needs of disabled students cannot be met without first \nguaranteeing that they have the full protection of the law. This \namendment provides that guarantee, while still encouraging paperwork \nreduction, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for offering the \namendment that will reduce the paperwork for teachers and also ensure \nthe protection of the rights of disabled children.\n  This amendment draws a clear line between unnecessary paperwork about \nthe process and necessary documentation and ensuring every disabled \nchild's right to a free and appropriate public education.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has made it clear that States will not \nbe allowed to waive the civil rights of disabled students or waive \nprocedural safeguards guaranteed under law.\n  This is a good amendment. It balances the needs of both the teachers \nand students. I thank him for his work on this amendment and also for \nhis accommodation and willingness to work this out. It has been very \nhelpful.\n  I will wait for my colleague, the chairman, before urging the \nadoption of the amendment, but I expect it will be done momentarily.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be evenly \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have been informed by Senator Gregg's \nstaff that he does not seek any time.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3149, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3149), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes 6 seconds on the majority \nside and 5 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield the 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. He \nhas been such a dedicated champion for the needs of special education \nthroughout the country for all these years. I wish his dedication was \nreflected fully in this legislation on which we are going to be voting \nshortly.\n  In an era when we are talking so much about accountability in \neducation, the teachers, administrators, and local school boards \nthroughout our country who are supposed to be accountable for results, \nfor ``making acceptable progress'' and improving student test scores, \nwe, too, in the Senate have a role and responsibility to aid and assist \nthem in making that progress.\n  I regrettably believe this legislation falls seriously short of our \nresponsibility to them and to the students they are helping and \nsupporting and without our full involvement and aid are less likely to \nsucceed.\n  In this important area of special education, we in the Senate, the \nCongress, and the Federal Government have very special responsibilities \nbecause it was Congress who established these rights for every American \nchild to a quality public education a quarter century ago and mandated \nevery school district with the responsibility to provide it.\n  I was not here when that legislation passed, but its language implied \nthat schools would be reluctant, perhaps even resistant, to assume \ntheir responsibilities. That was over a quarter century ago.\n  I speak from my personal knowledge about Minnesota, and I assume it \nis true throughout our country, our public schools, our teachers, \nadministrators, support personnel, and policymakers are the \nlegislation's allies. In Minnesota, our educators are fully committed \nand deeply dedicated to providing the best possible special education \nto every student with special needs and in fact every student who comes \nthrough their doors. They are doing so, as I have personally witnessed \nin hundreds of special education classes throughout Minnesota, with \namazing skills, heart-warming personal devotion and often extraordinary \nsuccess. They are doing so increasingly in spite of, not because of, \nthe Senate.\n  This legislation fails our responsibility to the students of this \nNation with special needs, to their dedication and to their cause, \nwhich is our cause. Yesterday an amendment failed which would have \nfulfilled in 6 years a promise the U.S. Congress made over a quarter \ncentury ago when it passed the initial legislation to fund 40 percent \nof the costs of special education.\n  In the year 2001, when we had all of these surpluses we were told \nwould exist throughout the decade, the Senate did pass such an \namendment, but the House of Representatives and the administration \nrefused to accept it and so it was not put into that law.\n  I have tried 5 times in the last 3 years, with amendments, to have us \nrealize our long-broken promise in 1 year, in a succeeding fiscal year, \nand those amendments have failed.\n  I was shocked and appalled that this body rejected Senator Harkin's \namendment to bring us up to that promised 40-percent level in 6 years. \nToday it is less than half of that promise. That cost Minnesota schools \n$250 million a year. That is money that is badly needed to fulfill \ntheir responsibilities to children with special needs and it is money \nthen that often has to be taken out of regular school programs because \nthey have a legal responsibility and liability to provide those special \neducation services. So it means all of the students in Minnesota get \nshortchanged because this Senate will not keep its promise. The \nmajority decided to provide an additional $39 billion over the next 10 \nyears in tax advantages to companies for their foreign operations, tax \npreferences to expand their foreign businesses and take more jobs away \nfrom the United States and put them overseas. That was deemed worthy of \n$39 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes to \nconclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, at that same time, where there is $39 \nbillion around somewhere for giant corporations and wealthy investors \nwho do not need it, there is not a willingness to provide even in 6 \nyears the promised 40-percent level for students with special needs. It \nis not that we do not have the money; we do not have the right \npriorities; we do not have the will. It is terribly unfair for us to be \ntelling the school districts they have to run tests every year and \ninclude children with special needs and be measured and publicized and \nin some cases publicly embarrassed because they are not making \nacceptable progress toward goals that have been established when we do \nnot provide the money to enable them to do it. Shame on us, not them. \nIt is irresponsible and it is inexcusable. This money is badly needed \nin Minnesota, and I assume elsewhere in the country.\n\n  In terms of reform, the paperwork that burdens the reporting \nrequirements is driving Minnesota teachers out of special education and \nout of the classroom entirely. Those who remain spend less than half of \ntheir time actually working with students because\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nthey are so busy filling out the forms the Federal Government has \nimposed on them, as well as some by the State and the school districts \nfor sure. I commend Senator Santorum for offering a pilot program for \n15 States, but it is the job of the Senate to determine those reforms. \nI have heard for over 3 years the reason we are not providing money for \nspecial education is because we have to ``reform it first''. So now we \nare passing a bill that has minimal reforms and a pilot program and no \nadditional money.\n  I think it is a terrible disservice to No Child Left Behind, which is \nbeing proven once again to be a nice phrase but with no real meaning or \ncommitment behind it. I think we will regret that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of our time and I \nask unanimous consent that we proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, under the \nprevious order the committee substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Improving \n     educational results for children with disabilities is an \n     essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality \n     of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \n     economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       ``(2) Before the date of the enactment of the Education for \n     All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142), the \n     educational needs of millions of children with disabilities \n     were not being fully met because--\n       ``(A) the children did not receive appropriate educational \n     services;\n       ``(B) the children were excluded entirely from the public \n     school system and from being educated with their peers;\n       ``(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from \n     having a successful educational experience; or\n       ``(D) a lack of adequate resources within the public school \n     system forced families to find services outside the public \n     school system.\n       ``(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this Act \n     has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities \n     and the families of such children access to a free \n     appropriate public education and in improving educational \n     results for children with disabilities.\n       ``(4) However, the implementation of this Act has been \n     impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on \n     applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching \n     and learning for children with disabilities.\n       ``(5) Over 25 years of research and experience has \n     demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities \n     can be made more effective by--\n       ``(A) having high expectations for such children and \n     ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in \n     the regular classroom to the maximum extent possible in order \n     to--\n       ``(i) meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent \n     possible, the challenging expectations that have been \n     established for all children; and\n       ``(ii) be prepared to lead productive and independent adult \n     lives, to the maximum extent possible;\n       ``(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of parents \n     and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful \n     opportunities to participate in the education of their \n     children at school and at home;\n       ``(C) coordinating this Act with other local, educational \n     service agency, State, and Federal school improvement \n     efforts, including improvement efforts under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965, in order to ensure that \n     such children benefit from such efforts and that special \n     education can become a service for such children rather than \n     a place where they are sent;\n       ``(D) providing appropriate special education and related \n     services, and aids and supports in the regular classroom, to \n     such children, whenever appropriate;\n       ``(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice \n     preparation and professional development for all personnel \n     who work with children with disabilities in order to ensure \n     that such personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary \n     to improve the academic achievement and functional \n     performance of children with disabilities, including the use \n     of scientifically based instructional practices, to the \n     maximum extent possible;\n       ``(F) providing incentives for whole-school approaches, \n     scientifically based early reading programs, positive \n     behavioral interventions and supports, and prereferral \n     interventions to reduce the need to label children as \n     disabled in order to address their learning and behavioral \n     needs;\n       ``(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning while \n     reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in \n     improving educational results; and\n       ``(H) supporting the development and use of technology, \n     including assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services, to maximize accessibility for children \n     with disabilities.\n       ``(6) While States, local educational agencies, and \n     educational service agencies are primarily responsible for \n     providing an education for all children with disabilities, it \n     is in the national interest that the Federal Government have \n     a supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to \n     educate children with disabilities in order to improve \n     results for such children and to ensure equal protection of \n     the law.\n       ``(7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential \n     for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to \n     provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.\n       ``(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded \n     opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and \n     constructive ways.\n       ``(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and \n     States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary \n     paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational \n     outcomes.\n       ``(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the \n     growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society.\n       ``(B) America's ethnic profile is rapidly changing. In the \n     year 2000, 1 of every 3 persons in the United States was a \n     member of a minority group or was limited English proficient.\n       ``(C) Minority children comprise an increasing percentage \n     of public school students.\n       ``(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts \n     for special education personnel should focus on increasing \n     the participation of minorities in the teaching profession.\n       ``(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the \n     fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in \n     many parts of our Nation.\n       ``(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the \n     levels of referral and placement of limited English \n     proficient children in special education.\n       ``(C) This poses a special challenge for special education \n     in the referral of, assessment of, and services for, our \n     Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.\n       ``(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the \n     intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and \n     high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.\n       ``(B) More minority children continue to be served in \n     special education than would be expected from the percentage \n     of minority students in the general school population.\n       ``(C) African-American children are identified as having \n     mental retardation and emotional disturbance at rates greater \n     than their white counterparts.\n       ``(D) In the 1998-1999 school year, African-American \n     children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged \n     6 through 21, but comprised 20.2 percent of all children with \n     disabilities.\n       ``(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately \n     Caucasian students and teachers have placed \n     disproportionately high numbers of their minority students \n     into special education.\n       ``(13)(A) As the number of minority students in special \n     education increases, the number of minority teachers and \n     related services personnel produced in colleges and \n     universities continues to decrease.\n       ``(B) The opportunity for minority individuals, \n     organizations, and Historically Black Colleges and \n     Universities to participate fully in awards for grants and \n     contracts, boards of organizations receiving funds under this \n     Act, and peer review panels, and in the training of \n     professionals in the area of special education is essential \n     if we are to obtain greater success in the education of \n     minority children with disabilities.\n       ``(14) As the graduation rates for children with \n     disabilities continue to climb, providing effective \n     transition services to promote successful post-school \n     employment or education is an important measure of \n     accountability for children with disabilities.\n       ``(d) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       ``(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have \n     available to them a free appropriate public education that \n     emphasizes special education and related services designed to \n     meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment, \n     further education, and independent living;\n       ``(B) to ensure that the rights of children with \n     disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and\n       ``(C) to assist States, localities, educational service \n     agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education \n     of all children with disabilities;\n       ``(2) to assist States in the implementation of a \n     Statewide, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system \n     of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with \n     disabilities and their families;\n       ``(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the \n     necessary tools to improve educational results for children \n     with disabilities by supporting systemic-change activities; \n     coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated \n     technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and \n     technology development and media services; and\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\n       ``(4) to assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts \n     to educate children with disabilities.\n\n     ``SEC. 602.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \ntoday to talk about the special education reauthorization bill, S. \n1248, that was passed on the Senate floor today.\n  I start by thanking Senators Gregg and Kennedy, in particular, for \ntheir hard work in crafting this bill over the course of the last two \nCongresses. This reauthorization process has truly been a bipartisan \neffort and is an example of what happens when partisan differences are \nset aside to work toward common goals. There are few more appropriate \nissues on which to work together than ensuring all children, regardless \nof their lot in life, are guaranteed an education that suits their \nneeds.\n  I support this bill because it is a step in the right direction. It \nis not perfect, but it reaches a fair compromise by giving States and \nschools greater administrative and fiscal flexibility, while continuing \nto provide parents with disabled children the assurances that their \nchildren will continue to get an appropriate education.\n  This bill focuses on two main concepts: aligning special education \nlaw with No Child Left Behind and ensuring greater mechanisms are in \nplace to allow disabled students to transition into mainstream society \nafter high school graduation.\n  No Child Left Behind requires States and school districts to ensure \nthat all students are learning and are reaching their highest \npotential. Special education students should not be left out of these \naccountability mechanisms. They should have the same level of support \nand guidance as nondisabled students, and have the same opportunities \nto enter the workforce and continue their education after high school. \nThe goal of this reauthorization bill was to put provisions in place to \nallow teachers and parents to plan early for special education students \nto make a life for themselves after graduation.\n  I believe it is going to really help my State and other States around \nthe country by giving teachers more guidance and support to do their \njobs, and\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\ngiving parents greater involvement in how their children are educated. \nI also hope that it will help identify children early--as infants and \ntoddlers--so that they can receive the services they need before it is \nnecessary for them to enter a special education classroom.\n  One notable provision that the Senate attached to this bill on the \nfloor this week is a mechanism to guide Congress toward meeting its \ncommitment to provide States with 40 percent of the excess costs \nassociated with educating students with special needs.\n  Although the original special education law, which was passed in \n1975, gave States assurances that the Federal Government would \nreimburse States for the cost of educating special education students, \nCongress has never come close to meeting its goal.\n  Today, for instance, States are receiving about 19 percent or $10 \nbillion in Federal funding to be used for educating special needs \nchildren. And while Congress has worked hard over the last 7 years to \nmake greater investments in special education, States continue to \nstruggle to educate special needs students because of how costly it is \nto teach them.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Gregg and supported by myself and 95 \nother Senators sets up a timeline by which Congress will move toward \nits goal of funding 40 percent of the cost of special education. Every \nyear, from now until 2011, Congress can use its discretion to \nappropriate up to $2 billion each year for special education.\n  This new funding mechanism will mean States could see their Federal \nshare of special education funds double over the course of the next 6 \nyears.\n  In California, where State schools educate 11 percent--or roughly \n675,000 students--of the Nation's special education K through 12 \npopulation, school districts will receive $1.7 billion in Federal \ndollars this year. In spite of the large amount of funding the State \nreceives, I am told that they have been forced to transfer billions of \ndollars annually from general education to special education due to \nCongress' failure to keep its promise to fully fund special education.\n  An increase in the Federal funding commitment will mean that \nCalifornia could receive up to $2.7 billion a year in special education \nfunding by 2011 and will no longer have to shuffle money from their \ngeneral education budgets to underwrite the cost of educating special \nneeds students.\n  So this funding promise will make a huge difference to States and \nschool districts and one that I was happy to support. Schools will now \nhave predictable special education funding that they can count on when \nbalancing their budgets and planning for future years.\n  I also urge the Senate's support, in conference, of a provision \nadopted by the House which would require that increases in Federal \nfunding above fiscal year 2003 levels be directly allocated to the \nlocal level. This would ensure that all IDEA funding gets down to our \nschool districts that are responsible for providing quality education \nto children with disabilities.\n  In California, this provision is critical in meeting the Federal \nresponsibilities to assist all students with disabilities, including \nthe thousands of students with physical and mental disabilities served \nby the State's large county education offices, such as Los Angeles, San \nFrancisco, and San Diego, that are tasked with educating the State's \nvast majority of special needs children.\n  So I am satisfied that this bill will meet the needs of both school \ndistricts and parents. I hope it will help give students the tools they \nneed to become productive citizens, teachers more flexibility to do \ntheir jobs, parents greater ability to work with schools to ensure that \ntheir children are getting the services to which they are entitled, and \nStates the funding and oversight necessary to make sure that education \nfor disabled students is as seamless as for nondisabled students. I am \npleased to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \ntwo subjects this afternoon. First, this is the 50-year anniversary of \nthe historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education where the Supreme \nCourt of the United States ruled that separate but equal education \nfacilities violated the U.S. Constitution and ordered the integration \nof schools in the United States.\n  That is historic because for the first time it gave real meaning to \nequality and the equal protection of the law clause of the 14th \namendment.\n  Prior to Brown v. Board of Education, segregation had been the rule \nof the day. The 14th amendment, incorporating the equal protection \nclause and due process of law, was enacted in 1868. At that time, the \ngalleries of the Senate were segregated, and the manager of the 14th \namendment in the House of Representatives, in commenting about what \nequal protection meant, did not mean that the races would share \naccommodations together. Then in the celebrated case of Plessy v. \nFerguson decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1896, an \n8-to-1 decision, the Supreme Court decided that the equal protection \nclause was satisfied if the facilities were equal even though they were \nseparate. That remained the law of the land for the next 58 years until \n1954 with Brown v. Board of Education.\n  The decisions in this field are the best examples of the vitality of \nthe U.S. Constitution and the way the Constitution reflects the \nfundamental values of a society, which have changed in the course of \ntime. Justice Cardoza, in the celebrated case of Palko v. Connecticut, \narticulated the changing constitutional doctrine when he talked about \nthe fundamental values of our society.\n  There are still some who contend that original intent is the only way \nto interpret the U.S. Constitution. In the first place, it is very hard \nto divine what the intent was of the Founding Fathers in 1787 when the \nConstitution was signed, even more difficult to figure out the intent \nof the ratifiers of the U.S. Constitution; and then when there is the \nequal protection clause, there is no doubt that the intent of\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\nthose who spoke to equal protection was not to have integration. When \nthe fundamental values of our society changed in the intervening years, \nthe Supreme Court of the United States recognized that and interpreted \nthe Constitution and equality and equal protection in a very different \nway.\n  When I was in the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office, I saw \nfirsthand the changing values that led to new and different \nconstitutional doctrines. The case of Mapp v. Ohio decided in 1961 \nstarted a cavalcade or an avalanche of Supreme Court decisions which \nchanged the constitutional law of defendants' rights.\n  In Wolf v. Colorado in 1949, the Supreme Court of the United States \nsaid that the due process clause of the 14th amendment did not \nincorporate the fourth amendment prohibition against search and \nseizure.\n  Back in 1916, in Weeks v. The United States, the Supreme Court ruled \nthat evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure could not \nbe introduced in a criminal prosecution. But that was not applicable to \nthe States until the U.S. Supreme Court broadened what due process \nmeant and said the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable \nsearch and seizure was a fundamental value in our society and it \napplied to State prosecutions as well.\n  I recall one case that came up in the Philadelphia criminal court not \nlong thereafter where the defense advanced the concept of unreasonable \nsearch and seizure and cited Mapp v. Ohio, and the Philadelphia judge \nsaid, well, that is a Ohio case, and disregarded the constitutional \nlaw. He later found out that Ohio cases were binding in Pennsylvania \nwhen they are decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Mapp v. Ohio was then followed by a case involving a right to \ncounsel, and it was decided that there was a constitutional right to \ncounsel. Justice Black said that anyone who was hauled into court had a \nright to counsel in a State prosecution.\n  Then the Escobedo v. Illinois case in 1964 concluded that a defendant \nwas entitled to certain warnings, and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 \nexpanded that doctrine.\n  In my tenure in the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office I saw \nfirsthand on an ongoing basis the prosecutor's job being made more \ncomplicated, but understandably so, and in the long trail of history, \ndecisions which improved the quality of our civilization so that due \nprocess of law had broader concepts.\n\n  The principal case in the field continues to be Brown v. Board of \nEducation, and it is time to reminisce a bit, time to focus. There is \nstill a great deal more to be done on equality in our society. If we \ntake a look at the statistics of earnings of African Americans versus \nCaucasians--way down. If we take a look at the earning opportunities \nfor women, the glass ceiling still prevails. There is decided \nimprovement in the Senate. When I was elected, only Senator Nancy \nKassebaum of Kansas had been in this Chamber as a woman, and Senator \nPaula Hawkins was elected in 1980 as the second woman. Now the number \nis 14 and growing. The Senate is a better place for the additional \nwomen whom we have. At the top of the list is the distinguished \nPresiding Officer--or near the top of the list, or tied for the top of \nthe list; I do not want to get into too many comparisons--the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Lisa Murkowski.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5453-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5453-S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have also sought recognition to comment about the \nstatus of pending asbestos legislation under S. 2290, the Fairness in \nAsbestos Injury Resolution Act. The Judiciary Committee passed out of \ncommittee a bill in July of last year, largely along party lines, which \nI supported because I thought it important to move the legislation \nforward even though I had grave reservations about the quality of the \nbill.\n  There was no doubt that there was an urgent need for Federal \nlegislation on this subject because some 70 corporations have gone \nbankrupt, thousands of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos \nhave deadly diseases, mesothelioma and other ailments, and were not \nbeing compensated because their employers, potential defendants, were \nbankrupt. I enlisted the aid--he is still a very young man, although a \nsenior judge--of the former chief judge for the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit, Edward Becker, who is now a senior judge, having \ntaken that status in May of last year, and I asked him to assist in \ntrying to resolve many of the problems in the asbestos issue. For 2 \ndays in August of last year he and I met in his chambers with \nrepresentatives of the manufacturers, the insurers, the reinsurers, the \nAFL-CIO, and the trial lawyers, trying to work through many of the \nproblems. On many intervening days since last August, he and I have met \nwith those parties in my conference room, trying to work out many of \nthe complex issues.\n\n  These efforts were recognized by the majority leader, Senator Frist, \nand the leader of the Democrats, Senator Daschle, who asked Judge \nBecker to take on formal status as a mediator. He has spent many hours, \nmany days working under the auspices of the leaders.\n  Right now, the efforts to find a legislative solution have been held \nin abeyance because of the differences between the manufacturers, \ninsurers, and reinsurers on one side, and the stakeholders, \nrepresenting the injured parties, the AFL-CIO, and the trial lawyers, \non the other, as to what the amount of the trust fund ought to be.\n  The concept of a trust fund is an outstanding idea. Senator Hatch, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, deserves great credit for \nmoving the legislation in the direction of a trust fund with a schedule \nof payments analogous to workmen's compensation so the cases would not \nhave to go through the litigation process. But a fund would be \nestablished to pay them once their damages were determined; credit also \nto Senator Leahy, the ranking member, and credit also to members of the \nJudiciary Committee and the leadership, Senator Frist and Senator \nDaschle, and many others.\n  I asked Judge Becker to submit a memorandum summarizing where the \nissue stood, which at an appropriate time I will ask to have printed in \nthe Record. Judge Becker's memorandum notes:\n\n     . . . the achievements on an administrative structure for \n     processing claims, and on provisions for judicial review.\n\n  And, further:\n\n     . . . other significant matters such as the definition of \n     exigent claims, timing of payments, and . . . some consensus \n     on certain concepts such as the anatomy of the ``start up''. \n     . . .\n\n  There was:\n\n     . . . a much clearer understanding [as a result of these \n     mediation efforts] on the troublesome issue of projecting \n     disease incidence . . . and claim filings over the next \n     [many] years.\n\n  Judge Becker noted that:\n\n     . . . there are still some loose ends to be tied down, \n     especially on the issue of distribution of non-cancer \n     asbestos claimants with increasing degrees of lung impairment \n     claims . . .\n\n  And noted further:\n\n     . . . a significant breakthrough on the related issue of \n     partial ``sunset''. . . .\n\n  And then itemized some of the issues which have yet to be resolved:\n\n       Treatment of pending claims and bankruptcies; subrogation \n     of workers compensation payments; and the venue of any \n     revision to the tort system as a vehicle for ``sunset''. . . \n     .\n\n  As noted, these mediation efforts have achieved a great deal. Much of \nthe controversy has been resolved and many of the other issues, \nalthough not resolved, have seen very substantial progress.\n  There is a considerable difference, as noted, as to what the fund \nought to be with the insurers, reinsurers, and manufacturers on one \nside and the injured workers represented by the AFL-CIO and the trial \nlawyers on the other side. Judge Becker notes in his memorandum he is \nduty-bound not to make a disclosure as where the parties stand, but \nalso noted there have already been disclosures by the parties. So it is \nnot really a secret matter. But I will respect the confidentiality the \nleaders asked for, and not talk about that.\n\n  I think maybe a certain hiatus in the negotiations would be \nappropriate. Judge Becker concluded his intensive 6 days of mediation \nlast week. I have been talking to the parties on both sides and it is \nmy hope to reconvene the mediation process.\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n  If the matter goes back to committee, it will not have the input from \nall of the stakeholders which is so important and so vital in \nunderstanding all the issues and trying to come to agreement. The \nparties may be motivated by reconstituting negotiations because of \ntheir desire to find a way to have agreement as opposed to having the \nSenate impose decisions that are not agreed to by the parties.\n  I think it would be unfortunate if the Senate imposed the judgment as \nto where we stand on these complex issues because I think they require \na lot more detail and a lot more study than the Judiciary Committee can \ngive them. It is a much better forum to have the parties continue to \nwork. As to the amount of money, it is my hope there will be \nflexibility on all sides.\n  We ought not to consider this as a matter for extracting the last \ndollar one way or another because there are so many thousands of \ninjured workers who have mesothelioma, which is deadly, who are not \nbeing compensated because their companies are bankrupt. There are some \n70 companies in bankruptcy. It would be an enormous help to the economy \nif there could be a resolution of this very troublesome problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of Judge Becker's memorandum to \nme, dated May 11, be printed in the Record following my comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     Date: May 11, 2004.\n     To: Senator Arlen Specter.\n     From: Judge Edward R. Becker.\n     Re: Pending Asbestos Legislation S. 2290 (Fairness in \n         Asbestos Injury Resolution Act; Status Report on \n         Mediation).\n\n       You have asked that I update my previous evaluation of the \n     status of the efforts to achieve a consensus among the \n     manufacturers and other defendant companies, the insurers, \n     the reinsurers, organized labor, and the trial lawyers, i.e., \n     the stakeholders concerned with S. 2290, so as to facilitate \n     consideration of the legislation by the Senate and make \n     possible its ultimate passage in a form satisfactory to the \n     stakeholders and the Senate. I am pleased to do so.\n       You and I began the mediation process in the summer of \n     2003, and intensified it in the early months of 2004, leading \n     to significant agreement among the stakeholders on a number \n     of major issues, most notably on an administrative structure \n     for processing claims, and on provisions for judicial review. \n     We also achieved agreement on a number of other significant \n     matters such as the definition of exigent claims, the timing \n     of payments, and we reached some consensus on certain \n     concepts such as the anatomy of the ``start up'', though \n     details remained to be worked out.\n       As you know, I have just concluded six days of intensive \n     mediation under the auspices of Majority Leader Frist, and \n     Minority Leader Daschle, focused on the critical issues of \n     claims values, projections, and the overall funding necessary \n     to sustain a viable National Trust. These sessions were \n     attended by the top representatives of all the stakeholders, \n     including a large cadre of CEO's and corporate general \n     counsels. This process served a number of highly useful \n     purposes. At the threshold, as the result of a session \n     attended by four leading experts, we came to a much clearer \n     understanding of the troublesome issue of projecting disease \n     incidence and, more importantly, claim filings over the next \n     forty to fifty years. There are still some loose ends to be \n     tied down, especially on the issue of distribution of non-\n     cancer asbestosis claimants with increasing degrees of lung \n     impairment claims (S. 2290 levels III, IV and V), but in \n     other respects we have a good handle on the issues. While the \n     confidentiality attendant to the mediation process cautions \n     me against memorializing the details of the parties' \n     positions on claim values, projections, and the size of the \n     fund, I can fairly state that major progress was made in all \n     these areas. There was also a significant breakthrough on the \n     related issue of partial ``sunset'' of claims by lung cancer \n     victims with significant asbestos exposure, but without x-ray \n     evidence of pleural thickening or asbestosis, if and when \n     these claims exceed an agreed upon number. . . . In short, \n     the parties are significantly closer than they had been \n     before. Additionally, on the vital issue of the size of the \n     up-front funding (during the first 5 years of the fund), \n     major strides have also been made.\n       While there is still a good deal of distance between the \n     positions of the stakeholders on these matters, I am \n     optimistic that, with further discussions with the right \n     intermediary, the gap might be closed. Such a ``gap closure'' \n     would not, I must add, seal a consensus in the absence of \n     agreement on a number of other issues of great importance to \n     the parties, most of which are inextricably intertwined with \n     the financial issues just described. The most important items \n     on this list are: (1) treatment of pending claims and \n     bankruptcies; (2) subrogation of workers' compensation \n     payments; and (3) the venue of any revision to the tort \n     system as a vehicle for ``sunset'' in the event that the fund \n     becomes insufficient to make the required payments to \n     victims. But if the claims values, projections and funding \n     issues can be resolved, I believe that these latter issues \n     would fall into place.\n       I am encouraged by the joint statement made today by \n     Senator Frist and Senator Daschle that they ``are committed \n     to working together to determine whether a compromise can be \n     reached that would provide sufficient payments to asbestos \n     victims and certainty to companies.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday Secretary Abraham of the \nDepartment of Energy announced that Oak Ridge National Laboratory in my \nhome State of Tennessee was selected the winner of the Department of \nEnergy's competition to develop a leadership class computational \nfacility.\n  To put that in plain English, that means the Oak Ridge Laboratory, \nbeing one of the most famous names in science in the world, will lead \nan effort that includes many of the brightest minds in our country to \ntry to regain leadership in high-speed and advanced computing for the \nUnited States of America.\n  Oak Ridge, because of this competition, will receive $25 million in \nfunding from the Department of Energy this year for developing this \nleadership class facility, and the Department has requested an \nadditional $25 million for this activity for next year.\n  Secretary Abraham's decision will put the United States back in the \nleadership position in high-performance computing by supporting the \ndevelopment of a 50-teraflop high-end computing facility capable of \nperforming 50 trillion calculations per second.\n  Why is that important to us? It will permit us in this country to \naddress many scientific problems. For example, we have great debates in \nthis Chamber about global warming and climate change. We base a lot of \nimportant policy decisions about clean air regulations--decisions that \ncost us money--on what is happening in the Earth's climate. This high-\nend, advanced computing will help us simulate the Earth's climate and \nhave better science upon which to make our policy decisions about \nglobal warming.\n  High-performance computing is also required to model and simulate the \nplasma phenomena to examine whether fusion power can become a reality. \nWe have enormous debates, and we have not resolved the energy picture. \nIf fusion were an option, we would have a completely different energy \npicture in the world today because it would offer the promise of \nvirtually no-cost or low-cost energy for people all around the world. \nNanoscience has the possibility of revolutionizing chemistry and \nmaterials sciences. Yet the full benefit of nanoscience may not be \nachieved without detailed simulation of quantum interactions.\n\n  Advanced manufacturing: We have great debates in this Chamber about \nhow to keep our manufacturing jobs from moving overseas. One way to do \nthat is to lower manufacturing costs and advance our technology, and we \nshould be able to do that. Having advanced computing would help us do \nit.\n  I was in Japan about a month ago. One of my purposes for going there \nwas to get a briefing on what Japan calls the Earth Simulator. The \nEarth Simulator is Japan's high-speed, advanced computing technology. \nIt is currently 2.5 times more powerful than anything else in the \nworld. It has held this distinction for 2 years. The United States is \nnot No. 1 in advanced computing; Japan is. Two years is a very long \ntime to hold the top spot in the computing field.\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\n  We are very fortunate Japan is one of the strongest allies we have on \nthis Earth. With our scientists working with Japan's scientists, we \nwill have an opportunity to learn more about climate together and more \nabout manufacturing together.\n  But the United States needs to be first in high-speed advanced \ncomputing. It is one of the critical science fields in which we need to \nbe the world's leader. This is because high-performance computing \nproduces scientific discoveries which were once thought only possible \nthrough experimentation.\n  In other words, instead of actually doing the scientific experiments, \nwe simulate those experiments with high-speed, advanced computers and \nare able to do calculations scientists once thought never would be \npossible.\n  The $25 million in funding that was announced yesterday will put the \nOak Ridge National Laboratory and all of its associates at laboratories \nand universities around America working together on a path to deliver a \nsupercomputer with a sustained performance of 50 trillion calculations \nper second.\n  With the Secretary's announcement, the Cray computer will be expanded \nto exceed sustained performance of the Earth Simulator.\n  In other words, what is happening in Oak Ridge, if we stay on this \npath, will put us ahead of Japan's Earth Simulator, and the performance \nof this Cray architecture at Oak Ridge will be evaluated by the Oak \nRidge scientists on a host of problems, including climate science, \nmaterials science, chemistry, astrophysics, and fusion. The decision by \nthe Secretary is very timely.\n  Recently, on May 3, the New York Times published a front-page article \nstating the United States is losing its dominance in the sciences. This \narticle basically points out the foreign advances in basic science \nrival or exceed those of U.S. scientists. Japan's Earth Simulator was \none of the best examples of our loss of scientific leadership.\n  The article stated impacts of the advances in other countries can be \nseen by the increases in U.S. patents that are held by foreign \ncompanies, and the dominance of foreign scientists in publishing \narticles in the physical sciences and the reduction in the number of \nU.S. recipients of Nobel Prizes. These changes need to be understood.\n  Since World War II, at least half our jobs in the United States of \nAmerica have come because of advances in science and technology. We are \nentering an even more competitive era. We are entering it at a time--I \nwas thinking about this while I was in Japan--when our country and \nJapan, those two countries, have 43 to 45 percent of all the gross \ndomestic product in the world. We are 5 percent of the people in the \nworld, and we have a third of the dollars. Add Japan to that, and we \nare 43 to 45 percent; those two countries have 43 to 45 percent of the \ndollars.\n  We are not going to keep our standard of living even in a world that \ngrows greatly in wealth unless we have some secret weapon. That secret \nweapon has to be brainpower, computer power, and scientific power. Our \nsecret weapons are our national laboratories and our great research \nuniversities. That has been true before and it is true for the future.\n  Some have suggested the current administration, the Bush \nadministration, has neglected basic research. I think we need to put \nthis in context. The Bush administration and this Congress have \nfollowed through with the effort to double the funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. The NIH budget increased nearly 44 percent from \n2000 to 2003.\n  Furthermore, since coming into office, President Bush has \nsignificantly increased funding for the National Science Foundation. \nThat science budget increased by a factor of nearly 27 percent in the \nlast 3 years. But despite these accomplishments by the Bush \nadministration and by this Congress and the previous Congress, the \nphysical sciences and engineering fields historically have been \nneglected. This systemic neglect has occurred for more than a decade.\n  The Department of Energy's Office of Sciences is the largest \nsupporter of basic research in physical sciences and engineering.\n  While this office and its predecessor are responsible for many of our \nscientific advances, including significant contributions to mapping the \nhuman genome, the office has largely been neglected over the last 10 \nyears. In fact, when adjusting for inflation, the Office of Science \nreceived more funding in 1992 than it has in any other year over the \npast 12 years. The most significant decline in funding for the Office \nof Science occurred during the Clinton administration.\n  So let's spread the blame all around, and let's spread the credit, \ntoo. We have done a good job in funding the health sciences. We have \ndone a good job at the National Science Foundation. We have done a poor \njob on the physical sciences. Our future depends on the physical \nsciences just as much, maybe more, than it does on the other sciences.\n  Our great research universities, our national laboratories, and our \nindustry leaders have urged the funding for the physical sciences and \nthat engineering be brought to parity with that of the life and medical \nsciences. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology \nmade the same recommendation last year.\n  Some argue we cannot expect to be the leader in every field. That is \ncorrect, but we need to be among the world leaders in most fields and \nneed to lead in some fields. One of those critical fields is high-\nperformance computers. Computing is seen by many as the third pillar of \nscience--right after theory and experimentation. Secretary Abraham's \nannouncement is the first step in developing and sustaining our \nNation's leadership in high-performance computers.\n  I have sponsored the High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004 \nalong with Senator Bingaman. This would authorize the Secretary to \ncarry out research and development to keep our Nation on the forefront \nof high-performance computing. The act authorizes the Energy Secretary \nto establish scientific computing facilities and would authorize a \nminimum of $100 million per year for 5 years to establish these \nfacilities. It would authorize the Secretary to establish a high-end \nsoftware development center and would authorize a minimum of $10 \nmillion a year for 5 years for this activity. If we want to regain the \nlead in high-speed computing, high-performance computing, this is what \nwe must do. We know exactly how to do it. We have the laboratories to \ndo it. We have the research universities to do it. Oak Ridge has now \nbeen selected as the coordinator of that effort. If we fund it, we will \nregain it. It is up to us to do it.\n  I have also sponsored the Energy and Scientific Research Investment \nAct of 2003 with Senators Levin, Warner, and Bingaman. This would \nessentially double funding for the Department of Energy Office of \nScience to keep our Nation among the leaders of science. The \nauthorizations for this bill became part of the Energy bill.\n  We must act to put our Nation back at the forefront of science. We \nhave a lot of discussions in the Senate. Most of them have to do with \nour high standard of living. They take for granted the fact that we \nlive in an increasingly well-educated world and that most of our \nability to maintain that standard of living has to do with whether we \nhave good schools, whether we have great universities, and whether we \nhave great energy laboratories.\n  We talk about outsourcing. In Europe, the outsourcing they talk about \nis the outsourcing of brains being attracted by our universities and \nour national laboratories. Mr. Schroeder in Germany and Mr. Blair in \nGreat Britain are challenging their higher education system because \nthey are falling behind our higher education system.\n  Our research universities and our national laboratories are our \nsecret weapons for our national defense, for our standard of living, \nand for our improved health care. They have been for 50 years, and they \nwill be in the future.\n  I am delighted to see the Secretary of Energy has made his decision \nto center an attempt to regain the lead for the United States in \nadvanced computing facilities by focusing that effort at Oak Ridge. \nHowever, I hope this Congress on both sides of the aisle will now begin \nto pay attention to proper funding of the physical science over the \nnext 5 years. We should double it, as we have doubled funding for the \nhealth sciences. If we do so, it is the surest path to maintaining our \nstandard of living, our national defense and our health care.\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the article from the New York Times to which \nI refer from Monday, May 3, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         United States Is Losing Its Dominance in the Sciences\n\n                         (By William J. Broad)\n\n       The United States has started to lose its worldwide \n     dominance in critical areas of science and innovation, \n     according to federal and private experts who point to strong \n     evidence like prizes awarded to Americans and the number of \n     papers in major professional journals.\n       Foreign advances in basic science now often rival or even \n     exceed America's, apparently with little public awareness of \n     the trend or its implications for jobs, industry, national \n     security or the vigor of the nation's intellectual and \n     cultural life.\n       ``The rest of the world is catching up,'' said John E. \n     Jankowski, a senior analyst at the National Science \n     Foundation, the federal agency that tracks science trends. \n     ``Science excellence is no longer the domain of just the \n     U.S.''\n       Even analysts worried by the trend concede that an \n     expansion of the world's brain trust, with new approaches, \n     could invigorate the fight against disease, develop new \n     sources of energy and wrestle with knotty environmental \n     problems. But profits from the breakthroughs are likely to \n     stay overseas, and this country will face competition for \n     things like hiring scientific talent and getting space to \n     showcase its work in top journals.\n       One area of international competition involves patents. \n     Americans still win large numbers of them, but the percentage \n     is falling as foreigners, especially Asians, have become more \n     active and in some fields have seized the innovation lead. \n     The United States' share of its own industrial patents has \n     fallen steadily over the decades and now stands at 52 \n     percent.\n       A more concrete decline can be seen in published research. \n     Physical Review, a series of top physics journals, recently \n     tracked a reversal in which American papers, in two decades, \n     fell from the most to a minority. Last year the total was \n     just 29 percent, down from 61 percent in 1983.\n       China, said Martin Blume, the journals' editor, has surged \n     ahead by submitting more than 1,000 papers a year. ``Other \n     scientific publishers are seeing the same kind of thing,'' he \n     added.\n       Another downturn centers on the Nobel Prizes, an icon of \n     scientific excellence. Traditionally, the United States, \n     powered by heavy federal investments in basic research, the \n     kind that pursues fundamental questions of nature, dominated \n     the awards.\n       But the American share, after peaking from the 1960's \n     through the 1990's, has fallen in the 2000's to about half, \n     51 percent. The rest went to Britain, Japan, Russia, Germany, \n     Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand.\n       ``We are in a new world, and it's increasingly going to be \n     dominated by countries other than the United States,'' Denis \n     Simon, dean of management and technology at the Rensselaer \n     Polytechnic Institute, recently said at a scientific meeting \n     in Washington.\n       Europe and Asia are ascendant, analysts say, even if their \n     achievements go unnoticed in the United States. In March, for \n     example, European scientists announced that one of their \n     planetary probes had detected methane in the atmosphere of \n     Mars--a possible sign that alien microbes live beneath the \n     planet's surface. The finding made headlines from Paris to \n     Melbourne. But most Americans, bombarded with images from \n     American's own rovers successfully exploring the red planet, \n     missed the foreign news.\n       More aggressively, Europe is seeking to dominate particle \n     physics by building the world's most powerful atom smasher, \n     set for its debut in 2007. Its circular tunnel is 17 miles \n     around.\n       Sciene analysts say Asia's push for excellence promises to \n     be even more challenging.\n       ``It's unbelievable,'' Diana Hicks, chairwoman of the \n     school of public policy at the Georgia Institute of \n     Technology, said of Asia's growth in science and technical \n     innovation. ``It's amazing to see these output numbers of \n     papers and patents going up so fast.''\n       Analysts say comparative American declines are an \n     inevitable result of rising standards of living around the \n     globe.\n       ``It's all in the ebb and flow of globalization,'' said \n     Jack Fritz, a senior officer at the National Academy of \n     Engineering, an advisory body to the federal government. He \n     called the declines ``the next big thing we will have to \n     adjust to.''\n       The rapidly changing American status has not gone unnoticed \n     by politicians, with Democrats on the attack and the White \n     House on the defensive.\n       ``We stand at a pivotal moment,'' Tom Daschle, the Senate \n     Democratic leader, recently said at a policy forum in \n     Washington at the American Association for the Advancement of \n     Science, the nation's top general science group. ``For all \n     our past successes, there are disturbing signs that America's \n     dominant position in the scientific world is being shaken.''\n       Mr. Daschle accused the Bush administration of weakening \n     the nation's science base by failing to provide enough money \n     for cutting-edge research.\n       The president's science adviser, John H. Marburger III, who \n     attended the forum, strongly denied that charge, saying in an \n     interview that overall research budgets during the Bush \n     administration have soared to record highs and that the \n     science establishment is strong.\n       ``The sky is not falling on science,'' Dr. Marburger said. \n     ``Maybe there are some clouds--no, things that need \n     attention.'' Any problems, he added, are within the power of \n     the United States to deal with in a way that maintains the \n     vitality of the research enterprise.\n       Analysts say Mr. Daschle and Dr. Marburger can both supply \n     data that supports their positions.\n       A major question, they add, is whether big spending \n     automatically translates into big rewards, as it did in the \n     past. During the cold war, the government pumped more than $1 \n     trillion into research, with a wealth of benefits including \n     lasers, longer life expectancies, men on the Moon and the \n     prestige of many Nobel Prizes.\n       Today, federal research budgets are still at record highs; \n     this year more than $126 billion has been allocated to \n     research. Moreover American industry makes extensive use of \n     federal research in producing its innovations and adds its \n     own vast sums of money, the combination dwarfing that of any \n     other nation or bloc.\n       But the edifice is less formidable than it seems in part \n     because of the nation's costly and unique military role. This \n     year, financing for military research hit $66 billion, higher \n     in fixed dollars than in the cold war and far higher than in \n     any other country.\n       For all the spending, the United States began to experience \n     a number of scientific declines in the 1990's, boom years for \n     the nation's overall economy.\n       For instance, scientific papers by Americans peaked in 1992 \n     and then fell roughly 10 percent, the National Science \n     Foundation reports. Why? Many analysts point to rising \n     foreign competition, as does the European Commission, which \n     also monitors global science trends. In a study last year, \n     the commission said Europe surpassed the United States in the \n     mid-1990's as the world's largest producer of scientific \n     literature.\n       Dr. Hicks of Georgia Tech said that American scientists, \n     when top journals reject their papers, usually have no idea \n     that rising foreign competition may be to blame.\n       On another front, the numbers of new doctorates in the \n     sciences peaked in 1998 and then fell 5 percent the next \n     year, a loss of more than 1,300 new scientists, according to \n     the foundation.\n       A minor exodus also hit one of the hidden strengths of \n     American science: vast ranks of bright foreigners. In a \n     significant shift of demographics, they began to leave in \n     what experts call a reverse brain drain. After peaking in the \n     mid-1990's, the number of doctoral students from China, India \n     and Taiwan with plans to stay in the United States began to \n     fall by the hundreds, according to the foundation.\n       These declines are important, analysts say, because new \n     scientific knowledge is an engine of the American economy and \n     technical innovation, its influence evident in everything \n     from potent drugs to fast computer chips.\n       Patents are a main way that companies and inventors reap \n     commercial rewards from their ideas and stay competitive in \n     the marketplace while improving the lives of millions.\n       Foreigners outside the United States are playing an \n     increasingly important role in these expressions of \n     industrial creativity. In a recent study, CHI Research, a \n     consulting firm in Haddon Heights, NJ., found that \n     researchers in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea now account for \n     more than a quarter of all United States industrial patents \n     awarded each year, generating revenue for their own countries \n     and limiting it in the United States.\n       Moreover, their growth rates are rapid. Between 1980 and \n     2003, South Korea went from 0 to 2 percent of the total, \n     Taiwan from 0 to 3 percent and Japan from 12 to 21 percent.\n       ``It's not just lots of patents,'' Francis Narin, CHI's \n     president, said of the Asian rise. ``It's lots of good \n     patents that have a high impact,'' as measured by how often \n     subsequent patents cite them.\n       Recently, Dr. Narin added, both Taiwan and Singapore surged \n     ahead of the United States in the overall number of \n     citations. Singapore's patents include ones in chemicals, \n     semi-conductors, electronics and industrial tools.\n       China represents the next wave, experts agree, its \n     scientific rise still too fresh to show up in most statistics \n     but already apparent. Dr. Simon of Rensselaer said that about \n     400 foreign companies had recently set up research centers in \n     China, with General Electric, for instance, doing important \n     work there on medical scanners, which means fewer skilled \n     jobs in America.\n       Ross Armbrecht, president of the Industrial Research \n     Institute, a non-profit group in Washington that represents \n     large American companies, said businesses were going to China \n     not just because of low costs but to take advantage of \n     China's growing scientific excellence.\n       ``It's frightening,'' Dr. Armbrecht said. ``But you've got \n     to go where the horses are.'' An eventual danger, he added, \n     is the slow loss of intellectual property as local \n     professionals start their own businesses with what they have \n     learned from American companies.\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n       For the United States, future trends look challenging, many \n     analysts say.\n       In a report last month, the American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science said the Bush administration, to live \n     up to its pledge to halve the nation's budget deficit in the \n     next five years, would cut research financing at 21 of 24 \n     federal agencies--all those that do or finance science except \n     those involved in space and national and domestic security.\n       More troubling to some experts is the likelihood of an \n     accelerating loss of quality scientists. Applications from \n     foreign graduate students to research universities are down \n     by a quarter, experts say, partly because of the federal \n     government's tightening of visas after the 2001 terrorist \n     attacks.\n       Shirley Ann Jackson, president of the American Association \n     for the Advancement of Science, told the recent forum \n     audience that the drop in foreign students, the apparently \n     declining interest of young Americans in science careers and \n     the aging of the technical work force were, taken together, a \n     perilous combination of developments.\n       ``Who,'' she asked, ``will do the science of this \n     millennium?''\n       Several private groups, including the Council on \n     Competitiveness, an organization in Washington that seeks \n     policies to promote industrial vigor, have begun to agitate \n     for wide debate and action.\n       ``Many other countries have realized that science and \n     technology are key to economic growth and prosperity,'' said \n     Jennifer Bond, the council's vice president for international \n     affairs. ``They're catching up to us,'' she said, warning \n     Americans not to ``rest on our laurels.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed \nto extend my remarks of 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5457-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5457-S5459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point. A lot of exercises \nare going on with respect to Brown v. Board of Education. Most of the \ncomments, of course, are lamenting the fact we have not proceeded too \nfar, or sufficiently, with respect to the integration of public \neducation in America.\n  That misses the point. The point is this decision itself more or less \nremoved the lid off the punch bowl of segregation and allowed all \nAmericans, regardless of race, creed, or color, to become, for the \nfirst time, full Americans, full citizens. Yes, if you please, Rosa \nParks could know, in not moving from that front seat in the bus, down \nin Montgomery in 1955 after the 1954 Brown decision, that she was a \nfull citizen, she was a full American. That in and of itself is the \nreal significance of this history-making decision in the last century. \nIt certainly is the most significant judicial decision of that century \nin that it amended the Constitution and gave us pride, all of us, in \nfull citizenship in this land.\n  I rise because of the emphasis nationally with respect to the Brown \ncase, while the truth is the leading case was from the State of South \nCarolina. In December of 1952, the arguments before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, let the record show that Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for \nthe NAACP, did not argue the Brown case; he argued the Briggs v. \nElliott case of South Carolina. This is not to take in any sense away \nfrom the Kansas situation, but everyone should realize the State of \nKansas had only a 7-percent minority population. People did not \nunderstand that. There was a law to the effect that all cities in \nexcess of 15,000 population could either opt for segregated schools or \nfor integrated schools. Under that particular law, it more or less \ndevolved down to where the elementary schools were segregated and the \nsecondary schools were integrated. But it was not a matter of societal \nsignificance--so much so that, in essence, the State of Kansas had \nalready decided not even to argue the case before the Supreme Court. \nThey were going to just submit it on written briefs.\n  I speak advisedly. I was not the lawyer in the Briggs v. Elliott \ncase. I was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court when we \nmade our arguments in December 1952. I was sent at the last minute by \nGovernor James Francis Byrnes, who formally occupied this desk as a \nSenator, as did John C. Calhoun, and Governor Byrnes said: Fritz, you \nwrote that 3-percent sales tax for the schools that we enacted in 1951 \nunder his leadership. He said: You know all the elements of the \nequalization of the teachers' pay, the transportation, and the \nconstruction of public schools in South Carolina. You know that issue \nof separate but equal, how we equalized everything and what we had done \nto the extent of over 3-percent sales tax to finance it and everything \nelse, so it was real and not just what we intended. He said: You have \nto go up there with Robert McC. Figg, the active counsel at the local \nlevel in Briggs against Elliot, and with John W. Davis, former \nSolicitor General, candidate for President in 1924. According to \nGovernor Byrnes, a former associate justice who sat on the Supreme \nCourt, the constitutional mind of the legal profession is John W. Davis \nof West Virginia. I have called him and he is going to make the \narguments pro bono for the State of South Carolina that he believes so \nvehemently in Plessy vs. Ferguson, the 1896 decision of the Supreme \nCourt that enunciated the separate but equal doctrine. That was my \nparticipation.\n  Let me go back to the earliest part because that is the real \nsignificance of this change in our culture, society, and Constitution.\n  It was back in 1947 that a group in Summerton, SC, which is in \nClarendon County, and had gotten together an old, discarded bus. Levi \nPearson was the principal mechanic. He fixed the engine and got that \nbus all ready to go. They went to the school board for a little \ngasoline money. The school board said: No, we are not giving you any \ngasoline money. They said: Well, you have it for the White children. \nThey have the money. We have to walk to the Scotts Branch School--which \nwas a 9-mile walk for some of them--down a dirt road.\n  We get this big yellow bus full of White children passing us in the \ndust or in the rain--whichever of the two. They said: And we just fixed \nup the bus. It won't cost you anything.\n  They said: No. You folks don't pay taxes and we don't have any money \nfor gasoline for you to have a ride to school.\n  When you hear this, you begin to understand the significance of the \nchange in our society and what we call equal rights under the law. That \nis somewhere along the ceiling up here.\n  So Pearson got together with Rev. Joseph De Laine. Reverend De Laine \nwas an AME preacher and also a schoolteacher, and later a \nsuperintendent. They went up to Columbia and they got the case going. \nOn a technicality, if you please--they found out the plaintiff in the \ncase lived just over the line. His children were attending school in \nthe district where the case was brought, but on a technical thing they \nhad it thrown out. They could always find something to prohibit any \nkind of relief for the African Americans at that particular time.\n  So Reverend De Laine went and talked, in Columbia, to James M. \nHinton, the NAACP director. He said: Look, Reverend, if you go down to \nSummerton and you get 20 plaintiffs, I can get that lawyer Marshall, up \nthere in Washington, DC, to bring a class action.\n  So Reverend De Laine came back down to Summerton, got the 20 parents, \nand some 46 children, and that gives the genesis of the famous \n``Summerton 66.'' Anywhere you talk, in the African-American community \nin America, they know of that ``Summerton 66.'' Mind you me, this \nstarted 8 years before Rosa Parks.\n  Incidentally, and I am grateful to the Senate, they unanimously \nendorsed the Congressional Gold Medal for Levi Pearson, for Harry and \nEliza Briggs, as well as for Rev. Joseph De Laine. That is one of the \nreasons why this afternoon, when we are not too busy, I am speaking. I \nhad intended to speak on Monday, which is May 17, the actual 50-year \nanniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, but I have to be at an \nevent in South Carolina. I do not know that I will get back in time.\n  But be that as it may, it is important that the record be made about \nthese valiant Americans who changed history.\n  When they got there, sure enough, Thurgood Marshall took up the case. \nThen, as the expression goes, all hell broke loose. I could go into the \ndetails, but that is why I speak without notes. I could tell you just \nwhen and where and how Reverend De Laine's home was shot, and later it \nwas burned. He escaped to a church down in Lake City\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nsome 35 miles away, where, again, his church was burned and he escaped \nwith his life, never to return to the State of South Carolina. They \nheld a warrant out on him for 45 years. He had fired back at the car \nthe first time when they shot his home in order to identify the car, \nbut he never got a chance. They held on to the warrant on him for some \n45 years.\n  Harry Briggs, the plaintiff, he ran a filling station there in \nSummerton. Nobody would buy gas from him anymore. He escaped down to \nFlorida to make a living with his wife. Others who were just dirt \nfarmers there could not, all of a sudden, buy seed to plant. They lost \ntheir livelihoods and everything of that kind.\n  I could go down throughout the years. They stuck with it for a good \n5- or 6-year period, until that decision was made. Every pressure in \nthe Lord's world was made to try to threaten, coerce, and make them \nremove their names from that particular petition. But the famous \n``Summerton 66''--the 20 parents and 46 kids--stuck with it, and they \nmade history.\n\n  When I came to Washington, it was on a Saturday morning. Robert McC. \nFigg, a distinguished lawyer--a Columbia University law graduate--had \nhandled the case at the local level under Judge Waring in the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. We came up, obviously, on the appeal of the \nNAACP and Thurgood Marshall. We got here on a Saturday morning. You \nwill begin to understand what we learned, to our shock, that our Briggs \nv. Elliott case, the lead case, all of a sudden had been set aside, and \nthe lead case was made Brown v. the Board of Education in Topeka. Roy \nWilkins was a friend of the Solicitor General, and they moved the case \nup because they knew that Kansas was not really disturbed and did not \nhave a strong case one way or the other; it could care less. That was \nproved by that they were not going to even send an attorney to argue \nthe case.\n  I will never forget, on a Saturday afternoon and evening, Governor \nByrnes was on the line with the Governor of Kansas, finally persuading \nhim to send someone. Late on Sunday evening they sent Paul Wilson--an \nAssistant Attorney General. They did not send the Attorney General or \nanybody to handle it; they sent the Assistant Attorney General, and we \nhelped brief him over at the Wardman Park.\n  But I am getting ahead of my story. This morning I noticed in the \nWashington Post a Brown v. Board of Education decision whereby it is \nquoted that Thurgood Marshall thought that once they had won on May 17, \n1954, there would be complete integration within 5 years. Absolutely \nwrong. False. I know, and the reason I know is because we were at Union \nStation here in the District. We were having breakfast--that is Dean \nFigg, who was later the dean of our law school--Dean Figg and myself. \nAnd in walked Mr. Marshall. He sat down and they began to exchange \nstories. Incidentally, they had the highest respect for each other. \nThey got along. I will never forget when they were hanging a portrait \nof Jimmy Byrnes over in the Supreme Court, and Figg came in the doorway \nand Associate Justice Marshall hugged him and almost lifted him off the \nfloor. And all the other Justices wondered what in the world was going \non. They thought the world of each other.\n\n  Thurgood Marshall turned and said: Now, Bob, let's assume I have won \nthe case. How long do you think before there will be any real \nintegration?\n  And I will never forget it. Figg said: Thurgood, you are not going to \nlike my answer, but it is going to be a good 25 years before there is \nany real integration.\n  Marshall looked at him and said: No, you're wrong. It will be nearer \n50 years.\n  And here we are today, 50 years later, where the Scott's Branch \nSchool in the Briggs v. Elliott case is still 95-percent segregated. \nWhen that decision came out on May 17, we had 16 private schools in my \nlittle State of South Carolina. Now we have 372 private schools. Do you \nknow why charter schools, tax credits, all that there malarkey is \ncoming along? That is the drive to finance segregation. That is all it \nis. And they all know it. But you don't see that printed.\n  We ought to test this to see how the schools can work.\n  I wish they would go back to Horace Mann, when the greatness of \nAmerica was public education, where all people of all classes and \ncreeds were all put together, and they came and studied and graduated \ntogether and became one strong society. That is why I cosponsored the \ndraft, yes, on the inequality of those who have to serve, but more than \nanything else, the strength of the draft itself in the building of \nAmerica.\n  There was another story that some will say is not politically \ncorrect, but I will never forget Marshall turned to Figg, and he said: \nBy the way, Bob, you know--at that time they were referred to not as \nAfrican Americans--that Negro family in Cicero, they are having near \nriots and everything else like that. So he said: Do you know what I had \nto do? I had to go down to Springfield and see Governor Adlai \nStevenson. I got Governor Stevenson to send that family back to \nMississippi for safekeeping. And he said: But for Heaven's sake, don't \ntell anybody that. That will ruin me.\n  I said: Thurgood, don't tell anybody I am eating breakfast with you. \nI will never get elected to another office.\n  I was a young Speaker pro tempore back over 50 years ago in 1952. Now \nwe Democrats are begging to eat breakfast with African Americans, but \nnot then. Oh, no. You folks in this Chamber have to understand the \nchanges that have come about over America.\n  But be that as it may, when we left that morning after breakfast, we \nfound out that they had moved that case up for known reasons, and we \nhad to fight all weekend to get Wilson. And Wilson teed off on Monday \nmorning as the first argument in Brown against the board. He literally \nshocked the other side because he made a splendid argument. There were \n3 days of arguments.\n  Fred Vinson was the Chief Justice at the time. All of the lawyers \nwere talking about the value of association under the Vinson decision \nof Sweatt v. Painter and making appeals, knowing that the court would \nonce again confirm Plessy v. Ferguson.\n  Governor Byrnes, incidentally, told me: Don't worry about that case. \nI have talked to some friends up there.\n  He wouldn't want to say he talked to the Court. He said: I talked to \nsome friends, and we will win that case. And there is no question that \nthey probably would have.\n  But what happened was that a few months later, Chief Justice Vinson \npassed away and Earl Warren was appointed Chief Justice. That changed \nhistory because Warren said: Come back and don't argue.\n  So Warren made us come back, reargue not separate but equal, but the \nfundamental that segregation in and of itself was unconstitutional.\n  So we went back and we reargued that case. On May 17, a unanimous \ncourt decision came down which changed America. There is no question in \nmy mind that was for the good. I had my doubts at that particular time. \nStill as a young southern politician, I said: Good gosh, how are we \ngoing to do this?\n  Well, it is very interesting. Thurgood Marshall, Bob Figg, Roy \nWilkins, the NAACP lawyers, they all got together. And the Court, on \nMay 17, said: desegregate with all deliberate speed. So Wilkins and \nMarshall had agreed to this--they said what we will do is the first \nyear we will integrate the first grade. The second year we will \nintegrate the first grade again, and of course the second grade is \nalready integrated, then on up the line over a 12-year period, and we \nwill have, with all deliberate speed, all the elementary grades \nintegrated, beginning with the little ones playing together.\n  That was Marshall's answer to Felix Frankfurter when Frankfurter \nasked him: What happens when you have won your case? What happens?\n  He said: Well, the little children, if Your Honor please, who play \ntogether and go off to separate schools will come back and play \ntogether, and they will have freedom of choice. They can go to whatever \nschool they want. What we are trying to remove is the State-imposed \nseparation of race in public education.\n  Our Constitution and the law of South Carolina, unlike Kansas, which \nwas local option, our Constitution and law required separate but equal.\n  We had it all worked out until the lawyer up in New York for the \nNAACP said: No, sir. We are not going to be\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\ngiven our constitutional rights on the installment plan.\n  And the rest is history. We had the white citizens councils on the \none hand. We had Martin Luther King, Jr., and burn baby burn on the \nother hand. And we literally had some 20 years--Malcolm X and \neverything else of that kind--of trauma, upset, burning here in \nWashington. I will never forget the riots in 1968. It has been quite a \nhistory over that period of time.\n  What has happened is not integrated public education. That is agreed \nto. But it really made legitimate Rosa Parks and everybody else coming \nsouth, the freedom riders and everything else like that. For the first \ntime officially everyone became a full citizen under the Constitution \nand under the law in America on May 17, 1954.\n  So we made a lot of progress in the United States since that time. It \nwas done through the valiant effort of the Summerton 66 that literally \nlost their lives--one was attributed to having lost his life as a \nresult of the discord. But whatever it might be, Reverend De Laine \ncould not return to South Carolina. The United States Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives unanimously have agreed now to present them \nthe Congressional Gold Medal.\n  It had been my hope that next Monday afternoon, May 17, we would have \na ceremony in the Rotunda, but we will look forward to the time later \nthis year when we can honor Reverend De Laine, Harry and Eliza Briggs, \nand Levi Pearson, who really understood the Constitution in America \nbetter than this particular Senator, who at that time was only a \nfledgling Democratic politician. That is the history. I will be glad to \ngo into it sometime with my colleagues about some of the arguments \nmade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, did I hear the Senator say that the first \narguments took 3 days?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Three days, yes.\n  Mr. REID. Now, in the Supreme Court, if you get an hour, you are \nlucky.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right, it took 3 days. I will never forget, \nHenry Fonda was over at the National Theater, and I was sitting right \ninside the rail with John W. Davis and Mr. Briggs right at the table, \nand I got Fonda to sit up there with me during the 3 days. He didn't \nleave. He wanted to hear all the arguments. That was in December of \n1952.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, what a great history \nlesson we had today. We have only heard a short bit of the knowledge of \nthe Senator from South Carolina. The Senator from South Carolina was \none of the originals who decided things were not the way they should be \nin the South. He has been able to work through the process and stand \nfor what he believed, and because of this, the people of South Carolina \nhave elected him time after time. It is obvious why. He is a man who is \na World War II combat veteran, someone we admire so much. We are all \ndisappointed that he has indicated he is not going to seek reelection. \nIt is a disappointment to me.\n  I cannot express in words what a role model he has been for me. Not \nonly can he stand and speak, as he did today, about the most serious \nsubjects that face the world, but he has one of the best senses of \nhumor of anyone I have dealt with.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5459-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AWARDING MEDALS TO SERVICE MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we don't have anybody from the majority in \nthe Chamber. I want to reiterate what I said earlier in the day. We are \nbasically in morning business today. There is no legislative business \non the floor. Senator Bingaman--I am speaking for him and for everyone \non this side of the aisle--badly wants to do Calendar No. 507, H.R. \n3104 on the Calendar of Business, which is a piece of legislation to \nprovide for the establishment of separate campaign medals to be awarded \nto members of the uniformed services who participated in Operation \nEnduring Freedom in Afghanistan and members of the uniformed services \nwho participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom, of course, in Iraq. I \ncannot imagine why we cannot do this bill, which passed the House \nunanimously.\n  I hear on the other side that ``we are trying to clear it.'' What in \nthe world does that mean? Is somebody opposing bringing this bill to \nthe floor? The problem we have is that the day is winding down. As we \nall know, people have things to do in their States and around the \ncountry. They are going to be leaving. If we don't get something within \nthe next 35 minutes or so, there won't be enough Senators here to allow \na vote to take place.\n  So, again, I say to the majority, why can we not do this piece of \nlegislation? It is something Senator Bingaman has worked on for more \nthan a year. It is important legislation, something we should do. I am \nterribly disappointed that I am told they are trying to clear it. I \ndon't understand what that means. Clear what? Is someone going to vote \nagainst medals for people who participated in those two theaters of \nwar? Is it just because it is Senator Bingaman's idea. I don't know \nwhat it is. I hope we get real and move forward on this legislation. I \napologize for making my friends wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, here we go again, rushing to give aid and \ncomfort to our enemies--pushing, pulling, shoving, and leaping over one \nanother to assign blame and point the finger at ``America the \nterrible,'' lining up in long lines at the microphones to offer \napologies to those poor, pitiful Iraqi prisoners.\n  Of course, I do not condone all the things that went on in that \nprison, but I for one refuse to join in this national act of contrition \nover it. Those who are wringing their hands and shouting so loudly for \nheads to roll over this seem to have conveniently overlooked the fact \nthat someone's head has rolled, that of another innocent American \nbrutally murdered by terrorists.\n  Why is it there is more indignation over a photo of a prisoner with \nunderwear on his head than over the video of a young American with no \nhead at all? Why is it some in this country still do not get it, that \nwe are at war, a war against terrorists who are plotting to kill us \nevery day, terrorists who will murder Americans at any time, anyplace, \nany chance they get.\n  Yet here we are, America on its knees in front of our enemy, begging \nfor their forgiveness over the mistreatment of prisoners, showing our \nenemy and the world once again how easily America can get sidetracked, \nhow easily America can turn against itself.\n  Yes, a handful of soldiers went too far with their interrogation. \nClearly some of them were not properly trained to handle such duty, but \nthe way to deal with this is with swift and sure punishment and \nimmediate and better training.\n  There also needs to be more careful screening of who it is we put in \nthese kinds of sensitive situations--and no one wants to hear this, and \nI am reluctant to say it, but there should also be some serious \nquestioning of having male and female soldiers serving side by side in \nthese kinds of military missions. Instead, I worry that the HWA, the \n``hand wringers of America,'' will add to their membership and continue \nto bash our country ad nauseam and, in doing so, hand over more \ninnocent Americans to the enemy on a silver platter.\n  So I stand with Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma who stated that he is more \noutraged by the outrage than by the treatment of those prisoners. More \noutraged by the outrage, that is a good way of putting it. That is \nexactly how this Senator from Georgia feels.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5459-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5459-S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING OUR SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong hope that we \ncan get agreement today to move ahead\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nwith H.R. 3104 and pass that legislation before we adjourn this week. \nThis is legislation which has passed the House unanimously and has come \nover to the Senate. In my opinion, this should now pass the Senate and \ngo to the President for signature. This is legislation that would honor \nthose service men and women in Iraq and in Afghanistan who have served \ntheir country there or continue to serve there.\n  Obviously, over the last couple of weeks the reputation of our \nmilitary has been stained by the horrific events at Abu Ghraib prison \nand every level of our military has been affected by the actions of the \nfew who have been identified. I think all of us are looking to see the \nextent of the problem. All of us are anxious to ensure the problem does \nnot continue in the future.\n  At this point, it is important to recognize and honor the thousands \nof fighting men and women who serve this Nation every day with \ncommitment, courage, integrity, and professionalism both in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan.\n  That is the purpose of the legislation I am urging us to bring up and \nto pass today. We have a Senate version of this same bill that has been \nintroduced. It has 24 cosponsors. I have introduced this legislation \nwith Senators Lugar and Lott, Landrieu, Inhofe, Gregg, Johnson, \nRockefeller, Pryor, Reid, Daschle, Lincoln, Boxer, Durbin, Biden, \nAkaka, Edwards, Kerry, Clinton, Bayh, Feingold, Nelson, Conrad, \nKennedy, Stabenow, and Dole. So this is a broadly supported piece of \nlegislation on both sides of the political aisle.\n  I particularly want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner, for his support of this important measure.\n  This has been a dangerous and a brutal period for our troops in Iraq \nin particular, but also in Afghanistan. There have been nearly 3,000 \nAmericans injured in these 2 conflicts in recent months. More than a \nyear after the initial Iraq invasion, the administration has announced \nplans to maintain a force of at least 135,000 troops in Iraq through \nnext year, through 2005.\n  We will have many debates as we proceed with the Defense \nauthorization bill next week and then later with the Defense \nappropriations bill, on the right level of funding, on how quickly to \nproceed with funding. President Bush has recently asked for another $25 \nbillion to be included in the defense budget for the operations in Iraq \nand I know there will be discussion about whether that is the \nappropriate amount. But clearly the liberation of Iraq is turning out \nto be the most significant military occupation and reconstruction \neffort this country has engaged in since World War II. We must not \nunderestimate the importance of the work that is involved here. I think \nit is important that we recognize those whose lives are on the line to \naccomplish this very difficult task.\n  Let me talk a minute about what is at stake in this legislation. The \nDefense Department has decided in their view what is appropriate is to \naward to the brave men and women who are serving in those two conflicts \nthe Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and no other medal. \nThis is despite the fact the Global War on Terrorism Medal is meant for \nany individual who served overseas during this war on terror and may \nhave come within a few hundred miles of a combat zone. The dangers of \nserving in Iraq and in Afghanistan are far greater. Therefore, along \nwith my colleagues, I propose to correct what I considered a mistake by \nauthorizing that we issue the Iraq and Afghanistan Liberation Medals in \naddition to the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\n  When the President was defending Secretary Rumsfeld earlier this \nweek, he noted Secretary Rumsfeld was involved in leading the military \nin ``two wars.'' If the President is willing to acknowledge the fact we \nare engaged in two wars, then his decision about how to award medals \nshould be consistent with that. The policy we are currently following, \nthat the Pentagon is currently following, is not consistent with that.\n  While some of us in this body have not shared the administration's \nview on the wisdom of going to war in Iraq, we are united when it comes \nto supporting our troops. These young men and women from Active Duty, \nfrom National Guard, and from Reserves are all volunteers. They \nexemplify the very essence of what it means to be a patriot. We \nbelieve what they are doing in Iraq and what they are doing in \nAfghanistan today differs from military expeditionary activity such as \npeacekeeping operations or enforcement of no-fly zones.\n\n  They continue to serve even though they do not know when they will \nreturn home to their family, to their friends. They continue to serve \ndespite the constant threat which they face to their own lives and the \ntremendous hardship many of them face.\n  There is a difference between an expeditionary medal and a campaign \nmedal and it is a well-recognized difference that goes back throughout \nour military history. We only need to look at an excerpt from U.S. Army \nQualifications for the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Kosovo \nCampaign Medal. In order to receive the Armed Forces Expeditionary \nMedal, you did not need to go to war; you only needed to be ``placed in \nsuch a position that in the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nhostile action by foreign Armed Forces was imminent even though it does \nnot materialize.''\n  However, to earn the Kosovo Campaign Medal, the standard was higher. \nA military member was required to:\n\n       Be engaged in actual combat or duty that is equally \n     hazardous as combat duty, during the Operation with armed \n     opposition, regardless of time in the Area of Engagement. Or \n     while participating in the Operation regardless of time [the \n     service member] is wounded or injured or requires medical \n     evacuation from the Area of Engagement.\n\n  Many within the military agree there is a difference. According to \nthe Army Times, and let me quote their statement, they say:\n\n       Campaign medals help to establish immediate rapport with \n     individuals checking into a unit.\n\n  An expeditionary medal like the Global War on Terrorism Medal does \nnot necessarily denote the individual with that medal has ever been \ninvolved in combat. A campaign medal is designed to recognize military \npersonnel who have risked their lives in combat.\n  Campaign medals matter. Let me give another quotation here.\n\n       When a marine shows up at a new duty station, commanders \n     look first at his decorations and physical fitness score, the \n     first to see where he has been, the second to see if he can \n     hang [tough]. They know what you have done and how serious \n     you are. . . . If you are a good marine, people are going to \n     award you when it comes time. . . .\n\n  That is the statement of a sergeant, as quoted in the Army Times.\n  In my view it is time we agreed with the rank and file in the \nmilitary, recognize the sacrifice of our young men and women who are \nfighting to assist in Iraq, including great Americans such as Army SP \nJoseph Hudson from my home State, from Alamogordo, NM, who was held as \na prisoner of war. The Nation was captivated as we watched Specialist \nHudson several months ago being interrogated by the enemy. Asked to \ndivulge his military occupation, Specialist Hudson stared defiantly \ninto the camera and said, ``I follow orders.''\n  Those of us whose sons and daughters were united in worrying about \nSpecialist Hudson's family--and the entire Nation rejoiced when he was \nliberated--that same circumstance has played out with regard to many \nother men and women who have served and are continuing to serve our \nNation in those conflicts.\n\n  We have also asked a great deal from the Reserve and National Guard \nforces in our States. The reconstruction of Iraq would not be possible \nwithout the commitment and sacrifice of the 170,000 guard and \nreservists currently on active duty.\n  In my view it is absolutely essential we go ahead and act on this \nlegislation. I know there may be some who say this legislation has been \nincorporated, or the same provisions have been incorporated in the \nDefense authorization bill which will be considered on the Senate floor \nnext week, and therefore we need not take action today. The problem \nwith dealing with it on the Defense authorization bill as part of the \nDefense authorization bill is all of us who have been around the Senate \nknow that bill will not get to the President's desk for signature until \nlate this summer or maybe fall. What I am urging is we take the bill \nthe House has passed unanimously, without a dissenting vote, we pass \nthat same legislation,\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nand send it to the President for signature, so these two campaign \nmedals, one for Iraq and one for Afghanistan, can begin to be awarded \nto these brave men and women.\n  I hope we can get the needed clearance on the Republican side. All \nDemocratic Senators have agreed to this course of action so we can \nbring up this legislation and pass it.\n  I am informed there is objection at this point; at least clearance \nhas not been achieved. I hope that can be remedied and we can act on \nthis bill before we leave town this week.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I inquire, is there currently business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business with a 10-\nminute time limit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5461-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5461-S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. ENERGY MARKET\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor once again \ntoday, as I have on three different occasions over the last 2 weeks, to \nvisit with my colleagues about the State of the U.S. energy market and \nwhat is happening out there that I am afraid some of my colleagues are \nnot yet understanding in a way that will cause them to act to help us \nshape a national energy policy for our country.\n  When I was on the floor of the Senate 2 weeks ago, I mentioned that \ngas at the pump in California had hit $2.25 a gallon. A few days later, \nI announced that gas had hit $2.50 a gallon in the State of California. \nYesterday, gas hit over $3 a gallon in the Los Angeles market--a \nhistoric high not only for this Nation but most assuredly for the State \nof California. In our State of Idaho--I say ``our'' State because my \ncolleague, Mike Crapo, is presiding at this moment--in some instances, \ngas has gone over $2 per gallon. For those of us who travel the miles \nacross Idaho to get from one small community to another, that begins to \nhave a very real impact upon the ability of our citizens to simply move \nacross the State of Idaho, let alone those businesses and industries \nthat use large volumes of chemicals, gasoline, and diesel for the \nconduct of their businesses.\n  So while I was accused by some of our folks on the other side of \nbeing a little bit too much of an alarmist a week ago in speaking about \nthis, I will simply hold my tone down today. But I have to think that \nthe average consumer who swiped his credit card with a $50 limit and \nfound out that before he could get his SUV filled, he had ran out the \nlimit of the credit card and had to swipe it one more time because the \ngas pump shut down got a very rude awakening this week in the Los \nAngeles basin.\n  Who ever thought it would cost $45 or $50 to fuel your automobile? \nThat is what it is costing today. I said a couple weeks ago that the \naverage citizen this fiscal year would spend $300 to $500 just for \ngasoline than a year ago. I need to update that a little bit. Now we \nare up to about $560 instead of $400. That has happened just within the \ncourse of a week and a half. Yet, the Senate still cannot get its act \ntogether. It cannot produce a national energy policy that we have been \ndebating and refining in this Chamber and in the appropriate committees \nfor the last 5 years. Somehow it just isn't quite perfect.\n  In the course of those years, we quit producing as a country. We kept \ndemanding and growing, and our growth, in large part, is based on \nsurplus energy that was built into our system over the last two \ndecades. But as our economy comes back on line, that surplus is gone.\n  Let's remember what happened at the last peak of an economic cycle in \nthe State of California, when the State of California went dark, and \nbusinesses and industries had to curtail production because they didn't \nhave electricity--or very little--or it wasn't reliable or stable. Have \nwe done anything to correct that, to create sustainability and \nreliability in the system?\n\n  The answer is that we have not done anything. We have debated it \nloudly and clearly, but we really could not get our political act \ntogether to solve the problem in California and the region. We have not \ndrilled any more oil wells in the United States. We have not been \nallowed to drill where we think there are literally billions of barrels \nof oil in Alaska because somebody said it might damage the environment. \nYet we have already proved by drilling in Alaska that proper procedure \nin the 1970s didn't damage the environment. Our abilities now, in 2004, \nare so much enhanced that we know we will not damage the environment. \nBut it became the clarion call of the environmental movement in this \ncountry not to touch ANWR. So, politically, we did not; we could not. \nThe votes simply were not here to do it.\n  What would happen today if ANWR were developed and the production was \non line, even though it wasn't pumping at the moment? We could say to \nOPEC, to other countries around the world, that we are going to turn \nthe valve of ANWR on and flow the oil through the pipeline of Valdez \nand fill our tankers and bring them down to Anacortes, WA, and to the \nrefineries of California, and begin to refine the oil of Alaska.\n  I bet OPEC would scratch its head and say: Maybe we better change our \nways a little bit. Maybe getting $30 to $35 a barrel is not realistic \nbecause we forced the United States to be less reliant on us and more \nreliable on themselves. It is called fungibility in the oil market.\n  We cannot do that today because politically we have not been allowed \nto do the right kind of exploration and environmentally sound \ndevelopment in Alaska.\n  We are hoping this economy keeps going, keeps growing, keeps \nrebounding the way it currently is, but what is putting a phenomenal \namount of pressure on it at this moment in the form of greater input \ncosts into almost every aspect of the economy is the cost of energy, \nwhether it is the average home and consumer or whether it is our \nfarmers in the State of Idaho who this past February, when they sat \ndown with their banker to develop their line of credit for the year, \npenciled in an energy cost and a fertilizer cost, little knowing what \nthey penciled in was 30 to 40 percent inadequate from what it was \nactually going to cost them. They have today found out their fertilizer \ncosts doubled. Why? Because phosphate is made from natural gas, natural \ngas processes, and natural gas went from $2.50 a million cubic feet to \n$6.50 to $7 a million cubic feet, and the cost of fertilizer went \nthrough the roof.\n  So fertilizer got applied less in some areas and where it did not get \napplied, the farmer rolled the dice and gambled, hoping somehow the \nvalue of the crop produced would increase 25, 30, or 40 percent, which, \nof course, won't happen. That is agriculture alone.\n  What about the chemical industry? What about those kinds of \nindustries up and down the east coast of America that produce the \nchemicals for this country? Many of them have already shut down, and \nthey have taken their production to Europe. It has cost us thousands of \njobs.\n  I must tell those men and women who are out of work: Why don't you \npick up the phone and call your Senators and ask your Senators how they \nvoted on the Energy bill, and if they voted no, why did that vote cost \nyou your job because the cost of energy went through the roof and your \ncompany had to shut down. That is, in part, the reality America is \nfacing today.\n  While all of us are excited about the growth of the economy and the \nthousands of new jobs that are being created at this moment, there is a \ncloud hanging over Wall Street and the investment community. They \nopenly say that cloud is the unpredictable high cost of energy and the \nimpact it will have on certain segments of the economy that are highly \ndependent upon it.\n  What did we do when we crafted S. 2095? We built a broad-based, \nincentivized bill that said we ought to be producing in all segments of \nthe energy market. It was not selective. It said America would grow and \nAmerica would prosper with an abundance of energy at a reasonable price \nthat was reliable and available. Therefore, our bill, S. 2095, \nencouraged domestic oil\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nproduction, encouraged the development of more natural gas, encouraged \nthe building of necessary infrastructure, such as the Alaska natural \ngas pipeline. Oh, I didn't tell you? We are pumping trillions of cubic \nfeet of gas back into the ground in Alaska as we speak from the \ncurrently developed oilfields. Why? Because we cannot get it to the \nlower 48. We produce it, it comes up, we segregate it from the oil, we \nput the oil in the pipeline, and we pump the gas back into the ground.\n\n  So we said: Why don't we build a pipeline? And industry said: Because \nit is so expensive, we cannot afford to build it unless you give us \ncertain consideration. This week we gave them that consideration. We \ngave them the tax incentives to build the pipeline to bring the gas to \nthe lower 48 to supply our business and industry, to bring down the \ncost of fertilizer, and S. 2095 did just that. It encouraged and \nincentivized the building of a natural gas pipeline out of Alaska.\n  Our Senate bill encouraged use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol. \nIt encouraged more renewable energy. Wind--you bet we are all for wind \nand more of it as a generating source for electricity and \nphotovoltaics, energy cells, taking the energy of the Sun. This bill \npromotes that where it can fit and does work. We have strengthened the \nfuture of nuclear energy as an option by, again, trying to incentivize \ngetting into what we call generation 4 reactor development.\n  Our State of Idaho might well be the place where a prototype is \nbuilt. This week in the State of Idaho, five representatives from five \ndifferent nations around the world visited our national laboratory as \nthe site where a new reactor prototype will be built, called generation \n4. It is a high-pressure reactor, safe to operate, that can produce a \nphenomenal abundance of nonemitting electricity and even hydrogen for a \nhydrogen economy and a hydrogen fuel cell transportation market. That \nis in S. 2095. That is part of what we have been working on.\n  Clean coal technology, that phenomenal energy resource of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, who is sitting here beside me at the moment, could be \nused without the risk of pollution.\n  There is hydrogen promotion, hydrogen fuel cell development, and I \nspoke of the generation 4 reactor and the production of hydrogen. Of \ncourse, there is conversation, using energy more wisely so we use less, \nresearch and development in new technologies, mandatory reliability \nrules for the electrical grid that moves our electricity across the \ncountry, the promotion of advancement and the expansion of that grid. \nThat is the full package.\n  It is also very interesting that when George Bush was President-elect \nGeorge Bush, before he had taken the oath of office, I will not forget \nmeeting with him for the first time just down the hall from the Senate \nChamber in the office of the majority leader of the Senate. He said: My \nmost important priority beyond education, the economy, and tax cuts to \nget the economy going again will be a national energy policy.\n  At that time, he said: I will task the Vice President to put the best \nminds in the country together and make recommendations to you, the \nCongress, to develop a national energy policy based on what we see is \nnecessary in the market. Our President did that.\n  It is interesting that a lot of people criticized him for it: Gee, \nwho was that who was meeting with you? Did they meet behind closed \ndoors? What did they recommend? And all of that.\n  They recommended a first-class list of things to do and what I have \nmentioned. What is embodied in S. 2095 is, in large part, what the \nPresident of the United States recommended to us as a national energy \npolicy.\n  Why isn't it law? Why hasn't this country turned toward producing \nenergy instead of simply consuming and being more reliant on a foreign \nproducer than a U.S. producer? Because this Senate could not get its \nact together. It is not big oil you ought to be blaming anymore, it is \nbig Government and big politics. It is the politics of energy, it is \nthe politics of the environment, and it is the denial of the \nresponsibility that every Senator in this body has to the home folks, \nto the consumer, to the producer, to the farmer, to working men and \nwomen who are now paying more for energy than at any other time in this \nNation's history.\n  If you don't think $3 a gallon for gas at the pump in the L.A. basin \ndoes not have an impact on the economy of this country, then think \nagain. If you think $2 a gallon for gas at the pump in Idaho today does \nnot have an impact on the consumer, does not have an impact on the \nfarmer, the producer, the working men and women, then think again.\n  Our economy is a whole. It is just as I said, and if that average \nworking family has to spend $400, $500, $600 or more or $1,000 or more \na year on energy, that is $1,000 less they have to put food on their \ntable, buy clothes for their kids, or even go out in the evening and \nhave a dinner.\n  It is that extra income that rolls across America that makes this \ncountry and this economy as strong as it is. When it is going to an \nOPEC nation to pay for the oil for the gas or the oil we burn here \ninstead of going to our own producers, somehow that just is not right. \nBut that is exactly what we are doing today, and we are doing it for \none simple reason alone: Because politically we could not function. \nPolitically we did not get our act together.\n  Many of us tried. We produced a bipartisan bill, but it was not quite \nperfect for some. Now the tragedy of that story is that the American \nconsumer pays an unprecedented price. That is the bad news.\n  There is a glimmer of good news. In a bill that we passed this week, \nwe passed a piece of this energy bill. We passed the tax incentives. A \ncouple of Senators came to the floor and said: Oh, all that money is \njust being given to big oil, which is a big rich industry and shame on \nyou for doing that.\n  Do my colleagues know what the rate of return on investment in the \noil industry was last year? Mr. President, 6.3 percent. Banking was \n19.5 percent. Starbucks was 8 percent. In other words, it was more \nprofitable last year to invest in a Starbucks coffee shop than to \ninvest in a major oil company. Why? Cost of production, Federal \nregulations, Clean Air Act, all of those Government hurdles that the \noil industry has to jump over that cost hundreds of millions of dollars \nto bring a new refinery online or to bring a new oilfield into \nproduction.\n  So good money just does not go there when money can go elsewhere with \nless risk to make greater return. That is what we passed this week. \nWith the tenacity of the leadership, we got it through. That is a piece \nof a total picture of getting this country back into the business of \nproducing.\n  Somebody said, well, we could tap SPR, the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, the salt domes down in the south where we store crude oil in \nthe case of an emergency. So if we tap those, then we would have more \noil and therefore more gas and the gas at the pump would cost less.\n  What they did not say is that was the strategy that Bill Clinton used \nduring a period of high gas prices and it changed the price at the pump \nby one cent. The reason it changed the price at the pump by only one \ncent is because our refinery capacity in this country is so limited \ntoday.\n  Twenty years ago, we had 324 gas and oil refineries in this country. \nToday, we have 135 or 140. It was not cost effective to retrofit them \nand rebuild them to meet the standards of the Clean Air Act. They \nsimply tore them down and they went away. So with our gas and oil \nrefineries operating at 95- to 98-percent capacity, as we speak at this \nmoment, adding more total supply does not change the equation.\n  Well, would you leverage down the Saudis and OPEC? Probably not that \nmuch, because they know that ultimately we will have to come back to \nbuy oil from them because we are not producing it for ourselves.\n  So before we adjourn this final session of the 108th Congress, \nwhether it occurs in late September or early October, there is one \nthing we ought to do, and that is we ought to pass a national energy \npolicy for this country. It is written. It is refined. It has been \nthrough conference. It is laying at the desk of the Senate, ready for \nan up-or-down vote. It is that simple.\n\n  It will not change gas at the pump overnight, but it will set us on a \npath of conserving, of producing, and of creating new technologies, \nalternatives, and fuel sources that are clean and nonemitting. Most \nimportantly, it will say to the American consumer that the\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\nSenate of the United States on energy, for the first time, acted \nresponsibly; instead of kowtowing to an environmental community or to \nanother community of interests, it put it all together, it did the \nright things, and S. 2095 does, in my opinion, all of the right things \nand it puts us on a path of getting back to the business of producing, \nbeing more self-reliant on our own ability, less reliant and less \ndependent on nations elsewhere in the world that have become the \nprimary producers of crude oil for the whole of the world.\n  That is the mission we ought to be about, but somehow politically we \njust cannot get there. So pick up your phone, call your Senator. I have \ncalled mine. I am talking to my Senator, who is the Presiding Officer. \nHe and I agree that it is time this country get back into the business \nof producing energy, and it is important that the Senate respond.\n  I have one request of my colleagues this weekend when they are home. \nTake your car out, drive up to a gas pump at the local service station \nand fill it up and watch the face of the gas pump. Then watch your \nwallet because, if the tank is empty and you are filling it, it will \ndrain your wallet, as it is draining the wallets of the working men and \nwomen of America.\n  Shame on us for having allowed that to happen, but it is this Senate \nand its inability to get a policy together that has in large part \ncaused the problem our consumers now face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham of Florida pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 2420 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida.

Mr. President, all of us in the Senate, and in the \nGovernment generally, are terribly upset with the events of these last \ndays and weeks because the shock and awe that we all experienced in the \nbeginning days has been diminished when compared to what we are seeing \nnow.\n  Now we are seeing the ultimate degradation of human conduct. \nUnfortunately, some part of it comes from us, from Americans. We are \nembarrassed, apologetic, humiliated by what we have seen.\n  I, like all of my colleagues, had a chance to view the pictures the \nPentagon sent to Congress yesterday. They were sick, perverted images \nfrom the Abu Ghraib prison. Shameful, perverted, degraded images that \nmade Members feel ill. But we could tell from the images there were \nmany soldiers present at these scenes. This was not a soldier or two; \nthere were many. The photographs demonstrated complete disintegration \nof discipline. Unfortunately, while it would be a lot easier if this \nwere just the case of a few bad apples, it indicates a breakdown in \nleadership.\n  I am a World War II veteran. I experienced the stress of being in a \ncombat zone. I understand the psychological wear and tear. I also know \nit is the responsibility of a soldier's leaders all the way to the top \nof the chain of command to supervise, to manage as best they can the \nconduct of the troops.\n  Regarding the current case of prison abuse, it is premature to rush \nto court-martial individual soldiers before all of the facts are known. \nI understand the administration seeks a public, visible court-martial \ntrial to demonstrate the United States commitment to justice, but \nbefore we simply lay all the blame on the soldiers at the bottom of the \nchain of command, we need to understand where the directives were and \nwhat they were when they came down from the top. How clear is it now \nthat well-dressed men in charge have let the soldiers in uniform down?\n  The top civilian leadership at the Pentagon has failed. In my view, \nreplacing Secretary Rumsfeld will change little at the Pentagon if his \ndiscredited team of advisers remain in their high-level position. A \nseries of bad decisions by the top civilian leadership at the Pentagon \nhas severely undermined our operations in Iraq. In my view, the \nPentagon's trio of civilian leaders needs to be replaced. I am speaking \nspecifically of the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy \nSecretary Paul Wolfowitz, and the Under Secretary for Policy, Douglas \nFeith. All three of those officials ought to be replaced. They all work \nvery closely together, and I am sure not one, not even the Secretary \nhimself, made all of the decisions. The trio's poor planning and \nmiscalculations have undermined the troops serving on the ground in \nIraq.\n  We are proud of those who have served so generously and nobly. That \ndoes not mean we cannot have some bad actors, but it also does not mean \nthose at the top are free of responsibility. Their negligence regarding \nreports of prisoner abuses which were alleged to take place as early as \nlast October is the last straw in a record of missteps and \nmiscalculations that have compromised the safety and effectiveness of \nour military operations.\n  These civilian leaders have dismissed the views of people in uniform \nnumerous times. For example, in early 2003, Four Star General Eric \nShinseki disagreed with Secretary Rumsfeld's plans for a light \nbattlefield force for Iraq. He said--and it was a courageous \nstatement--that at least 300,000 troops would be needed during the war, \nparticularly in the aftermath of the war. Now we know that General \nShinseki was right. The security situation in Iraq is deteriorating in \nexactly the way he said it would if there were not enough troops.\n\n  So how was General Shinseki handled by the trio of civilian leaders \nat the Pentagon? He was fired. Fired for telling the truth. It tells us \nsomething about the character of those decisionmakers who said, no, no, \nwe can get this done in much easier fashion. He was fired for knowing \nwhat he was talking about.\n  That is just one of the many miscalculations and mistakes made by \nthis trio at the Pentagon. Despite the urging of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff not to do so, the Pentagon civilian leadership disbanded the \nIraqi army after the invasion. We left 400,000 armed and trained Iraqis \nunemployed--I am not trying to give them jobs--and resentful, and now \nthese men are contributing significantly to the massive security \nproblems American troops are facing.\n  The civilian leadership at the Pentagon also ignored postwar plans \ndrawn up by the Army War College and the State Department Future of \nIraq Project, which predicted most of the security and infrastructure \nproblems that America faced in the early days of the Iraq occupation.\n  We have heard plenty of speeches from Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy \nSecretary Wolfowitz and Under Secretary Feith. They talk tough about \nsupporting the soldiers, sailors, marines, air men and women, but in \nreality they fail to provide adequately for our U.S. commanders as they \nrequested in Iraq such things as sufficient interceptor body armor or \nadequate protection from Humvees.\n  I learned that on my trip to Iraq last month when I asked a young \nsoldier--a captain, as a matter of fact--what it was he needed to \nbetter conduct his soldiers in our Army there. He said: Senator, the \nflak jacket you are wearing is the latest. It is the most protective. I \ndon't understand, he said to me, why we do not have them when I have \nseen those in the coalition wearing those vests.\n  He said to me: You see this rifle? This big, heavy rifle is bigger \nthan the one I carried in World War II; I carried a carbine. He said: \nThere are better weapons out there with better sighting mechanisms, \nlighter to carry. He said: We do not have them, and I don't understand \nwhy, Senator. He said: We have seen those in coalition hands.\n  Recently, Acting Secretary of the Army Les Brownlee and Army Chief of \nStaff GEN Peter Schoomaker recently told Congress that the Army \ncurrently\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nonly has 2,000 armored Humvees even though it needs at least 5,000 to \nadequately protect our troops. And the sight of those vehicles burning \nleaves out what happened to those people who were in those vehicles.\n\n  When asked why the Army did not have enough of these vehicles, \nGeneral Schoomaker said the Pentagon policymakers had not foreseen the \nneed for these standard fighting vehicles.\n  Despite their academic credentials, Wolfowitz and Feith horribly \nmisjudged the post-invasion situation in Iraq, and it has cost American \nlives.\n  Under Secretary Feith dismissed all dissent to his view that U.S. \nforces would be greeted as liberators and quickly win the lasting \ngratitude of the Iraqi people. Despite the current quagmire, he \ncontinues to cling to his delusional view of the situation.\n  In addition, before the invasion, these civilian leaders also told \nthe American people that Iraq would pay for its own reconstruction \nthrough oil revenues. As we now know, not only has that not happened, \nbut U.S. taxpayers are paying virtually all of the costs of the \nreconstruction of Iraq.\n  We cannot pass a highway bill in this Congress for America, but we \nare unloading U.S. taxpayer dollars to rebuild Iraq's highway system. \nWhy do we have to go to our taxpayers over and over again for billions \nof dollars for Iraq? Why does the President need to take another $25 \nbillion that could be used for Medicare, education, and American \nhighway construction?\n  The reason is the administration marginalized the international \ncommunity before the war, and Pentagon civilian leaders refused to cede \nany control of post-invasion Iraq to the international community. As a \nresult, we have paid more than 80 percent of all of the reconstruction \nfunds in Iraq.\n  I want to make it perfectly clear, I do not think we can cut and run. \nI think we have a responsibility there that we have developed through \nour own decisionmaking and through the fate that war has brought us. So \nI do not say cut and run. But I do say it would help us an awful lot if \nwe were not, at this point in time, arguing to give people who have \nbeen successful in business or in life greater tax breaks when we \ndesperately need the money.\n  Furthermore, there is little hope that European allies or \ninternational donors will cough up the over $30 billion that Iraq still \nneeds for rebuilding, according to World Bank estimates.\n  U.S. taxpayers will have shelled out almost $200 billion by the end \nof 2004. As a result of this unilateralism, we barely cobbled together \na meager coalition of the willing, but our men and women make up over \n87 percent of the troops fighting in Iraq.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, and Under Secretary \nFeith all have to be replaced. We need new leadership at the Pentagon, \nleadership that will listen to the military experts, leadership that \nwill not cling to discredited ideologies.\n  Perhaps the best illustration of the ineptitude of this team was \ntheir gross underestimate of the length of the Iraqi operation. They \ncreated false hopes for troops and their families, especially the \nreservists, many of whom are now facing more than a year's worth of \nduty away from their homes, away from the ability to pay their \nmortgages, away from the comfort children need from a father. They \ncreated the false hopes, especially of the reservists, who expected \nmuch shorter battlefield tours of duty.\n  In February 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld said the war ``could last six \ndays, six weeks.'' And he said: ``I doubt [that it could last] six \nmonths.''\n  It is well over a year from the beginning of this war, and now our \nown generals are publicly questioning whether we can win. We have to \nwin. We have no choice. But in order to win, we have to make sure our \ntroops have the tools to do the job with, and that we have sufficient \nhelp from other places. We have to make sure we pursue that mission.\n  I am not sure the current Pentagon team has the ability to direct our \nneeds now. We need new leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary \nWolfowitz, and Under Secretary Feith need to resign. And if they do not \ndo so, then the President would be wise to ask them to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5464-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5464-S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AAA AWARD WINNERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate \ntoday the names of the young men and women who were selected to receive \nspecial awards from the American Automobile Association. Eight safety \npatrollers will receive the 2004 AAA School Safety Patrol Lifesaving \nMedal Award, the highest honor given to members of the school safety \npatrol. Another safety patroller will receive the special honor of the \nAAA National Patroller of the Year. They will receive their awards this \nweekend and I want to say how proud we are of them.\n  There are roughly 500,000 members of the AAA School Safety Patrol in \nthis country, helping in over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young \npeople ensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, \nand back home in the afternoon.\n  Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But on \noccasion, these volunteers must make split-second decisions, placing \nthemselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. The heroic \nactions of this year's recipients exemplify this selflessness.\n  The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Centereach, NY. \nHis name is Shawn Rooney.\n  On the afternoon of November 18, 2003, Shawn, age 13, was on patrol \nin front of St. Joseph School. A 9-year old boy, Zachary Chase, ran \ninto the street to catch up with his class as a mini school bus was \napproaching. Shawn noticed that Zachary was in danger, grabbed his \nbackpack, and pulled him back. Zachary was only one step away from the \nfront of the bus.\n  This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Manassas, \nVA.\n  Josh Wampler, age 11, of Weems Elementary School, was approaching his \nbus stop on October 9, 2003, when he heard a woman yelling to a young \nbody. Josh saw that a 3-year-old, Isaac, was standing in the middle of \nthe street as a car was approaching. Josh carefully checked the traffic \nand met Isaac in the middle of the street. The driver of the car saw \nthe patroller and child and was able to stop in time. Josh escorted \nIsaac safely to the side of the road and out of harm's way.\n  The next AAA Lifesaving Medal winner comes from Bristow, VA.\n  On the afternoon of October 14, 2003, Andrew Deem, age 11, was at his \npatrol station at Bristow Run Elementary School, when he saw a 2-year-\nold, Anthony D'Areagelis, walking with his mother. His mother was \npushing a small child in a stroller, and Anthony ran away from his \nmother, down a hill, and into the busy street. Andrew quickly saw that \nAnthony was in danger, grabbed him, and brought him back to safety. \nAndrew also stopped Anthony's mother from running out into the street \nafter her child.\n  The fourth AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient is also a student at \nBristow Run Elementary School in Bristow, VA.\n  On October 14, 2003, John Hickey, age 10, witnessed the event that \ntook place with Patroller Andrew Deem. As Mrs. D'Areagelis ran after \nher 2-year-old, Anthony, the stroller that she had been pushing with \nPatrick D'Areagelis aboard began rolling into the street. John Hickey \nacted quickly and placed his foot into the street to stop the stroller \nfrom rolling any further. As he did this, an SUV drove by at a \nconsiderable speed, grazed Anderw's shoe, and did not stop.\n  The next AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Culpepper, VA.\n  Vincent Verardo, age 10, is a patroller at Epiphany Catholic School. \nOn a morning in April, 2003, Vincent was at his patrol station in the \nschool's parking lot, when he saw 4-year-old Paul Thomas run back to \nhis car to retrieve something he had left behind. Paul ran in front of \na car leaving its parking space, and Vincent quickly ran to the car, \ntook Paul by the arm, and brought him back to safety. The driver of the \ncar attested that they had not seen the 4-year-old until Vincent was \npresent.\n  The sixth AAA Lifesaving Medal winner is from Harrah, WA.\n  Martay Gunnier, of Harrah Elementary School, was at her post on the \nafternoon of October 28, 2003, when she saw Raymond James, age 7, run \nout into the street to meet his mother on the other side without \nstopping to wait for a clear crossing. Martay acted\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\nquickly by taking Raymond by the arm and pulling him back to safety and \nout of the way of two oncoming vehicles.\n  This year's seventh AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient is from Milwaukee, \nWI.\n  Michael Chobanian, age 13, is a student at James Fennimore Cooper \nElementary School. Michael was at his post on December 3, 2003, when he \nsaw a 6-year-old, Chantal Hill, approach the street. Michael told her \nnot to cross it, but she did not hear him and darted out into the \nstreet just as a parked car pulled away from the curb and began \napproaching quickly. Michael realized that the driver of the moving \nvehicle would not be able to see Chantal because their view was blocked \nby another parked car. He quickly yelled, ``Watch out!'' and reached to \npull her out of the path of the moving car. The driver of the car swept \nby and slowed farther down the street, after realizing what could have \nhappened.\n  The eighth AAA Lifesaving Medal winner is from Akron, OH.\n  On the morning of October 23, 2003, Robert H. Clement, age 10, was at \nhis post at Pfeiffer Elementary, when he saw Aidan Robertson, a 2-year-\nold, slip away from his mother and run out into the street. Robert \nimmediately dropped his patrol flag and ran into the street to help \nAidan. Robert returned Aidan to his mother after narrowly escaping \noncoming traffic by an estimated margin of only 4 feet.\n  In addition to honoring safety patrollers with the Lifesaving Medal \nAward, AAA also recognizes the School Safety Patroller of the Year. \nThis award is presented to patrollers who perform duties above and \nbeyond their normal responsibilities and demonstrate outstanding \nleadership, dependability, and academic strength.\n  This year, the Safety Patroller of the Year is Katie Wright, age 11, \na safety patroller at Randolph Howell Elementary School in Columbia, \nTN.\n  Katie was selected because of her leadership abilities, academic \nachievement, and involvement in numerous school and civic activities. \nKatie wrote an essay on her school safety patrol experience and said, \n``Safety Patrol has provided me with several qualities that have helped \nme in becoming a leader.'' Among the qualities she mentions are \npatience, compassion, self-respect, charisma, responsibility, and self-\ndiscipline.\n  She and all of the other AAA winners deserve our thanks and \nadmiration.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend congratulations and thanks to these \nyoung men and women. They are assets to their communities, and their \nfamilies and neighbors should be very proud of their courage and \ndedication.\n  I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association \nfor providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety \npatrol on duty nationwide.\n  Since the 1920s, AAA clubs across the country have sponsored student \nsafety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against traffic \naccidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange safety belts \nand shoulder straps, safety patrol members represent the very best of \ntheir schools and communities. Experts credit school safety patrol \nprograms with helping to lower the number of traffic accidents and \nfatalities involving young children.\n  We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that \nour Nation's children arrive to and from school safely and soundly. And \nwe owe our thanks to these exceptional young men and women for their \nselfless actions. The discipline and courage they display deserves the \npraise and recognition of their schools, their communities, and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5465-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5465-S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to update \nmy colleagues on the situation in Burma.\n  In short: there has been no progress: Burmese democracy leader Aung \nSan Suu Kyi remains under house arrest; 1,300 prisoners of conscience \nremain in Burmese jails--with others threatened by arrest for speaking \nout against the convention; and the SPDC nightmare of rape and \nrepression continues unabated in Burma.\n  I expect that the junta may again release Suu Kyi in the houses \nleading up to the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, \norchestrated May 17 constitutional convention charade. The world must \nhold the applause.\n  The generals in Rangoon need to do much more to prove they are \nserious about reconciliation than staging bad political theater in \nwhich they control every line and cue.\n  What should the SPDC do? First, release all political prisoners \nincluding those rounded up in the anticipation of the convention. \nSecond, permit the NLD to operate freely, including immediately \nreopening all party offices. Third, allow NLD members to meet with \nethnic leaders without threats of harassment, imprisonment or worse. \nFinally, provide the international press with unfettered access to \nBurmese democrats, throughout the country.\n  While the NLD will decide whether or not to attend the constitutional \ncharade, the international community bears the responsibility to \ncondemn a fundamentally flawed process that offers little in the way of \ntransition to democracy. I remain deeply concerned that the regime has \nnot rescinded their order which imposes lengthy prison sentences on \nanyone who speaks out against the national convention. What more \nevidence of a Potemkin village is needed?\n  As we think about Burma, it is important to consider the comments of \nTashika Elbegdorj, former Mongolian Prime Minister, who wrote in a \nrecent op-ed on Burma:\n\n       That the regime attempts to justify its behavior by talking \n     about ``managed democracy'' and the ``Asian way to \n     democracy'' is an outrage. The fact that Burma's regional \n     neighbors look the other way while making pretenses about \n     ``internal affairs'' is a stain on all Asians, and this must \n     change.\n\n  Tashika Elbegdorj speaks the truth and I commend his interest in the \nstruggle of freedom for Burma. I encourage other democrats in the \nregion to find their voices in support of Suu Kyi and the NLD in the \ndays, weeks, and months to come.\n  I close by highlighting yesterday's Baltimore Sun editorial on Burma \nentitled ``Window Dressing'' that encouraged the U.S. Senate to ``. . . \nact quickly to renew import sanctions. . . . And this time sanctions \nmust be followed by a U.S. diplomatic campaign--with the generals, \ntheir Southeast Asian apologists and the U.N. Security Council--that \nwill be more strongly focused on forcing the junta to begin sharing \npower. Ms. Suu Kyi has deservedly gained world renown as a symbol of \nthe Burmese quest for freedom, but she is also just one of 50 million \npeople who remain under this regime's lock and key.''\n  The Sun editors got it right: the Senate must act quickly to pass \nS.J. Res. 36, which renews import sanctions against Burma. By doing so, \nwe send a clear message that America continues to stand with the people \nof Burma. It is my hope that we can get agreement to consider and pass \nthis resolution before the May recess.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the former Prime Minister's op-ed, which \nappeared in The Nation, an English-language newspaper in Thailand, and \nthe Baltimore Sun editorial be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, May 12, 2004]\n\n                            Window Dressing\n\n       On Monday, 14 years after a pack of generals stole control \n     of Myanmar from a legally elected democracy party, the still-\n     ruling military junta will convene a national constitutional \n     convention to which it has invited its long-suppressed \n     opponents. In advance, the National League for Democracy, \n     which won those last parliamentary elections in 1990, has \n     been allowed to reopen an office. And there's mounting \n     anticipation that its leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu \n     Kyi, will be released from house arrest to participate in the \n     national political conference.\n       If this sounds all too familiar, it should. Those concerned \n     with the brutal suppression of freedom in the national once \n     known as Burma have been down this road before--in 1996 and, \n     more recently, last year, when the indomitable Ms. Suu Kyi \n     and her supporters, briefly free to speak out, came under \n     violent ambush leading to her last rearrest. Her release \n     now--it would be her third since her first arrest in 1989--\n     would be welcome, but it also would impart credibility to a \n     political process that Sen. Mitch McConnell has aptly \n     denounced as ``window dressing.''\n       All but a few of the more than 1,000 convention delegates \n     are said to be hand-picked supporters of the generals. Even \n     as the illegal regime talks of a new road map to resolving \n     this long standoff with the NLD, 1,300 political prisoners \n     remain jailed, and in recent\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\n     weeks more dissidents reportedly have been receiving long \n     sentences. Ms. Suu Kyi's party is in a tough spot: It can \n     boycott the convention as a sham and be accused by the regime \n     of being noncooperative, or it can legitimize a sham. Either \n     way, the Yangon generals again seem to be stringing along the \n     world.\n       All this speaks to the need for the U.S. Senate to act \n     quickly to renew import sanctions placed on Myanmarese goods \n     after Ms. Suu Kyi was rearrested last year. And this time, \n     sanctions must be followed by a U.S. diplomatic campaign--\n     with the generals, their Southeast Asian apologists and the \n     U.N. Security Council--that will be more strongly focused on \n     forcing the junta to begin sharing power.\n       Ms. Suu Kyi has deservedly gained world renown as a symbol \n     of the Burmese quest for freedom, but she also is just one of \n     50 million people who remain under this regime's lock and \n     key.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           [From the Nation]\n\n                  Now Is the Time for Action on Burma\n\n                         (By Tashika Elbegdorj)\n\n       Nobody should be clinking champagne glasses over the recent \n     announcement that Burma's National League for Democracy \n     (NLD), lead by Aung San Suu Kyi, has tentatively accepted an \n     invitation to attend the national convention being organized \n     by the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). If \n     this is to be a credible process, the regime must first meet \n     a number of reasonable demands by the NLD--something the \n     ruling junta has never done in the past. Now is the time to \n     step up pressure on Rangoon to ensure the NLD's demands are \n     met and to prevent another attempt by the SPDC to place a \n     veneer of democracy over their brutal rule.\n       Beginning a so-called process of national reconciliation \n     and charting a way out of Burma's political impasse without \n     the full participation of Suu Kyi and the NLD (as a party and \n     not as individuals) is destined to failure. The legitimacy of \n     the NLD cannot be denied. The Burmese people overwhelmingly \n     elected NLD candidates in 1990 to represent them in \n     parliamentary elections the SPDC refuses to recognize.\n       Few regimes in the world are as repugnant as the SPDC led \n     by Senior General Than Shwe. Human rights reports and \n     documentation by international organizations such as the \n     United Nations have catalogued a long series of horrors the \n     ruling regime inflicts on its people. For example, the SPDC \n     demands forced labor from its citizens, uses rape as a weapon \n     of fear and intimidation against ethnic groups, fills its \n     jails with political prisoners and torture and summary \n     executions are common. In one of the greatest crimes against \n     our youth, Human Rights Watch reports that nearly 70,000 \n     child soldiers, some as young as 11, have been dragooned into \n     the Burma army.\n       That the regime attempts to justify its behavior by talking \n     about ``managed democracy'' and the ``Asian way to \n     democracy'' is an outrage. The fact that Burma's regional \n     neighbors look the other way while making pretenses about \n     ``internal affairs'' is a stain on all Asians--and this must \n     change.\n       The SPDC's national convention continues a process begun in \n     1995 to guarantee a future constitution that cements the \n     military's role in power. Statements by senior SPDC officials \n     that this convention will pick up where the last one left off \n     demonstrates a striking lack of sincerely and strongly \n     indicates that this exercise has nothing to do with democracy \n     and everything to do with dictatorship.\n       The Burmese people are not the only victims of the regime. \n     Burma's neighbors also suffer. In Thailand, the junta's \n     actions have forced tens of thousands of refugees across the \n     Thai-Burma border. Methamphetimines, or ya ba as it is known \n     locally, wash into Thailand from Burma, saddling Thai social \n     services with skyrocketing addiction rates and increased \n     crime. China is battling an HIV-AIDS epidemic that has its \n     roots in Burma's opium smuggling. Regionally, Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), who have long provided \n     Burma's generals with political cover, are forced to pick up \n     the tab for the regime's behavior. Meetings with the U.S. and \n     EU officials that should be focused on enhancing economic, \n     security and social ties are instead devoted to explaining \n     the outrageous actions of a brutal regime. This tension is a \n     drag on the region.\n       It is time for Asian governments to realize that it is time \n     to get tough with Burma's thugs. After expending considerable \n     political capital and prestige, Prime Minister Thaksin \n     Shinawatra received a slap in the face when the junta refused \n     to participate in a second meeting of the Bangkok Process, a \n     mechanism he put in place to allow the regime to brief the \n     international community on its road map to democracy and \n     national convention.\n       Thaksin has bent over backwards to curry favor with Burma's \n     generals by cracking down on Burmese refugees and democracy \n     activists promoting non-violence in their opposition to the \n     SPDC. Thaksin should communicate strongly to the regime that \n     they will not find solace or cover with his government. \n     Allowing Burmese democracy activists to meet and organize in \n     Thailand would serve to demonstrate his commitment to freedom \n     in Thailand as well as sending a strong signal to the regime \n     that their actions are unacceptable and their support waning. \n     Asean could take the step of suspending Burma's membership in \n     the regional grouping putting the SPDC on notice they are \n     unwilling to foot the rising political and financial bill for \n     the regime's acts of violence and abuse.\n       A peaceful Burma holds the promise of returning refugees, \n     addressing narcotics smuggling, and investing in a social \n     infrastructure that can unleash the talents and potential of \n     the people. This will create a huge new economic market for \n     Asean and be a catalyst for further development in an \n     environment of peace and stability. None of this will exist \n     under the SPDC.\n       It is testimony to the bravery of the Burmese people that \n     despite the regime's oppression and terror they are unable to \n     subdue the country's democracy movement. The strength of the \n     movement lies in its legitimacy and the demand by the country \n     for governance derived from the will of the people. It is \n     long past time for Asian governments to hear their call and \n     take the actions necessary for a peaceful transition of power \n     that can begin to heal this torn land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5466-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MURDER OF NICHOLAS BERG\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

I extend my sincere sympathy to Mr. Berg's \nfamily and friends, who have had to confront a terrible loss in the \ncontext of a barbaric public display.\n  No one should be misled by the claims of the terrorists responsible \nfor this atrocity. They purport to be retaliating for the abuse of \nIraqi prisoners by American soldiers. But this is a lie. These people \nseek to kill us and kill our children because that is at the core of \ntheir agenda, because they derive power from inspiring fear and horror. \nThey do not need a pretext for their brutality.\n  We express our disgust at the scandalous treatment of Iraqi prisoners \nbecause our country stands for basic principles, for the rule of law, \nfor the dignity of the individual. We hold ourselves to high standards, \nand generations of Americans have shed blood to protect those standards \nand uphold our principles. We do not call for an investigation of these \nprisoner abuses in the hopes of placating terrorists. We call for an \ninvestigation and for full accountability because that is the right \nthing to do.\n  And in the broader fight against terrorism, we speak, wisely, of the \nneed to win hearts and minds in the Arab and Muslim worlds, where \nmillions of good and decent people question American intentions and \nactions. We insist, quite rightly, that the basic norms and standards \nof conduct embodied in the Geneva Convention not be undermined, because \nthose same Conventions protect our own troops when they are in harm's \nway. But our efforts are not aimed to influence the behavior of \nterrorists. No one has any illusions about the nature of these people. \nWe will not change their minds, or win their hearts, or convince them \nto uphold basic standards in their conduct.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember and pay tribute \nto those from my home State who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the \nline of duty. I sincerely believe we must never forget those who have \ngiven their lives to protect us all.\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\n  Each and every day, law enforcement officers risk themselves to \nprotect the rights and freedoms we enjoy as citizens of this great \ncountry. Their commitment and sacrifice make our streets and homes \nsafer, our communities stronger, and keep our families secure.\n  On October 1, 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed Public Law 87-\n726, proclaiming May 15 of each year as Peace Officers Memorial Day and \nthe calendar week of each year during which May 15 occurs as National \nPolice Week. The week is a time to honor Federal, State and municipal \nofficers who have been killed or disabled in the line of duty. This law \nwas amended by the 103rd Congress as part of the Violent Crime Control \nand Law Enforcement Act in 1994 to order the United States flag on all \ngovernment buildings displayed at half-staff on May 15.\n  Since the turn of the last century, more than 60 law enforcement \nofficers have been killed in the line of duty in New Mexico ten since \n1996. I would like to bring special attention to two events in \nparticular, while realizing that all are nonetheless significant. One \noccurred long ago, and the second just this past year.\n  The first took place the year prior to my election to this body. On \nthe night of November 8, 1971, New Mexico State Police Officer Robert \nRosenbloom was gunned down after he stopped a vehicle on Interstate 40 \nwest of Albuquerque. Three murder suspects--Charles Hill, Ralph \nLawrence Goodwin, and Michael Robert Finney--fled to Albuquerque. On \nNovember 27, they forced an Albuquerque tow truck operator at gunpoint \nto drive them to the runway of Albuquerque International Airport. Once \nthere, the hijackers seized control of a commercial jet and forced the \npilot to fly to Havana, Cuba.\n  Under the protection of Fidel Castro, they have avoided American \njustice. It has been reported that one suspect died in Cuba; however, \nthere are still outstanding warrants for all three suspects. These men \nhave been given asylum in Cuba and we continue to seek the extradition \nof these men for trial. Today, I renew my call for Cuba and Fidel \nCastro to return these fugitives. This shall also serve notice that \nthose of us from New Mexico have not forgotten, and we will forever \nhold out desire for due justice.\n  I would also like to remember Patrick K. Hardesty. Patrick grew up in \nArtesia, NM, where he established himself as a talented musician and \nEagle Scout. In fact, he was one of my military academy nominees years \nago. While making a career in the U.S. Marine Corps and Reserve, \nPatrick earned a college degree and joined the Tucson, AZ police force \nafter retiring from the military. On May 26, 2003, about this time last \nyear, he was brutally shot and killed while investigating a minor hit-\nand-run in midtown Tucson.\n  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the unselfish dedication of \nRobert Rosenbloom and Patrick Hardesty, and all the brave men and women \nwho have devoted their lives to public protection and service.\n  We remember their dedication to protect and serve, and the tragic \nprice they paid for that devotion. We also remember the families of \nthese two officers and the sacrifices they have incurred because of a \ndeep-seated commitment to duty and public service. All of us from New \nMexico owe a debt of gratitude to each and every officer who has lost \ntheir lives in the line of duty.\n  We would do well to remember to express our gratitude to the officers \nwho continue to serve us day to day. The men and women of law \nenforcement, through their service, are most worthy of our thanks and \nhighest respect. To all who have paid the ultimate price and to those \nwho continue to serve, may we forever be grateful and never take for \ngranted what you do. You have my utmost admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5467-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN COMMEMORATION OF POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the 145 law \nenforcement officers who gave their lives in service to their \ncommunities last year. They are true heroes, and their families are \nowed our gratitude.\n  This is National Police Week. Tonight, the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial Fund will host the 16th Annual Candlelight Vigil on \nthe grounds of the National Law Enforcement Memorial here in \nWashington. Three hundred and sixty-two names will be added to the \nmemorial tonight--145 officers who were killed in 2003, and 217 who \nwere lost in prior years. Saturday, the Fraternal Order of Police will \nhost the National Peace Officers' Memorial Day Service on the West \nFront of the Capitol. Together, these two events, along with other \nevents throughout the city this week, should make us all pause and give \nthanks to police officers throughout the Nation who protect our \ncommunities against crime and terrorism.\n  We lost fewer officers in the line of duty last year than we have in \nyears past, and the total is well below the 230 officers killed in \n2001, when we lost 72 officers on September 11 alone. But the numbers \nof lost officers is still far too high. On average, one out of every 9 \nofficers is assaulted per year, one out of every 25 is injured, and one \nout of every 4,400 is killed in the line of duty annually. Police risk \ntheir own lives in our service each and every day, and we should keep \nthese sobering statistics in mind every week, not just during police \nweek.\n  Law enforcement is an inherently dangerous undertaking, and police \nofficers have become our front lines in the war on terror. I fear we \nare underfunding their efforts as we reorient Federal assistance to \nlocal law enforcement post 9/11, but that is a conversation for another \nday. Today, and this entire week, we give police officers our thanks, \nwe remember those that paid the ultimate price while serving our \ncommunities, and we give comfort to the loved ones they have left \nbehind.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize nine extraordinary \nindividuals from my home State of Wisconsin. Each of them dedicated, \nand ultimately sacrificed, their lives to protect their fellow \ncitizens.\n  On Thursday, May 13, 2004, a candlelight vigil will be held at the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial to add 362 more names to the \nmemorial. Each day, law enforcement officers risk life and limb to \nserve the public. On average, 167 officers are killed each year in the \nline of duty. This memorial is a lasting tribute to these courageous \nindividuals.\n  Nine of the names being added today belong to law enforcement \nofficers who served throughout the State of Wisconsin. For the \nsacrifices they have made on our behalf, the citizens of Wisconsin owe \nthese brave individuals and their families a debt that can never be \nrepaid. I would like to honor them by placing their names in the \nRecord, along with the date of their untimely passing.\n  They are: Harry O. Harris of St. Croix County--6/18/1904; Richard \nMeyer of Winnebago County--11/13/2003; Roland Silas Payne of Wisconsin \nRapids--11/10/1939; Roy Sampson of La Crosse County--9/24/1952; Matt \nSchumacher of the Wisconsin Department of the Treasury--9/22/1934; \nMichael Eron Shannon of Adams County--3/7/2003; Charles Snover of \nWaukesha County--7/28/1935; Curtis Owen Starry of Viroqua--3/13/1953; \nand Bruce Allen Williams of Green Lake County--10/19/2003.\n  Every day, public safety officers around the country put themselves \nin harm's way to make our communities safer. It is important that we \nhonor their dedication and commitment to making our country and our \ncommunities a better place in which to live. That is particularly true \nof those who have lost their lives in the line of duty, but it is also \ntrue of those who take that risk day after day. For their commitment \nand dedication to their profession, we are forever in their debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5467-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5467-S5468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTO AUTHORIZE SEPARATE MEDALS FOR THE IRAQ AND AFGHAN MILITARY CAMPAIGNS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, I would like to express my support as a \ncosponsor for S. 1737, the Gasoline Free Market Competition Act. Over \nthe past few months, oil prices have skyrocketed $40 per barrel, the \nhighest price since 1990. High gasoline prices are inextricably linked \nto high crude oil prices. And these high oil and gas prices hurt \nAmericans across the Nation and from all walks of life. Farmers, \nteachers, and small business owners across the country and in Wisconsin \nin particular are getting hit hard by these outrageous costs.\n  The statistics are staggering. For gasoline, the increases in crude \noil prices have resulted in an average national price of $1.96 per \ngallon. In Wisconsin, the current average price for a gallon of self-\nservice regular unleaded gasoline in Wisconsin is $1.821, according to \nAAA's Fuel Gauge Report. The current average is 7.1 cents higher than a \nmonth ago at this time and 23.6 cents higher than a year ago at this \ntime. These are the highest gas prices we have seen in 13 years.\n  Unfortunately, under current law, the Department of Energy can \nconduct investigations into gasoline prices, but it does have the power \nto enforce the law or sanction companies for price manipulation. On the \nother hand, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, does have the power to \nprotect consumers from gas price manipulation. The FTC is supposed to \npromote competition and free markets, but all too often, the FTC has \nnot actively overseen energy markets to prevent price fixing and market \nmanipulation.\n  Congress needs to direct the FTC to eliminate anticompetitive \npractices that currently cause a chokehold on the competitiveness of \nindependent gas distributors and gas station owners. That is why I am \nsupporting the Gasoline Free Market Competition Act, S. 1737. This \nlegislation would modernize antitrust law to prohibit anti-ompetitive \npractices by single companies in the concentrated gasoline markets. The \ngasoline market in Wisconsin and at least 27 other States are now \nconsidered to be ``tight oligopolies'' with four companies controlling \nmore than 60 percent of the gasoline supplies. We need to ensure that \nthese concentrated markets are not subject to manipulation.\n  S. 1737 would address two major problems tied to gasoline price-\nfixing called ``redlining'' and ``zone pricing.'' In tightly \nconcentrated markets, numerous studies have found oil company practices \nare driving independent wholesalers and dealers out of the market. One \nanticompetitive practice is called ``redlining,'' which limits where \nindependent distributors can sell their gasoline. As a result, \nindependent stations must buy their gasoline directly from the oil \ncompany, usually at a higher price than the company's own brand-name \nstations pay. With these higher costs, the independent station cannot \ncompete. Investigations have also found large consolidated oil \ncompanies control not just the buying choices of local gas stations, \nbut also the selling prices of gasoline distributors. This anti-\ncompetitive practice is called zone pricing. The company bases prices \nnot on the cost of producing gasoline, but on the maximum a \nneighborhood will pay.\n  The Gasoline Free Market Competition Act, S. 1737, will do three \nthings to address this problem. First, the bill would establish \n``consumer watch zones'' for concentrated gasoline markets like \nWisconsin. Where a few companies control a large part of the market, \nthey can manipulate supplies and restrict competition with ease. \nTherefore, the FTC should watch consolidated markets more carefully.\n  The Gasoline Free Market Competition Act also shifts the burden of \nproof for price-fixing. If the FTC finds that an oil company is \nemploying anticompetitive practices in a consumer watch zone, the \ncompany should have to prove it is not hurting consumers. Redlining and \nzone pricing would be presumptively illegal. Oil companies that engage \nin anticompetitive practices that manipulate supply or limit \ncompetition would have to prove these practices do not hurt consumers.\n  Finally, the act gives the FTC clear ``cease and desist'' authority \nto stop price-fixing. In consumer watch zones, the FTC could issue \n``cease and desist'' orders to companies participating in these \nanticompetitive practices, forcing them to stop gouging consumers. The \nCongress needs to act now to ensure that anticompetitive practices do \nnot lead to further gas price increases, as many energy analyst are \npredicting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5468-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW ROSS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida.

He recently won the \nprestigious national award, the Temple Grandin Award, for achievement \nin autism, became the first autistic child to serve as a page in the \nFlorida House of Representatives and won the Special Olympics District \nTournament Golfing Regionals in his area. What a year.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Matt recently. I was impressed by his \npolite demeanor and his interest in special education issues.\n  A little over a year ago, Matt was in special education classes \nbecause by his own words, he had ``trouble with the way my brain \nprocesses information.'' He had been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome \nand, earlier, his mother had even considered placing him in a group \nhome. But, now just some 12-13 months later he has blossomed. He is no \nlonger in special education classes, and as I understand it has \npolitical aspirations. I give high praise to his mother, Susan Ross, \nwho has steadfastly stood by Matt and made it possible for him to \nsucceed.\n  I wish Matt all the luck and blessings in the world.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nAsia Foundation, a private, nonprofit organization based in San \nFrancisco, CA, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2004.\n  The Asia Foundation is a national asset that has contributed in \nsignificant ways to the mutual interests of the people of Asia and the \nUnited States for a halfcentury.\n  Through its programs, the foundation has been instrumental at key \nmoments in these five eventful decades. Early in its life, the \nfoundation contributed to democracy, freedom, peace and constructive \nrelations in post-World War II Asia. Since then, the foundation has \ninvested in Asia's future leaders, built the capacity of democratic \ninstitutions, provided support to civil society groups, promoted the \nrights of women and created opportunities for economic growth and \ndevelopment.\n  Today, the foundation is contributing to new initiatives in the \nregion, building new governance and opportunity in Afghanistan, for \ninstance, through support to the Constitutional Loya Jirga, helping new \ndemocratic institutions in Indonesia and programs with moderate Muslim \nleaders, and continuing to support human rights and prospects for \nreform in Cambodia, Nepal, and throughout Asia.\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\n  Through its 17 field offices in Asia, the Asia Foundation has made \nits positive mark. The foundation identifies and supports reform-minded \npeople at every level of society, from presidents and parliamentarians, \nto grassroots nongovernmental leaders. The foundation has supported \neducational institutions and libraries, legislatures and judiciaries, \ncivil society and the media, all with the aim of improving the lives \nand helping to meet the aspirations of the people of Asia.\n  In every corner of Asia, the foundation's impact is felt through the \nfellowships it has provided to thousands of Asia's leaders since its \nfounding, the new government and nongovernmental institutions it has \nsupported and the new ideas it has fostered to meet the challenges \nfacing Asia today. In so doing, the Asia Foundation represents America \nat its best: a private organization working in partnership with \ngovernment, advancing mutual interests of the U.S. and Asia in \nsupporting vibrant democracies, open economies, and peaceful relations.\n  As the United States addresses new challenges and opportunities in \nU.S.-Asian relations, we celebrate the Asia Foundation's history of \nachievement, and look forward to its continued contributions to the \nregion in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5469-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF MARY CONNELLY KEGELMAN, NATIONAL AND DELAWARE MOTHER \n                              OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mary \nConnelly Kegelman, recipient of the Delaware Mother of the Year and the \nNational Mother of the Year awards. Mary has dedicated her life to \nraising her 10 children and to the thousands of school children whose \nlives she has touched.\n  Mary was born in Massachusetts in 1930. She received her Bachelor's \ndegree in chemistry from Elms College in Massachusetts and went on to \nFordham University in New York for her Master's degree in physical \nchemistry. It was during graduate school that she met her husband, \nMatthew. The two were married on October 12, 1953, in Massachusetts in \nfront of their loved ones.\n  Shortly after graduation, Matthew was offered a job at the DuPont \nCompany. The newlyweds moved to Delaware and have lived here for over \n50 years. They have 10 children--John, Matthew, Jerry, Joseph, Thomas, \nMary, Christine, Bernadette, James and Daniel, and 18 grandchildren.\n  Mary began teaching algebra part time at Ursuline Academy in \nWilmington, DE in 1973. While her children were in middle school at \nImmaculate Heart of Mary, she saw a great need for algebra education. \nTwo of her children were in seventh and eighth grade, and were not \nbeing taught algebra. Mary knew they were capable of learning it. She \ntalked to the school, and began volunteering one day a week to teach \nalgebra to the top students in the class. One day turned into two days, \nand soon thereafter, the school asked her to come aboard full time to \nteach and to start the advanced math program at Immaculate Heart of \nMary. With the help and cooperation of students, teachers, \nadministrators and faculty, the curriculum developed into a top-notch \nprogram, with each of the top 15 students in grades 6, 7 and 8 \nparticipating.\n  It was after a lifetime of dedication to her family and students that \nMary was recognized for her selfless devotion. American Mothers Inc., a \nnonprofit group that promotes motherhood and family, awarded Mary with \nthe Delaware Mother of the Year and the National Mother of the Year \nhonors. The State award was presented to Mary in April, and the \nnational award was announced in early May. Mary was honored for reading \nfavorite bedtime stories, helping with homework and offering friendship \nwhen it was needed most. Those who know Mary describe her as embodying \nthe spirit of what motherhood is supposed to be--nurturing, but strong.\n  Mary is an amazing woman. She has been committed to her family, her \nstudents, and her community. Even to this day, she spends several hours \na week tutoring students who need help in math. She has helped shape \nthe lives of thousands in the halls of the institutions she served, and \nin the hearts of those who have been lucky enough to call her their \nfriend. I rise today to honor and thank Mary for her selfless \ndedication to the betterment of others. She is a remarkable woman and a \ntestament to the community she represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5469-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WE THE PEOPLE: THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION NATIONAL COMPETITION\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nstudents from Central Academy in Des Moines, IA, who participated in \nthe ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals \nin Washington, D.C. The annual competition is the culmination of the \nstudents' extensive study of the American system of constitutional \ndemocracy. The team from Central Academy won the State competition, \nearning the honor of representing Iowa in the national finals on May 1-\n3. I am proud to say that performance of the Central Academy students \nin the national finals earned them the Regional Award for the central \nstates, which is given to the best non-finalist team in each region. I \noffer my sincere congratulations to these exemplary students.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with these students when they were in \nWashington. They are a remarkable group of politically engaged young \npeople and I am proud to have had them representing Iowa during the \nnational competition.\n  The ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' program, run \nby the Center for Civic Education with the help of Federal funding, \nprovides an outstanding curriculum that promotes civic competence and \nresponsibility among elementary and secondary students. Students take \naway a solid understanding of the origin of American constitutional \ndemocracy as well as the contemporary relevance and application of our \nfounding documents and ideals. In short, the We the People program \nproduces better citizens.\n  In closing, I would like to personally recognize the Central Academy \nstudents who participated in this program, Oliver Borzo, Andrew Dahm, \nAndrew Eilts, Becki Gell, Andrew Greiner, Sean Noonan, Carole Peterson, \nPaige Richards, Maura Walsh, Shannon Wenck, Emma White, Molly White, \nChristopher Woods, Ru-Huey Yen, Ru-Shyan Yen and their teacher, Michael \nSchaffer.

Mr. President, I rise today to praise the Acting \nSecretary of the Army, Les Brownlee, for his wonderful leadership and \ngreat job he has done under very difficult circumstances as the Army \ncopes with the stresses of heavy involvement in the Global War on \nTerrorism, especially in Afghanistan and Iraq, and as he juggles many \ndemands and complex priorities as the Army continues to transform.\n  Acting Secretary Brownlee is indeed a highly distinguished public \nservant who has performed with great humility, energy and passion on \nbehalf of all our active and reserve soldiers and their families. I was \nparticularly impressed with the article ``Army of One'' by Katherine \nMcIntire Peters which appeared in the latest edition of Government \nExecutive magazine and believe that every member should take time to \nread it. I ask that this article be printed in the Record in its \nentirety.\n  The article follows.\n\n                              Army of One\n\n       Acting Secretary Les Brownlee once again leads troops \n     through tumultuous times. On Christmas Eve 2001, \n     Undersecretary of the Army Less Brownlee took an Air Force C-\n     130 transport plane to Baghram Air Base in Afghanistan, where \n     about 200 soldiers were battling al Qaeda and the terrorist \n     organization's Taliban sponsors. It was a dangerous flight. \n     To reduce their chances of drawing enemy fire, the pilots \n     landed at night, with their lights extinguished. Brownlee \n     spent the evening and following day meeting with soldiers, \n     listening to their experiences and offering encouragement and \n     praise for their service. He had been in office less than two\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n     months when he made the Christmas visit, but it established a \n     pattern. With little fanfare and no press attention, Brownlee \n     has spent every holiday since then in the field with \n     soldiers.\n        Brownlee's boss at the time, Army Secretary Thomas White, \n     was the public face of the Army, testifying before Congress \n     and participating in Pentagon press briefings with Defense \n     Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, while Brownlee was quietly \n     managing an expanding portfolio of responsibilities. In March \n     2002, Brownlee was made acting assistant secretary of the \n     Army for civil works, taking on oversight responsibility for \n     the Army Corps of Engineers, a position that would last until \n     this past August, when President Bush appointed John Paul \n     Woodley to the job. In the meantime, Rumsfeld fired White \n     last April and Brownlee became acting Army secretary. For \n     four months last year, Brownlee simultaneously held the \n     positions of Army secretary. For four months last year, \n     Brownlee simultaneously held the positions of Army secretary, \n     undersecretary and director of civil works. During this time, \n     the Army went to war in Iraq and began the biggest civil \n     works project since World War II--the $18 billion program for \n     rebuilding Iraq. Despite his enormous role in what is \n     arguably one of the most profound shifts in U.S. military \n     posture, Brownlee has received very little media attention, a \n     fact that clearly suits him. ``He's a humble and completely \n     dedicated man,'' says John Hamre, deputy Defense secretary \n     during the Clinton administration and a former colleague of \n     Brownlee's when both worked on the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee, Brownlee for Republicans and Hamre for Democrats. \n     ``He does not seek press. He refused to let me have a dinner \n     in his honor when he became undersecretary. He just said, `I \n     don't think that's right.' Les is one of my best friends, \n     and I said `Les, please, this is for you,' and he said, \n     `Please don't do it. I know how much you care,' '' Hamre \n     recalls. ``He completely wants to dissolve his own \n     personal identity into the good of the Army,'' Hamre says. \n     ``Without question, he is one of the finest people I've \n     ever worked with.''\n\n\n                         a `get-it-done fellow'\n\n       If a Hollywood producer were casting a film about the Army, \n     the service secretary might very well look like Brownlee. In \n     an interview in March he appeared tanned and fit, handsome, \n     square-jawed, blue-eyed, silver-haired. He wore a navy suit, \n     a white shirt French cuffs and a red, white and blue tie, the \n     uniform of official Washington, but for the Silver Star pin \n     in his lapel, a hard-earned award for valorous conduct on the \n     battlefield nearly four decades ago. Brownlee earned two \n     Silver Stars in Vietnam, along with three Bronze Stars and a \n     Purple Heart. He may look like a politician or a banker, but \n     he is a soldier's soldier. Brownlee's bearing is formal and \n     gentlemanly and he speaks in a measured, low voice. After \n     introducing himself at the beginning of an interview, his \n     first comment is: ``I've never really done this before.'' A \n     press hound he is not. Brownlee's resume is remarkably suited \n     to his responsibilities. A highly decorated infantry company \n     commander in Vietnam, he served a full career in the Army \n     before retiring as a colonel in 1984, after serving as \n     executive officer to James Ambrose, one of the most dynamic \n     Army undersecretaries in modern history. ``I though he was a \n     real comer and a very effective fellow,'' recalls Ambrose. \n     ``I think of Brownlee as a superb organizer--a get-it-done \n     fellow.''\n       After leaving the Army, Brownlee went to work on the staff \n     of Sen. John Warner, R-VA., a stalwart on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee. Three years later, Brownlee joined the \n     committee staff, where he worked for 14 years, several years \n     as staff director under the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, the \n     committee chairman whose failing health greatly impaired his \n     participation in Senate business. ``Les single-handedly \n     ensured the authorization bills were produced in some very \n     difficult years,'' recalls Hamre. ``Had it not been for Les \n     to hold the committee together and move those bills forward . \n     . . there were a couple of years we weren't going to have \n     authorization bills. Les made it happen.\n       While working for the Senate, Brownlee oversaw some of the \n     most profound changes in military posture since the Korean \n     War. He was a major player in decisions surrounding the \n     reduction in military forces and the cancellation of major \n     weapons programs following the end of the Cold War, and he \n     played a key role in establishing requirements aimed at \n     helping the services navigate the strategically messy decade \n     of the 1990s.\n       In the summer of 2001, Bush administration officials asked \n     Brownlee if he would take the job as Army undersecretary. He \n     was still mulling it over on the morning of Sept. 11, when he \n     turned on the television in his Senate office in time to \n     watch terrorists fly a second plane into the World Trade \n     Center towers in New York. A short while later he spoke to \n     his son, A U.S. attorney in Roanoke, VA., who told him: ``You \n     know you have to take the job now.'' ``I knew he was right,'' \n     says Brownlee.\n\n\n                             SHUNNING PERKS\n\n       To get to Brownlee's Pentagon office a visitor must walk \n     past an empty suite of offices designed for the Army \n     secretary. When he became acting secretary a year ago, \n     Brownlee declined to move into the secretary's spacious \n     third-floor suite. Nor would he let his staff change the \n     nameplate on his office door to reflect his position. ``The \n     morning I signed the papers to become acting secretary I told \n     my staff I would not be using the secretary's office, I would \n     not use the secretary's car and I did not want my picture up \n     on the wall [with other Army secretaries]. I assumed there \n     would be a nominee. It didn't seem appropriate [to assume the \n     perks of office]. It's a personal thing,'' he says, when \n     asked about it.\n       Last July, months after Brownlee assumed the job of acting \n     secretary, Bush nominated Air Force Secretary James Roche to \n     become Army secretary. Some observers saw the move as another \n     sign of Rumsfeld's widely reported discontent with the Army. \n     Almost immediately, Roche's nomination ran into trouble in \n     the Senate, where members have questioned both his role in \n     promoting a controversial deal to lease air tankers from \n     Boeing and his handling of sexual assault cases at the Air \n     Force Academy. Last month, after it became clear the Senate \n     would not move on the nomination, Roche withdrew his name \n     from consideration.\n       Whether Brownlee or anyone else will be nominated for the \n     Army secretary's position is a topic of speculation at the \n     Pentagon, but in a contentious election year, many are \n     doubtful. ``I don't think it really matters,'' says one \n     senior Army officer who asked not to be identified. \n     ``Brownlee is a workhorse. Soldiers respect him and he knows \n     how the Hill works. He's doing the job far more effectively \n     than many of his predecessors who didn't have `acting' in \n     front of their titles.'' Brownlee typically works 15 hours a \n     day, six days a week. He says his expectations for the job \n     were largely formed by his work for Ambrose. ``He had an \n     enormous appetite for work. The first day I worked for him he \n     came out of his office around 8:30 p.m. and apologized \n     because he was leaving early. The next day we started at 4 \n     a.m.'' Brownlee's hours are marginally better. One of his \n     staff officers complains that working for Brownlee is like \n     being on a deployment--he rarely sees his family. When asked \n     what he thinks of Brownlee, he says, ``I think the world of \n     him.''\n\n\n                            SHAPED BY COMBAT\n\n       As a child growing up during World War II, Brownlee was \n     fascinated by military history. Although no one in his family \n     had served in the military--his father, an explosives expert, \n     ran a bomb plant in West Texas during the war--Brownlee was \n     drawn to service. He attended the University of Wyoming, a \n     land-grant school where ROTC was compulsory. Brownlee \n     enrolled in the Air Force ROTC program, but failed to pass \n     the flight physical, so he switched to the Army ROTC program. \n     He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the infantry in 1962 \n     and in July 1965, he was a distinguished honor graduate of \n     the intensely competitive U.S. Army Ranger Course. By year's \n     end he was part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the first \n     major ground unit to enter Vietnam.\n       ``As a soldier, there's one thing worse than going to war--\n     that's not going to war,'' he says. He wondered if he had \n     what it took to lead men in battle. The rifle company \n     commander got his chance soon enough after deploying to \n     Vietnam. ``As we came under fire the first time I heard \n     this steady, commanding voice, and I found it very \n     reassuring. Then I realized it was my voice. It was very \n     strange,'' he recalls.\n       The July 18, 1966, orders for his first Silver Star award \n     give some measure of his experience in Vietnam. The award \n     reads, in part: ``With complete disregard for his safety, \n     Captain Brownlee dragged his fellow officer to the rear. \n     While performing this heroic action he was seriously wounded \n     in the arm and leg by intense hostile fire. Demonstrating \n     outstanding courage and stamina, he continued to move his \n     wounded comrade and lead his men to the rear. Though \n     seriously wounded, Captain Brownlee refused evacuation until \n     all the others wounded had been evacuated and an attempt at \n     recovering missing equipment had been made.''\n       Pat Towell, the senior defense reporter at Congressional \n     Quarterly for 25 years and now a visiting fellow at the \n     Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, says Brownlee \n     brings a personal credibility to the job that is important. \n     ``The [Army] is under a lot of stress. I think it's \n     especially important for the institution that [soldiers] have \n     the reassurance that the civilian who represents them in the \n     leadership is one of them,'' Towell says.\n       Arnold Punaro, who was the Democratic staff director on the \n     Armed Services Committee during the time Brownlee was \n     Republican staff director, says, ``One of Les' strengths was \n     that he always worked issues from what was in the interest of \n     a strong national defense and the country and not from a \n     partisan angle.'' A retired major general in the Marine Corps \n     Reserve, Punaro adds, ``He's a true leader. I say that from \n     having worked with him when he was still in uniform.''\n       Punaro says that when Brownlee worked in the Senate, he \n     came up with an important plan, called the Soldier Marine \n     Initiative, to get better fighting equipment to soldiers and \n     Marines. ``We were always buying big airplanes and big ships \n     and big submarines, and Les was asking `What are we doing for \n     the foot soldiers?' He was instrumental in improving body \n     armor for troops and improving the helmet and head \n     protection. He was in the minority at the time. That \n     initiative stuck and has produced a tremendous amount of good \n     for the soldiers and Marines.''\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\n       The improvements in body armor Brownlee championed while in \n     the Senate proved so successful in saving lives in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan that the Army in recent months faced a public \n     maelstrom, forcing the service to field the protective gear \n     more quickly and broadly than it had earlier planned. \n     Brownlee recently visited an armor manufacturing plant to \n     press managers to further ramp up production. According to \n     one person who was at the meeting, Brownlee left no doubt \n     about his seriousness that the production schedule would have \n     to improve dramatically. ``If it involves force protection, \n     then do it with the utmost urgency,'' Brownlee says. ``If you \n     only get it out there one day early, you still might save a \n     life,'' he says.\n       ``Here's a guy that goes almost every day to visit troops \n     at Walter Reed [Army Medical Center in Washington],'' says \n     Punaro. ``I don't think many people know that about Les, and \n     Les wouldn't want anybody to know about it. But this is a guy \n     who cares deeply about men and women in uniform and their \n     families. It's not just something that happened since he \n     became acting secretary.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5471-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5471-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5471-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:36 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 4141 Postmark Drive, Anchorage, Alaska, as the \n``Robert J. Opinsky Post Office Building,'' to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation to \ndesignate the U.S. Post Office located at 4141 Postmark Drive in \nAnchorage, Alaska after Robert J. Opinsky.\n  Bob Opinsky started his career with the Postal Service in 1956 as a \n$1.50-an-hour temporary clerk. Through hard work and dedication, he was \nable to work up the ranks of the Postal Service and become the District \nManager of the Postal Service in Alaska.\n  During his 41 years with the Postal Service, Bob has proven his \ncommitment to the Postal Service. In 1964 when the great earthquake hit \nAlaska, the local roads were torn apart and homes and buildings were \ndestroyed. In addition, the earthquake created a large hole in the \nAnchorage post office building. However, despite the conditions of the \nAnchorage post office and roads, Bob Opinsky went to work on the Monday \nmorning following the Friday quake.\n  Bob Opinsky introduced innovative methods to run the Postal Service. \nUnder Bob's leadership in 1996, the Postal Service was awarded the \nGreen Star Award; an award given in honor of environmental \nresponsibility. The Postal Service in Alaska recycled more than 725,000 \npounds of mixed paper and 100,000 pounds of cardboard. Not only was the \nAnchorage recycling program environmentally friendly, the Postal \nService's efforts reduced their annual disposal cost by about $34,000.\n  After 41 years of employment with the Postal Service, Bob Opinsky \nretired from his District Manager position in 1996. Bob has poured his \nheart and soul into the Postal Service. It is only fitting we honor his \ncommitment to the Postal Service by dedicating a post office in \nAnchorage, Alaska after him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 2417. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish care for newborn children \nof\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\nwomen veterans receiving maternity care, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the Veterans Administration has taken \nremarkable strides over the years to adapt to the increasing number of \nwomen veterans using VA facilities. As of 2002, there were \napproximately 1.5 million women in the Armed Forces and 20,000 of these \nwomen are from Minnesota. Many of these soldiers want to start families \nwhen they return home and will need to use their VA healthcare coverage \nfor obstetrics care.\n  Currently, a woman can use her VA coverage for prenatal care, \ndelivery and postnatal care. The VA will enter into a contract with a \nhospital to provide these services, but the VA cannot provide any \ncoverage for the baby after it is born. The baby is uninsured until a \nhospital social worker or the parents can arrange for private \nhealthcare coverage, or in most cases, for the baby to receive Medicaid \nassistance. This period of time, which in some cases can reach 2 weeks, \nis very stressful for all the parties involved.\n  Today, I have introduced a bill that will allow the VA to provide \ncoverage for veterans' babies for up to 14 days after delivery in a VA \nhospital or VA contract facility. This will help care for these \nchildren during the time needed to secure long-term coverage outside of \nthe VA system.\n  This bill will also make it easier for the VA to find willing \nhospitals. Today, many hospitals are reluctant to offer services to an \ninsured mother and an uninsured baby. If both the mother and the baby \nwere covered by the VA, hospitals in the veterans' local community \nwould be more likely to accommodate them. Finally, I am hopeful that \nover time this legislation will save money for VA by eliminating extra \nsurcharges and fees to hospitals which currently cover their liability \nfor delivering an uninsured baby.\n  I firmly believe that veterans who have gone through the traumatic \nexperiences of war should not have to worry about the health of their \nnewborn babies because of bureaucratic glitches in the system. This \nbill will cut the red tape surrounding the delivery rooms and ease the \nburden on our veterans who want nothing more than to bring children \ninto the free society which they helped protect and defend.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2417\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Care for newborn children of women veterans receiving maternity \n              care.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2418.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional relief for membes of the Armed Forces and their families; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, our men and women serving in the military \nare the defenders of freedom and security around the world. The special \nrole they play demands that they be ``on call'' to serve our Nation at \npoints all over the globe.\n  The unique nature of their job has resulted in a unique and, I must \nsay, very complex compensation package. The various types of \ncompensation and benefits oftentimes create an especially difficult \nburden, especially when it comes to filing their tax return.\n  Through the years, Congress has periodically passed laws that \nrecognize the special needs of our military and to lessen \nadministrative burdens on them.\n  During consideration of such a bill last year, I approached the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Chuck \nGrassley, and ranking member of that committee, Senator Max Baucus, and \nasked them to join me in an effort to get a fresh look at the overall \npicture of how the Tax Code treats our military.\n  I was pleased when they agreed to join me in this work, and I was \ndelighted to jointly request an expedited study by the GAO. It has been \nan honor to work with them and their staffs throughout this process, \nand I believe our work will produce good things for our military.\n  Yesterday, GAO released a report as a result of our request. The \nreport raises many interesting findings, but there is one especially \nimportant issue that demands our immediate attention. Mr. President, I \nwant to discuss the problem identified by GAO, and then I will \nintroduce a bill to correct the inequity that has been documented.\n  The problem identified by GAO is the result of complex interactions \nbetween the combat zone exclusion under section 112 of the Internal \nRevenue Code and the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit.\n  Under the combat pay exclusion, a very important benefit provided by \nCongress, military pay earned--including basic pay, bonuses, special \npay and allowances--is excluded from taxable income while members of \nthe military are serving in a designated combat zone.\n  That is right, Uncle Sam doesn't impose taxes on military pay for \nthose serving our country in combat zones--and rightfully so.\n  However, income excluded under the combat pay provision is also \nexcluded from income for the purpose of computing the earned-income tax \ncredit and the child care credit.\n  As a result of this, thousands of men and women serving in combat, in \nplaces such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places around the globe, \nwill see a reduction or elimination of their earned-income tax credit \nor the child tax credit and, in effect, because of how these interact, \nwill lose money. In other words, the Tax Code has the impact of \npenalizing them because they are serving in combat zones. That is the \nopposite effect intended by Congress.\n  The GAO report characterizes this result as an ``unintended \nconsequence.'' I call it a wrong, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin fixing this glitch as soon as possible.\n  The urgency of this situation is highlighted especially when you \nfocus on those of our troops which this affects.\n  We are talking about troops who tend to be in combat for more than 6 \nmonths, who are not making much money, who have families to provide for \nand have little or no savings or little or no spouse income.\n  I am going to repeat that. We are talking about a clear wrong in the \nTax Code that takes money away from men and women serving this Nation \nheroically and in dangerous places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The GAO analysis suggests the amount of the tax benefit loss enlisted \npersonnel could face is up to $4,500 and $3,200 for officers. This is \nreal money, make-or-break money, to many of these families who are \nalready under an enormous amount of stress. This money will make a real \ndifference and we need to get about the business of fixing this problem \nas soon as possible.\n  To correct the unfairness of current law, I am introducing the Tax \nRelief for Americans in Combat Act. The bill allows men and women in \nuniform serving in combat to include combat pay for the purpose of \ncalculating their earned income tax credit and their child tax credit \nbenefits. In other words, they will be able to continue receiving their \nrightful combat pay exclusions while having the ability to take full \nadvantage of other tax credits. I urge my colleagues to join me in this \neffort. It will make a real difference for thousands of military \nfamilies across the Nation.\n  I thank Liz Liebschultz and Christy Mistr of the Finance Committee \nstaff for their advice and counsel in helping me sort through this \nmatter in generating this GAO report. They did the work in drafting the \nprovisions of this bill to make sure these provisions could be adopted \nby the Senate as soon as possible.\n  Also I want to recognize the GAO team which put this report together, \nbecause they did a lot of work on this: Jim White, Derek Stewart, Lori \nAtkinson, Jennifer Gravelle, John Pendleton, Sonja Ware, and James \nWozny. They did a great job in preparing this report and I appreciate \ntheir hard work.\n  While we found this tax breakdown in the GAO report, there is also a \nlot of good news in the report regarding the compensation of our \nmilitary personnel and I hope my colleagues will take time to review \nwhat the GAO says in all the information provided.\n  During a time of war, I do not want to lose sight that the Senate \nArmed Services Committee chairman, Senator John Warner of Virginia, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, are taking care of \nour troops financially.\n  One thing we talked about in the Armed Services Committee is \nrecruiting and retention. Are we going to be able to meet those two \nobjectives for our military? Well, I think today with this bill we can \nsend a clear message to our youth and our enlisted personnel that a \nmilitary career is an amazing option, and the compensation is such that \nit can compete with the private sector.\n  There is a real problem with our Tax Code that needs to be fixed \nimmediately and the good news is, it can be. The bill corrects a \nproblem and lets our troops risking life and limb know while they are \naway fighting for us, fighting for freedom and democracy, we will be in \nthe Senate fighting for them and fighting for their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation and also to \nconsider cosponsoring this bill with me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a GAO summary, and the text of the bill, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    General Accounting Office,\n\n                                       Washington, DC, May 7, 2004\n     Subject: Military Personnel: Active Duty Compensation and Its \n         Tax Treatment.\n\n     .Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Max S. Baucus,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Mark Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       The Department of Defense's (DOD) total military \n     compensation package for active duty members consists of both \n     cash and noncash benefits. Since the late 1990s, Congress and \n     the DOD have increased military cash compensation by \n     increasing basic pay and allowances for housing, among other \n     things. Military members also receive tax breaks, which are a \n     part of their cash compensation. Moreover, active duty \n     personnel are offered substantial noncash benefits, such as \n     retirement, health care, commissaries, and childcare. In some \n     cases, these noncash benefits exceed those available to \n     private-sector personnel. DOD relies heavily on noncash \n     benefits because it views benefits as critical to morale, \n     retention, and the quality of life for service members and \n     their families.\n       To better understand the military compensation system, you \n     asked us to provide you information on active duty military \n     compensation and its tax treatment. At the outset of this \n     engagement, we agreed to keep you periodically informed of \n     the status of our work. In January 2004, we briefed your \n     staff on our preliminary observations. Because our work \n     identified that the combat zone tax exclusion could impact \n     some service members, you asked us to focus our work on \n     military cash compensation and to do additional work to \n     estimate the effect of the combat zone tax exclusion on \n     service members' compensation. We provided your staff\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\n     subsequent briefings that estimated the effect of the combat \n     zone exclusion. As requested, we have updated and combined \n     the briefings for this report to (1) summarize active duty \n     cash compensation and describe how military compensation \n     varies at different career points for officers and enlisted \n     members; (2) explain how military pay is taxed and any \n     special tax treatment of military compensation; (3) \n     estimate the effects of interactions between the combat \n     zone exclusion and certain tax credits on military \n     members' compensation; and (4) describe the benefits DOD \n     provides active duty members as well as specific programs \n     available to members that encourage wealth building (see \n     enclosure I). To provide a rough estimate of the number of \n     service members in 2003 who suffered a net tax loss \n     because of the interactions between serving in a combat \n     zone and certain tax credits, we used aggregate data \n     compiled by the Defense Manpower Data Center on the number \n     of members who served in a combat zone in 2003 and \n     aggregate data on the percentage of spouses not in the \n     workforce from the 2002 Active Duty Survey. We believe \n     that the data is sufficiently reliable to estimate within \n     a broad range the number of people affected. We conducted \n     our review from October 2003 through April 2004 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n\n                            Results in Brief\n\n       The foundation of military cash compensation is what the \n     DOD calls regular military compensation--the sum of basic \n     pay, nontaxable allowances for housing and subsistence, and \n     the associated federal tax savings. Some members also receive \n     additional cash compensation in the form of special pays, \n     incentives, and other allowances. In total, there are over 50 \n     of these pays, incentives, and allowances, ranging from \n     reenlistment bonuses to clothing allowances and family \n     separation allowances. The annual amounts of these pays, \n     incentives, and allowances range from a few hundred dollars \n     to thousands of dollars, and some of these are also \n     nontaxable. In general, regular military compensation \n     progresses steadily with pay grade and years of service. For \n     example, a junior enlisted member with 3 years of service \n     might earn around $40,000 in cash compensation, while a \n     senior officer with 22 years of service could earn cash \n     compensation of about $130,000.\n       Military service brings with it significant tax advantages. \n     Basic pay and most other pays are generally subject to \n     federal income tax; however, certain allowances are not \n     taxed, such as the basic allowances for housing and \n     subsistence. DOD considers the federal tax advantage as the \n     additional income military members would have to earn in \n     order to receive their current take-home pay if their \n     allowances for housing and subsistence were taxable. In fact, \n     DOD views the federal tax advantage as part of service \n     members' cash compensation when it compares military pay with \n     civilian pay. In addition, pay earned--including basic pay, \n     bonuses, special pays, and allowances--while members are \n     serving in one of the 15 designated combat zones is excluded \n     from taxes.\n       The complex interactions between the combat zone exclusion \n     and certain tax credits (principally the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit) appear to be \n     creating unintended consequences. Specifically, some low-\n     income- earning service members who serve in a combat zone \n     are worse off for tax purposes, while some higher-income-\n     earning members are better off because they become \n     eligible for a tax credit that is normally targeted to \n     low-income workers. Low-income members with children \n     qualify for refundable tax credits that can not only \n     offset all of their tax liability but can also leave them \n     with payments from the government. The combat zone \n     exclusion can actually cause a reduction or elimination of \n     these payments to some service members. For example, over \n     certain income ranges the amount of Earned Income Tax \n     Credit that a taxpayer earns increases as his or her \n     income increases. Service in a combat zone reduces the \n     amount of earned income that a member reports for tax \n     purposes and, thus, can reduce or eliminate the refunded \n     portion of the member's credit. These members actually \n     suffer a net loss in tax benefits because they receive no \n     offsetting advantage from the exclusion. Our analysis \n     suggests that some of the roughly 430,000 members serving \n     in a combat zone in 2003--between 5,000 and 10,000 members \n     in one-earner households--suffered a net loss of tax \n     benefits. Data limitations make it difficult to produce a \n     comprehensive estimate of the number of members who \n     suffered a net loss of tax benefits. In particular, it is \n     more difficult to make a reliable estimate of the number \n     of members with working spouses who had net losses of tax \n     benefits. However, we believe that number is not likely to \n     be much higher than several thousand and could be less \n     than that. Additionally, the number of members losing tax \n     benefits could be larger in 2004 depending on the how many \n     service members are in a combat zone and how long they are \n     there. The amount of the tax benefit loss varies \n     considerably, with a maximum of about $4,500 or $3,200, \n     for enlisted and officer members, respectively. In \n     general, the members losing tax benefits tend to be those \n     who are serving in a combat zone longer than 6 months; who \n     are in the lower pay grades; who are married with \n     children; and who have little to no investment or spousal \n     income. On the other hand, some other low-income members \n     earned larger earned income tax credits by serving in a \n     combat zone than they otherwise would have. Moreover, it \n     appears that a large number of service members who had \n     incomes exceeding the normal upper limit for Earned Income \n     Tax Credit eligibility and who served in a combat zone for \n     at least 6 months could become eligible to receive that \n     credit as a result of this income exclusion. DOD is aware \n     of service members who are disadvantaged and advantaged by \n     these tax provisions, and it is seeking remedies that \n     would require changing the rules of the tax credits so \n     that income earned in a combat zone would not be excluded \n     when calculating eligibility for the tax credits.\n       Benefits are a substantial portion of noncash military \n     compensation. DOD offers a wide range of benefits to active \n     duty members, including health care, retirement, education \n     assistance, and installation-based benefits--that is, \n     services found on military installations, such as \n     commissaries and child care. While the value of benefits to \n     members varies depending on the members' needs, the cost to \n     provide such benefits is substantial. Some of the benefits \n     DOD provides encourage wealth building over a service \n     member's career. Military retirement--a lifetime annuity \n     generally provided to members who serve 20 years or more--\n     is one of the primary wealth-building programs available \n     to military members. However, DOD estimates that less than \n     half of officers and only about 15 percent of enlisted \n     members will become eligible for retirement. In addition, \n     other savings programs are offered, such as the Thrift \n     Savings Plan and the Savings Deposit Program. Since 2001, \n     service members can contribute a percentage of their basic \n     pay, before taxes, to be invested in one or more of the \n     specific funds offered through the Thrift Savings Plan; \n     about 21 percent of the active duty military participate. \n     Service members deployed to a combat zone or other \n     qualified areas can contribute to the Savings Deposit \n     Program, earning a guaranteed 10 percent interest on their \n     investment. However, less than 1 percent of the active \n     duty force participates. Service members may also be \n     eligible to participate in the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs no-money down, mortgage-backed loan program. \n     Moreover, military members can take advantage of a number \n     of wealth-building tax provisions available to citizens, \n     such as deductions for mortgage interest and tax credits \n     for elective retirement accounts contributions.\n\n                 Matter for Congressional Consideration\n\n       If the Congress wishes to remedy the unintended tax \n     consequences associated with the combat zone exclusion, it \n     should consider revising the rules of the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit with respect to \n     income earned in a combat zone.\n\n                         Scope and Methodology\n\n       Our audit work focused on military cash compensation and \n     its tax treatment for active duty service members. To \n     summarize the components of active duty military members' \n     compensation, we reviewed policies, publications, and \n     regulations governing military compensation. We interviewed \n     officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Defense Manpower Data Center. We compiled 2003 data for basic \n     pay tables, basic allowances for housing and subsistence \n     rates, special pay amounts, incentive pay amounts, and \n     allowance pay amounts. To describe how military compensation \n     varies at different career points for officers and enlisted \n     members, we created notional junior and senior enlisted \n     service members and officers. We assigned these hypothetical \n     service members typical years of service for their pay \n     grades, locations across the United States, numbers of \n     dependents, and special pays typical of their pay grades and \n     locations. We discussed our examples with officials from the \n     Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \n     Readiness to ensure that our profiles were reasonable. We \n     identified benefits offered to active duty military members \n     and some associated values by reviewing past GAO reports, DOD \n     documents, and the fiscal year 2002 DOD Actuarial Valuation \n     Report.\n       To explain how military pay is taxed and any special tax \n     treatment of military compensation, we reviewed DOD policies \n     and regulations and the Internal Revenue Services' 2003 Armed \n     Forces Tax Guide publication. To estimate the federal tax \n     advantage of the exclusion of the housing and subsistence \n     allowances from taxation, we estimated the tax liability for \n     hypothetical members according to current tax rules as if the \n     members' housing and subsistence allowances were taxable. We \n     present the pre-tax value of this tax advantage--that is, the \n     additional income the members would have to earn in order to \n     receive their current take home pay if their allowances were \n     taxable.\n       To estimate certain effects of the combat zone exclusion on \n     military members' taxes, we estimated the number of members \n     negatively affected and the number who may become eligible \n     for Earned Income Tax Credit by the combat zone tax \n     exclusion. For more detailed information on how we estimated \n     the combat zone effect, see enclosure II.\n       To describe programs available to members that encourage \n     wealth building, we reviewed documents and interviewed \n     officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs. In addition, we also reviewed \n     other documents to identify tax provisions that encourage \n     wealth building for citizens.\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n                            Agency Comments\n\n       In providing oral comments on a draft of this report, DOD \n     representatives from the Office of the Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Personnel and Readiness stated that they \n     generally concurred with the content of the report. Technical \n     comments were incorporated as appropriate. DOD officials told \n     us that they have been seeking to remedy the unintended tax \n     consequence related to the combat zone tax exclusion. We also \n     received comments on the tax-related sections of our draft \n     from Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In providing oral \n     comments, IRS representatives from the Office of the \n     Commissioner, Wage and Investment Division and the Office of \n     Legislative Affairs said that the IRS could administer a \n     change in law that would include combat pay in earned income \n     for purposes of computing eligibility for the Earned Income \n     Tax Credit. Since earned income used for computing Earned \n     Income Tax Credit is not reported anywhere on the IRS form \n     1040 or Schedule EIC, IRS would modify the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit worksheets and related instructions to account for the \n     combat zone pay. In addition, they would work with DOD to \n     develop a process for identifying and processing returns from \n     taxpayers who would be affected by this provision. The \n     representatives noted that, although at the outset the \n     process would likely be primarily manual, IRS would explore \n     options for automation. The IRS officials also provided \n     technical comments relating to the child tax credit, which we \n     incorporated as appropriate, and made the point that changes \n     to the treatment of income earned in a combat zone for the \n     purposes of the two credits could affect other tax benefits, \n     such as the dependent care credit and the exclusion for \n     employer-provided benefits under a dependent care assistance \n     program, depending on the specific wording of the changes. We \n     also spoke to the Department of Treasury staff about the tax-\n     related sections of our briefing documents and incorporated \n     their technical comments as appropriate.\n       As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce \n     its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this \n     report until 30 days from its issue date. At that time, we \n     will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, in introducing the Tax Relief for Americans in \nCombat Act. I applaud Senator Pryor for his commitment to our Armed \nForces. The study and the bill that he has unveiled today provide just \none example of that commitment.\n  Last year, Senator Pryor asked me to join him in requesting a study \non the compensation received by our military personnel, and the tax \ntreatment of this compensation. This study has been completed. Many of \nthe results are encouraging. But the study reveals one significant \nglitch in the tax law that is hurting many of our low-income military \npersonnel.\n  For the most part, the compensation packages received by our military \npersonnel are competitive with the private sector. And the Tax Code \nprovides many incentives for military service. But as the GAO study \nreveals, some low-income military personnel are losing out because they \nhave been called to serve in a combat zone.\n  Now this just does not make sense. Why would we penalize those \nmilitary personnel who are serving our country in Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand elsewhere around the world?\n  Let me explain. Under current law, compensation earned by military \npersonnel while they are serving in a combat zone is exempt from income \ntax. This provides most military personnel in these areas with a very \nsignificant tax benefit. Because of a glitch in the tax law, however, \ncertain individuals may actually end up losing money because of this \nexemption.\n  This is because the law is preventing them from receiving the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit and Refundable Child Tax Credit that they would \notherwise been entitled to. These credits are based on earned income, \nand the law says that combat zone income does not qualify as earned \nincome. GAO has found that as many as 10,000 men and women serving in \ncombat will see a reduction or elimination of their EITC or child \ncredit, they will, in effect, lose money.\n  This bill would fix that glitch in the law, and provide these \nindividuals with the tax credits to which they are entitled.\n  Our brave men and women in the Armed Forces put their lives on the \nline for our Nation every day. It is the least we can do to ensure that \nthey are being properly compensated and receiving all the tax benefits \nthat are due to them under the law. Given the ongoing conflict in Iraq \nand the war on terrorism, it is more important than ever that we \nvigilantly oversee the tax system to ensure that our troops are being \ntreated fairly.\n  I applaud Senator Pryor for taking the lead. I am proud to join him \nin introducing legislation to correct these errors and ensure our \nservice men and women receive the proper level of tax relief they \ndeserve. Serving our country is one of the most honorable services a \ncitizen can provide. Now it is up to us to provide them with the tax \ncompensation they are due.\n  I hope that the Senate will take up and pass this bill at the \nearliest appropriate time, and make sure that our men and women in \nuniform receive the tax relief to which they are entitled.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida:\n  S. 2420. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to make \nall uninsured children eligible for the State children's health \ninsurance program, to encourage States to increase the number of \nchildren enrolled in the Medicaid and State children's health insurance \nprograms by simplifying the enrollment and renewal procedures for those \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, Expansion Act of 2004. This \nCongress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program in the late \n1990s. It has been a great success. There are 5 million American \nchildren today who have quality medical insurance because of this \nprogram; without this program there would be another 5 million \nAmericans uninsured.\n  The expansion of this legislation in 2004 would allow States to \nexpand health coverage under the SCHIP program to all uninsured \nchildren, regardless of their family income. It would also provide \ncritical funding for this important program.\n  This week is Cover the Uninsured Week. This is a collaborative effort \nof the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and many other organizations \nhighlighting the vast number of uninsured in this country and the need \nto find a solution.\n  Yesterday, I introduced legislation with Senators Daschle and Kennedy \nwhich will call for the Nation to cover all Americans by the year 2006. \nThe goal of universal coverage is one that I believe every Member of \nthis Senate\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nshares. Based on the experience of the last decade, it is my judgment \nthat the road to achieving that goal of full coverage begins with a \nfirst step. We have not taken a significant first step on the road to \nclosing the gap now in over 5 years. In that 5-year period, we have \nseen a dramatic increase in the number of uninsured Americans, \nincluding uninsured children.\n  We could take that first step by providing health coverage for all \nchildren. That step will be a large one.\n  Today, there are an estimated 9 million American children under the \nage of 19 who are uninsured for their health care. Over 640,000 of \nthose children live in my home State of Florida. There are other large \ngroups of uninsured Americans, however, and one might ask, why pick out \nchildren from this large group of uninsured Americans? The goal is to \ncover all Americans. The reality is the effort to accomplish that \nobjective in one giant step has proven to be without success. Uninsured \nchildren, in my judgment, represent the group that we should start \nwith, for the following reasons.\n\n  We know this about uninsured children: They are four times more \nlikely to delay seeking care than insured children, and they are five \ntimes more likely than insured children to use an emergency room for \nregular medical care. Lack of timely treatment can turn a simple health \nproblem into a serious childhood illness. Covering children is cost \neffective, and more important, it improves the lives of children. It \ncan, in fact, save the lives of children. Let me give two common \nexamples.\n  Ear infections are a very common affliction of young children and \neasily treated with an inexpensive antibiotic. However, if that ear \ninfection is not diagnosed and not treated, the infection can mature \ninto deafness and learning disabilities. What happens when an \nunvaccinated child is struck with bacterial meningitis? Failure to \ndiagnose and treat this contagious disease with an antibiotic can lead \nto brain damage, even to death.\n  Our Nation's publicly funded health programs play a critical role in \nproviding access to care in order to prevent such occurrences. As I \nsaid in the beginning, SCHIP has made an enormous difference in the \nhealth and lives of over 5 million American children, many of whom are \nfrom working families.\n  We know 8 out of 10 of the currently uninsured Americans come from a \nfamily in which one or both parents are working.\n  Despite the success of SCHIP, States have taken to such tactics as \ncapping enrollment and placing limits on eligibility and benefits. I am \nsorry to have to report some of the things that have happened in my \nState, not because they are peculiar, but because they are increasingly \nrepresentative of what is happening in States across America.\n  Until recently, Florida had amassed a waiting list of children who \nwere eligible for the SCHIP program but who were not being served, \nprimarily because of limitations on State funds to match the Federal \nfunds. We had a waiting list of nearly 100,000 Florida children. \nAlthough most of these children have since been temporarily enrolled, \nthe Florida SCHIP program has eliminated all outreach activities; that \nis, those activities that had informed families about the availability \nof these programs have been eliminated. Florida has also restricted \neligibility for children in families whose employers offer any kind of \ndependent coverage, regardless of its cost.\n  If there is one thing we know, it is that one of the factors that is \nfueling the increase in the numbers of uninsured Americans is that even \nwhen employers provide at least the appearance of health insurance \ncoverage but that coverage is so expensive that it amounts to more than \n5, sometimes almost 10 percent of that family's income, and as \navailable as it may appear, in real economic terms it is not available. \nYet in my State, I am sad to report that a child who has fallen into \nthat circumstance will not any longer be considered eligible for the \nSCHIP program.\n  Florida has eliminated its SCHIP waiting list. No one in the future \nwill ever say that Florida has nearly 100,000 children who are eligible \nfor but not receiving SCHIP coverage because there will not be any list \nof children who are waiting for their opportunity to be covered. This \nis a means by which knowledge of the number of uninsured children who \nare denied access to the program will be denied to the people of \nFlorida, as will, therefore, their ability to influence public policy \nto increase the health care coverage of the children of Florida.\n\n  What would the legislation I introduce today do to address these \nproblems? First, it would allow States to expand health coverage to \nuninsured children, regardless of the income, so that no child goes \nwithout necessary care.\n  Second, it would provide Federal financial support to assure the \nlong-term stability of the SCHIP program. To meet congressional budget \nlimits, Federal funding for SCHIP declined by over $1 billion a year, \nbeginning in the fiscal year 2002, and running through the current \nfiscal year of 2004. That reduction, which is referred to as the CHIP \ndip, has brought the Federal funds available for children's health \ninsurance from $4 billion annually down to $3 billion.\n  The consequence of this is that many States which had a fully \noperational SCHIP program--that is, they were using the full amount of \nthe pre-2002 Federal funds--are now facing another component of their \nfiscal crisis.\n  The SCHIP Expansion Act would restore Federal funding allotments to \ntheir pre-2002 level, assurance that States could continue to cover \nmore uninsured children.\n  The legislation would also invest additional resources in SCHIP, \nallowing States that are currently using all of their Federal funds to \nexpand their programs, providing relief to many States that anticipate \na shortage of funding in the near future.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that by 2007, on \nthe current course, 39 States will have spent their entire funding \nallotments. Additional funds are necessary to allow these States to \ncontinue to reach new currently uncovered, uninsured children. Many of \nour uninsured children are, in fact, already eligible for coverage \nunder SCHIP, but where you have limitations in Federal or State funds, \nthey are not enrolled. Effective outreach and streamlined enrollment \nare keys to improving coverage.\n  SCHIP expansion will help States cover more children by increasing \nfunds for outreach in States. That will simplify the enrollment \nprocess.\n  Finally, this legislation will prohibit States that have not \nexhausted all available Federal funds from capping enrollment in their \nSCHIP program. Where enrollment is capped, children are put on a \nwaiting list--if the State has not done what Florida has done, which is \nto eliminate the waiting list, and they will go without coverage. \nWithout coverage, their parents must choose between paying for rent and \npaying for medicine for their sick children.\n  Have we not reached a sad state of affairs in this Nation when many \nof our elder citizens have to make a choice between paying for \nprescription drugs or eating a nutritious meal three times a day, and \nthat many of our parents of young children who are sick and without \nmedical insurance must make a choice between paying the rent or paying \nfor the medicine for their child?\n  My bill assures no family faces such a choice as a result of an \narbitrary enrollment tax. States which choose to participate in SCHIP \nmust be willing to participate fully and cover as many children as they \ncan with the funds they have available. There is no reason in a nation \nof unsurpassed wealth and of unsurpassed medical talent that any child \nshould be without health insurance coverage.\n  Investment in proven effective public programs is imperative.\n  Although our overall goal is universal coverage, assuring that all \nchildren have access to quality health care is a crucial first step. In \nmy opinion, steps 2 and 3 should be to cover the working poor and the \nearly retirees. These steps won't achieve the goal of full coverage \neven in conjunction with the full coverage of children, but they will \nsignificantly close the gap of those Americans today who are without \nhealth coverage.\n  The SCHIP expansion program represents a serious and long overdue \ncommitment to expanding coverage for the most vulnerable in our \nsociety, our young boys and girls. This measure has\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nthe support of the Children's Defense Fund, Catholic Charities USA, the \nAssociation of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and Families USA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Association of Maternal and\n\n\n                                        Child Health Programs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Association of Maternal and Child \n     Health Programs (AMCHP) supports your efforts to ensure that \n     children have access to health care coverage through the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). All \n     children deserve quality health care.\n       The SCHIP Expansion Act of 2004 highlights the vital \n     importance of the SCHIP program in assuring the health of our \n     nation's children. The bill provides states with financial \n     incentives to continue to expand the number of children \n     covered by SCHIP. At the same time, the bill prevents states \n     from rolling back coverage by capping enrollment.\n       AMCHP is a national, nonprofit organization that represents \n     state public health leaders administering family health \n     programs. These family health programs serve over 27 million, \n     children and youth, including almost 18 million children. Our \n     members serve insured, underinsured, and uninsured women, \n     children and their families.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important issue \n     and we look forward to working with you to address the needs \n     of the 8 million uninsured children in this country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deborah Dietrich,\n                         Director, Center for Policy and Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I call upon this Congress to act and to act \nthis year to pass this important legislation, and to remove from the \nrolls of the uninsured for health coverage Americans, at least those \nmost fragile and vulnerable, those we love the most, our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 2421. A bill to modernize the health care system through the use \nof information technology and to reduce costs, improve quality, and \nprovide a new focus on prevention with respect to health care; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Health Care Modernization, Cost \nReduction, and Quality Improvement Act addresses three serious and \nrelated problems in our health care system that affect every American \nfamily: Health care costs are too high and are rising too rapidly. The \nquality of care received by too many patients is well below the \nstandard that we are capable of achieving. In fact, the gap between the \ncare we actually provide and the care we should be providing is so \ngreat that the prestigious Institute of Medicine has referred to it as \na ``quality chasm.'' Our system lavishes funds on sickness care and \nneglects the health promotion and disease prevention activities that \nare the most effective ways of reducing health costs and assuring good \nhealth for as many of our people as possible.\n  The legislation we are introducing is an effective way to modernize \nand improve the health care system, by using modern information \ntechnology, by paying for value and results and not simply for \nprocedures performed or patients admitted to hospitals, and by focusing \non improving quality and preventing disease.\n  Controlling the soaring cost of health care is essential. In the year \n2000, health insurance premiums grew 8 percent--two and a half times \nthe cost of living. In 2001, premiums went up 11 percent--six times the \nConsumer Price Index. They went up 13 percent in 2002, and 14 percent \nin 2003--almost eight times the cost of living increase. By any \nstandard, increases like that are unsustainable.\n  We have to bring these costs under control--but there is a right way \nand a wrong way to do it. Arbitrary cutbacks for hard-pressed hospitals \nand physicians are the wrong remedy.\n  With emergency rooms bursting at the seams, nursing shortages \nthreatening the quality of care, and physicians forced to spend less \ntime with more patients, we have an obligation to all our health \nproviders as well. They're the backbone of our health care system, and \nwe have an obligation to help them provide the quality care that every \npatient deserves.\n  Fortunately, the right way to control costs is also the right way to \nachieve higher quality care. It's based on an emerging consensus of \nhealth experts and practitioners. It involves four fundamental \nprinciples--using information technology, paying for results, improving \nquality, and investing in prevention.\n  The gap is vast and growing between information technology and the \ncurrent practice of medicine. Health care in America is the best in the \nworld, but it is also one of the least efficient industries in America. \nWe spend a staggering $480 billion a year on administration alone--more \nthan 30 cents of every dollar spent on care. Over a quarter of all \npersonnel in the health care system today are performing administrative \ntasks, not providing care.\n  The potential savings through modern technology are immense. \nTransactions in health care cost $12 to $25 apiece. Brokers and bankers \nused to have similar costs, but now, a transaction in these industries \ncosts less than one cent.\n  Information technology can also improve the quality of care, at the \nsame time it reduces costs. Automated patient record-keeping can help \nbring real coordination to what is often a frighteningly fragmented \nhealth care system.\n  Today, for one in five patients with significant health problems, \nvarious health professionals order duplicate tests and procedures. One \nin four patients arrive for a doctor's appointment and find that needed \ntest results or records are not available. Information technology can \nend this waste of time and resources and also prevent the errors that \nreduce quality. Automated prescribing, for example, has reduced errors \nby 95 percent, and reduced hospital costs by an amazing 13 percent. \nIt's time to end the disconnect between modern health care and modern \ninformation technology, and the savings will be immense.\n  The gap between the best standard of care and the care that too many \npatients receive is staggering. A quarter of all breast cancer patients \nreceive substandard care. A third of all patients diagnosed with high \nblood pressure receive substandard care. Half of asthma patients \nreceive substandard care. Sixty percent of patients with pneumonia \nreceive substandard care. Almost 80 percent of patients with a hip \nfracture receive substandard care.\n  The Midwest Business Group on Health estimates that poor quality care \ncosts employers $2,000 a worker every year. Improving quality can cut \ncosts dramatically. But more important, it can reduce unnecessary \nsuffering. For patients and their families, good quality care can truly \nmean the difference between life and death, and between disability and \nhealth.\n  One of the highest barriers to improving the quality of care is the \nbackward incentive system embedded in the way we pay for care. We need \nto start rewarding the quality care by paying for results, and not just \nfor the number of procedures performed or the number of hospital \nadmissions. Too often, the incentives today are geared to doing more--\nnot doing better. It makes no sense that doing better today can \nactually result in even greater financial hardship for health care \ninstitutions. If hospitals organize patient-tracking, home visits, and \npatient education to improve care for chronic diseases, they can reduce \nhospitalization dramatically. But the hospitals won't get paid much, if \nanything, for these improvements--and they will no longer receive the \nlarge reimbursements they would otherwise receive for inpatient care. \nUse of doctors specially trained to manage hospital intensive care \nunits has been shown to reduce costs and improve outcomes. But fewer \ndays in the ICU mean lower revenues for hospitals. That's wrong, and we \nneed to correct it.\n  Hospitals in Boston have already negotiated terms with insurers under \nwhich they are paid for results, rather than days of care. Some \nbusiness associations, such as the Leapfrog Group, have begun to make \nquality standards a condition for participation in their insurance \nplans. the Department of Health and Human Services is testing the use \nof incentive payments to hospitals that meet specific quality \nstandards. These steps are hopeful, but we need to make payment for \nresults the rule, rather than the exception, in all aspects of our \nhealth care system.\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\n  Another key step is to assure that the typical standard of care comes \nmuch closer to the best standard of care. We need to do far more to see \nthat what we know how to do for patients is actually what is done.\n  Opportunities are immense for improvements by targeting specific \ndiseases that have high incidence, high costs, and high impact on \nindividuals and families. Diabetes, for example, afflicts 17 million \nAmericans. Patients with the disease account for one in ten dollars of \noverall health expenditures and one in four dollars of expenditures by \nMedicare. By using proven methods of prevention and treatment, we can \nsave 10 million Americans from diabetes-related amputations, \ndisability, or blindness during their lives--and save more than 50 \nbillion dollars a year as well.\n  Stroke is another example of the huge gap between what we could do \nand what we actually do. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and \none of the major causes of disability. It strikes nearly 750,000 \nAmericans each year. The economic cost is also staggering. The United \nStates spends almost $50 billion a year in caring for persons who have \nsuffered a stroke. Appropriate, timely intervention with clot-\ndissolving drugs has been shown to reduce disability and death by 55 \npercent but only three percent of patients receive the needed \ntreatment.\n  Chronic illnesses are major costs in the current system. Medicare \nbeneficiaries with three or more chronic conditions account for almost \n90 percent of Medicare spending. Well-organized care for patients with \nchronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, asthma, \nand depression produce significant reductions in costs and significant \nimprovements in outcomes. But only a fraction of patients with chronic \nconditions have the opportunity to benefit from such treatment.\n  Finally, to cut costs and promote quality, we can do much more to \nstop illness before it starts. Health promotion and disease prevention \nmust be central to our health system as hospital and physician care. \nFour hundred thousand Americans require medical treatment every year \nfor diseases that are fully preventable by vaccination. Lack of \nexercise and poor diet cost almost $80 billion a year because of \nincreased heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.\n  The legislation being introduced today is a recipe for a peaceful \nrevolution in the way health care in the United States is delivered. \nBuilding on a growing expert consensus, it provides a blueprint for a \nbetter health care system that will be lower in cost, higher in \nquality, and more closely oriented toward prevention.\n  To assure that modern information technology will be fully utilized \nin health care, the legislation sets a goal of full implementation of a \nbroad-based system of electronic medical records and automated bill-\npaying. It authorizes grants, loans and loan guarantees for health \nproviders to install and implement clinical information systems that \nmeet national technical standards for parameters such as security and \ninteroperability.\n  The bill also offers larger reimbursements for providers who \nimplement these types of information systems. Over a period of time, it \nreduces payments for large health care facilities that fail to do so. \nThe legislation also encourages the use of information technology to \nreduce the administrative costs, by requiring insurance companies to \nadopt the same types of computerized transaction-processing systems \nthat are the norm in other industries.\n  In these ways, the legislation begins the needed effort to enable the \nhealth care system to become a system that pays for value, rather than \nsolely for procedures performed or illnesses treated. The Secretary of \nHHS is required to set quality standards for providers of services. \nPublic and private payers will be required, through their reimbursement \nprocedures, to reward the attainment of these quality standards, and \nare permitted to reduce reimbursements to providers who fail to meet \nthe standards.\n  When a provider of services believes it can provide higher quality \ncare at lower cost, but feels that existing reimbursement procedures \nwill not fairly recognize these innovations, payers are required to \nenter into good faith negotiations with providers to reach agreement on \nan alternative payment system. The legislation also has special \nprovisions for payment for chronic care services in recognition of the \nspecial role of coordination of care, patient education, tracking, and \nfollow-up in achieving quality care for individuals with chronic \ndiseases.\n  Finally, the legislation contains a number of important initiatives \nto improve the quality of care and strengthen health promotion and \ndisease prevention. These include the establishment of a National \nQuality Council, and specific initiatives on diabetes, stroke, \narthritis, nutrition, exercise, adult oral health, adult immunizations, \nand the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate care for \npatients whose primary language is not English.\n  America's health care system cannot continue to lurch from crisis to \ncrisis. Our people deserve affordable care, and when illness strikes, \nthey deserve the best care our system can provide. This legislation \nlays out a number of important steps to achieve this objective, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the broader \nhealth community to achieve the important goals we share.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 2422. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain modifications to be made to qualified mortgages held by a REMIC \nor a grantor trust; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Real Estate \nMortgage Investment Conduit Modernization Act. I am pleased to join my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Conrad, in introducing this legislation \nto accelerate economic growth for every American community.\n  A Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) is a tax vehicle \ncreated by Congress in 1986 to support the housing market and \ninvestment in real estate by making it simpler to issue real estate-\nbacked securities.\n  By pooling real estate loans into mortgage backed securities, REMICs \noffer residential and commercial real estate borrowers access to large \npools of capital that would not otherwise be available. REMICs allow \ncommercial banks and other lenders to sell their loans in the capital \nmarkets, thus freeing up assets for additional lending and investments. \nBecause they contribute to the efficiency and liquidity of the U.S. \nreal estate markets, REMICs help to minimize the costs of residential \nand commercial real estate borrowing and to spur real estate \ndevelopment and rehabilitation.\n  REMICs play a critical role in providing capital for residential and \ncommercial mortgages. As of September 30, 2003, the value of single-\nfamily, multi-family and commercial-mortgage backed REMICs outstanding \nwas over $1.2 trillion. While the current volume of REMIC transactions \nreflects their important role in this market, certain changes to the \ntax code will eliminate impediments and unleash even greater potential. \nCurrent rules that govern REMICs often prevent many common loan \nmodifications that facilitate loan administration and ensure repayment \nof investors.\n  The legislation that created REMICs has not been updated in nearly 20 \nyears. Our legislation will update the REMIC provisions of the tax \ncode. These proposed changes are simple, non-controversial, and will \ngreatly enhance the ability of commercial real estate interests to \nobtain capital for financing new construction projects.\n  These changes would ultimately benefit the entire real estate \ncommunity, including local real estate owners, builders, construction \nmanagers, the engineering, architectural and interior design firms that \nprovide real estate services, as well as firms that offer services to \nsupport real estate sales. The changes would accelerate the creation of \njobs and economic activity throughout the U.S., and would have a \npositive effect on federal and state tax revenues. By encouraging \nproperty renovations and expansions, these changes would strengthen the \nlocal property tax base in towns and cities across America.\n  We urge our colleagues to work with us to enact this legislation to \nspur economic and employment growth in real\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nestate, the construction trades, and the building materials industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am happy to join my friend and Finance \nCommittee colleague, Mr. Smith, to introduce The Real Estate Mortgage \nInvestment Conduit Modernization Act. This is a measure that will help \nexpand access to capital for real estate investment across the nation \nand especially in rural areas like my home State of North Dakota.\n  Growth in the commercial real estate market over the last decade has \nbeen fueled, in part, by a strong and growing secondary market for \ncommercial mortgages. That market is structured through real estate \nmortgage investment conduits (REMICs). Created by Congress in 1986, \nREMICs are critically important to U.S. real estate finance, providing \nnew capital and expanded access to that capital. They have proven to be \na cost-effective method for the private sector to create pools of \ncapital that are made available across the nation.\n  It is time to modernize the REMIC law because many borrowers have \nbeen stymied in attempts to make improvements to the mortgaged \nproperties. For example, if a property is in a REMIC, the property \nowner is effectively precluded from adding a parking garage to an \nexisting building. That is because the 1986 tax rules treat that \nimprovement as a collateral modification triggering a deemed exchange \nof a new loan for the old loan thereby violating REMIC regulations.\n  Unlike home mortgages, which are rarely modified, commercial loans \nrequire flexibility in dealing with changing circumstances in order to \nsupport the borrower's ongoing business property. The bill we are \nintroducing today will add this needed flexibility to the tax code, \nincreasing the ability of property owners to invest in improvements.\n  I urge our colleagues to help us harness the full potential of \nmortgage-backed securities to provide improved access to capital to \nAmerica's businesses--big and small. Please join us in working to enact \nthe Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Modernization Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5481-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5481-S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 360--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \n    LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION SHALL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE \n                                INTERNET\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S. Res. 360\n\n       Whereas an open and free exchange of information about the \n     legislative process is critical to ensuring the success and \n     health of a democracy;\n       Whereas the public should have easy and timely electronic \n     access to public records of Congress;\n       Whereas congressional documents that are placed in the \n     Congressional Record are made available to the public \n     electronically by the Superintendent of Documents of the \n     Government Printing Office, under the direction of the Public \n     Printer, but it is often difficult and time-consuming for the \n     public to access and locate such documents;\n        Whereas many official congressional documents are not \n     placed in the Congressional Record and are unavailable \n     electronically to the public; and\n       Whereas the current system for electronic public access to \n     legislative information and legislative resources, as \n     maintained by the Library of Congress, could be improved, and \n     should be continuously upgraded to keep pace with advances in \n     website technology: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Library of Congress shall continue to provide and \n     maintain a website for public access to legislative \n     documents;\n       (2) the website shall provide access to as much information \n     about current and historical legislative documents as is \n     reasonably practicable;\n       (3) the Library of Congress shall provide sufficient \n     financial and personnel resources to maintain the website at \n     modern standards of accessibility and usability; and\n       (4) offices and personnel that develop and maintain \n     congressional documents shall cooperate to the maximum extent \n     practicable with the Library of Congress to ensure that the \n     Library of Congress website has full and prompt access to all \n     publicly available congressional documents.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senators McCain, \nFeingold, Cornyn, Leahy, and Bingaman, I am submitting a resolution \ndesigned to make it easier for the American people to get information \nabout Congress from the Internet.\n  Almost 10 years ago, the Library of Congress started the THOMAS \nwebsite, which was one of the first electronic references for the \npublic to get up-to-date information about legislation. The\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nLibrary did a tremendous job getting THOMAS ready, and I commend their \nhard work in maintaining it over the past 10 years. However, THOMAS \nrecently has begun to show its age. Although there have been some \nimprovements over time, the Library has been unable to devote the \nresources necessary to keep THOMAS up to the level the public expects \nfor today's websites. One reason is that the Library has never been \nformally told by either Chamber of Congress that it has a \nresponsibility to maintain a website for public access to legislative \ninformation.\n  In contrast, the Congressional Research Service was given a mandate \nto maintain a legislative information website for Members of Congress \nand their staffs in the 1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations \nconference report. The Legislative Information System that Congress \nuses is vastly superior to THOMAS, both in terms of functionality and \nease of use. For example, LIS users are able to search across multiple \nCongresses to find information about bills; THOMAS users must search \neach Congress individually. In LIS, links to committee reports, if \navailable, are provided along with the basic information about a bill. \nIn THOMAS, a user must make a separate search to find the report. In \nLIS, the names of bill sponsors can be clicked on to find other bills \nsponsored by that Member; that feature is not available in THOMAS. And \nanyone who has used both LIS and THOMAS has seen that the LIS site is \nmuch more attractive and usable, and has benefited from continual \nimprovements that have not been matched on THOMAS. When it comes to \nobtaining the public legislative information of Congress, there should \nnot be such a significant difference between what we use and what the \npublic uses.\n  Obviously, the American people have the right to see all the public \ndocuments of Congress. And, if we are to be true to our nation's \ndemocratic values, this information should be as easy to find as \npossible. It is not sufficient that those who are truly interested can \nmake the extra effort necessary to find what they need; we should be \nencouraging people to become interested. Americans should be able to \neasily go to the Internet and get legislative information directly from \nCongress, instead of having to rely on what they see and hear from \nothers. We can facilitate this by creating a visually appealing, \nhelpful, useful, and accessible public portal to the United States \nCongress.\n  Although THOMAS was a good start, it badly needs to be improved. This \nresolution will tell the Library of Congress that the Senate is paying \nattention, and that we will insist on that improvement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and help ensure we \nhave a public legislative information website we can be proud of.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, government transparency is fundamental to \ndemocracy. This well-known truism is a staple of every sermon about \ndemocracy. We sometimes take it for granted, but we shouldn't--\nespecially today. For one thing, the world is watching if and how we \npractice what we preach. For another, during this most partisan of \npolitical times, it is essential that citizens be able to judge us not \nonly on what we say, but on what we do.\n  Therefore, I am particularly pleased to join today with Senators \nCorzine, Cornyn, Feingold, Bingaman and Lieberman to submit a \nresolution that will provide citizens with expanded and more easily \naccessible information about legislation and the legislative process.\n  In particular, we are calling on the Library of Congress to improve \nits public website, called ``THOMAS,'' in order to provide as much \nlegislative information as is reasonably practical. In addition, \nbecause Internet technology continues to advance so rapidly, we are \nasking the Library to maintain THOMAS in a manner that reflects current \nstandards of accessibility and usability.\n  In December of 2003, together with Senator Corzine and others, I \nwrote to Dr. James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and asked him \nto redesign THOMAS to provide, as much as possible, information to the \ngeneral public that is already available to congressional staff through \nthe congressional Legislative Information System. Dr. Billington and \nhis staff agreed to work with us to improve THOMAS, and the resolution \nwe introduce today is a result of this constructive process. I would \nlike to thank Dr. Billington and his staff for their cooperation and \ntheir appreciation of the importance of this effort.\n  The Library of Congress has a well-known and well-deserved reputation \nas a source of reliable, unbiased, and comprehensive information. Our \nresolution will harness the power of the Information Age to allow \ncitizens to see more public records of the Senate in their official \nform, in context, and without editorial comment.\n  The taxpayers of this country, who pay millions of dollars a year to \nfund the Library of Congress, as well as to fund Congress itself, \ndeserve speedy access to this public information. They have a right to \nsee that their money is being spent well. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, \n``Information is the currency of democracy.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 361--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF NATIONAL MARINA DAY AND \nURGING MARINAS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY GATEWAYS \n                               TO BOATING\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 361\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States highly value their \n     recreational time and their ability to access the waterways \n     of the United States, one of the Nation's greatest natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas in 1928, the National Association of Engine and \n     Boat Manufacturers first used the word ``marina'' to describe \n     a recreational boating facility;\n       Whereas the United States is home to more than 12,000 \n     marinas that contribute substantially to local communities by \n     providing safe and reliable gateways to boating;\n       Whereas the marinas of the United States serve as stewards \n     of the environment and actively seek to protect the waterways \n     that surround them for the enjoyment of this generation and \n     generations to come;\n       Whereas the marinas of the United States provide \n     communities and visitors with a place where friends and \n     families, united by a passion for the water, can come \n     together for recreation, rest, and relaxation; and\n       Whereas the Marina Operators Association of America has \n     designated August 14, 2004, as ``National Marina Day'' to \n     increase awareness among citizens, policymakers, and elected \n     officials about the many contributions that marinas make to \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of National Marina Day; and\n       (2) urges that the marinas of the United States continue to \n     provide environmentally friendly gateways to boating for the \n     people of the United States.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation \ndesignating August 14, 2004, as National Marina Day to honor America's \nmarinas for their many contributions to local communities. This year's \ncelebration will be held in Georgia on Lake Sidney Lanier, one of the \nlargest U.S. Army Corps of Engineer lakes in the nation, and home to 10 \nmarinas. National Marina Day was created by the Marine Operators \nAssociation of America to educate civic leaders, government leaders, \nand the public about the important role that the marina industry plays \nin cities and towns across America as family-friendly gateways to \nboating and outdoor recreation.\n  Georgia's Lake Lanier consists of 39,000 acres of water and 692 miles \nof shoreline. The lake was originally authorized by the United States \nCongress in 1946 for the purposes of power production, flood control, \ndownstream navigation, and fish and wildlife management. Over the \nyears, recreation has become a major factor in the lake's attraction to \n8 million visitors each year. According to a recent study commissioned \nby the Metro Atlanta Marine Trade Association, Lake Lanier generates \nnearly $5.5 billion in annual economic impact from jobs created on and \naround the lake, restaurants, hotels and resorts, camping and \nrecreation, real estate sales, boat and marine dealers, and marinas.\n  National Marina Day will be held for the third year in a row, is set \nto have its most successful year yet, in no small part by the tireless \nwork of the President of the Marina Operators of Lake Lanier, Kirby Cay \nScheimann, State Representative Stacy Reece of\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nGainesville, Georgia, the President of the Marina Operators Association \nof America, Bill Anderson, and the President of the International \nMarina Institute, Gregg Kenney. I am grateful for all the hard work \nthat everyone involved has contributed to making National Marina Day a \nhuge success.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 362--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n DEDICATION OF THE NATIONAL WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL ON MAY 29, 2004, IN \n RECOGNITION OF THE DUTY, SACRIFICES, AND VALOR OF THE MEMBERS OF THE \n      ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. Graham of Florida (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Reed, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Biden, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Graham  of South Carolina, \nMr. Talent, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bond, \nMr. Voinovich, Mr. Miller, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nFitzgerald, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Burns, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Reid, \nMr. Sessions, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \nHatch, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. McCain, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nSmith, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Nickles, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Ensign, \nMr. Carper, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nEnzi, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Allen, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Allard) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on Saturday, May 29th, we will dedicate a \nnational memorial to the more than 16 million men and women who served \nfrom December 1940 to August 1945 in our Army, Army Air Force, Navy, \nMarine Corps, Coast Guard and Merchant Marines, as well as the 400,000 \nmen and women who gave their lives during World War II.\n  The memorial is a fitting tribute to all who served and contributed \nto the war effort at home and abroad. When visitors enter the memorial, \nthey are greeted with an inscription that puts the memorial, its \nplacement on the National Mall and its importance to our nation into \nperspective: ``Here in the presence of Washington and Lincoln, one the \n18th century father and the other the 19th century preserver of our \nnation, we honor those 20th century Americans who took up the struggle \nduring the Second World War and made the sacrifices to perpetuate the \ngift of our forefathers entrusted to us: a nation conceived in liberty \nand justice.''\n  The memorial, composed of bronze and granite, has a memorial plaza \nand a rainbow pool as its main features. These features symbolize the \ntotality of the war effort, both at home and overseas. Its two arches \ndepict the two theaters of the war--the Atlantic and the Pacific. The \nfifty-six pillars represent every state and territory that committed \nmen and women to the effort. A ``freedom wall'' with 4,000 sculpted \ngold stars commemorates the more than 400,000 Americans who died while \nserving in the armed forces during the war.\n  I hope that for generations to come, this memorial, will etch into \nthe collective memory of all Americans who visit the sense of duty, \npatriotism, valor and sacrifice of the millions of citizens--men and \nwomen, from all walks of life, from America's farms and cities, made up \nof all races, religions and ethnicities--who served and who answered \ntheir nation's call in a time of great need.\n  This memorial is truly a shrine to democracy. World War II was a test \nof our Nation's democracy, against the forces of fascism and \ntotalitarianism, which threatened to engulf the globe. Americans \ncombated this evil as citizens of the world's bastion of democracy. It \nis only fitting that around each memorial flagpole--flying the symbol \nof a free and democratic people--is inscribed, ``Americans came to \nliberate, not to conquer, to restore freedom and to end tyranny.''\n  America's spirit was captured by President Franklin Roosevelt when he \nsaid of his countrymen, ``They have given their sons to the military \nservices. They have stoked the furnaces and hurried the factory wheels. \nThey have made the planes and welded the tanks, riveted the ships and \nrolled the shells.'' It was through the collective contribution of \nmillions of Americans that victory was ultimately achieved.\n  At war's end, General Douglas McArthur said it best when accepting \nthe surrender of the Japanese in Tokyo Bay, ``Today the guns are \nsilent. The great tragedy has ended. A great victory has been won. The \nskies no longer rain death--the seas bear only commerce--men everywhere \nwalk upright in the sunlight. The entire world is quietly at peace.''\n  I hope that when Americans visit this memorial and pay tribute to the \nmillions of veterans who served to preserve our freedom, they will \nrealize there was a time when the mission was clear, the cause was just \nand righteous and Americans were united in their quest for victory. As \na nation, we honor the memory of ordinary Americans who were asked by \ntheir country\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nto perform extraordinary feats, rose to the challenge and will forever \nbe remembered.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, that would resolve \nit to be the sense of the Senate to express the grateful thanks of the \nnation to the more than 16 million veterans who served in the Army, \nArmy Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine in \nWorld War II and to the millions of Americans on the home front who \ncontributed to the war effort during World War II and to recognize the \ndedication of the National World War II Memorial on the National Mall \nin Washington, the District of Columbia, on May 29, 2004, as an \noccasion to acknowledge and pay tribute to the duty, sacrifices and \nvalor of all members of the Armed Forces of the United States who \nserved in World War II, a group known collectively as the ``Greatest \nGeneration.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/13/senate-section/article/S5484-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3150.
