Mr. President, today we will begin a period of morning \nbusiness for up to 60 minutes. The majority will control the first half \nof that time and the minority will control the remaining second half. \nFollowing the 1 hour of morning business, the Senate will resume the \npending intelligence reform legislation.\n  I do once again congratulate the chairman and ranking member, \nSenators Collins and Lieberman, for their opening remarks yesterday. I \nam pleased we are now underway on this historic bill. We had a good \nstart yesterday. We had a number of Members participating in the debate \nyesterday. Three amendments were offered, and they are now pending.\n  It would be my hope we could continue to make progress on the bill \nover the course of today, continue the good progress from yesterday and \ndispose of a number of amendments in addition to the ones that have \nbeen offered. Thus, we can expect votes over the course of the day on \nthe intelligence reform amendments.\n  As is usual on a Tuesday, we will be breaking from 12:30 to 2:15 for \nthe weekly policy luncheons. Again, as I mentioned yesterday, as we all \nknow, we have scheduling challenges over the course of the week during \nthe nights, which in many ways is good because it means we absolutely \nmust focus, beginning right up front in the morning, and work through \nthe day to process the bill, to process amendments, and to, of course, \nvote.\n  Again, I think every evening this week there are major commitments by \nboth caucuses and the caucuses working together. Thus, we really \nabsolutely must continue to work aggressively over the course of the \nday. There are a lot of people with a whole range of amendments to \noffer. We have had a long time for people to both now look at the bill \nbut also, since late July, to have Senators and their staffs address \nthe important issues and the recommendations which were made public in \nlate July by the 9/11 Commission and since that time through a lot of \nhearings during August in the Governmental Affairs Committee that had a \nsuperb markup where a number of amendments were offered, debated, and \nadopted.\n  It gave the Senators on that committee the opportunity to highlight \nthe important issues, to dispose of a number of them, but also, I \nbelieve, to make it so on the floor, when we address amendments that \nare similar to and in some cases maybe even the same amendments, we can \ndeal with those in very expeditious ways since so much groundwork has \nbeen laid.\n  I am going to encourage, with the leadership on both sides of the \naisle, the managers to gather these amendments just as soon as \npossible. All 100 Senators need to recognize that we have very few \ndays, really just a few more than a handful of days, before we depart \non October 8. Although we have dealt with many of these issues over the \nlast several days and weeks, it is critical that we see the amendments \nso we can plan out the next several days on the bill. I have encouraged \nall of our colleagues to bring those amendments to the managers today, \nthis morning.\n  With that, I will close my remarks and turn to the Democratic leader \neither for general comments or comments on the course of the week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9761-6", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader has been very clear about the \nintent that we both have to try to finish this work as quickly yet as \nthoroughly as we can. I would hope that we could work on a finite list. \nI would hope that we could reach time agreements on amendments. This is \na piece of legislation\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\nthat should be familiar to all Senators. It has been out there. The \ncommittee has done very good and deliberative work on both sides. It \nhas been one of the better demonstrations of the cooperation that we \nused to take for granted around here. I would hope that we could \ncontinue to show that same level of cooperation as we work through this \nbill.\n  I reiterate my strong support for what the majority leader has noted. \nHe may have said this, and I just didn't catch it, but I know we have \nto take up some expiring legislation this week. We have a CR. We have a \ntransportation bill. We have TANF. All of that has to be addressed this \nweek as well. It is my hope that we can get agreements on those and not \ndevote a good deal of time on the Senate floor to those and keep our \nfocus first on 9/11 and then other agreements we could get on \nappropriations bills. We will work throughout the day to clarify the \nschedule with regard to those bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9762-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENSURING A STRONG FARM CREDIT SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Farm Credit System is a nationwide \nnetwork of borrower-owned financial institutions consisting of four \nfarm-credit banks, one agricultural-credit bank, and nearly 100 locally \nowned farm-credit associations.\n  These institutions were created as a result of the 1916 Farm Credit \nAct, whose fundamental purpose was to establish a network of \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that would provide America's farmers \nand ranchers with a reliable source of credit at fair and competitive \ninterest rates.\n  Over the years, the Farm Credit System has provided critical credit \nand related services to farmers, ranchers, rural homeowners, farm-\nrelated businesses, and cooperatives, including rural utilities.\n  In fact, the Farm Credit System provides over $90 billion in loans to \nmore than a half-a-million producers, agribusiness, and agricultural \ncooperatives. Overall, more than 25 percent of the credit needs of \nAmerican agriculture are met by these important farm credit \ninstitutions.\n  These institutions have the unique attribute of being organized as \ncooperative businesses, each owned by its member-borrower stockholders, \nwho have the right to participate in director elections and vote on \nissues impacting business operations.\n  One of the largest farm-credit institutions serving South Dakota is \nFarm Credit Services of America, or FCSA. FCSA also provides services \nin Iowa, Nebraska, and Wyoming, and it holds nearly $8 billion in \nassets, which is about 8 percent of the entire Farm Credit System \nportfolio.\n  On July 30, the board of FCSA approved an agreement to be acquired by \nthe Rabobank Group, a Dutch banking giant and international farm \nlender.\n  The agreement is subject to approval by the regulatory agency which \noversees these institutions--the Farm Credit Administration or FCA. It \nis also subject to stockholder approval and the expiration or \ntermination of antitrust waiting periods.\n  Under the agreement, FCSA would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of \nRabobank and would seek to exit the Farm Credit System under the \ntermination provisions of the FCA's regulations.\n  FCSA has over 51,000 farmer and rancher customers--thousands of which \nare in my State of South Dakota.\n  Having spent a great deal of time in South Dakota over the past few \nmonths, I can say without any doubt that this proposed sale of one of \nour leading Farm Credit System institutions to a foreign bank has \ncreated a whirlwind of confusion and uncertainty.\n  While the tentative deal would pay producer-members $600 million in \npatronage, FCSA would also have to pay the Federal Government an $800 \nmillion ``exit fee,'' which is required should a member-institution \npull out of the system.\n  The $800 million would go to the system's insurance fund. If the \nagreement is approved, FCSA would no longer exist.\n  At the same time, another banking interest--AgStar, which is also \npart of the Farm Credit System, and which operates out of Minnesota--\nhas also sought to enter into a merger with FCSA.\n  Under AgStar's proposal, the new, merged AgStar would pay producers-\nowners $650 million in patronage--a full $50 million more than the \nRabobank offer.\n  Plus, AgStar would not have to pay the $800 million termination fee \nthat the Rabobank deal would require.\n  Finally, AgStar would make a commitment to provide future patronage \npayments to farmers and rancher-owners.\n  Looking solely at these figures, the Babobank offer appears \nquestionable. But a decision like this should not be taken lightly, and \nmore time is needed to fully analyze all the facts and determine what \nwould be in the best interest of the producer-owners of FCSA, and in \nthe best interest of the overall Farm Credit System.\n  Senator Johnson and I have sought to ensure that public hearings on \nthese matters be held by both the FCA and the appropriate committees in \nCongress.\n  The FCA has said that they will hold at least one meeting or hearing. \nIn addition, the first of what I hope could be several congressional \nhearings will be held by a House Agriculture Subcommittee tomorrow.\n  Unfortunately, the current time line under which the Farm Credit \nAdministration must operate would require a decision within 60 days of \nFCSA's submission of a termination notice--a notice which could be \nfiled as early as this week.\n  If the FCA approves the sale, a final vote by the FCSA shareholders \ncould theoretically come before the end of the year, when Congress will \nlikely be out of session.\n  It would be extremely difficult for the FCA to hold the public \nmeetings or hearings that many of us think are needed, and make a \nthoughtful decision about the termination, within the initial 60-day \ntime frame.\n  That is why, today, Senator Johnson and I are introducing legislation \nto ensure that when a Farm Credit System institution seeks to leave the \nsystem and terminate its status, the FCA will hold no less than one \npublic meeting or hearing in each of the States in which that \ninstitution is chartered.\n  In this case there would be no less than one meeting or hearing in \nSouth Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming.\n  The bill would also require the FCA to wait at least six months \nbefore making a decision on the termination request by the \ninstitution--in this case, FCSA.\n  At best, the proposed sale of FCSA to Rabobank raises more questions \nthan answers.\n  Farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and in the other impacted States \nfear they will have to vote on a deal before studying it and having all \nthe appropriate information they need.\n  And the Farm Credit Administration, which is not a large agency, is \nat risk of being overburdened by an unrealistic time line.\n  A decision to leave the system is really monumental in the world of \nrural credit, and it could have a huge impact on rural America.\n  The Farm Credit System has served our Nation's rural communities \nexceedingly well for nearly 90 years.\n  Before any action is taken that may jeopardize that impressive \nrecord, we need to ensure that farmers, ranchers, and rural residents, \nas well as members of the FCA, have the time they need to analyze this \nprofoundly important decision and reach the right conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9762-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Mr. President, on leader time--and we will come right into \nmorning business shortly--I want to continue on the intelligence reform \nbill that is underway and make a very brief statement. Just a few \nminutes ago, the Democratic leader and I urged our colleagues to come \nforward and submit their amendments. We just had further discussion \nwith the assistant Democratic leader. Over the course of the day, we \nmust see these amendments.\n  Today, we continue debate on a bill to overhaul the intelligence \ncommunity of the United States Government. It is a huge undertaking. \nThe reforms are the most comprehensive since the National Security Act \nof 1947. But nothing less than the security of the United States of \nAmerica is at stake.\n  We have determined enemies who will use any means available to take \nthe lives of as many Americans as possible. They cheered when the Twin \nTowers fell. They dream of even larger calamities.\n  They must be stopped. And that requires an intelligence system that \nfinds them, before they harm us.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, the \nGovernment Affairs Committee has produced a bill that is worthy of this \ntask. It was passed unanimously out of committee.\n  It has received support from the White House.\n  And it is supported by the Senate leadership.\n  The Senate will examine this legislation in a comprehensive and \ndeliberate manner. We will be focused and expeditious.\n  We have a unanimous consent agreement that restricts amendments ``to \nthe subject matter of the bill or related to the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations.''\n  I urge Senators that if they have, or are considering, amendments \nthat they inform or file them with the manager today.\n  I am confident we will come to agreement on this package in a timely \nmanner. I know that it is ambitious, but my hope is that we can \ncomplete this bill by the end of this week. This would give us time to \nconference with the House.\n  Reforming the executive branch and the legislative branch is key to \nimproving the security of the American people and our great Nation.\n  I am proud to say that we have worked in a bipartisan manner at every \nlevel, from individual Members, through committees, to leadership.\n  We have also worked closely with the administration, which has \nembraced the findings and recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  The administration has taken additional measures to further improve \nour counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts. These efforts deserve \nour praise.\n  The committee has worked to produce a bill that addresses fundamental \nissues facing our intelligence community. It contains a number of key \nrecommendations consistent with the 9/11 report.\n  First, and most critically, the legislation creates a national \nintelligence director with robust budgetary and personnel authority \nover the intelligence community.\n  As recommended by the 9/11 report, the NID will be the President's \nprimary intelligence advisor. This official will be Senate-confirmed \nand separate from the CIA Director. The NID's primary mission is to \nbreak down stovepipes, and knit the intelligence agencies into an agile \nand effective network.\n  The NID will develop and present to the President the annual budget \nrequest for the National Intelligence Program. Critically, the national \nintelligence director will receive the appropriation for the program.\n  The NID also will have parallel authority over major acquisitions \nfunded through the appropriations that the NID will control.\n  The NID will have the authority to transfer funds within the National \nIntelligence Program. He or she will have authority to set our \nintelligence priorities.\n  The director will set standards for security, personnel, and \ninformation technology across the intelligence community.\n  The director will also play an active role in selecting the heads of \nthe key entities in the National Intelligence Program.\n  Critically, the legislation requires the NID to provide intelligence \nthat is independent of political considerations. To this end, the \nlegislation establishes an analytic review unit to provide an \nindependent and objective evaluation of the quality of analysis of \nnational intelligence.\n  The NID will chair a cabinet-level Joint Intelligence Community \nCouncil. The purpose of the council is to advise the NID on setting \nrequirements, financial management, and establishing policies across \nthe intelligence community.\n  The council will help ensure the implementation of a joint, unified \nnational intelligence effort to protect national security.\n  In addition to creating the national intelligence director post, the \ncommittee bill also establishes the National Counter Terrorism Center. \nCurrently, our intelligence agencies are not maximally integrated in \ntheir efforts against terrorism. The committee seeks to remedy that \nthrough the creation of the counterterrorism center. The center will \nhave a directorate of intelligence--in essence, a national intelligence \ncenter to integrate intelligence capabilities against terrorism.\n  The National Counterterrorism Center will also have a directorate of \nplanning to develop interagency counterterrorism plans, assign \nagencies' responsibilities, and monitor implementation.\n  The center's directorate of planning will concentrate on developing \njoint counterterrorism plans, meaning plans that involve more than one \nagency. Such planning will be at both the strategic level, such as \n``winning hearts and minds'' in the Muslim world, and at an operational \nlevel, such as hunting for bin Laden.\n  In addition to these two major reforms--the national intelligence \ndirector and the counterterrorism center--the legislation also includes \nprovisions to strengthen the FBI and transform the CIA's capabilities.\n  The legislation before us is comprehensive. It is ambitious. And it \ncontains the reforms that are critical to strengthening the \nintelligence community and protecting our country.\n  I am confident that this overhaul of our intelligence community--the \nlargest since 1947--and the pending overhaul of the Senate oversight of \nintelligence--the largest in three decades--will make our country safer \nand more secure. We have no higher responsibility to our fellow \nAmericans than protecting the homeland. Our lives, our freedoms, our \nliberties are at stake.\n  We have made tremendous progress in the days since 9/11. We've taken \na hard look at our intelligence system, what it did right, where it \nwent wrong. Many dedicated men and women have spent countless hours \nexamining the facts and finding ways to fix the system. I am confident \nthat the United States Senate will do our part to defend the homeland \nand make America more secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9763-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9763-S9766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will be offering a unanimous consent \nrequest to try to move forward on welfare reform and try to move this \nvitally important issue that affects millions of Americans out of the \nSenate and toward passage of an extension. Today, the House is going to \npass an extension, and I hope we will also.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we are left in the position that we \nare not able to pass a welfare reform bill in the Senate, in spite of \nthe fact that an amendment on the underlying bill passed $1.2 billion \nin new daycare spending. That has always been the mantra of those who \noppose welfare reform and work requirements, that there wasn't enough \nmoney for daycare. Yet $1.2 billion was added to the welfare bill, and \nwe had attempt after attempt to move that bill to conference. So far, \nwe have not been able to do so. As a result, we are here for another \nextension.\n  We have had several extensions over the last 2 years. The problem \nwith these extensions--let me make this point--is that the current \nwelfare system was put into place in 1996. It had very tough work \nrequirements. It had work requirements that were tied to\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\ncaseload reduction. What happened is we have had such a successful \nprogram over the last 8 years that almost all of the States have met \ntheir caseload reduction and therefore no longer have work \nrequirements.\n  So what we are seeing is that gradually, slowly, a lot of these \nStates that have reduced their caseload are falling back under work \nrequirement--not requiring work and not requiring the transformative \nvalue that this new welfare system that was put into place in 1996 has \ngiven to millions of women and children in poverty over the last 8 \nyears. If we just continue the 1996 bill, which was great in its time--\nit achieved what it wanted to achieve and needed to achieve. Now we \nneed to ratchet it up to make sure the work requirement is maintained \nand that we are still moving people out of poverty into work. So this \nextension I am going to offer does not accomplish that. That is \ndisappointing.\n\n  I hope to later on maybe offer an opportunity to go to conference, \nbut for now, I want to offer a unanimous consent request to extend the \ncurrent welfare bill for another 6 months and add two minor provisions \nthat the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, and I have been working on now \nfor quite some time in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The two provisions deal with fatherhood, money that was not provided \nin the 1996 Welfare Act to encourage responsible fatherhood. There is \n$100 million for that provision and also $200 million to do a whole \nvariety of things to try to educate and encourage responsible marriage, \nif you will; responsible fatherhood, responsible marriage, encourage \nfathers and mothers who are having children outside of wedlock.\n  Let me give at least one example of how this money could be used. \nThere was a study done at Princeton University which said that when a \nmother would apply for welfare with a child born out of wedlock, 80 \npercent of the mothers who applied for welfare in this study, done by a \nliberal professor from Princeton, said they were in a relationship with \nthe father of the child. When the father of the child was asked, 80 \npercent said they were interested in marriage. So we have a mother and \na father who in 80 percent of these cases that were studied said they \nwere in a relationship at the time that welfare was applied for, which \nis certainly after the child's birth, and they were interested in \nmarriage. Yet within a year's time, less than 10 percent of those \ncouples were together.\n  The point here is that Government does nothing, other than attach the \nfather's wages for child support, to encourage that relationship or \nhelp that relationship prosper. All we are interested in is getting the \nmoney out of the hide of the father, which is not necessarily what \nnurtures a relationship.\n  All we are suggesting is that if a mother and a father come in and \nsay, yes, we are in a relationship, and, yes, we are interested in \nmarriage at the time we are having this child, cannot the Government do \nsomething to help that situation? It is a very difficult time in these \ntwo young people's lives. They are going through a lot of stresses and \nstrains. It is hard enough to have a child when you are married, much \nless when you are not married, and the difficulties associated with \nthat. Could we pay for counseling? Could we pay for a faith-based \norganization to bring them in and help them get through these difficult \ntimes to nurture this relationship so the child of these two parents \ncould have an opportunity to have a mother and a father in the home in \na stable relationship?\n  If we look at the benefits of marriage, they are overwhelming. Social \nscientist after social scientist has come in to testify before the \nFinance Committee in a hearing earlier this year from the left and the \nright and they said: There is no argument here, marriage is beneficial \nfor children.\n  It is beneficial for children because they have better school \nperformance and there are fewer dropouts, fewer emotional and behavior \nproblems, less substance abuse, less abuse and neglect, less criminal \nactivity, fewer out-of-wedlock births. Everything we look at, marriage \nis a benefit to children. Why is the Government neutral on marriage? \nWhy, if a couple is interested in marriage, can't we at least provide \nthem some of the resources they need to build that relationship instead \nof just saying: Here is childcare dollars; if you want to get married, \nthat is fine, we don't really care one way or the other; here are your \nchildcare dollars and here are your whatever other dollars and that is \nall we care about. That is a short-term help for moms and children, but \nto have a stable, loving father and mother relationship is the best \nlong-term help we can provide. But we do nothing. We are silent.\n\n  What we are proposing here is to try to do something to provide some \nresources through responsible fatherhood programs to--in this case, \nthese programs are trying to bring in fathers who have not been \ninvolved in their children's lives--find mentoring programs and other \nprograms funded through the nonprofit arena to help bring fathers back \ninto the lives of their children. Children need moms and dads, and \nresponsible mothers and responsible fathers are optimal. Senator Bayh \nhas been a leader on this issue, along with Senator Domenici. I have \nworked also to try to get more responsible fathers back into the lives \nof their children.\n  Look at the statistics when it comes to fathers involved in \nchildren's lives: A child is two times more likely to abuse drugs if \nthe father is not in the home, two times more likely to be abused if \nthe father is not in the home, two times more likely to be involved in \ncrime, three times more likely to fail in school, three times more \nlikely to commit suicide, and five times more likely to be in poverty. \nThat is what fatherlessness does to children.\n  This extension I am asking for is a straight extension, no other \nchanges, simply two modifications: One, $100 million to help bring \nfathers back into the lives of these children to help improve some of \nthese horrendous statistics we see here, and, two, to simply have some \nsupport where Government is no longer neutral, I would argue even \nagainst by enabling, if you will--I won't say survival because it is \nbeyond that--but enabling women and children to go forward without \nfathers. You can make an argument it is beyond neutral, that we are \nempowering through Government money mothers not to need fathers as much \nas they did before all these programs were out here.\n  What we are saying is let's at least, if they express an interest in \nmarriage, see if we can help them through this process. It is a \nstraight extension, plus $100 million for fatherhood and $200 million \nfor marriage programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 714, S. 2830; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we on this \nside note the intentions of the Senator from Pennsylvania. The two \nprograms he talks about extending certainly have merit. I think if we \nhad the opportunity to discuss them, offer amendments, and debate them, \nwe could complete that very quickly.\n  The problem is that during the consideration of the welfare bill in \nMarch, the Senate passed a bipartisan amendment by a vote of 78 to 20 \nto put in $6 billion in childcare funding. It is my understanding the \namendment my friend from Pennsylvania offers does not include that.\n  My question is, why should we create two new programs untested--but \nthey appear to have some merit--without extending additional resources \nfor childcare, something we know the Senate agrees to and we know \nparents need to succeed in the workplace?\n  I ask my friend, will the Senator modify his request to include the \nSnowe-Dodd amendment? If this were done, I think we could move forward \non this very quickly.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would be willing to offer another \nunanimous consent request to take care of the very issue the Senator \nfrom Nevada has mentioned, which is I will offer another unanimous \nconsent request to simply go to conference on the bill that is still \npending in the Senate that has the $1.2 billion in the Dodd-Snowe \namendment and send it to conference, and let's get this bill done.\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\n  So I am willing to go to conference on that bill. In fact, if we can \nfirst dispense with this first unanimous consent request, I would be \nhappy to offer a second one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the first unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. REID. To the second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the first.\n  Mr. REID. To the first? Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 305, H.R. 4; the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. I further \nask consent that the Senate insist upon its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees.\n  This is the welfare bill the Senator from Nevada described, the bill \nwith $1.2 billion in new child care funding per year in mandatory \nspending. We have had this thing bound up in the Senate. The Senator \nasked would I be willing to amend my request. I have, in essence, done \nthat.\n  Now we can send this bill to conference. We can start working on it \nwith the House and maybe we can get a new welfare bill instead of \nhaving an extension, which I would agree with the Senator from Nevada \nis not adequate because, in the eyes of the Senator, it does not \nprovide enough daycare money. I would say it is not adequate because it \ndoes not require work anymore. Most States in the country now do not \nhave to have work requirements because of the way the 1996 law was \nwritten.\n  I agree with the Senator, this is the better solution. So I ask that \nunanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I did not quite get what the unanimous consent was.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would be happy to read it again, but \nin essence it is to take the bill on the calendar now, which has the \nSnowe-Dodd amendment in it.\n  Mr. REID. H.R. 4?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. H.R. 4. And send it to conference and ask for a \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have the \ntimeline on this bill so it is unnecessary to go through it. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record as to what has \nhappened.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Bill Summary and Status\n\n\n                       H.R. 4--welfare extension\n\n       2/13/2003, 2:35 p.m.: H.

Mr. President, at the time the debate was going forward on \nthis most important bill, an amendment was offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia dealing with minimum wage. Immediately, cloture was filed. \nCloture was not invoked.\n  We would have no problem going forward with the bill prior to going \nto conference, assuming the Senate seeks to resume H.R. 4 in the status \nit was when it was pulled from the floor which is, of course, the \npendency of the Boxer amendment. So I ask my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, to modify his unanimous consent to allow us \nto proceed with H.R. 4 on the floor with the Boxer amendment pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from Nevada that on March 30, I \ndid that. I actually proposed the unanimous consent to allow a vote in \nrelation to the Boxer amendment, with a substitute offered by Senator \nMcConnell on the issue of minimum wage, which I know was an important \nissue at the time of this discussion. I offered that unanimous consent \nso we could move forward and dispose of those two amendments and then \nmove the bill to conference, and that was objected to.\n  There was objection to the extension with some minor modifications to \nhelp marriage and fatherhood. There was an objection to a unanimous \nconsent that puts $1.2 billion into new child care funding to go to \nconference. We have seen objections--I suspect this will be objected to \nagain, if I would offer it, which is an opportunity to have a vote on \nminimum wage up or down, and a vote on our minimum wage proposal up or \ndown, and then send it to conference.\n  I do not know how many times one has to say no to get the idea that \nmaybe there is something other than trying to get votes on issues that \nare of concern to the minority, that there might be some underlying \nconcern about having an extension of the welfare bill or a modification \nto it, and I think that is probably where we are.\n  It is unfortunate because it is important to reestablish work \nrequirements. It is important to give people the best opportunity to \nsucceed in America. We have seen, for example, in this country, as a \nresult of welfare reform which passed in 1996, the lowest rate of black \npoverty in the history of the country, lowest ever as a result of \nrequiring work and changing the dynamic in low-income families in \nAmerica. So we have shown success.\n  It is unfortunate we are not going to be able to continue that \nsuccess as a result of the blocking maneuvers on the side of the \nDemocrats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. REID. I have a modification of the request pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I object to the modification.\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I object to the underlying request and ask the Senator to \nallow a clean extension for 6 months of this most important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will object for the moment. I \nunderstand the House is working on an extension right now. We may agree \nlater today. Certainly, we need to do an extension and I will check \nwith the leader on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to my distinguished friend, the \nSenator from Kentucky, taking the floor, I inquire as to how much time \nis remaining with the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could on behalf of Senator Daschle \nyield 15 minutes when our time comes to Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes to \nSenator Durbin, and 5 minutes to Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9766-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9766-S9767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOUR-PART PRESIDENTIAL PLAN FOR IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Presidential campaign is heating up \nand after considerable flipping and flopping, Senator Kerry claims to \nhave finally presented the American people with something resembling a \nfirm position on Iraq. It is a four-part plan, and frankly it resembles \nthe plan President Bush has been pursuing for the last year and a half. \nI call it Senator Kerry's ``too little too late to gain credibility'' \nplan.\n  Although Kerry has characterized the administration's policy as a \nfailure, perhaps he simply believes it would be a success were he the \none implementing it. I wonder. Let us take a look.\n  The first part of Senator Kerry's plan is to ``internationalize \nbecause others must share the burden.'' Let's leave aside the \ninconvenient fact that Senator Kerry has denigrated the 19 countries \nthat participated in the liberation of Iraq or the 34 helping to secure \nand rebuild that country today as a ``trumped up and so-called \ncoalition of the bribed, the coerced, the bought and the extorted.''\n  This from the man who is so confident of his diplomatic skills.\n  Senator Kerry fails to understand that no amount of diplomacy will \nconvince the countries whose interests compete with ours, or the \nnations that share our interests but lack our will or capacity to act, \nto join our efforts to bring security and freedom to the Middle East \nand the terrorists to their knees.\n  Senator Kerry wants to bring U.S. troops home within the first 6 \nmonths of his administration. So his plan is not to share the burden; \nit is to pass the buck. But to whom would he pass the buck?\n  The Financial Times reported yesterday that Germany and France will \nnot send troops to Iraq even if John Kerry is elected. Indeed, how \ncould Senator Kerry convince any nation to send troops to a conflict he \nhimself has called ``the wrong war at the wrong time''?\n  It would be nice to see the United Nations pulling its own weight \nonce in a while, but one would have to be living in a fantasy world to \nbelieve that it will do so. If it continues to allow tyrannies like \nSudan to chair the Human Rights Commission, the U.N. will follow the \nLeague of Nations into permanent and deserved irrelevance.\n  The second part of Kerry's plan is to ``train Iraqis because they \nmust be responsible for their own security.'' Adding further confusion \nto his inconsistent claims that, first, the U.S. needs more troops in \nIraq, that he would bring them home within the first 6 months of his \nadministration, and that this would make America stronger at home and \nmore respected in the world, Senator Kerry now claims the U.S. is not \ndoing enough to train Iraqis to provide for their own security.\n  Well, about a year ago I traveled to Iraq and I stood with GEN David \nPetraeus in Mosul where I witnessed the graduation ceremony of an Iraqi \nsecurity force, a unit trained by the 101st Airborne. I recall being \nimpressed that so many Iraqis were willing to risk their lives to help \nsecure their newly free country.\n  Petraeus completed his tour as the commanding general of the 101st \nAirborne in February of this year. After making sure his soldiers \nreturned safely to Fort Campbell, KY, Dave Petraeus received his third \nstar and went back to Baghdad, where he assumed responsibility for \ntraining Iraq's army and security forces. He is the right man for the \njob and, for me, his views carry enormous weight. He had an op-ed in \nthe Washington Post this past Sunday that I would commend to my \ncolleagues, in particular the junior Senator from Massachusetts. In it, \nhe notes:\n\n       Approximately 164,000 Iraqi police and soldiers . . . and \n     an additional 74,000 facility protection forces are \n     performing a wide variety of security missions.\n       Equipment is being delivered. Training is on track and \n     increasing in capacity. . . . Most important, Iraqi security \n     forces are in the fight, so much so that they are suffering \n     substantial casualties as they take on more and more of the \n     burdens to achieve security in their country.\n\n  But he cautions that:\n\n       Numbers alone cannot convey the full story. The human \n     dimension of this effort is crucial. The enemies of Iraq \n     recognize how much is at stake as Iraq reestablishes its \n     security forces. Insurgents and foreign fighters continue to \n     mount barbaric attacks against police stations, recruiting \n     centers and military installations. . . . Yet despite the \n     sensational attacks, there is no shortage of qualified \n     recruits volunteering to join the Iraqi security forces.\n\n  This is David Petraeus.\n  So it would seem the training of Iraqis is well underway.\n  The third part of Kerry's plan is to ``move forward with \nreconstruction, because that's an important way to stop the spread of \nterror.''\n  I agree. When I spoke with General Petraeus in Iraq last year, he \ntold me that: ``Money is ammunition,'' and that it was critical to get \nthe Iraqi economy working again in order to provide jobs for Iraqis who \nmay otherwise turn to violence. I returned to Washington and lobbied my \ncolleagues to vote for the $87 billion to supply our troops and for \nIraqi reconstruction, because I had seen firsthand how important it was \nto get Iraq's economy back on track.\n  It is a shame Senator Kerry was not listening to General Petraeus \nwhen he voted against this $87 billion for our troops. In fact, Senator \nKerry still does not seem to get it, because he complained just \nrecently that too much money was being spent on reconstruction in Iraq \nand too little was being spent in America.\n  We won the debate on the $87 billion for our troops and \nreconstruction in spite of Senator Kerry's--and Senator Edwards'--\nopposition. And although I am heartened Senator Kerry has come to \nappreciate the importance of this aid, I hope he understands that \nPresidents, unlike Senators, do not often get second chances to make \ncrucial decisions.\n  The fourth and final plan in Senator Kerry's plan is to: ``help the \nIraqis achieve a viable government, because it is up to them to run \ntheir own country.''\n  You could call this the ``Do as I say, not as I do'' plan, because \nSenator Kerry may have undermined the credibility of Iraq's Prime \nMinister--who traveled to America to consult with President Bush, to \ndeliver a speech to a Joint Session of Congress, and rebut the \ncriticism of those who believe Iraq and the world are not better off \nwith Saddam Hussein in an Iraqi jail.\n  Kerry's wrong-headed criticism of Ayad Allawi--who risks his life \nevery day to bring peace and democracy to Iraq--was as repugnant as it \nwas undiplomatic. If a President Kerry were to treat foreign leaders as \ndisgracefully as he treated Prime Minister Allawi, he would find it \ndifficult to live up his campaign promise of being ``more respected in \nthe world.''\n  Yet, Kerry has already done diplomatic damage, in my view. By \nmaligning the judgment of America's most important new ally in the \nMiddle East, Senator Kerry has fired a political shot that will be \nheard more loudly in the streets of Baghdad or Tehran than in Boston or \nOrlando. His comments were intended to undercut President\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\nBush's standing in the eyes of American voters, but they may have the \nconsequence of undermining Prime Minister Allawi's position in Iraq.\n\n  If a potential President of the United States doesn't take the Iraqi \nPrime Minister seriously, why should the terrorists?\n  Writing about Iraq's transition from totalitarianism to democracy, \nGeneral Petraeus concluded his op-ed with this line: It will not be \neasy, but few worthwhile things are.\n  Bringing democracy and stability to the heart of the Middle East is \nmore than worthwhile. It is a critical component of our war against \nterrorists. For if we fail to offer an alternative to the corrupt \ntheocracies and dictatorships of that region, we will forever be \nfighting the war against terrorism defensively, making it much more \nlikely that we will be fighting terrorists in Chicago and New York than \nin the cities where they live and train.\n  We have an opportunity to fight side by side with our new Iraqi \nallies against the terrorists who share goals and tactics with those \nwho hijacked planes on 9/11, who murdered hundreds of school children \nin Russia, and who bombed innocent civilians in Bali, Istanbul, Riyadh, \nMadrid, Jerusalem, and elsewhere. And if we fail to win this fight it \nwill not be just Prime Minister Allawi's credibility that suffers, it \nwill be our own.\n  Mr. President, I ask that General Petraeus's op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 26, 2004]\n\n                           Battling for Iraq\n\n                         (By David H. Petraeus)\n\n       Baghdad.--Helping organize, train and equip nearly a \n     quarter-million of Iraq's security forces is a daunting task. \n     Doing so in the middle of a tough insurgency increases the \n     challenge enormously, making the mission akin to repairing an \n     aircraft while in flight--and while being shot at. Now, \n     however, 18 months after entering Iraq, I see tangible \n     progress. Iraqi security elements are being rebuilt from the \n     ground up.\n       The institutions that oversee them are being reestablished \n     from the top down. And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward, \n     leading their country and their security forces courageously \n     in the face of an enemy that has shown a willingness to do \n     anything to disrupt the establishment of the new Iraq.\n       In recent months, I have observed thousands of Iraqis in \n     training and then watched as they have conducted numerous \n     operations. Although there have been reverses--not to mention \n     horrific terrorist attacks--there has been progress in the \n     effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for \n     their own security, something they are keen to do. The future \n     undoubtedly will be full of difficulties, especially in \n     places such as Fallujah. We must expect setbacks and \n     recognize that not every soldier or policeman we help train \n     will be equal to the challenges ahead.\n       Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. Today \n     approximately 164,000 Iraqi police and soldiers (of which \n     about 100,000 are trained and equipped) and an additional \n     74,000 facility protection forces are performing a wide \n     variety of security missions. Equipment is being delivered. \n     Training is on track and increasing in capacity. \n     Infrastructure is being repaired. Command and control \n     structures and institutions are being reestablished.\n       Most important, Iraqi security forces are in the fight--so \n     much so that they are suffering substantial casualties as \n     they take on more and more of the burdens to achieve security \n     in their country. Since Jan. 1 more than 700 Iraqi security \n     force members have been killed, and hundreds of Iraqis \n     seeking to volunteer for the police and military have been \n     killed as well.\n       Six battalions of the Iraqi regular army and the Iraqi \n     Intervention Force are now conducting operations. Two of \n     these battalions, along with the Iraqi commando battalion, \n     the counterterrorist force, two Iraqi National Guard \n     battalions and thousands of policemen recently contributed to \n     successful operations in Najaf. Their readiness to enter and \n     clear the Imam Ali shrine was undoubtedly a key factor in \n     enabling Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani to persuade members of \n     the Mahdi militia to lay down their arms and leave the \n     shrine.\n       In another highly successful operation several days ago, \n     the Iraqi counterterrorist force conducted early morning \n     raids in Najaf that resulted in the capture of several senior \n     lieutenants and 40 other members of that militia, and the \n     seizure of enough weapons to fill nearly four 7\\1/2\\-ton dump \n     trucks.\n       Within the next 60 days, six more regular army and six \n     additional Intervention Force battalions will become \n     operational. Nine more regular army battalions will complete \n     training in January, in time to help with security missions \n     during the Iraqi elections at the end of that month.\n       Iraqi National Guard battalions have also been active in \n     recent months. Some 40 of the 45 existing battalions--\n     generally all except those in the Fallujah-Ramadi area--are \n     conducting operations on a daily basis, most alongside \n     coalition forces, but many independently. Progress has also \n     been made in police training. In the past week alone, some \n     1,100 graduated from the basic policing course and five \n     specialty courses. By early spring, nine academies in Iraq \n     and one in Jordan will be graduating a total of 5,000 police \n     each month from the eight-week course, which stresses \n     patrolling and investigative skills, substantive and \n     procedural legal knowledge, and proper use of force and \n     weaponry, as well as pride in the profession and adherence to \n     the police code of conduct.\n       Iraq's borders are long, stretching more than 2,200 miles. \n     Reducing the flow of extremists and their resources across \n     the borders is critical to success in the counterinsurgency. \n     As a result, with support from the Department of Homeland \n     Security, specialized training for Iraq's border enforcement \n     elements began earlier this month in Jordan.\n       Regional academies in Iraq have begun training as well, and \n     more will come online soon. In the months ahead, the 16,000-\n     strong border force will expand to 24,000 and then 32,000. In \n     addition, these forces will be provided with modern \n     technology, including vehicle X-ray machines, explosive-\n     detection devices and ground sensors.\n       Outfitting hundreds of thousands of new Iraqi security \n     forces is difficult and complex, and many of the units are \n     not yet fully equipped. But equipment has begun flowing. \n     Since July 1, for example, more than 39,000 weapons and 22 \n     million rounds of ammunition have been delivered to Iraqi \n     forces, in addition to 42,000 sets of body armor, 4,400 \n     vehicles, 16,000 radios and more than 235,000 uniforms.\n       Considerable progress is also being made in the \n     reconstruction and refurbishing of infrastructure for Iraq's \n     security forces. Some $1 billion in construction to support \n     this effort has been completed or is underway, and five Iraqi \n     bases are already occupied by entire infantry brigades.\n       Numbers alone cannot convey the full story. The human \n     dimension of this effort is crucial. The enemies of Iraq \n     recognize how much is at stake as Iraq reestablishes its \n     security forces. Insurgents and foreign fighters continue to \n     mount barbaric attacks against police stations, recruiting \n     centers and military installations, even though the vast \n     majority of the population deplores such attacks. Yet despite \n     the sensational attacks, there is no shortage of qualified \n     recruits volunteering to join Iraqi security forces. In the \n     past couple of months, more than 7,500 Iraqi men have signed \n     up for the army and are preparing to report for basic \n     training to fill out the final nine battalions of the Iraqi \n     regular army. Some 3,500 new police recruits just reported \n     for training in various locations. And two days after the \n     recent bombing on a street outside a police recruiting \n     location in Baghdad, hundreds of Iraqis were once again lined \n     up inside the force protection walls at another location--\n     where they were greeted by interim Prime Minister Ayad \n     Allawi.\n       I meet with Iraqi security force leaders every day. Though \n     some have given in to acts of intimidation, many are \n     displaying courage and resilience in the face of repeated \n     threats and attacks on them, their families and their \n     comrades. I have seen their determination and their desire to \n     assume the full burden of security tasks for Iraq.\n       There will be more tough times, frustration and \n     disappointment along the way. It is likely that insurgent \n     attacks will escalate as Iraq's elections approach. Iraq's \n     security forces are, however, developing steadily and they \n     are in the fight. Momentum has gathered in recent months. \n     With strong Iraqi leaders out front and with continued \n     coalition--and now NATO--support, this trend will continue. \n     It will not be easy, but few worthwhile things are.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as we look at the situation in America and \nin the world today, we face serious challenges. Obviously, the war on \nterrorism is one of the most serious challenges we have had in many \ndecades, one that is different because there are no specific battles \nthat are won or lost. There may not be a moment when we say it is over. \nBecause we are dealing with a moving, shadowy element that uses the \nmost dastardly types of attacks on individuals, innocent men, women, \nand children.\n  We have seen the situation in Florida, where the people there have \nbeen hit repeatedly by hurricanes and disasters. I guess you could say \nin many respects these are times that try men and women's souls.\n  We are under attack in a lot of ways. But, also, these are the times \nthat require a certain trumpet. We cannot have uncertainty in terms of \nleadership. We cannot have an uncertain trumpet. We have to have \ndirection, strong leadership, and courage to take a stand and follow it \nthrough. That is why I am very much worried about what I see in Senator \nKerry and the positions he has taken, first on one side and then the \nother.\n  I was greatly distressed last week when we had the Prime Minister of \nIraq here. He is a man who is showing strength, leadership, and great \ncourage because his life is on the line every day with repeated \nassassination attempts directed at him. He came here. He said: Thank \nyou, America. He said: We are going to have elections. We are going to \nhave peace and freedom and democracy. We chose justice and the rule of \nlaw rather than chaos and anarchy. He did a magnificent job. I was \ninspired by what he is doing and by his speech.\n\n  Yet Senator Kerry attacked his speech before he even left town. Where \nare the basic courtesies that we have in the past extended to leaders \nof other countries?\n  President Bush, on the other hand, has shown strength, leadership, \nand courage. He is dealing with the issues of security. People see in \nhim and hear in his voice a determination, a commitment, that will get \nus through this. But Senator Kerry has been flip-flopping back and \nforth on Iraq for not just the campaign but actually for years, going \nback to 2002 where he took one position and where now, in 2003 and \n2004, he has taken a different position.\n  On September 20, 2004, he said that our most important task is to win \nthe war on terrorism. On March 6, 2004, he balked at calling the war on \nterror an actual ``war.''\n  On September 20 he said Iraq was a ``diversion from'' the war on \nterror. Yet back in December of 2003 he said that Iraq is ``critical'' \nto the success of the war on terror.\n  In September of 2004 he said the evil of Saddam was enough to justify \nthe war. Yet before that he agreed with the administration's goal of \nregime change. He also said that Saddam's ``breach of international \nvalues'' was a sufficient cause of war.\n  In 2004 he said Saddam's ``downfall . . . has left America less \nsecure.'' Yet in December of 2003 he questioned the judgment of those \nclaiming Saddam's capture doesn't help American security.\n  The list goes on and on. I ask unanimous consent this list be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n FLIP FLOP #1: ``Most Important Task'' Is To Win ``War On Terrorism.''\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       . . . the events of September 11 reminded every American of \n     that obligation. That day brought to our shores the defining \n     struggle of our times: the struggle between freedom and \n     radical fundamentalism. And it made clear that our most \n     important task is to fight . . . and to win . . . the war on \n     terrorism.\n     ``In His Words: John Kerry,'' The New York Times Website, \n         www.nytimes. com, March 6, 2004, Kerry Balked at Calling \n         War on Terror an Actual War:\n       The final victory in the war on terror depends on a victory \n     in the war of ideas, much more than the war on the \n     battlefield. And the war--not the war, I don't want to use \n     that terminology. The engagement of economies, the economic \n     transformation, the transformation to modernity of a whole \n     bunch of countries that have been avoiding the future.\n\n\n        FLIP FLOP #2: Iraq Was ``Diversion From'' War On Terror.\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       . . . Iraq was a profound diversion from that war and the \n     battle against our greatest enemy, Osama bin Laden and the \n     terrorists. Invading Iraq has created a crisis of historic \n     proportions and, if we do not change course, there is the \n     prospect of a war with no end in sight.\n     Fox News' ``Special Report,'' December 15, 2003, Kerry Said \n         Iraq ``Is Critical'' To Success of War on Terror:\n       Iraq may not be the war on terror itself, but it is \n     critical to the outcome of the war on terror. And therefore \n     any advance in Iraq is an advance forward in that.\n\n\n      FLIP FLOP #3: Evil Of Saddam Was Not Enough To Justify War.\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who deserves his own \n     special place in hell. But that was not, in itself, a reason \n     to go to war.\n     Senator John Kerry, Speech to the 2002 DLC National \n         Conversation, New York, NY, July 29, 2002, Kerry \n         Originally Agreed With Removing Saddam Hussein:\n       I agree completely with this Administration's goal of a \n     regime change in Iraq--Saddam Hussein is a renegade and \n     outlaw who turned his back on the tough conditions of his \n     surrender put in place by the United Nations in 1991.\n     MSNBC's ``Hardball,'' October 10, 2002, Kerry Cited Saddam's \n         ``Breach of International Values'' as Cause for War.\n       I believe the record of Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless \n     breach of international values and standards of behavior is \n     cause enough for the world community to hold him accountable \n     by use of force if necessary.\n\n\nFLIP FLOP #4: Saddam's ``Downfall . . . Has Left America Less Secure.''\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       The satisfaction we take in his downfall does not hide this \n     fact: we have traded a dictator for a chaos that has left \n     America less secure.\n     Anne Q. Hoy, ``Dean Faces More Criticism,'' [New York] \n         Newsday, December 17, 2003, Kerry Questioned Judgment of \n         Those Claiming Saddam's Capture Doesn't Help American \n         Security:\n       Those who doubted whether Iraq or the world would be better \n     off without Saddam Hussein, and those who believe we are not \n     safer with his capture, don't have the judgment to be \n     president or the credibility to be elected president.\n\n\n      FLIP FLOP #5: Decision To Go Into Iraq ``Colossal'' Failure.\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       ``The President now admits to ``miscalculations'' in Iraq. \n     That is one of the greatest understatements in recent \n     American history. His were not the equivalent of accounting \n     errors. They were colossal failures of judgment--and judgment \n     is what we look for in a president. This is all the more \n     stunning because we're not talking about 20/20 hindsight. \n     Before the war, before he chose to go to war, bi partisan \n     Congressional hearings . . . major outside studies . . . and \n     even some in the administration itself . . . predicted \n     virtually every problem we now face in Iraq.\n     CNN's ``Inside Politics,'' August 9, 2004, in Response to \n         Question About How He Would Have Voted if He Knew Then \n         What He Knows Now, Kerry Confirmed That He Would Still \n         Have Voted For Use Of Force Resolution:\n       Yes, I would have voted for the authority. I believe it's \n     the right authority for a president to have. But I would have \n     used that authority as I have said throughout this campaign, \n     effectively. I would have done this very differently from the \n     way President Bush has.\n\n\n        FLIP FLOP #6: ``Iraq Was Not ``Threat To Our Security.''\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       We now know that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction \n     and posed no imminent threat to our security.\n     Ronald Brownstein, ``On Iraq, Kerry Appears Either Torn or \n         Shrewd,'' Los Angeles Times, January 31, 2003, Kerry \n         believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and \n         was a threat:\n       Kerry said, ``If you don't believe . . . Saddam Hussein is \n     a threat with nuclear weapons, then you shouldn't vote for \n     me.''\n     CNN's ``Inside Politics,'' August 9, 2004, In Response to \n         Question About How He Would Have Voted if He Knew Then \n         What He Knows Now, Kerry Confirmed That He Would Still \n         Have Voted for Use of Force Resolution.\n       Yes, I would have voted for the authority.

This doesn't end with Afghanistan by any \n     imagination. And I think the president has made that clear. I \n     think we have made that clear. Terrorism is a global menace. \n     It's a scourge. And it is absolutely vital that we continue, \n     for instance, Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n   flip flop #8: iraq not ``source of serious disagreement with our \n                          allies'' before war.\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       We know that while Iraq was a source of friction, it was \n     not previously a source of serious disagreement with our \n     allies in Europe and countries in the Muslim world.\n     CNN's ``Crossfire,'' November 12, 1997, Kerry Questioned \n         Where Russia and France's Backbone To Stand up to Saddam \n         Was:\n       So clearly the allies may not like it, and I think that's \n     our great concern--where's the backbone of Russia, where's \n     the backbone of France, where are they in expressing their \n     condemnation of such clearly illegal activity, but in a \n     sense, they're now climbing into a box and they will have \n     enormous difficulty not following up on this if there is not \n     compliance by Iraq.\n     CNN's ``Crossfire,'' November 12, 1997, Kerry Noted French \n         Have Opposed U.S. on a Number of Foreign Policy Issues:\n       Well, John, frankly neither you nor I know that we did \n     nothing. I don't know that for a fact. We certainly didn't \n     publicly, I agree, but I don't know that we did nothing. But \n     it's not the first time France has been very difficult, as \n     the congressman said. I think a lot of us are very \n     disappointed that the French haven't joined us in a number of \n     other efforts with respect to China, with respect to other \n     issues in Asia and elsewhere and also in Europe.\n     Fox News' ``The O'Reilly Factor,'' May 22, 2002, Kerry says \n         that Europeans are ``Wrong On Iraq'' and U.S. ``Will Have \n         To Do What We Need To Do.''\n       Fox News' Bill O'Reilly: ``The ambassador to Germany is \n     basically saying what most people in Europe are saying, \n     senator. They're afraid. They're afraid that if we go after \n     Saddam Hussein, and all the Arabs get crazy, and the whole \n     thing blows up, that Europe's going to take the brunt of \n     this. I said you can't negotiate with tyrants out of fear. \n     How do you feel about it?''\n       Senator John Kerry: ``I agree with you. . . . [I] think \n     that you're correct in making that judgment. And I think \n     we've all reached a judgment that obviously the United States \n     has to protect our national security interests. And we have \n     to do what we think is right. I do think the European \n     demonstrations are larger than just Iraq. I think they're \n     concerned about other issues, like global warming. They're \n     concerned about proliferation. They're concerned about--I \n     mean, there are a whole host of issues. So I think it's a \n     more confused bag than just Iraq, but I think they're wrong \n     on Iraq. I mean, plain and simply, the United States will \n     have to do what we need to do, and our best judgment to \n     protect our national security. And quite frankly, if we do \n     what we need to do, it will also wind up protecting Europe.''\n\n\n    flip flop #9: President's iraq policy ``has weakened'' national \n                               security.\n\n     Senator John Kerry, Remarks at New York University, New York, \n         NY, September 20, 2004:\n       Let me put it plainly: The President's policy in Iraq has \n     not strengthened our national security.

How can he possibly \n     be serious? Is he really saying that if we knew there were no \n     imminent threat, no weapons of mass destruction, no ties to \n     Al Qaeda, the United States should have invaded Iraq? My \n     answer is no--because a Commander-in-Chief's first \n     responsibility is to make a wise and responsible decision to \n     keep America safe.\n     CNN's ``Inside Politics,'' August 9, 2004, In Response to \n         Question About How He Would Have Voted if He Knew Then \n         What He Knows Now, Kerry Confirmed That He Would Still \n         Have Voted for Use of Force Resolution:\n       Yes, I would have voted for the authority.

But that \n     was not the reason given to the nation; it was not the reason \n     Congress voted on; it's not a reason, it's an excuse.\n     Senator John Kerry, Congressional Record, October 9, 2002, \n         page S10171, Kerry Called Those Who Would Leave Saddam \n         Alone ``Naive to the Point of Grave Danger: ``\n       It would be naive to the point of grave danger not to \n     believe that, left to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will \n     provoke, misjudge, or stumble into a future, more dangerous \n     confrontation with the civilized world.\n     CBS' ``Face The Nation,'' September 15, 2002, Kerry Said \n         Saddam's Miscalculations are Biggest Concern, Not \n         ``Actual'' WMD:\n       I would disagree with John McCain that it's the actual \n     weapons of mass destruction he may use against us, it's what \n     he may do in another invasion of Kuwait or in a \n     miscalculation about the Kurds or a miscalculation about Iran \n     or particularly Israel.

And we'd \n     better make them. We've been sliding into a fundamental \n     policy of containment, which I share with Major Ritter the \n     notion is disastrous to our overall proliferation interests \n     and disastrous with respect to the Middle East and our \n     interests with respect to Saddam Hussein and Iraq. But we \n     have to make a decision whether we're prepared to do what is \n     necessary, and I mean to the point of a sustained targeting \n     of the regime; not the Iraqi people, but the regime.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. But it goes beyond just the war on Iraq. What worries me is \nthere is a pattern here, across the board, not only in that area that \nthreatens our very security and our lives, the war on terrorism, but in \narea after area, issue after issue.\n  For instance, in 1991 Senator Kerry supported most-favored trade \nstatus for China and now he criticizes the Bush administration for \ntrading with China.\n  Which is it? You cannot be for it and against it when you talk about \ninternational trade. Trade is good. America can compete. We do need to \nenlarge the pie. We need to make sure we have fair trade. But you \ncannot vote one way on trade and then be critical of it on the other \nside.\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\n  In October 2003, Senator Kerry called the fence that is being built \nin Israel for security purposes a ``barrier to peace.'' He was critical \nof it. Yet in February of 2004, he calls the fence a ``legitimate act \nof self-defense.'' You can't get into a very dangerous and sensitive \nsituation like this and say one thing and then the other. What is it? \nWhich is it? An uncertain trumpet takes lives.\n  Even in the case of eliminating the marriage penalty for the middle \nclass, Senator Kerry said he will fight to keep the tax relief for \nmarried couples. He said Democrats fought to end the marriage penalty \ntax. Yet in 1998, he voted against eliminating the marriage penalty \nrelief for married taxpayers with a combined income of less than \n$50,000 a year. Last week when we actually extended the elimination of \nthat marriage penalty tax, of course, he didn't vote.\n  He even flip-flopped on the PATRIOT Act. The PATRIOT Act is a \nfavorite punching bag now.\n  I was here when the death debate occurred. I remember the broad \nunanimous support involved in passing that legislation. We needed to do \nsome things to give our law enforcement people the ability to deal with \nthese terrorists. If you look at what has transpired since then, this \ngreat fear of having your library card checked or a ``knock in the \nnight'' is not occurring. So he voted for it, and now he attacks the \nPATRIOT Act. He said:\n\n       We are a nation of laws, and liberties, not of a knock in \n     the night. So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft.\n\n  I think that is an unfair shot at our former colleague, the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. Again, Senator Kerry was for the Patriot \nAct and now he is against it.\n  On the gay marriage amendment, in 2002, Senator Kerry signed a letter \nurging the Massachusetts legislature to reject a constitutional \namendment banning gay marriage. Yet now in 2004 he won't rule out \nsupporting a similar amendment. Which is it? Is it one thing in \nMassachusetts and another here in Washington?\n  Also, I think when you get into other issues like the death penalty \nfor terrorists, these are relevant issues we can't take the wrong \nposition on. Yet, in 1996, he attacked Governor Weld of Massachusetts \nfor supporting the death penalty for terrorists. But now he said he \nmight support the death penalty for terrorists.\n  On the No Child Left Behind Act, he voted for it, and now he attacks \nit as a ``mockery.'' He trashed it as an ``unfunded mandate'' with \n``laudable goals.''\n  Let me tell you that I am a son of a schoolteacher. I was in public \neducation all my life. I didn't go to some elite school.

And it is \n     divisive because it creates a ``perception and a reality of \n     reverse discrimination that has actually engendered racism.'' \n     (Lynne Duke, ``Senators Seek Serious Dialogue On Race,'' The \n     Washington Post, 4/8/92)\n     In 2004, Kerry Denied Ever Having Called Affirmative Action \n         ``Divisive.''\n       CNN's Kelly Wallace: ``We caught up with the Senator, who \n     said he never called affirmative action divisive, and accused \n     Clark of playing politics.''\n       Senator Kerry: ``That's not what I said. I said there are \n     people who believe that. And I said mend it, don't end it. \n     He's trying to change what I said, but you can go read the \n     quote. I said very clearly I have always voted for it. I've \n     always supported it. I've never, ever condemned it. I did \n     what Jim Clyburn did and what Bill Clinton did, which is mend \n     it.

Mr. President, my friend from Mississippi attempted to \ndescribe my friend and colleague's position on a variety of different \nissues. As we know around here, one of the favorite techniques--we have \njust seen it--is to distort and misrepresent someone's position and \nthen differ with it. That is what has been done with regard to Senator \nKerry's position on the issues we just heard about. I know about the No \nChild Left Behind Act. I know John Kerry's position, and I know his \nposition on health care. We talk about his position on health care. \nWhat he wants for the American people is the same thing President Bush \nhas for himself. When he talks about the No Child Left Behind Act, the \nfact is 4\\1/5\\ million children aren't getting the benefits of it. He \ncan defend himself.\n  It is always interesting to me to listen to distortions and \nmisrepresentations on his record. Read the Web site.\n  I listened to the Senator from Kentucky talk about Senator Kerry on \nIraq. The fact of the matter is this President can't solve that \nproblem. He has had his turn, and it is time to have someone new. You \ncan ask, Why? Because he has burned his bridges with\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\nthe international community. He has insulted the world community and \nshattered and shredded all of the treaties of the United States with \nthe world community on the matter of dealing with Iraq. They don't \ntrust him. And they won't. And they will John Kerry. You have had your \ntime, Mr. President. You have had your turn to try to do it. John Kerry \nhas a plan to be able to do it. He has outlined that and it offers the \nbest reason and the best hope for us to be able to achieve it.\n  Twenty-four years ago, the President of the United States, Ronald \nReagan, posed the defining question to the American people in that \nelection when he asked, ``Are you better off today than you were 4 \nyears ago?'' That simple question is given greater relevance now than \nwhen Ronald Reagan asked it.\n  The defining issue today is national security. Especially in the post \n9/11 world, people have the right to ask Ronald Reagan's question in a \nvery specific and all- important way. Are we safer today because of the \npolicies of President Bush?\n  Any honest assessment can lead to only one answer--and that answer is \nan emphatic no. President Bush is dead wrong and John Kerry is \nabsolutely right. We are not safer today and the reason we are not \nsafer is because of the President's misguided war in Iraq. The \nPresident's handling of the war has been a toxic mix of ignorance, \narrogance, and stubborn ideology. No amount of Presidential rhetoric or \npreposterous campaign spin can conceal the truth about the steady \ndownward spiral in our national security since President Bush made that \ndecision to go to war in Iraq.\n  No issue is more important today. The battle against terrorism is a \nbattle we must win. Even those of us who opposed the war in Iraq \nunderstand that this is now an American commitment and we must see it \nthrough. But to remain silent in the face of mounting failures by this \nPresident and this White House is to weaken our security even further, \nand we cannot let that happen.\n  The President keeps saying America and the world are safer today and \nbetter off today because Saddam Hussein is gone. Let us count the ways \nthat George Bush's war has not made America safer.\n\n  No. 1, Iraq has been a constant, perilous distraction from the real \nwar on terrorism. There was no persuasive link between Saddam Hussein \nand al-Qaida. All you have to do is read the 9/11 Commission report. \nThere it is on page 66.\n\n       Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated \n     with al-Qaida in the development or carrying out any attacks \n     against the United States.\n\n  There it is--9/11 Commission, Mr. Cheney; 9/11 Commission, Mr. Bush.\n  It is stated in the staff commission report as well:\n\n       Two senior bin Laden associates adamantly denied any ties \n     between al-Qaida and Iraq. We have no credible evidence that \n     Iraq and al-Qaida cooperated on attacks against the United \n     States.\n\n  There it is. There it is, and this President indicates that this ties \nin.\n  We should have finished the job in Afghanistan. We should have \nfinished the job with al-Qaida and the job with Osama bin Laden.\n  No. 2, the mismanagement of the war in Iraq has created a fertile and \nvery dangerous new breeding ground for terrorists in Iraq and a \npowerful magnet for al-Qaida that didn't exist before the war. We can't \ngo a day now without hearing of attacks in Iraq by insurgents and al-\nQaida terrorists, and our troops are in far greater danger because of \nit.\n  In the month of August, 863 Americans were killed or wounded; 70 \nattacks every single day on American troops. And we hear the rosy \npicture of this administration, and the Secretary of Defense saying, \n``I am encouraged by the way things are going.'' The President of \nUnited States said only a week ago that it is just a handful of \ninsurgents.\n  Let us get real. This is what is happening. That this violence would \noccur was abundantly clear before the war.\n  We find in today's New York Times, pre-war assessment on Iraq shows \nchance of strong divisions. Is this the same intelligence unit that \nproduced a gloomy report in July that President Bush says is just a \nmatter of guesswork by our intelligence agencies? He changed that to \n``estimate'' but initially called it ``guesswork.''\n  About the prospect of growing instability in Iraq, the report \n``warned'' the Bush administration about the ``potential costly \nconsequences of American-led invasion 2 months before the war began, \nGovernment officials said.''\n  The assessments predicted that an American invasion of Iraq would \n``increase sympathy'' and support for political Islam and would result \nin a deeply divided Iraqi society prone to violent internal conflict.\n  There it is. Give it to the President of the United States. We have \n140,000 American boys over there, with no tie-in with al-Qaida? And the \npredictions are right there in front of us that we were going to have \nthis kind of conflict over there. And this administration says: Oh, no, \nwe are a lot better off than we were before.\n\n  We should have finished the job against al-Qaida. We should have \nfinished the job in Afghanistan. We should have had Osama bin Laden \nbehind bars instead of Saddam Hussein.\n  And what did the administration do? They put on their ideological \nblinders, ignored the intelligence, and rushed headlong into a \nmisguided war that has put our troops in perilous danger.\n  Mr. President, if we had gone into Afghanistan, we could have either \nended or damaged al-Qaida, and captured Osama bin Laden. But al-Qaida \nis like a cancer. It metastasized. We had an opportunity to grab it all \nwhen we battled in Afghanistan, but we did not. We stepped back. We \nwent into Iraq. And what has happened? Like a cancer, it has \nmetastasized all over the world--in Southeast Asia, in Saudi Arabia, as \nfar as Morocco, all over. It is a fundamental and basic miscalculation, \nand the American people are in greater danger as a result of that \ndecision not to close the door on al-Qaida.\n  No. 4, because of the war, the danger of terrorist attacks against \nAmerica itself has become greater. Our preoccupation with Iraq has \ngiven al-Qaida 2 full years to regroup and plan murderous new assaults \non us. We know al-Qaida will try to attack America again and again at \nhome if it possibly can. Yet instead of staying focused on the real war \non terror, President Bush rushed headlong into an unnecessary war in \nIraq.\n  No. 5, and most ominously, the Bush administration's focus on Iraq \nhas left us needlessly more vulnerable to an al-Qaida attack with a \nnuclear weapon. The greatest threat of all to our homeland is a nuclear \nattack. A mushroom cloud over any American city is the ultimate \nnightmare, and the risk is all too great. Osama bin Laden calls the \nacquisition of a nuclear device a ``religious duty.'' Documents \ncaptured from a key al-Qaida aide 3 years ago reveal plans even then to \nsmuggle high-grade radioactive materials into the United States in \nshipping containers.\n  If al-Qaida can obtain or assemble a nuclear weapon, they will use it \non New York, Washington, or any American city. The greatest danger we \nface in the days and weeks ahead is a nuclear 9/11, and we hope and \npray it is not already too late to prevent. The war in Iraq has made \nthe mushroom cloud more likely, not less likely, and it never should \nhave happened.\n  No. 6, the war in Iraq has provided a powerful worldwide recruiting \ntool for al-Qaida. We know al-Qaida is getting stronger because its \nattacks in other parts of the world are increasing. In the 8 years \nbefore 9/11, al-Qaida conducted three attacks. But in the 3 years since \n9/11, it has carried out a dozen more attacks, killing hundreds in \nSpain, Pakistan, Indonesia, and elsewhere.\n  No. 7, because of the war, Afghanistan itself is still unstable. \nTaliban and al-Qaida elements roam the country. A dangerous border with \nPakistan, where terrorists can easily cross, continues to be wide open. \nPresident Hamid Karzai is frequently forced to negotiate with warlords \nwho control private armies in the tens of thousands. Opium production \nis at a record level and is being used to finance terrorism. Our troops \nthere are in greater danger. Free and fair elections are in greater \ndanger. The war in Iraq has stretched our troops thin to the point \nwhere we cannot provide enough additional forces to stop the rising \ndrug trade and enable President Karzai to gain full control of\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\nthe country and root out al-Qaida. How can we afford not to do that?\n\n  No. 8, we have alienated longtime friends and leaders in other \nnations, whom we heavily depend on for intelligence, for border \nenforcement, for shutting off funds to al-Qaida, and for many other \ntypes of support in the ongoing war against international terrorism. \nMistrust of America has soared throughout the world, and we are \nespecially hated in the Muslim world. In parts of it, the bottom has \nfallen out.\n  The past 2 years have seen the steepest and deepest fall from grace \nour country has ever suffered in the eyes of the world community in all \nour history. We remember the enormous goodwill that flowed to America \nin the aftermath of September 11, and we never should have squandered \nit.\n  Does President Bush ever learn? His chip-on-the-shoulder address to \nthe United Nations last week was yet another missed opportunity to turn \nthe page and start regaining the genuine support of the world community \nfor a sensible policy on Iraq.\n  In fact, the President's arrogance toward the world community has \nleft our soldiers increasingly isolated and alone. We have nearly 90 \npercent of the troops on the ground in Iraq, and more than 95 percent \nof those killed and wounded are Americans. Instead of other nations \njoining us, initially supportive nations are pulling out. The so-called \ncoalition of the willing has become the coalition of the dwindling.\n  No. 9, our overall military forces are stretched to the breaking \npoint because of the war in Iraq. As the Defense Science Board recently \ntold Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       Current and projected force structure will not sustain our \n     current and projected global stabilization commitments.\n\n  LTG John Riggs said it clearly:\n\n       I have been in the Army 39 years, and I've never seen the \n     Army as stretched in that 39 years as I have today.\n\n  As Senator John McCain warned last week, if we have a problem in some \nother flash point in the world, ``it's clear, at least to most \nobservers, that we don't have sufficient personnel.''\n  The war has also undermined the Guard and Reserve. Many Guard members \nare also first responders for any terrorist attack on the United \nStates. Our homeland security, as well, is being weakened because of \ntheir loss.\n  No. 10, the war in Iraq has undermined the basic rule of \ninternational law that protects captured Americans. The Geneva \nConventions are supposed to protect our forces, but the brutal \ninterrogation techniques used at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq have lowered \nthe bar for treatment of POWs and endangered our soldiers throughout \nthe world.\n  No. 11, while President Bush has been preoccupied with Iraq, not just \none but two serious nuclear threats have been rising--from North Korea \nand Iran. Four years ago, North Korea's plutonium program was inactive. \nIts nuclear rods were under seal. Two years ago, as the Iraq debate \nbecame intense, North Korea expelled the international inspectors and \nbegan turning its fuel rods into nuclear weapons. At the beginning of \nthe Bush administration, North Korea was already thought to have two \nsuch weapons. Now they may have eight or more, and the danger is far \ngreater.\n\n  Iran, too, is now on a fast track that could produce nuclear weapons. \nThe international inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at \ntwo nuclear sites, and Iran admitted last March that it had the \ncentrifuges to enrich uranium. The international community might be \nmore willing to act if President Bush had not abused the U.N. \nresolution passed on Iraq 2 years ago, when he took the words ``serious \nconsequences'' as a license for launching his unilateral war in Iraq. \nNow, after that breach of faith with the world community, other nations \nnow refuse to trust us enough to enact a similar U.N. resolution on \nIran because they fear President Bush will use it to justify another \nreckless war.\n  No. 12, while we focused on the nonexistent nuclear threat from \nSaddam, we have not done enough to safeguard the vast amounts of \nunsecured nuclear material in the world. According to a joint report by \nthe Nuclear Threat Initiative and Harvard's Managing-the-Atom Project, \n``scores of nuclear terrorist opportunities lie in wait in countries \nall around the world''--especially at sites in the former Soviet Union \nthat contain enough nuclear material for a nuclear weapon and are \npoorly defended against terrorists and criminals.\n  As former Senator Sam Nunn said:\n\n       The most effective, least expensive way to prevent nuclear \n     terrorism is to secure nuclear weapons and materials at the \n     source.\n\n  How loudly--how loudly--does the alarm bell have to ring before \nPresident Bush wakes up?\n  No. 13, the neglect of the Bush administration of all aspects of \nhomeland security because of the war is frightening. All we have to do \nis look at today's paper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when I have \n1 minute remaining.\n  It says in the paper that the FBI is said to lag on translations. It \ntalks about 3 years after 9/11 more than 120,000 hours of potentially \nvaluable terrorism-related recordings have not been translated by the \nlinguists at the FBI. Then it talks about that the al-Qaida messages \n``tomorrow is zero hour'' and ``the match is about to begin'' were \nintercepted by the National Security Agency on September 10 but not \ntranslated until days afterwards.\n  Homeland security? Why aren't we getting this done in terms of \nsecuring our homeland? We are pouring nearly $5 billion a month into \nIraq. We are grossly shortchanging the urgent need to strengthen our \nability to prevent terrorist attacks at home and to strengthen our \npreparedness to respond to them if they occur.\n  As former Republican Senator Warren Rudman, chairman of the \nIndependent Task Force on Emergency Responders, said: ``Homeland \nsecurity is terribly underfunded.''\n  That is a Republican Senator who is saying that. That isn't a \nDemocrat. ``Terribly underfunded.''\n  We see what happens as a result. Our hospitals are unprepared for a \nbioterrorist attack. Our land borders, our seaports, our shipping \ncontainers, our transit systems, our waterways, nuclear power--none of \nthese have sufficient funds for protection against terrorist attacks, \neven though the Bush administration has put the Nation on high alert \nfor such attacks five times in the last 3 years.\n  You can't pack all these reasons America is not safer into a 30-\nsecond television response ad or a news story or an editorial. But as \nanyone who cares about the issue can quickly learn, our President has \nno credibility--no credibility--when he keeps telling us that America \nand the world are safer because he went to war in Iraq and rid us of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  President Bush's record on Iraq is clearly costing American lives and \nendangering America and the world. Our President won't change or even \nadmit how wrong he has been and still is. Despite the long line of \nmistaken blunders and outright deception, there has been no \naccountability. As election day draws closer, the buck is circling more \nand more closely over 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Only a new President \ncan right the extraordinary wrongs of the Bush administration on our \nforeign policy and our national security.\n  On November 2, the American people will decide whether they still \nhave confidence in this President's leadership. When we ask ourselves \nthe fundamental question, whether President Bush has made us safer, \nthere can only be one answer. No, he has not. That is why America needs \nnew leadership. We could have been, and we should have been much safer \nthan we are today.\n  We cannot afford to stay this very dangerous course. This election \ncannot come soon enough. As I have said before, the only thing America \nhas to fear is 4 more years of George Bush.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9774-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9774-S9776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, September 3, 2004, marked the 40th \nanniversary of the Wilderness Act. I have introduced a resolution, S. \nRes. 387, commemorating this important milestone, and I hope the Senate \nwill approve this resolution, which has 18 cosponsors, before we \nadjourn for the year.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the many people \nwho have\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\nhelped us preserve over 106 million acres of wilderness for future \ngenerations to hike, to hunt, to fish, and to enjoy.\n  People such as Howard Zahniser, Olaus and Mardy Murie, Ceila Hunter, \nand Bob Marshall had the vision to protect our wild places. Legislators \nsuch as John Saylor and Hubert Humphrey listened to them and made their \nvision a reality.\n  As a Senator from Wisconsin, I feel a special bond with this issue. \nMy State has produced great wilderness thinkers and leaders, such as \nthe writer and conservationist Aldo Leopold, whose ``A Sand County \nAlmanac'' helped to galvanize the environmental movement; like Sierra \nClub founder John Muir; and like Sigurd Olson, one of the founders of \nthe Wilderness Society.\n  Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico said that his support of the \nwilderness system was the direct result of discussions he had held \nalmost 40 years before with Leopold. And then-Secretary of the Interior \nStewart Udall referred to Leopold as the instigator of the modern \nwilderness movement.\n  For others, the ideas of Olson and Muir--particularly the idea that \npreserving wilderness is a way for us to better understand our \ncountry's history and the frontier experience--provided an important \njustification for the wilderness system.\n  I am privileged to hold the Senate seat held by Gaylord Nelson, a man \nfor whom I have the greatest admiration and respect. He is a well-known \nand widely respected former Senator and two-term Governor of Wisconsin, \nand the founder of Earth Day. What I find so remarkable is that, even \nafter a distinguished career in public service, he continues to work \nfor conservation. He is currently devoting his time to the protection \nof wilderness by serving as a counselor to the Wilderness Society--an \nactivity which is quite appropriate for someone who was a co-sponsor, \nalong with former Senator Proxmire, of the bill that became the \nWilderness Act.\n\n  I am proud of Wisconsin's part in making this legislation law, and I \nam proud to carry on that tradition through the Senate Wilderness \nCaucus.\n  I also wish to thank my colleagues the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nand the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, all of whom served in \nthe Senate in 1964 and voted for the Wilderness Act.\n  That Act was the first piece of legislation in the world to preserve \nwild places. Forty years after the act passed, wilderness still enjoys \nwidespread, bipartisan support. Just recently the Bush administration \nannounced its recommendation for wilderness designation of the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin, a place that is near and dear \nto my heart and to the hearts of many Wisconsinites. I thank my former \nstaffer Mary Frances Repko, who for 9 years worked tirelessly to \npromote, protect, and push for a wilderness study for the Apostles \nIslands, and to preserve America's public lands.\n  In closing, I would like to remind colleagues of the words of Aldo \nLeopold in his 1949 book, ``A Sand County Almanac.'' He said, ``The \noutstanding scientific discovery of the twentieth century is not the \ntelevision, or radio, but rather the complexity of the land organism. \nOnly those who know the most about it can appreciate how little is \nknown about it.'' We still have much to learn, but this anniversary of \nthe Wilderness Act reminds us how far we have come and how the \ncommitment to public lands that the Senate and the Congress \ndemonstrated 40 years ago continues to benefit all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I recently received a letter from Mrs. \nMargaret Baker of Hillsboro, WV, who wrote of ``how important \nwilderness areas are to the quality of life in West Virginia.'' Writing \nabout West Virginia's Cranberry Wilderness Area, she explains that, in \nthis special place ``you can take your children here and actually see \nwhat nature looks like when it's not in a neatly labeled museum \nexhibit, when the animals aren't in cages and the trees aren't trimmed \ninto perfect little bricketts of shrubbery.''\n  Mrs. Baker's letter continues:\n\n       My husband and I hike in the Cranberry Wilderness and \n     always see something that is astonishing, a forest of ferns, \n     an abstract art work of lichen or sunset colored mushrooms. \n     You can see a picture of a wilderness area but unless you \n     smell it, and feel the mud under your boots, experience the \n     light shining on it and hear the birds and crickets, you \n     can't really appreciate how amazing the offerings of the \n     planet are. I think West Virginians have a duty to preserve \n     this reminder of what is good and wholesome and worth being \n     optimistic about in our world. Help keep West Virginia wild.\n\n  I share that letter today for several reasons. The first is that Mrs. \nBaker's letter gives me the opportunity to boast of the natural beauty \nof West Virginia, which everyone knows I like to do. One should not \ndoubt that areas like the Cranberry Wilderness are both beautiful and \nunique. This incredible area of 35,864 acres of broad and massive \nmountains and deep, narrow valleys is the State's largest wilderness \narea.\n  As Mrs. Baker's letter so movingly indicates, visitors to the \nCranberry Wilderness directly and vividly experience nature. Its \nwildlife includes black bear, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, mink, \nbobcat, numerous varieties of birds, and many species of reptiles. The \nwaters of the Cranberry Wilderness are home to brook trout and several \nspecies of amphibians. Vegetation in the area includes spruce and \nhemlock at the higher elevations and hardwood trees such as black \ncherry and yellow birch and thickets of rhododendrons and mountain \nlaurel in the lower terrain.\n  How exciting and rewarding it is to know that individuals like Mrs. \nBaker are able to use and enjoy this great wilderness. I certainly \nagree with Mrs. Baker that we ``have a duty to preserve this [and \nother] reminders of what is good and wholesome.''\n  That brings me to my second reason for sharing Mrs. Baker's letter \nwith you. This year, 2004, is the 40th anniversary of the Wilderness \nAct of 1964, which was enacted to ensure that special places like the \nCranberry Wilderness would be protected for future generations. In an \nera of ``an ever increasing population, accompanied by expanding \nsettlement and growing mechanization,'' the Wilderness Act declared \nthat we must secure the land where ``the earth and its community of \nlife are untrammeled by man and where man himself is a visitor.''\n  My home State of West Virginia has certainly benefitted from the \ncreation of wilderness areas, and the Cranberry Wilderness is just one \nof the five wilderness areas in my State. The others include Dolly \nSods, Otter Creek, Laurel Fork North, and Laurel Fork South Wilderness \nAreas, and West Virginia remains wild and wonderful, in part, because \nof Congress's actions. Furthermore, our Nation's 662 wilderness areas \nhave given Americans a freedom to explore. This freedom has been \nsecured and protected so that future generations also may enjoy the \nbeauty of God's creation.\n  Covered from end to end, and on all sides, by the ancient Appalachian \nMountains, West Virginia is exquisite in its natural splendor. It is \nthe most southern of the northern; the most northern of the southern; \nthe most eastern of the western; and the most western of the eastern \nStates. It is where the east says ``good morning'' to the west, and \nwhere Yankee Doodle and Dixie kiss each other goodnight.\n  It is only fitting that, on the celebration of the 40th anniversary \nof the Wilderness Act, we cast our eyes backward so that we might have \ninsight into how to better prepare for future events. On a whole range \nof important issues, the Senate has always been blessed with Senators \nwho were able to reach across party lines and consider, first and \nforemost, the national interest.\n  Our late colleague, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey was certainly such a \nperson. He introduced the first wilderness bill in the Senate in 1956 \nand was there for its passage in 1964. Other former colleagues had this \nability, including Senators Scoop Jackson, Clinton Anderson, Frank \nChurch, Richard Russell, and Mike Mansfield. They understood the art of \nlegislating, and they reveled in it. For this and other reasons, I am \nalso honored to be associated with such Senators and to be the \nrecipient of the Hubert H. Humphrey Wilderness Leadership Award that \nwas presented to me earlier this month.\n  As we look back 40 years, we can see how the seeds of legislation \nhave blossomed. This certainly rings true of the\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\npassage of the Wilderness Act. Through four Congresses, Members on both \nsides of the aisle worked through the key challenges and made the right \ncompromises rather than simply succumbing to the purely political \ntactics and rhetoric that seem to dominate today. The debate on the \nWilderness Act should serve as a great example of how Members of both \nparties in the Senate and the House of Representatives can come \ntogether to pass historic pieces of legislation.\n  It is hard for me to believe that 40 years have passed since Congress \nfirst approved the Wilderness Act. It is also hard to believe that only \nSenators Inouye and Kennedy and I remain in the Senate as Members who \nvoted for that original legislation. Yet today we can proudly say that \nthe original designation of 9.1 million acres in that first bill has \nexpanded to more than 105 million acres in 44 States. I believe that \nthis landmark legislation should serve as a lesson for those who are \nseeking guidance regarding other important measures before this and \nfuture Congresses.\n  In closing, I am reminded of the immortal words of one of America's \nforemost conservationists and outdoorsmen, John Muir:\n\n       Oh, these vast, calm, measureless mountain days, inciting \n     at once to work and rest! Days in whose light everything \n     seems equally divine, opening a thousand windows to show us \n     God. Nevermore, however weary, should one faint by the way \n     who gains the blessing of one mountain day: whatever his \n     fate, long life, short life, stormy or calm, he is rich \n     forever. . . . I only went out for a walk, and finally \n     concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, \n     was going in.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 40th \nanniversary of the Wilderness Act.\n  From the days of the earliest settlers, wilderness has always been a \ndefining part of our national heritage. Simply put, the American \nwilderness helped shape the American values of freedom, opportunity and \nindependence.\n  As it did in 1964, Nevada still contains many of the wildest and \nleast traveled places in the lower 48 States. The remote and untamed \nareas of Nevada represent a reservoir of challenges and opportunities \nfor hunters, fishermen, birdwatchers, photographers, and other \noutdoorsmen.\n  We all play a stewardship role, and I am proud of the job our nation \nhas done and continues to do in upholding these uniquely American \nvalues.\n  In particular, I would like to recognize four individuals from my \nhome State of Nevada who are true wilderness heroes.\n  Marge Sill has advocated protecting wild places for more than 4 \ndecades. She worked to pass the 1964 Act, as well as every Nevada \nwilderness bill since then. Marge helped establish the Friends of \nNevada Wilderness, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, and \nhas mentored multiple generations of wilderness advocates.\n  Hermie and John Hiatt have been leaders in Nevada conservation \nefforts for more than 2 decades. Their tireless advocacy for wilderness \nand environmental protection particularly in southern and eastern \nNevada serves as inspiration for many. Their interest in and knowledge \nof the science behind conservation serves Nevada well.\n  Finally I would like to recognize Roger Scholl, who played a key role \nin the development of the 1989 Nevada Wilderness Protection Act. In a \nquiet but effective and reasonable manner, Roger has consistently \nsought to develop consensus wilderness proposals. From Mt. Moriah and \nthe Schell Creek Range in White Pine County to Mr. Rose and High Rock \nCanyon in Washoe County, Roger's work on wilderness issues has \nbenefited Nevada and our Nation. His counsel has served me well.\n  Through the work of these Nevadans the number of Nevada wildernesses \nhas grown from one, the Jarbidge Wilderness, to more than 40 in 40 \nyears. I commend them for their work on behalf of Nevada and the \nNation.\n  As President Lyndon Johnson said upon signing the Wilderness Act, \n``If future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than \ncontempt, we must leave them something more than the miracles of \ntechnology. We must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was in the \nbeginning.''\n  With stewards such as these four great Nevadans, If know that our \nNation's great wilderness heritage will be secure for generations to \ncome.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, forty years ago this month, President \nLyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act, which set aside some of the \nmost quintessential American landscapes in this vast country. This \nvisionary law first protected about 9 million acres of public lands. \nToday, as a result of a bipartisan commitment by successive Congresses \nand Presidents, 105 million acres of land are protected in 44 States.\n  California is blessed to have nearly 14 million acres permanently \nprotected as wilderness for the public to enjoy and as a legacy for \nfuture generations. These areas include some of the most spectacular \nlands and diverse ecosystems, including forests, deserts, coastal \nmountains and grasslands.\n  Americans have long recognized the need to protect our public lands \nand their vast resources. John Muir, along with U.S. presidents from \nboth parties, including Teddy Roosevelt, foresaw the need for us to \nprotect these precious lands, lest they be lost forever.\n  Wilderness provides a place of refuge from urban pressures. Millions \nof Americans retreat to wilderness to fish, hunt, horseback ride, \ncross-country ski, hike and pursue other recreational breaks from \neveryday life.\n  Wilderness protects watersheds that provide clean water to our cities \nand farms. Forests cleanse our air and provide habitat for countless \nplant and animal species, many of which are endangered. Wilderness \nprovides something else that is harder to measure, solitude and peace. \nCalifornia's population of nearly 36 million will balloon to 50 million \nin the next 20 years, so space will become even more precious.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Feingold's resolution honoring the \n40th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. I am also pleased to be the \nauthor of the California Wild Heritage Act, which would protect \napproximately 2.5 million acres of public lands as wilderness. The \nareas that would be protected by this legislation include: the King \nRange on the Lost Coast in Northern California; the White Mountains in \neastern California, home to the ancient Bristlecone Pines; and Eagle \nPeak in San Diego County, which includes the headwaters of the San \nDiego River and is home to great plant and animal diversity.\n  These and many other areas deserve the protection that was envisioned \nback in 1964, when the Wilderness Act was signed into law.\n  I believe that our beautiful and varied landscapes help make us the \npeople that we are. Today, we look back and are thankful for those who \nworked to set aside the rich tapestry that is our wilderness heritage. \nBut looking back is not enough. We must also dedicate ourselves to \nsecuring the irreplaceable remaining unprotected wilderness areas as \nour legacy for those who follow us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9776-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9776-S9778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHALLENGES FACING AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for this opportunity to \nspeak on issues that go to the heart of the challenges facing America \nand the challenge we face in the upcoming election. Is there one of us \nwho can forget 9/11, where we were, how our lives were changed, how \nAmerica was changed?\n  I was in this building, evacuated in panic as the White House was \nbeing evacuated, wondering what would happen next. Senators, \nCongressmen were dispersing in every direction, trying to find some \nsafe place with all the visitors in the Capitol.\n  I remember, as well, what happened during the course of that day. By \nthe evening time, after the President had spoken to our country, \nMembers of the Senate and House, Democrats and Republicans, in a \nremarkable, unprecedented move, stood together singing ``God Bless \nAmerica'' on the steps of our Capitol--a sense of unity, a sense of \npurpose, a determination to avenge those who had attacked the United \nStates and to protect Americans here and abroad.\n  Recall how the world reacted. Countries that had been barely friendly \nto the United States stood up and said\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nthey would be on our side in the war against terrorism, stood up and \nsaid they would help us to make sure such an attack never occurred \nagain, a broad coalition of countries standing behind the United \nStates, many of these same countries we had helped in years gone by. \nNow they were prepared to help us.\n  We came here on Capitol Hill and in a matter of hours did two very \nimportant things. First, we declared war on the clear enemy of the \nUnited States, al-Qaida. Of course, the Taliban in Afghanistan became \nthe focus of our military effort. It was a bipartisan vote, an \noverwhelming vote. There were no partisan speeches. We were together. \nWe had identified the enemy. We were moving forward. We were not going \nto forget what happened on 9/11 even as we buried our dead and honored \nthe wounded and the heroes of America.\n  And then think what happened next. We said to our Government: We are \ngoing to give you the tools and resources you need to fight this war \nagainst terrorism, to wage this war in Afghanistan. Again, we stood in \na bipartisan fashion.\n  It is hard to believe that was only 3 years ago. It seems like so \nmuch longer. What has happened in the meantime? Take a look around at \nthe United States and the world community. Countries that stood with us \nafter 9/11, determined to help us, have walked away from us. Americans \nwho were determined to work together are divided. We find ourselves \nwith scarce resources to really attack the enemies of the United \nStates. We find ourselves counting the dead and wounded on a daily \nbasis, with no end in sight.\n  What has happened to make the difference? What has happened is a \ndecision by this administration to lose focus, to stop this intensive \neffort against the enemies of 9/11 and instead to wage a war in Iraq--a \nwar which sadly goes on and on every single day, with no end in sight. \nFor some in the administration, it was an answer to a prayer; 9/11 was \nthe reason and the excuse that was needed to attack Iraq. This \nirrational passion to go after Saddam Hussein in Iraq, whatever the \nthreat against the United States, has led us to a point where we find \nso many of our best and brightest and bravest Americans dying and \nfacing severe injuries and wounds in Iraq every single day.\n  When the war began in Iraq, I said I wanted to call every family in \nIllinois who loses a soldier. I have not been able to do that. Some I \ncould not get through to. I have to tell you, there is a stack of six \nnames on my desk. Over 50 Illinoisans have been killed in this war and \nthere is no end in sight.\n  I spoke to another family yesterday, the family of a 28-year-old \nmarine from Pana, IL, a wonderful young man who was dedicated to this \ncountry. He lost his life a few days ago. How many times that story has \nbeen played out over and over again--over a thousand times American \nsoldiers killed, over 7,000 gravely wounded.\n  I have been to Walter Reed and I have seen them with arms blown off, \nlegs blown off, loss of both hands, head injuries, blinded, \nparaplegics. These are the wounded who come back from Iraq.\n  What do we know today? We know the case made by the Bush \nadministration for the invasion of Iraq was wrong. We know the \ninformation given to the American people to justify the invasion of \nthis country was wrong. How do we know that? The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, in a bipartisan report, came up with the clear conclusion \nthat our intelligence was just plain wrong.\n  When the President told us we would find an arsenal of weapons of \nmass destruction, over a year and a half later we have found none. When \nthe President told us we would find a stockpile of nuclear weapons \nthreatening the Middle East and the United States, we have found none. \nWhen the President told us there was a linkage between Saddam Hussein \nand al-Qaida, the attackers of 9/11, we have found none. The list goes \non and on.\n  The President has come back and retracted statements he made in the \nState of the Union Address, incorrectly saying that fissile materials, \nnuclear materials, were sent from Africa to Iraq. So the information \ngiven to the American people to justify the war turned out to be wrong.\n  Now, the question is, How were the American people misled? Was it \ndeliberate? I personally believe that unless there is clear, credible, \nand convincing evidence that the President and his administration knew \nthe information was wrong, you cannot say it was a deliberate deception \nof the American people. But this much you can say: People within this \nadministration who continue to parrot these lines they know are false \nare, frankly, not only doing a great disservice to the American people, \nthey have a wanton, reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n  Let me give you some quotes to back that up, so you understand what \nwe are talking about. This is a statement made by President Bush at a \npress conference a few months ago:\n\n       The reason that I keep insisting there was a relationship \n     between Iraq and al-Qaida is because there is a relationship \n     between Iraq and al-Qaida.\n\n  Look what Secretary of State Colin Powell said a few days ago:\n\n       I have seen nothing that makes a direct connection between \n     Saddam Hussein and that awful regime and what happened on 9/\n     11.\n\n  That is his own Secretary of State who says the President is not \ntelling the American people the facts.\n  Look at the 9/11 Commission report. This is a report prepared on a \nbipartisan basis, which has been lauded by everybody in Congress. This \nis what they say:\n\n       We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al-Qaida \n     cooperated on attacks against the United States.\n\n  Yet if you ask the American people, they will make the following \nargument: It is far better for us to be fighting terrorism in al-Qaida \nover there than to be fighting it here in the United States. These \nconclusions by the 9/11 Commission and Secretary of State Colin Powell \ntell you that statement is just plain wrong.\n  We are not fighting al-Qaida in Iraq. The al-Qaida forces, as Senator \nKennedy said earlier, have metastasized around the world. They are a \nthreat to all of us.\n  Let us tell you what we know for sure. We have lost international \ncooperation in Iraq; the same cooperation that was there to help us \nfight terrorism is gone. Our coalition continues to dwindle and the \nlosses are to American troops; 95 percent of those killed and wounded \nare American soldiers. If you want to know who is waging the war, how \nmuch commitment is being made by this coalition, that statistic tells \nit all.\n  Secondly, we were unprepared, we were not prepared, our troops did \nnot have the necessary equipment and even training for what they faced \nafter the initial military victory in Iraq.\n  Over the weekend, back home, officers in the Illinois National Guard \ntold us their units are being asked to do things far beyond their \ntraining capability. We know our troops went into battle in the \naftermath without the necessary body armor and that the Humvees were \nnot properly equipped for what happened in Iraq. We know our \nhelicopters didn't have the necessary defense equipment--this from an \nadministration that received every penny it asked for from Congress to \nwage this war.\n  This Commander in Chief did not stand up for our troops, was not \nprepared to defend our troops, and we have seen what resulted: over \n1,000 dead, over 7,000 wounded.\n  There is no end in sight.\n  There is a litany of quotes from Senator Hagel, Senator McCain, \nSenator Lugar, and so many others on the Republican side who have \njoined on the Democratic side to say that, clearly, we are not winning \nthe war in Iraq. This Commander in Chief cannot crow and brag about the \ngreat job in Iraq. We are there with no end in sight.\n\n  We have found now that we have been misled in going into Iraq, and we \ncontinue to be misled by statements from this administration about the \nreason for the war and what we can expect its outcome to be.\n  There are many who argue that John Kerry should not be elected \nPresident because he cannot come up with a plan to extricate us from \nthis complicated mess in Iraq. That, to me, is a curious position. This \nPresident, President Bush, drove our national bus into a cul-de-sac and \nnow he can't turn it around, and he blames John Kerry because he cannot \nexplain how President Bush can get us out of this mess in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\n  What is wrong with that picture? This is a decision by President Bush \nto invade before the inspections were completed, before the U.N. had an \nopportunity to join us, to invade before the facts were in. The \ninvasion took place and our military did its best. They are the best in \nthe world. They conquered Saddam Hussein, but they left us in a \nposition of vulnerability, with no end in sight. That is the choice \nfacing American voters on November 2.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9778-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last evening, on behalf of myself, \nSenator Carper, and Senator Lieberman, I offered an amendment to \nrewrite the formula for the Homeland Security Grant Program. The \namendment we brought before the Senate was unanimously reported as a \nseparate bill by the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  We should always keep in mind that should there be another terrorist \nattack on our country, people will be calling 911; they will not be \ncalling the Washington, DC, area code. It is our first responders--our \nfirefighters, our police officers, our emergency medical personnel--who \nare always on the scene first. We know that from the tragic attacks of \n9/11, and, as Secretary Ridge has pointed out many times, homeland \nsecurity starts with the security of our hometowns. For this reason, we \nhave come together in a bipartisan way, representing large States and \nsmall States, to draft the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act, and \nwe have offered it as an amendment to this bill. It would streamline \nand strengthen the assistance we provide to our States, communities, \nand first responders who protect our homeland.\n  The underlying Homeland Security Act contains virtually no guidance \non how the Department of Homeland Security is to assist State and local \ngovernments with their homeland security needs. In fact, the 187-page \nHomeland Security Act mentions the issue of grants to first responders \nin but a single paragraph. The decisions on how Federal dollars should \nbe spent or how much money should be allocated to home were left to \nanother day when Congress enacted that important legislation, but it is \nnow time for Congress to finally address this critical issue.\n\n  We know that much of the burden for homeland security has fallen on \nthe shoulders of State and local officials across America, those who \nare truly on the front lines. In crafting the amendment before us, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee listened first and foremost to our first \nresponders. We held three hearings on this vital topic and negotiated \nfor 2 years to produce the amendment that Senator Carper, Senator \nLieberman, and I are offering. The bipartisan measure was approved by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee by a 16-to-0 vote, and it currently \nhas 29 cosponsors, including the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  There are several groups that are active with first responders who \nare supporting our legislation. They include the National Governor's \nAssociation, Advocates for EMS, National Council of State Legislators, \nCouncil of State Governments, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational League of Cities, and the Fraternal Order of Police.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, our approach has widespread support. \nIt is supported by Senators from big States, such as Michigan and \nOhio--and I want to particularly commend the Senators from those States \nfor their hard work on this legislation--and small States, such as my \nhome State of Maine and the State of the Senator from Delaware.\n  The wide breadth of support demonstrates the balanced approach our \namendment takes to homeland security funding. It recognizes that \nthreat-based funding is a critical part of homeland security funding. \nIt does so by almost tripling the homeland security funding awarded \nbased on threat and risk. This has been a particular concern to Senator \nClinton, who has brought this issue before the Senate a couple of \ntimes.\n  The amendment, however, also recognizes that first responders in each \nand every State are on the front lines and have needs. Therefore, the \nbill maintains a minimum allocation for each State.\n  The legislation will also improve the coordination and the \nadministration of homeland security funding by promoting one-stop \nshopping for homeland security funding opportunities. It establishes a \nclearinghouse to assist first responders and State and local \ngovernments in accessing homeland security grant information and other \nresources within the new department. This clearinghouse will help \nimprove access to information, coordinate technical assistance for \nvulnerability and threat assessments, provide information regarding \nhomeland security best practices, and compile information regarding \nhomeland security equipment purchased with Federal funds.\n  Establishment of these improvements will mean first responders can \nspend more time training to save lives and less time filling out \nunnecessary paperwork.\n  This amendment will establish a fair and balanced approach to \nallocating this critical funding. I am very pleased to have worked with \nthe Senator from Delaware on this and I yield to him for any comments \nhe might have, unless, of course, the ranking member would like to \nspeak first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the recognition. Senator \nCollins and I have to go a short walk to a meeting, so I take this \nopportunity and use it briefly to rise in support of the Collins-Carper \namendment submitted by the chairman of the committee and the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, who worked very hard on this very \nimportant topic and area before the 9/11 Commission Report was assigned \nto the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  This is an important addition to the National Intelligence Reform \nAct, the underlying proposal that came out of our committee last week, \nbecause it would help ensure that in these dangerous times the needs of \nour States and local first responders are met in a reasonable and \ncoordinated way.\n  In the past 3 years since September 11, beginning on September 11, \nour first responders and preventers have made real progress in boosting \nAmerica's preparedness to deal with the threat of terrorism. But as an \nindependent task force of the Council on Foreign Relations found last \nyear: the United States has not reached a sufficient national level of \nemergency preparedness and remains dangerously unprepared to handle \ncatastrophic attack on American soil--dangerously unprepared. That I \ntake to refer particularly not to the law enforcers, who are the first \npreventers, but to the capacity of our total response system at the \nlocal and State level to respond to a catastrophic attack.\n  This amendment, unanimously approved by a total nonpartisan vote in \nour committee, is an important first step in ensuring that our local \nfirst responders get the resources they need.\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nFirst, this amendment simplifies the existing homeland security grant \nprocess by creating an interagency committee to coordinate Federal \nrequirements for homeland security planning and reporting, and it \neliminates redundancies. It would establish a clearinghouse to offer \nlocal communities one-stop shopping for information on available \nFederal grants.\n\n  Second and most important, this amendment would reform the way \nhomeland security grant money is currently distributed.\n  In crafting these funding provisions, the committee acted consistent \nwith the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission to significantly \nincrease the amount of homeland security funding distributed based on \nthreats but, the judgment we reached, not to eliminate a minimum amount \nto go to every State. The reason for that is unfortunately the reality \nof the terrorist threat and the nature of our terrorist enemies. Yes, \nthey have shown they will strike at visible national symbols, that to \nsome extent they will focus on big cities, but the fact is that anyone \nwho pays attention to the terrorist mode of operating around the world \nwill see what they also do is to strike at unpredictable, undefended, \nvulnerable targets.\n  Remember, these people do not hold themselves to any rules of \ncivilized or humane behavior, so they have no hesitancy to put a bomb \non a bus occupied by families, men, women, children; to attack a school \nand wantonly slaughter children, in some cases their teachers. In a \nreality such as this, gruesome and chilling as it is, the fact is every \npart of America needs some help from the Federal Government in getting \nitself prepared to prevent and respond, and that is exactly what this \namendment would do.\n  I continue to believe that this part of our own domestic army of \npreventers and responders in the war on terrorism is not adequately \nfunded. This amendment does not of itself change that, but it does \nrepresent a sensible bipartisan approach and goes a long way to \nensuring that whatever funding we do provide--and I hope that number \nwill increase--is allocated in a manner that is best designed to \nprotect all of the American people.\n  I thank Senator Collins and Senator Carper for the extraordinary work \nthey did on this issue in our committee. Senator Carper, characteristic \nof himself, took hold of a complicated problem with difficult political \nramifications to it but a real critical national need attached to it \nand worked very hard to bring about this result, which I feel very \nstrongly deserves the overwhelming support of Members of the Senate.\n  I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Delaware makes \nhis comments, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota, \nMr. Coleman, be added as a cosponsor to the underlying bill, S. 2845, \nand that he also be added as a cosponsor to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has been one \nof our most diligent committee members in attending all of the hearings \nwe held throughout the August recess. He was an active member of the \ncommittee throughout the debate on this legislation, and I am very \ngrateful to have his support and cosponsorship.\n  I say to the Senator from Connecticut that I think along with the \ncosponsorships we picked up yesterday, this is a sign that as people \nlook at our legislation and learn more about it, it is gaining even \nmore support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before the chairman of our committee and \nSenator Lieberman head for their meeting, I want to say in plain view \nof everyone how proud I am of the leadership they have provided to our \ncommittee. At a time when much of Washington, DC, was taking the month \nof August off, they made sure that our committee did not. At a time \nwhen most Senators were scattered around the world, the country, and \nback in their own States, they made sure we were here, and not just for \nany purpose but to participate in a series of excellent hearings.\n  I believe, and correct me if I am wrong, we have had a total of eight \nhearings thus far in the last month on this subject, from all kinds of \npeople within the CIA, folks who have been National Security Advisers, \nSecretaries of Defense, Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Homeland \nSecurity. We have heard from the Commissioners themselves, the cochairs \nof the Commission, and from their senior staff. It has been an \nextraordinary education. It has taken me a while to get my arms around \nthese issues. As we finished our markup, I said to both Senator Collins \nand Senator Lieberman that a lot had not been clear to me as we went \nthrough the course of those hearings, but as we went through the course \nof the markup a number of issues, questions that had not been in focus \nfor me, came into focus.\n\n  I thank you for providing this extraordinary month and a half for us \nto prepare to offer this package to our colleagues in the Senate. You \nhave done really good work. We are proud of you.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Thank you.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for his generous comments. I know \nSenator Lieberman joins me in commending the Senator from Delaware for \nhis active participation in our hearings. I believe the Senator from \nDelaware, as the Senator from Minnesota, made an extraordinary effort \nto be there, to question the witnesses, and all of us now quote the \nSenator from Delaware in various places and occasions, in reminding our \ncolleagues that:\n\n       The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.\n\n  Those words have become inexorably linked to the debate on \nintelligence reform. We thank the Senator for that as well.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the record should show those words should \nnot be directly attributed to me. They are actually the words of a \nrecently departed minister, Methodist minister from our State, Brooks \nReynolds, who would have been 89 years old on election day. He used to \ngive the opening prayer at the Delaware General Assembly. We would \nconvene every January. Among the things he would say to all of us who \nwould gather there in Dover in the legislative hall:\n\n       The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.\n\n  With respect to the underlying legislation, we have done a good job \nof doing that. What we have come up with is legislation that I think is \nwell designed to ensure that key decisionmakers--be it the President or \nthe President's Cabinet, those of us who serve in the House and Senate, \nthose who serve in the intelligence communities themselves--that we \nhave the information we need to have, we have it in a timely way, and \nthat we have the information objectively. That will enable us to better \nprotect this country from terrorism in the 21st century. That is the \nmain thing, and I believe the legislation before us today really does \nhelp us keep the main thing the main thing.\n  I wish to say a word or two, if I may today, about the amendment \nSenator Collins and I have offered. It seeks to address the issue of \nhow to allocate funds to first responders, and to also enable the \nsystem of distribution that we have to move forward with a little less \ndifficulty, a bit more smoothly, and maybe somewhat more efficiently.\n  First, I wish to say how much I have enjoyed working with Senator \nCollins. We have worked on it well over a year, and to express thanks \nto my staff and especially to John Kilvington on my staff for the great \nwork he has done with me and with Senator Collins's team.\n  What we seek to do with this amendment before us today, I say to my \ncolleagues, is to make a series of much needed reforms to the state of \nthe Homeland Security Grant Program. As many of my colleagues are \naware, funding under the State Homeland Security Grant Program today is \ndistributed somewhat arbitrarily. Much of the money that is made \navailable for grants each year is distributed on a per capita basis. It \nis based on a formula that is actually included in the PATRIOT Act.\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n  Some have criticized our current homeland security grant formula \nsaying it shortchanges larger States such as New York that are at the \nmost risk for attack. I agree. No one here, though, disputes the fact \nthat States such as New York and California deserve the biggest share \nof Federal funds.\n  But let me say clearly that funding should not be based on population \nalone. This may come as a surprise to some of you from big States such \nas Minnesota or Wyoming, but my home State of Delaware is not very big \nbut we still have major vulnerabilities. We have a significant port on \nthe Delaware River, the Port of Wilmington. Through that port, frankly, \nmore bananas come than any other port on the east coast--grapes, \nChilean fruit, and steel. Delaware has been known through its history \nas the chemical capital of the world, home to major companies such as \nDuPont and Hercules and others. We have a number of plants that dot the \nlandscape. Delaware is a financial center for our country, in downtown \nWilmington, DE.\n  A lot of people go through Delaware. If you do, you probably know I-\n95 passes through Delaware, one of the busiest highways in the country. \nInterstate 495 does as well. The Northeast corridor for Amtrak passes \nthrough Delaware. Both freight railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, two \nof the busiest railroads in America, pass through Delaware.\n  To our east, we have the Delaware River, a heavily trafficked river \nwith some cargo, including some hazardous cargo that goes through our \nStates, between our State and New Jersey on that river. On the other \nside of the Delaware is New Jersey and there is a nuclear powerplant in \nSummit, NJ. All of these factors tend to make our State a not \nunattractive target for terrorists.\n  We need to make sure that whatever we do, we protect States such as \nDelaware that may not be the most populous but do have real safety and \nsecurity concerns. I believe--I might be wrong, but I believe with this \namendment we have found a way to do that without shortchanging our \nsister States around the country.\n  The 9/11 Commission rightly pointed out that the current grant \nformula simply does not direct the Federal Government's scarce homeland \nsecurity resources to the States and localities that need it the most. \nThey called on Congress to create a new formula based on an assessment \nof threats and vulnerabilities that take into account real risk factors \nsuch as population density and the presence of critical infrastructure.\n  Our amendment does just that. The formula we have crafted ensures \nthat the majority of Federal first responders' aid each year goes to \nthe States most vulnerable to attack. In my judgment and the judgment \nof my colleagues, our cosponsors, the formula is a fair one. It would \nensure that big States such as New York and California and smaller, \nless populated States such as Delaware, or less populous States such as \nWyoming or Minnesota, receive our fair share of Federal homeland \nsecurity dollars.\n  Large States will do much better under this formula in the amendment \nthan they do under current law. This is especially true for States with \nlarge, densely populated cities or those that are located along an \ninternational border. It is my hope that this amendment will also \nbetter account for needs in States such as Delaware that have small \npopulations but are located in risky parts of the country and have \nother significant vulnerabilities.\n  In addition, our amendment gives the Secretary of Homeland Security \nthe authority to distribute a portion of each year's grant funding \ndirectly to large cities such as New York or Washington, DC, where we \nare gathered today, to help them meet their unique security needs.\n  We do all of this while preserving the small State minimum set out in \ncurrent law. This will ensure that small States such as ours will \ncontinue to receive the resources they need, that we need, to protect \nour citizens from potential terrorist attack.\n  In addition to these important formula changes which have been \nalluded to by both Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, our amendment \nmakes this Homeland Security Grant Program much more user friendly.\n  I don't know if our Presiding Officer or my colleague from Minnesota \ntalked to their Governors recently or their mayors. Senator Coleman was \nonce a mayor so he could be talking to himself on this one, I suppose. \nBut any of us talking to our Governors or mayors or first responders \nover the last couple of years know how inefficient this program can be \nand how frustrating it can be to deal with. Under the current system, \nanyone seeking a grant is faced with, believe it or not, a 12-step \napplication process--12 steps. Once this process is complete, first \nresponders then have to sit around and wait, sometimes for months, \nbefore they see that first dime.\n  Our amendment dramatically streamlines this process; shortening the \n12-step application process to 2 steps, requiring that States pass \ngrant funds down to the local level within 60 days of receipt. Our \namendment also ensures that cities and local governments are involved \nin their State's planning and application process. Our amendment also \nincludes an important provision giving States significant new \nflexibility to use first responder aid they receive to meet their most \npressing security needs.\n  Under the current system, States are given funding in four \ncategories: No. 1, planning; No. 2, training; No. 3, they can use this \nmoney for exercises, and, No. 4, for equipment purchases. The States \nmust spend a certain amount of money in each category, even if their \nhomeland security plan calls for a different spending plan.\n  We propose, on the other hand, to give States the ability to apply \nfor a waiver that would allow them to use unspent training money, for \nexample, to purchase needed equipment, if that is where their needs \nwere to lie or, frankly, the converse could be true.\n  Finally, our amendment creates a one-stop shop within the Department \nof Homeland Security. That one-stop shop would enable applicants to \nobtain grant information and other assistance. It also lays the \ngroundwork for future reforms by authorizing a major review of all \nexisting homeland security-related grant programs.\n  As part of this review, an interagency committee will look at \nplanning, will look at application and paperwork requirements in an \neffort to ensure that the different programs are coordinated and do not \nimpose duplicative requirements on applicants. The committee would then \nmake recommendations for changes aimed not at eliminating programs but \nat making sure all of those programs work together in a coordinated \nfashion with as small an administrative burden on applicants as \npossible.\n  In conclusion, this amendment is based on bipartisan legislation \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously this \npast June. It is a product of more than a year of debate on that \ncommittee about how we could better serve our first responders. The \namendment enjoys the support of Democrat and Republican Senators from \nboth large States and from small States, and when we have the \nopportunity to vote on this amendment, I will certainly urge our \ncolleagues to vote for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleague, the \nSenator from Delaware, for the outstanding work he has done on this \namendment and, in fact, as the Senator from Maine noted, his work \ninvolved in the series of hearings that we had to allow us to come \nbefore this body with a piece of legislation that will make America \nsafer.\n  If I may reflect first on the process of the underlying bill, we had \na series of I believe eight hearings. Sometimes folks say we move too \nslow in these hallowed halls. There was a concern that in less than 2 \nmonths we would come before this body with a bill that provides major \nrestructuring of the way in which we handle the threat of terrorism in \nthis country, that some might say we moved too hastily. But one \nwouldn't say that if they observed the process.\n  Within those eight hearings, we had a wellspring of information. We \nheard from heads of the CIA in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s across party \nlines. I think of that hearing. We talked about the ``three wise men'' \nwho came before\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\nus. We heard from agents who were active in the field in hearings that \nwere not open to the public in which in fact the names of the agents \nthemselves were still kept confidential. We heard from members of the \nCommission. We heard from representatives of the families of the \nvictims.\n  It was for me, relatively new in this body, who served as a mayor, as \nthe Presiding Officer has served as a mayor, and involved in politics \nat what I call the bottom of the political food chain, a fascinating \neducational experience. I learned a lot. I think my colleagues, no \nmatter how long they were in this body, learned a lot. We have all \nlearned a lot in the post-September 11, 2001 world.\n  As a result of what we heard, we come before this body with some \nneeded reform--reform that has broad bipartisan support. I believe the \nprocess we used represents the best of what this body is all about, \nworking in a bipartisan way dealing with some difficult issues, issues \nof life and death, truly life and death, coming to some conclusions, \nand in the end making America a safer place.\n  I associate myself with the comments of my colleague from Delaware as \nhe talked about the process because I shared that experience.\n  I also want to talk about the underlying amendment, the Collins-\nLieberman-Carper amendment, again from the prospective of a former \nlocally elected official who appreciates one-stop shopping. When I was \ndealing with licensing in the city of St. Paul, one of the things we \ndid was set up one-stop shopping so folks didn't have to go to 16 \ndifferent places to fill out where the application was, what had to be \nin it, who you had to talk to, and it made a difference. I talked with \nour consumers. I know because I talked to them. When you are mayor and \ngo down the street, people will grab you by the elbow and tell you \nabout the experience. They appreciated it.\n  With a matter as complex, as serious, and as profound as dealing with \nthe issue of homeland security in a time when our Nation faces threats \nof terrorism, we managed in this amendment to do a number of things \nwhich I believe are very helpful. We simplified a process. We have \ntaken something that was a 12-step process and made it a 2-step \nprocess.\n  We have accelerated the process requiring States to provide 80 \npercent for the homeland security resources they receive at the local \nlevel within 60 days without moving the money forward. There are needs \nout there. People deserve to know that the resources are there.\n\n  We provided flexibility, targeting the most vulnerable areas, and \nalso making sure that all parts of the country and all States have an \nopportunity to do what needs to be done to provide a greater measure of \nsafety against the threat of terrorism.\n  Minnesota is a big State. Wyoming is a big State geographically, but \nnot a big State in population. Much of the area of Minnesota is rural. \nYet within the State of Minnesota, which is a big State but not a \nhighly-populated State, with about 5 million people, we have the Mall \nof America, probably one of the most frequented tourist places in the \nUnited States. Every year 35 million people visit the Mall of America.\n  We have, of course, the Mississippi River in Minnesota which starts \nas a little stream right up there in Itasca and becomes the great \nMississippi of legend, of Mark Twain, and eventually finds its way to \nLouisiana and into the gulf.\n  Along the Mississippi, we have a nuclear powerplant on an Indian \nreservation, the Prairie Island Reservation right on the Mississippi \nRiver in Minnesota. We have Duluth, which is located on Lake Superior, \nwhich is the gateway to the Great Lakes and transatlantic shipping.\n  We have miles and miles of border between Minnesota and Canada, a \nborder that is not heavily populated, that is easily crossed, a border \nwhich in certain conditions is pretty tough to police. It is pretty \ntough up in International Falls where it is minus 28 or 30 degrees \nFahrenheit without wind chill. Border agents up there have to learn how \nto pull a trigger on a pistol when it is very cold. It is not that \neasy. They have to learn how to use snowmobiles and float planes, and \nall sorts of things that may not be seen in other parts of the country.\n  But we face challenges. Obviously, we heard from Delaware, and the \nPresiding Officer would be on the floor now talking about Wyoming. He \nwould talk about the challenges that are faced there.\n  This is an amendment that provides the targeting of resources in the \nareas where clearly there is the greatest threat but provides the \nneeded flexibility so that places such as International Falls in \nMinnesota or the Mall of America or a nuclear powerplant on the \nMississippi River can also be protected.\n  This is an amendment that is a product of the process I talked about. \nIt has bipartisan support. It has the support of Senators from large \nStates and small States. It is something I believe my colleagues will \nand should overwhelmingly support.\n  I am honored to speak on behalf of this amendment and to urge its \nadoption. In doing so, I truly believe it will make this country a \nsafer place and it will make it easier and make it quicker. It will \nmake it much more practical for folks throughout this country to access \nthe funds they need to provide a greater measure of protection against \nthe threat of terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to address two provisions in \nthe underlying bill that were the subject of much debate, much \ndiscussion during our hearings on the 9/11 Commission recommendations. \nOne of them had to do with the recommendation as to whether the \nnational intelligence director should serve at the pleasure of the \nPresident or should serve a fixed term.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended that the national intelligence \ndirector serve at the pleasure of the President. Some observers, \nhowever, have suggested that making the NID serve a fixed term would \nhelp preserve the independence of the national intelligence director. \nThe Collins-Lieberman bill creates a NID who will be appointed by the \nPresident, confirmed by the Senate, and who will serve at the pleasure \nof the President. This is one of those discussions where the words of \nthe Senator from Delaware ring true: the importance of making sure we \nkeep the main thing the main thing.\n  We had come before us, as I indicated earlier, three former Directors \nof the Central Intelligence Agency: William Webster, James Woolsey, and \nStansfield Turner. Each of them testified that among all the powers of \nthe NID and the variables we needed to consider when deciding whether \nto create a national intelligence director, the most important quality, \nthe most important variable for the national intelligence director to \nbe effective is to have the support of the President of the United \nStates.\n  The national intelligence director will be responsible for overseeing \na broad range of intelligence functions and operations in this country. \nHis ability to provide that kind of leadership and direction in many \nways will be contingent upon having the support of the Commander in \nChief, having the support of the President of the United States.\n  Robert Mueller, who served a 10-year term as FBI Director, testified \nthat the NID should serve at the pleasure of the President. Director \nMueller distinguished the FBI, which is expected to be an independent \ninvestigative agency, from the office of the NID, which will be \nresponsible for advising the President on intelligence matters, and \nthat advice will be shaping the President's policy decisions. Among the \nresponsibilities of the NID is to be the principal adviser to the \nPresident himself.\n  Some believe that having the NID serve a fixed term could help \ninsulate the national intelligence director from political pressure. \nHowever, what it would do is to insulate the national intelligence \ndirector from the President. We cannot afford, in these difficult and\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\nchallenging times, at a time when America is under the threat of \nterrorist attack, to have the national intelligence director \nmarginalized by a President who does not trust the national \nintelligence director.\n  The national intelligence director will be one of the most powerful \nindividuals in the U.S. Government, and he will be one of the \nPresident's closest advisers. As such, the President has to be able to \nselect his own national intelligence director. And all those in the \nintelligence operations, all those in other branches of Government \nwho are involved in intelligence gathering, intelligence processing, \nand intelligence formulation of operation need to understand that the \nnational intelligence director has the absolute confidence of the \nPresident of the United States.\n\n  There are a number of alternative mechanisms to protect the \nobjectivity and the independence of the national intelligence director. \nBut, again, I think it is critically important that the national \nintelligence director have the support of the President. And those \nthoughts are not just the thoughts of this Senator, but they were the \nexpressed opinions of three former Directors of the Central \nIntelligence Agency who came before our committee and the opinion of \nthe current head of the FBI who himself has a 10-year term.\n  One of the other issues that was the subject of a great deal of \ndiscussion and focus was what type of authority the national \nintelligence director should have to develop and execute the budget for \nnational intelligence. It was said many times, whoever controls the \nmoney has the power.\n  We have made a judgment in this bill to have a strong national \nintelligence director, a national intelligence director who has the \nconfidence of the President of the United States, but also a national \nintelligence director who will have control over the development of the \nbudget for the national intelligence program, including the authority \nto coordinate, prepare, direct, and present to the President the annual \nbudget for the national intelligence program.\n  This bill gives the NID the authority to manage and oversee the \nexecution of the national intelligence program, including visibility \nand control over how money is spent. It ensures that the core national \nintelligence agencies--the CIA, NSA, NGA, NRO, FBI Office of \nIntelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security Directorate of \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection--are entirely within \nthe budgetary authority of the national intelligence director. And it \ngives the national intelligence director influence over the budgets of \nintelligence-related activities and organizations that are outside the \nnational intelligence director.\n  Our approach is consistent with the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, which said the NID must be given--and I quote--``control \nover the purse strings,'' including the power to submit a unified \nbudget for national intelligence, to receive the appropriation for \nnational intelligence, and to apportion the funds to the appropriate \nagencies in line with the budget.\n  The Commission viewed these budget authorities as absolutely \nessential to achieve the objectives of intelligence reform. One of the \nchairs of the Commission, Mr. Hamilton, said:\n\n       We would not create the national intelligence director if \n     he or she did not have strong budget authority.\n\n  Former Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency who testified \nbefore our committee also supported giving the national intelligence \ndirector strong budget authority.\n  William Webster, who was both head of the CIA and the FBI, said:\n\n       Control of the budget is essential to effective management \n     of the intelligence community.\n\n  James Woolsey, former Director of the CIA, said:\n\n       If budget execution authority is given to the [national \n     intelligence director], he will or she will have a much \n     better ability to say to the Secretary of State or the \n     Secretary of Defense, ``Look, I sympathize. I understand. I \n     know this fluent Arabic linguist is a very rare asset, but \n     you did not hear me. I really need her or him.''\n\n  Again, who controls the money has the power.\n  As Chairman Hamilton said: The Commission would not have created a \nnational intelligence director if he or she did not have strong budget \nauthority.\n  Senior officials in the Office of the Director of Central \nIntelligence also believe that stronger budget authority is needed in \norder for the national intelligence director to truly be in charge of \nthe intelligence community.\n  John McLaughlin said the person responsible for the intelligence \ncommunity should ``have full authority to determine, reprogram and \nexecute all funding for the core national intelligence agencies, \nprincipally CIA, NSA, the NGA and NRO.''\n  On and on, the advice the committee received was very clear: If you \nwant to have a strong national intelligence director, you must give him \nor her strong budget authority.\n  Consumers of intelligence also testified that it would be desirable \nfor the national intelligence director to have strong budget authority. \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, at the hearing of our committee on \nSeptember 13, 2004, said:\n\n       The [Director of Central Intelligence] was there before, \n     but the DCI did not have the kind of authority [needed]. And \n     in this town, it's budget authority that counts. Can you move \n     money? Can you set standards for people. So you have access \n     to the President? The [national intelligence director] will \n     have all of that, and so I think this is a far more powerful \n     player. And that will help the State Department.\n\n  Some of those who have brought a different perspective have said that \nthe Director of Central Intelligence already has the needed authority \nbut simply has failed to use it, and that if budget execution authority \nis needed, it should be given to the national intelligence director by \nExecutive order.\n  With respect to the NFIP budget, the testimony before our committee--\nmuch of it in closed session--demonstrated that the Director of Central \nIntelligence authorities in practice are considerably weaker than they \nmight appear on paper. So what we heard was how things work in the real \nworld. What we heard was the day-to-day reality of how authority can be \nused, how it can be challenged. If it is not crystal clear, if it is \nnot absolutely clear, if it is not unequivocal, as laid out in this \nbill, then, in fact, it may not in practice be as strong as one would \ndesire.\n\n  The testimony also demonstrated considerable confusion about the \nactual extent of the Director of Central Intelligence legal authority \nwhich I found to be quite interesting. We would have before us various \nmembers of the intelligence community, and there would actually be a \ncross-discussion going on as to whether there was, in fact, this \nauthority that one person believed was there but that the other person \ndidn't believe was there. What we do in this bill is to get rid of the \nconfusion and make it clear. We clarify any ambiguity in the existing \nlanguage and make unmistakably clear Congress's intent that the \nnational intelligence director, not the Department heads, will have the \nfinal say in developing the national intelligence budget.\n  With respect to receiving the appropriation and budget execution, the \nDirector of Central Intelligence clearly does not have these key \nauthorities today. Neither the administration nor we believe these \nauthorities could be given to the Director of Central Intelligence, \nmuch less the national intelligence director, which has not yet been \ncreated by Congress, without congressional action.\n  There is simply no excuse for Congress not to act. This bill provides \nthe kind of action that was clearly laid out before our committee as \nneeded, as supported by those both in the intelligence network and the \nsystem, those who are making the decisions and those who are working \nwith the decisions that are being made.\n  I do hope this body supports the recommendation of the Commission, \nthe recommendation that is part of the bill before us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the McCain amendment No. 3702, with no \nsecond degrees in order to the amendment prior to the vote; provided \nfurther that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the \nvote. Finally, I ask consent that following the vote, Senator Stevens \nbe recognized in order to make a statement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Chair indicate, there are still \ntwo additional amendments that are pending?\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the Senator's request, there is just one \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I understand the unanimous consent request talks about one \namendment, but if we dispose of that amendment, there would still be \ntwo amendments pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I would hope that following Senator Stevens's statement, we \ncould make arrangements to vote on those two as early as possible this \nafternoon and move on to other matters on this bill. All of these \nmatters have been debated thoroughly. I would hope that after that, the \nmajority leader can arrange a time to vote on these amendments. We are \nready over here. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. We will talk to the Members over the lunch hour and see \nif we can work this out.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here today on the eve of the debate \nthat will be occurring on Thursday evening. I know most Americans will \nbe watching. I think they are probably the most important debates, \ncertainly, since the Kennedy-Nixon debate, which was the first one.\n  The issue, of course, is related to the security of the country. I am \ngoing to focus my few remarks on security here at home, in terms of \nhomeland security.\n  Whatever you think of the war on terror abroad--and there are many \ndifferent views and we will hear some of those on Thursday night--my \nview--and I tend to be hawkish--is that hawks should be as angry or \nmore angry with the President than doves, because the bottom line is \nthat Iraq wasn't thought through. We don't have a plan and there is \nnowhere really to go. The idea of keeping faith and saying, well, there \nwill be elections in January and that will make everything better, that \nis similar to the idea that we will win the war in 3 weeks and that \nwill make everything better. It is simply not thought through and there \nare all these chimerical sort of wishes and hopes.\n  First, the election will not be held in many parts of the country. \nSecond, I don't think it is going to make the basic problems go away. A \ndevastating commentary on the war in Iraq is that we have been unable \nto spend money on infrastructure. One of the whole theories is that we \nwere going to rebuild the country and show the Iraqis a better life. \nBecause the terrorists who are there--who are despicable--have been \nable to do so much in terms of sabotage and criminal activities, in \nterms of taking those workers who would rebuild Iraq and treating them \nso brutally, it has made it basically impossible to rebuild. The \nPresident and his administration admitted as much when they took back \nthe money for rebuilding and are now putting it into security.\n  Again, what everyone thinks about the war overseas--and there are \nmany different views, and I believe John Kerry will enunciate a view \nthat is far more consonant with the American people than what President \nBush has done so far. I say that as somebody who supported the $87 \nbillion and the vote to go to war, because I believe we need a strong, \naggressive foreign policy.\n  I believe the war on terror is the vital discussion of this decade \nand of our generation, probably. To win the war on terror, you need a \ngood offense and a good defense. On defense, I regret to say, \nbasically, this administration has not come close to doing what is \nnecessary.\n  When you ask why, the bottom line is very simple: They don't want to \nspend the money. Their idea after idea after idea about air security, \nport security, rail security, truck security--we have the technology, \nnot to make certain a terrorist attack doesn't occur but certainly to \ndecrease the odds of it. When you go to the people in the agencies and \nask why are you not doing this or that, they say: We don't have the \nmoney. When we come to the floor and argue about homeland security--as \nwe just did when the Appropriations bill on homeland security came \nforward--we were told by my friend from Mississippi, the chairman, that \nwe are spending enough. Let me tell you, we are not spending close to \nenough in any one of these areas.\n\n  Let's say, God willing, we manage to wipe out al-Qaida in the next \nyear or two, and let's say the problems in Iraq subside--in my view, \nbecause Kerry will be elected and will handle them a lot better than \nPresident Bush has--we are still going to have new terrorist threats.\n  Terrorism can be described in a single sentence, which is that the \nvery technology that has blessed our lives and accounted for so much of \nthe prosperity we have seen over the last two decades has an evil \nunderside; namely, that small groups of bad people can get ahold of \nthat technology and use it for terrible purposes. So if al-Qaida is \ngone--and let's hope they will be--and if terrorism in Iraq greatly \ndeclines--and let's hope that occurs--there are going to be new groups \nthat start using this terrorism and using it against us and trying to \nuse it in our homeland. It could be Chechnians; maybe they will have a \nmeeting and decide that instead of blowing up movie theaters and \nairplanes in Moscow, the real answer is to go after the United States. \nMaybe it will be East Timorese, who have been fighting for independence \nin east Asia. For all we know, it could be skinheads in Montana who \ndecide to do this--a couple of them did it in Oklahoma City--but in a \nmore structured and destructive way, God forbid. So we cannot even keep \ntrack of the various groups that could hurt us.\n  The sad fact is, if 500 random people around the world, with some \nleadership, were injected with an evil virus and they were to decide, \nfanatically, they would devote the next 5 years of their lives to \nfiguring out how to hurt America and try to implement it, the odds are \ntoo high that they could succeed.\n  So do we need a good offense? Yes, we do. Do we need a good defense? \nYou bet. On area after area after area, we are not doing enough. Let me \ncatalog a few.\n  Air security, here we are doing something of a better job than we \nhave done in the past. The screeners, for all the problems they have, \nare a lot better than they were before 9/11 when they were paid minimum \nwage by private security companies. Some didn't speak English \nadequately. We are inspecting cargo.\n  But probably the No. 1 way terrorists could now hurt us as we travel \nin the air is by using shoulder-held missiles. We know the terrorists \nhave them, al-Qaida has them, and they are available on the black \nmarket. We are slow walking any attempt to put on our commercial \nairplanes the mechanism to deflect the rockets, the heat-seeking \nrockets that emerge from shoulder-held missiles.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that on at least five different \noccasions we have had votes on the Senate floor where we have asked for \nincreased funding for homeland security and the Bush people have turned \nit down through various ways? I amplify that by saying these are all \nset forth in Senator Byrd's best-selling book. Is the Senator aware we \ntried to get money for real homeland security--not security in Iraq but \nsecurity for the American people--and this has been turned down; is he \naware of that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am aware of it, and it frustrates me to no end. \nSenator Byrd has had amendments, Senator Murray has had amendments, \nSenator Corzine has had amendments, Senator Clinton and I have had \namendments, one after the other, and they are turned down.\n\n  I say to my colleague from Nevada, I have asked people in the \nadministration, both present and former--a few who quit in disgust--are \nPresident Bush and his people not aware of the dangers? They basically \nsay, no, they are aware of the dangers, but they don't want to spend \nany money here at home. They would rather have all the money go to tax \ncuts, and so it is not that they do nothing in each of these\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nareas; they do the bare minimum: Let's have a study and let it take 2 \nyears. Let's decide on what to do down the road.\n  For every year we wait, we become more vulnerable.\n  Mr. REID. Being more specific, is the Senator aware we have tried to \naddress rail security and Amtrak security? Turned down. On several \noccasions, port security, turned down. Is he aware we have tried to get \nspecific money to first responders? Turned down. The Senator is aware \nof this and other measures--for example, hazardous chemicals security, \nwhich Senator Corzine has pushed so much. The Senator is aware of each \nof these, and we have had votes and have been turned down on the floor \nby the majority on all requests.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am aware, to answer my good friend from \nNevada, of this. I am frustrated by it, and, frankly, I am befuddled by \nit because an administration that is so aggressive when it comes to \ntaking the war overseas and will ask us for billions and billions more \nat the drop of a hat----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the McCain amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to address \ntransportation security-related recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nThe amendment is almost identical to Title VII of S. 2774, the 9/11 \nCommission Report Implementation Act of 2004, which Senator Lieberman \nand I introduced earlier this month.\n  The amendment implements the Commission's recommendations on \ntransportation security in the following three ways: One, establishing \na national strategy for transportation security; two, assigning \nresponsibility for the ``no-fly list'' to the Transportation Security \nAdministration; and, three, enhancing passenger and cargo screening.\n  This amendment is the next step in fulfilling the mandate of the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations and ensuring we move forward in addressing \nthe vulnerabilities in our transportation systems. These provisions \nshould not be controversial, and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment which I \ncosponsored with Senator McCain. This is the first of several he and I \nwill be introducing, along with other Members, which would implement \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission not included in the underlying \nbill that Senator Collins and I have introduced which focuses on \nintelligence reform.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support my \ncolleague's amendment to implement the 9/11 Commission's \nrecommendations on improving aviation security. Senator McCain and I \nhave worked closely over the last several years to strengthen our \naviation security network. Although I strongly agree with the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations for improving aviation security, I believe \nthat Congress must go further than the Commission's recommendations if \nwe are to continue to improve our aviation security system.\n  It is for this reason that I have filed my bill, S. 2393, the \nAviation Security Advancement Act, as an amendment to this legislation \nas well. I would note that Senator McCain is a cosponsor of my bill. In \naddition, to incorporating the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, \nmy bill also includes specific requirements to improve air cargo and \ngeneral aviation security, which I have long felt to be significant \ngaps in our security system and the 9/11 Commission specifically cited \nas a weakness. My bill also authorizes funding for these new security \nrequirements.\n  This legislation was passed unanimously out of the Commerce Committee \nlast week. This legislation is also supported by the airline industry. \nI hope that the Senate will consider this legislation later this week. \nMy amendment is cosponsored by Senators Hollings, Lautenberg, Snowe, \nand Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSnowe be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Air Cargo \nSecurity Act as an amendment to the Intelligence Reform Act. This is a \nmeasure that we need to pass to answer some of the criticisms in the 9/\n11 Commission Report regarding cargo security.\n  I am going to talk further about this bill, but I would like to offer \nSenator McCain some of the time to also talk because he was one of the \ncosponsors. It went through the Commerce Committee with his \nchairmanship. We all agree this is a bill that is needed to add to the \nsecurity that is in the bill in accordance with the 9/11 Commission \nReport.\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n  I yield to Senator McCain for his remarks, and then I will finish my \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. She has \nbeen on this issue for at least 3 years that I know of. We passed this \nbill twice through the Senate. Under the chairmanship of Senator \nHutchison, we had extensive hearings on this issue in the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I believe this is a very important issue. Senator Hutchison has many \nimportant aviation assets in her State, including major airports that \nare not only for passengers but for ports of entry as well.\n  I say to Senator Hutchison, thank you, because I think this is a very \nimportant bill. I tell my colleagues, it has been passed twice through \nthe Senate. It is unfortunate that we have to go back and revisit it.\n  Finally, we made a commitment that we would try to address all 41 of \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, not always in a positive \nfashion but at least have them addressed. This is one of the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nvery important amendment. Air cargo, according to many experts, is a \nsubject that certainly needs increased security and increased \nattention. I think this amendment does that. I thank my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, for adding his support to this \nbill. We would not have gotten it through the Commerce Committee \nwithout his support. I think it adds immeasurably to the bill that is \nbefore us today.\n  Congressional action following 9/11 quickly created the \nTransportation Security Administration to address the appalling \nsecurity gaps exposed by terrorists. We took drastic but appropriate \nsteps to considerably increase security of our airports and planes, and \n3 years later we are light-years ahead of where we were on that \nhorrific day.\n  I am pleased that the 9/11 Commission raises issues that are similar \nto those I have discussed since we enacted the Aviation and \nTransportation Security Act. The Commission report states:\n\n       Concerns also remain regarding the screening and transport \n     of checked bags and cargo. More attention and resources \n     should be directed to reducing or mitigating the threat posed \n     by explosives in vessels' cargo holds.\n\n  I have worked since 2001 to enact stringent air cargo security \nstandards and, along with Senator Feinstein, introduced the Air Cargo \nSecurity Act to create a comprehensive system to secure shippers, \nfreight forwarders, and carriers. The Senate has twice passed this bill \nunanimously, but it remains stalled in the House of Representatives.\n  The bottom line is this: Are we safer than on September 11? \nAbsolutely. But have we done enough? Not yet. So I think we can do \nmore. I think this is an opportunity for us to address this issue.\n  The Air Cargo Security Act will make a difference in our Nation's air \nsecurity. One thing we have not provided since 9/11 is security in the \nbelly of the aircraft equal to protections for passenger areas and \nairports. Cargo is shipped on passenger aircraft, in some cases, \nwithout being screened. That is why we need this amendment.\n  The Air Cargo Security Act would establish a reliable known-shipper \nprogram, mandate inspections of cargo facilities, and direct the \nTransportation Security Agency to work with foreign countries to \ninstitute regular inspections at facilities that bring cargo into the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation would develop a training program for air cargo \nhandlers and give TSA the power to revoke the license of a shipper or \nfreight forwarder whose practices are unsound. These provisions will go \na long way toward further securing aircraft in our country. All of us \nwant America to have the safest aviation system in the world. Closing \nthe cargo loophole is an important step.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the traveling public is \nconsiderably safer. We have made changes to ensure our screeners \nundergo background checks, training, and testing. Checked bags are \nscrutinized, flight crew training is constantly being improved, and we \nare traveling in a more secure system. But we must address the cargo \nissue.\n  Mr. President, 22 percent of all air cargo in the United States is \ncarried on passenger flights, only a tiny fraction of which is \ninspected.\n  Beyond transport on passenger planes, there are other issues in the \ncargo arena. Identification cards used by workers are generally not \nsecured with fingerprints or other biometric identifiers. Background \nchecks for cargo employees are still inadequate.\n  Perhaps the weakest link in the cargo security chain is the freight \nforwarder. These are the middlemen who collect cargo from the shippers \nand deliver it to the air carrier. Regulations governing these \ncompanies are lax, and the TSA is finding security violations when it \nconducts inspections. Under current law, however, TSA lacks the \nauthority to revoke the shipping privileges of freight forwarders that \nrepeatedly violate security procedures. This air cargo security \namendment would give TSA that power.\n  Air cargo security is not a new problem. In 1988, Pan Am 103 went \ndown over Lockerbie, Scotland, because of explosives planted inside a \nradio in the cargo hold of a passenger airplane. The 1996 Valujet crash \nin the Everglades was caused by high-pressure tanks that never should \nhave been put on a passenger aircraft in the first place.\n  My amendment will strengthen air cargo security on all commercial \nflights. It establishes a more reliable known shipper program by \nrequiring inspections of facilities, creating an accessible shipper \ndatabase, and providing for tamper-proof identification cards for \nairport personnel. It gives TSA the tools required to hold shippers \naccountable for the contents they ship by allowing the administration \nto revoke the license of a shipper or freight forwarder engaged in \nunsound or illegal practices. This is the most important part of the \nbill. The TSA has told me time and again they need to have this \ncapability in order to revoke licenses when they find an unsafe \nsituation.\n  I have had the support of my colleagues, such as Senator McCain. \nSenator Lott, the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, has worked \nwith me on this bill. We have passed this bill twice in the Senate. It \nis a bill we have looked at, we have vetted. We have had hearings.\n  I see my colleague Senator Lott, the chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, is on the floor of the Senate. He knows this bill. He \nworked with me to perfect it. If we can put this amendment on this very \nimportant piece of legislation, it will add immeasurably to our \naviation security. We will have the most secure aviation system in the \nworld with this amendment on this particular legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas for \nher determination in this area. It is one of the places where there was \na gap in our aviation security. It is one that she has been working on, \nthinking about, going back to the last Congress. I think one of the \nlast things we did in the last Congress was the Senate let this issue \ngo through, but we didn't get it completed. She has continued to work \non it. There were some concerns. Those concerns have been worked on and \ndeveloped and straightened out, and this is a good piece of \nlegislation. It passed the full Commerce Committee overwhelmingly last \nweek. It is supported by the industry. I want the record to show that \nit would not be happening if it were not for her determination and her \nleadership. It is good legislation.\n  The title of this bill is National Intelligence Reform Act. I want us \nto concentrate on the intelligence area and the reforms that are \nnecessary to give the national intelligence director the real strength \nhe or she may need to make sure our intelligence community does its \njob. It talks about the national counterintelligence center. This was \ndone at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission for intelligence and \nsecurity reforms. So while I don't want this to just become a debate \nabout various\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\nsecurity areas, I would like us to focus on intelligence. This is an \narea where there clearly was a gap. This is an area where thoughtful \nlegislation was available. I believe it is appropriate to be added.\n  I hope we will support the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember who have worked hard to get this legislation through in a \nreasonable time. We will have some good debates, and we will have some \ndisagreements. We will have some votes. But at the end of the day, we \nneed to get this done because the Commission has made it clear where \nthere are gaps and where there are problems, both in the executive \nbranch and in the legislative branch. We also have to have the follow-\non congressional reforms that will allow us to do a better job on \noversight because we are part of the problem.\n\n  For those who have questions or have concerns or have amendments, my \nargument is, come forth. Let's have the amendments. Let's debate them \nin the light of day. Let's have a full debate and let's vote. But let's \nget this done because this is about real issues. A lot of times we \ndebate, we vote on things that won't affect our lives immediately or \naffect people's ability to do the job under national security. But this \nlegislation is about lives. It is about what happened on 9/11. It is \nabout what will happen again if we don't step up to this important \nissue and make sure that our executive branch is set up in such a way \nas to do the job, that they have the right chain of command and that \nsomebody is in charge, somebody who reports only to the President, \nsomebody who can make a decision about the placement of satellites, \nsomebody who will give us the information we need to know, not only \nabout how much money is spent but where it is spent.\n  That has been one of our problems. The Congress has not been putting \nmoney in many instances where it should have gone so that our \nintelligence community would have had what they needed to do the job. \nJust this very day, we understand the FBI does not have the linguists \nthey need to translate intercepts. Now it has become so voluminous it \nis uncontrollable. That is scary. But it is a real problem. We are not \ngoing to solve it just with this bill or just in this week. If we don't \nbegin now, it will make the day even more inevitable or closer that we \nare going to have another disaster on our hands.\n  I am here today to tell the committee members I support their effort. \nThey have done a good job. We can make it stronger, I believe. But I am \ngoing to be supporting getting this work completed.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee and I thank the sponsor of this \namendment for the work she has done on this cargo security issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Aviation Subcommittee, the Senator from Mississippi. In fact, one \nof the unanimous consents we had when we took this intelligence reform \nbill to the floor was that all the amendments would have to be relevant \nto the 9/11 Commission. The amendment before us is relevant. I think \nbecause the Senate has acted on this, it will be a valuable \ncontribution to the bill.\n  I appreciate the help and counsel of the Senator from Mississippi. I \nthank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee for bringing this bill to the Senate floor. We will \npass this bill, and it will be a good bill. We are all going to work \ntogether to make that happen, which the distinguished chairman and \nranking member have already proven.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays at the appropriate time for whenever it \ncan be scheduled along the lines that the chairman and ranking member \nwould schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Mississippi has \nto leave the floor, I want to thank him for his advice and his support \nas we bring this very important legislation before the Senate for \nconsideration. I very much value the advice and support of the Senator, \nand I appreciate all he is doing to help move this legislation forward. \nHe has been a very early voice in identifying the flaws in our current \nintelligence system and has been stalwart in his support for \nsignificant reform. I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I also commend the Senator from Texas for her continued effort to \nexamine the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and to pursue \nlegislative solutions, particularly in the area of improving the \nsecurity of cargo and general aviation security in general. Senator \nHutchison has been a longtime leader in this area. Her amendment \nencompasses a significant portion of S. 165 that the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent in May. I commend her for her foresight in \nrecognizing areas of concern that have been singled out by the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  In the Commission's report, for example, the Commission noted that:\n\n       Major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general \n     aviation security.\n\n  The Commission went on to say that:\n\n       The TSA and Congress must give priority attention to \n     improving the ability of screening checkpoints to detect \n     explosives.\n\n  The Commission says:\n\n       More attention and resources should be directed to reducing \n     or mitigating the threat posed by explosives in vessels' \n     cargo holds.\n\n  These are all areas of weakness identified by the Commission that the \nSenator from Texas would address in her amendment. It will assist in \nimplementing several of the Commission's recommendations and as a whole \nwill help to make our Nation's air passengers, air carriers, and air \ncargo more secure. I would note that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has no objections to the Senator's amendment. When the roll \ncall does occur, I will be urging our colleagues to support her \nefforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of \nSenator Hutchison. I thank her for proposing it. She was ahead of her \ntime because she has been on this case, along with members of the \nCommerce Committee, at least since March of last year, when the bill \ncame out of the Commerce Committee; in fact, the Senate passed this \nbill unanimously in May of 2003.\n  Unfortunately, there has been no action that meets up with this bill \nin the House. So Senator Hutchison is quite right to introduce this as \nan amendment to our underlying reform of the intelligence community. \nThis is directly relevant to the 9/11 Commission's conclusion that \n``major vulnerability still exists in cargo and general aviation \nsecurity. These, together within adequate screening and access \ncontrols, continue to present aviation security challenges.'' That \ncomes from the 9/11 Commission.\n  The Commission concluded that we are safer than we were on September \n11, 2001, but we are not yet safe. This underlying bill is aimed at \nreforming our intelligence community so we will be safe, so we can see \nthe threats coming at us, hear them, and stop them before the \nterrorists are able to strike, but also that we may adopt other \nprovisions of the 9/11 Commission report.\n  Senator McCain and I introduced an amendment that was the first to \npass a short while ago. I hope this amendment will pass as well, \nbecause it tightens existing weaknesses, loopholes in the screening of \ncargo transported in passenger aircraft, opening up a vulnerability \nthat we all fear terrorists may exploit to strike at us.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for not only being foresighted last \nyear in seeing this weakness in our defenses to terrorism but for \ncoming forth and introducing this amendment. It will strengthen the \nbill Senator Collins and I and other members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee have brought out and, therefore, I urge its adoption.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are making very good progress on this \nsignificant bill that does focus on the\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\nsafety and security of the American people. This morning the Democratic \nleader and I opened up stressing the importance of making very \nefficient use of our time on the floor.\n  A lot has been accomplished even since this morning, but we have a \nlot to do. This morning the leadership on both sides of the aisle \ntalked, and we have talked in our caucuses, of the importance of \ncollecting today all of the amendments that might potentially be \noffered on this bill. People have been studying the issue since August. \nThe bill was marked up in committee in a very thorough way. A lot of \namendments were offered and debated, some of which will be debated \nagain on the floor. Because we need to finish the bill this week, if at \nall possible, it means, given the fact that there are a lot of evening \ncommitments which will preclude us from doing a lot of voting tonight, \nwe have to get this universe of amendments today.\n  Thus, I ask all of our colleagues to give us, through the managers, \ntheir potential amendments today, and if they plan on offering \namendments, we absolutely must have them today.\n  We are not looking for amendments, but if people have serious \namendments they feel need to be debated, if we have that list, and \nshortly thereafter--and it would be in all likelihood some time \ntomorrow--we will ask to have the complete language of each of those \namendments.\n  The initial reaction by some is: you are moving too fast. Again, this \nis something we announced several weeks ago, that we would be going to \nthe bill yesterday. We have made progress. The bill has been out, and \npeople have had time to address it. We ask people over the next hour or \ncouple of hours to let us know what amendments they may want to offer \nso we can have that list, and then shortly thereafter--not tonight, but \nshortly thereafter--we will have a deadline by which we need to have \nthose amendments, to have the language. It is the only way we will have \nan orderly process to address the substance of this very important \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Republican leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Daschle announced in our caucus that \nhe was in agreement with the majority leader. In conjunction with the \nRepublican cloakroom, we are going to hotline this and tentatively have \n9:30 or 10 o'clock in the morning--whenever the two cloakrooms agree \nthey can get their work done, we will have a time for Members to let us \nknow what amendments they might want to offer.\n  Senator Daschle is always very cautious to make sure we have ample \ntime to offer amendments, but this is an extraordinary piece of \nlegislation, and Senator Daschle agrees with the Republican leader that \nwe should set a time shortly thereafter, either tomorrow evening--or I \nassume tomorrow evening, when Members will actually have to file their \namendments.\n  The concept of the majority leader is certainly one with which \nSenator Daschle agrees. So we are ready to have our hotline go out, and \ntheirs. We will look at amendments in the morning and find out what the \nuniverse of those amendments is, and then those people are going to \nhave to step forward and offer amendments at a later time and enter \ninto a consent agreement if at all possible later on tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Good. Mr. President, as you can hear, this is a bipartisan \neffort, with full cooperation back and forth between the managers and \nthe leadership. We felt it was important to restate the sense of \nefficiency with which we have to address this bill. That is what we \nwould like to see happen.\n  Again, please let us know your amendments in the next several hours.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur in \nrelation to the pending amendment, that is, the Hutchison amendment No. \n3711, at 4:30 p.m. today, with no amendments in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote; further, that there be 2 minutes equally divided for \nclosing remarks prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, if the leader can withhold \nfor a minute, unless there is something that would cause us to vote at \n4:30 p.m., we might be able to get that done a half hour earlier.\n  Mr. FRIST. From our side, because of various commitments, 4:30 p.m. \nis the best time.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, part of the scheduling is to do just that, \nso we can have another amendment fully considered and then yet even \nanother amendment. For planning purposes, 4:30 p.m. seems to be the \nmost appropriate time. We will continue to debate and vote on \namendments. Then hopefully by 4:30 p.m., we will be able to schedule \nadditional votes as well.\n  Again, I encourage all Members to come forward now and notify us of \ntheir amendments and to work through the managers to offer appropriate \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished majority leader is \nfinished, Senator Nelson is here and wishes to be recognized for 5 \nminutes to talk about the situation in Florida. Is that all right with \nthe two managers?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I might say a word before that and \nthen I will be happy to yield the floor to Senator Nelson. Maybe I \nshould yield to the chairman who will probably say the same thing I \nwill be saying.\n  I am very grateful to the Senate majority leader and to the Senate \nDemocratic leader for this agreement and for the pace they are setting \nfor consideration of this bill on a bipartisan basis. These are not \nordinary times. This is not ordinary legislation. It goes to the heart \nof our security. We want to have thoughtful debate.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Collins, and I found in the \ncommittee that when we let some time for debate occur, people came to \nvery thoughtful conclusions, totally without regard to party. The votes \non all the amendments went all around the lot. I think people \nultimately felt good about the process.\n  By setting these deadlines now for amendments to be noticed and then \nfiled, we are going to expedite exactly that kind of thoughtful \nconsideration so we can get this done with the same feeling of, well, \nconfidence that we are doing the right thing. We are not only doing \nsomething we need to do quickly, but we are doing it the right way. So \nI thank the majority leader and Senator Daschle for their help on that \nmatter and the help they have given to Senator Collins and me.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, thank our leaders for their \ncooperation in moving this bill forward. The process they have outlined \nis a fair one. It will help us know how many amendments there are, and \nwe will work with the sponsors of those amendments to ensure adequate \ndebate.\n  If the Senator from Florida could tell me how much time he \nanticipates needing.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if I take 1 minute per \nhurricane in Florida, that would be a total of 4 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we would be happy, in light of the \ndevastation to his State, to give the Senator from Florida 10 minutes, \nif that would be helpful.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, it will not be necessary for 10 minutes, but the Chair of \nthe committee is very gracious.\n  It seems all I talk about on the floor of the Senate is the \nhurricanes that have ravaged Florida. I would like to say to the \nleadership of the committee, I support their legislation. I am looking \nforward to voting for it. They have done a magnificent job. It is very \ntimely, and I hope the wisdom they have displayed will be displayed by \nthe House of Representatives so we can get a quick agreement and a \nconference and go about the process of reforming our intelligence \napparatus. My congratulations.\n\n\n                           Florida Hurricanes\n\n  It does seem that I have spoken over and over about hurricanes and \nabout the need for disaster assistance. Indeed, I am making that plea \nagain. When we passed the Department of Homeland Security funding bill \n2 weeks ago, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee had \ncommitted, in a colloquy on the Senate floor, that he would address it. \nI take him at his word, and I am sure his word is good.\n  Now that the President has requested additional funds, the question \nfor us\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\nand Florida is speed in enacting this legislation quickly so that money \ncan get to the people who desperately need it in direct, outright FEMA \ngrants. They need assistance to rebuild their homes. They need Small \nBusiness Administration loans so that they can rebuild their lives and \ntheir businesses. Then there are a myriad of Federal disaster \nassistance programs to local governments so that we can rebuild our \ncommunities, so that we can pick up the debris.\n  There is one part of Florida where debris is all over our communities \nfrom three hurricanes that have hit the same place. We need to rebuild \nour roads and bridges, our airports, our military facilities, and NASA \nat the Kennedy Space Center. So time is of the essence, and I implore \nour leadership to get that message through to the White House and to \nthe leadership at the other end of this Capitol to get these funds.\n  It is the intention of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nwho just told me this a few minutes ago, to attach this money to the \nHomeland Security bill, but if that bill gets hung up for whatever \nreason, then this emergency funding needs to come out of here like a \nrocket taking off at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station so that it \ncan get to our people.\n  Needless to say, after two hits, one wonders just what is in store, \nand how they are going to pick up the pieces of their lives. But when \nthree hit, and then four, one can imagine how distressed our people \nare. Help us. We need speed. We need action now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing cosponsors be added to Collins-Carper-Lieberman-Coleman \namendment No. 3705: Senators Voinovich, Leahy, Akaka, Rockefeller, \nNelson of Nebraska, and Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator Voinovich, along with Senator \nLevin, was very instrumental in helping to draft the compromise \nrepresented in this amendment. I talked earlier about the efforts of \nthe Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Connecticut, but I also \nwanted to acknowledge that Senator Voinovich and Senator Levin worked \nvery hard to help us strike the right balance in allocating funding so \nthat large States with high-threat areas would receive additional \nfunding. Yet we wanted to make sure that we recognize that every State, \nregardless of size or population, has certain vulnerabilities.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3706\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3706 on behalf of \nSenator Shelby, Senator Roberts, Senator Bond, Senator Wyden, Senator \nBayh, Senator Feinstein, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), for himself, \n     Mr. Shelby, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bond, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Bayh, and \n     Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3706.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is one of two amendments which I \nintend to offer to strengthen the position of the national intelligence \ndirector. At the outset, I join many others in complimenting the \nchairwoman, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Lieberman, \nfor their leadership and their outstanding work in presenting the bill \nwhich is now on the floor.\n  This measure is a long time in coming for decision by the Congress. \nIn my view, had there been a strong national intelligence director in \nexistence prior to September 11, 2001, the attack on \n9/11 might well have been prevented. There were many indicators \npresent. Had they all been put together, I think there is a good chance \nwe could have avoided the calamity of that day.\n  There is a famous FBI report from Phoenix about this suspicious \ncharacter who wanted to learn how to fly an airplane but who was not \ninterested in takeoffs or landings. That information never got to the \nappropriate authority in headquarters at the FBI. There were two al-\nQaida suspects in Kuala Lumpur known to the Central Intelligence \nAgency, information not communicated to the INS, to Immigration, so \nthat those two al-Qaida agents came into the United States and were \namong the 19 hijackers who perpetrated the atrocities of 9/11.\n  There was an extensive investigation conducted by the Minneapolis \noffice of the FBI, the famous 13-page, single-spaced memorandum by \nspecial agent Coleen Rowley about Zacarias Moussaoui. Had those leads \nbeen followed, had there been an application for a warrant under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act using the right standard--the FBI \nused the wrong standard--that would have produced a great deal of \ninformation which could have, in combination with other information, \nbeen pieced together to have warned us of the impending attack.\n  There is the information from NSA, where there was the tip that \nsomething was going to happen on 9/11 which was either not translated \nor not communicated to the Intelligence Committee.\n  There had been the information about Murad, an al-Qaida operative \nback in 1996, and his plans to fly an airplane into the CIA.\n  Those are only some of the threats. In combination and along with \nothers, had we had all the information together, had we known what \ncould have been pieced together, I think the likelihood is present that \n9/11 could have been prevented.\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nduring the 104th Congress, the Intelligence Committee reported a bill, \nS. 1718, which sought to lodge effective power in the Director of \nCentral Intelligence. That position theoretically was in charge of all \nthe intelligence community but, because of lack of authority, lack of \nbudget control, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency was \nnever able to carry out the role of being the unifier, the real leader \nof the intelligence community.\n  In section 707 of that bill, it provided for:\n\n       Enhancement of authority of Director of Central \n     Intelligence to manage, budget, personnel, and activities of \n     the intelligence community.\n\n  On a cross referral, by the time it got to the Armed Services \nCommittee, the substance was taken out. There was a big turf battle and \nthe effort to lodge authority in the Director of CIA to do effective \ndirection and management of the Central Intelligence Agency went to \nnaught.\n\n  Thirty days after 9/11, Senator Lieberman and I introduced \nlegislation to create the Department of Homeland Security. That was on \nOctober 11 of 2001. When special agent Coleen Rowley testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee in June of 2002, there was finally impetus to \nget support from the administration to move ahead with a Department of \nHomeland Security, and when the matter was debated on the floor of the \nSenate, the effort was made to vest authority in the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to direct other intelligence agencies. It seemed to \nus that when we were creating a new department, Homeland Security, this \nwas an opportune time to pick up the strands of what had been attempted \nby S. 1718 back in 1996, and by many others.\n  It wasn't my idea alone. The Scowcroft Commission had come up with \nsimilar recommendations. Others had called for real power and real \nauthority in a national director. It seemed to us that that was the \ntime, with the new Department of Homeland Security, to give this \neffective power to the newly created Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Our efforts, again, were unsuccessful because of the turf battles, \nbecause of the interests of the CIA and the Department of Intelligence, \nDIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense and the \nFBI, and the\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\nother agencies to protect their own turf.\n  In October of 2002, the House of Representatives passed a bill and \nwent home leaving the Senate with the alternative of either taking the \nbill or letting the matter go over until the next year. I was prepared \nat that time to offer the amendment to give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity authority to direct some real power. After talking to \nSecretary Ridge, talking with the Vice President, and talking with the \nPresident, rather than have no bill at all, it was decided to proceed \nand let the matter stand without having that kind of authority for the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  There the matter languished until the families of the victims of \nSeptember 11 became a powerful advocacy group, which led to the \ncreation of the 9/11 Commission, and the 9/11 Commission report was \nfiled in July of this year. There was very substantial momentum finally \nto create a national intelligence director with some real authority to \nreally manage the entire community.\n  Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, and I have produced \na bill as had been recommended by the \n9/11 Commission and then the Governmental Affairs Committee proceeded \nto have hearings, came back after the recess in late July, had hearings \nin August, marked up the bill, and passed it out of committee last \nweek. So it is now on the floor in a context where there is \nconsiderable public pressure created by the 9/11 Commission report and \nwhat the families of the victims have done. And the momentum is \npresent.\n  There has been very substantial opposition to moving at this time. \nThere are those who say this legislation is precipitous, that it ought \nnot to be passed on the eve of an election, that we have more of an eye \non 11/2, the election date, than we have on 9/11.\n  I reject those contentions. This issue has been under study for \ndecades, and personally on my behalf since I spent 8 years on the \nIntelligence Committee and chaired the committee during the 104th \nCongress.\n  The 9/11 Commission unanimously and emphatically has called for the \ncreation of a national intelligence director. It is my view that is a \nproposition whose time has come.\n  When I offered the amendment in committee, which was rejected \nalthough we received five votes in the committee, there was very \nintense lobbying coming, as I understand it--you can never present \ncompetent evidence which would stand up in court but a lot of lobbying \nfrom the protectors of their turf.\n  My amendment to create the strength of the national intelligence \ndirector was deferred until this day. It is my hope and expectation \nthat from this bill we will have a national intelligence director if it \nis the one proposed by amendment or if it is the one which is in the \nbill which has been reported by the committee.\n  It is my conclusion after very substantial study and after very \nsubstantial thought and after very substantial consideration that we \nneed a very strong national intelligence director. We need an \nindependent national intelligence director who will stand up to the \nexecutive branch, who will stand up to the Congress, who will tell the \nCongress exactly what is needed by way of resources, and who will have \nthe stature and strength to get that job done.\n  There is an enormous controversy about the resolution to authorize \nthe use of force which Congress passed and the President acted on--a \nlot of concern about the adequacy of the intelligence which led to that \njudgment, the 77 votes in this body joined by a majority of Democrats \nas well as Republicans. But there is no doubt that however one views \nthe resolution for use of force, it would have been highly desirable to \nhave better intelligence.\n\n  The amendment which is embodied in amendment No. 3706 would give \nsubstantial additional authority to the national intelligence director \nthan is contained in the committee bill. It would put the CIA under the \nnational intelligence director. The national intelligence director \nwould have the authority to manage and oversee the intelligence \ncommunity, including the CIA, the NSA, the National Security Agency, \nthe NRO, the National Reconnaissance Office, the NGA, the National \nGeospacial Agency, and national collection from the Defense \nIntelligence Agency leaving tactical intelligence within the Department \nof Defense as it is now.\n  Valid considerations have been raised that tactical intelligence \nought to be left in the Department of Defense so the Department of \nDefense can carry out its functions. My amendment would leave that \nimportant facet with the Department of Defense.\n  The national intelligence director under the committee bill has \nbudget authority over the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After a \ngreat deal of thought, this amendment No. 3706 does not include the FBI \nunder the supervision, direction, and control of the national \nintelligence director as the other agencies enumerated would have the \nnational intelligence director with the authority to supervise, direct, \nand control which, in my judgment, would give the national intelligence \ndirector the authority to manage and oversee the national intelligence \ncommunity in an effective way.\n  The essence of my bill was circulated to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee with a letter dated August 3 of this year. I put the bill \ninto the Congressional Record on September 7. I introduced the bill on \nSeptember 15 under the caption of S. 2081. The amendment embodied in \nNo. 3706 is somewhat different, as I have described it.\n  We are dealing here with agencies where there are inbred cultures of \nconcealment. It is very difficult to get information, even as chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  My experience has shown it was very difficult for the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency to know fully and adequately what has \nhappened within his own agency. One of the matters which I referred to \nduring the committee hearings was information which was disseminated by \nthe CIA Chief of Reports and Requirements in the Soviet East European \nDivision of the Central Intelligence Agency. This was a man who was in \nthe CIA from 1950 until 1991. He had information which was tainted by \nthe Soviet Union--information where the individual conceded that he \nknew the intelligence came from Soviet-controlled sources and that he \ndisseminated that information at the highest levels of government \nwithout disclosing that fact to the individuals whom he transmitted the \ninformation that it came from controlled or tainted sources.\n  That information was transmitted, including transmission on January \n13 of 1993. So it went to President George Herbert Walker Bush and it \nwent to President-elect Bill Clinton.\n  When I took his testimony and expressed shock at what he had done, \nthe individual confidently responded that he had acted entirely \nproperly because disclosure of the controlled source that the \ninformation was tainted would have made it even harder, as he put it, \nto sell the intelligence to policymakers; that there was no reason to \nbelieve the Soviets used deception was inaccurate, and no customer \nwould use it unless he had concealed the fact it was tainted.\n  This was an extraordinary approach, as I saw it, but I think \nrevealing as to what happens within the Central Intelligence Agency, \nwithin the Bureau, where the individuals have their empires, where they \nknow better than anybody else, and transmit information to the \nPresident of the United States and the President-elect, knowing it to \nbe tainted and not telling the President or President-elect that it was \ntainted because they then would not use it, and saying that the \ninformation was given because the CIA agent, the CIA individual, knew \nthat it was correct. That is just the height of audacity but I think \nindicative of the kinds of problems we face with the cultures of \nconcealment that we have in the intelligence agencies.\n  Another matter which I refer to, in the course of the committee \nhearings, is relevant for presentation; that is, the difficulty of \nhaving adequate oversight over the intelligence agencies and the duties \nthat the intelligence agencies have to make disclosures to the \noversight committee.\n  In the spring of 2002, when I chaired a subcommittee of oversight on \nthe Department of Justice and had a wide-ranging subpoena, a document \nwas presented which I ask unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nbe printed in the Record, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 9, 1996.\n     To: Mr. Esposito.\n     From: Director.\n     Subject: Democratic National Campaign Matter.\n\n       As I related to you this morning, I met with the Attorney \n     General on Friday, 12/6/96, to discuss the above-captioned \n     matter.\n       I stated that DOJ had not yet referred the matter to the \n     FBI to conduct a full, criminal investigation. It was my \n     recommendation that this referral take place as soon as \n     possible.\n       I also told the Attorney General that since she had \n     declined to refer the matter to an Independent Counsel it was \n     my recommendation that she select a first rate DOJ legal team \n     from outside Main Justice to conduct that inquiry. In fact, I \n     said that these prosecutors should be ``junk-yard dogs'' and \n     that in my view, PIS was not capable of conducting the \n     thorough, aggressive kind of investigation which was \n     required.\n       I also advised the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and PIS \n     regarding this case because the ``Attorney General's job \n     might hang in the balance'' (or words to that effect). I \n     stated that those comments would be enough for me to take him \n     and the Criminal Division off the case completely.\n       I also stated that it didn't make sense for PIS to call the \n     FBI the ``lead agency'' in this matter while operating a \n     ``task force'' with DOC IGs who were conducting interviews of \n     key witnesses without the knowledge or participation of the \n     FBI.\n       I strongly recommended that the FBI and hand-picked DOJ \n     attorneys from outside Main Justice run this case as we would \n     any matter of such importance and complexity.\n       We left the conversation on Friday with arrangements to \n     discuss the matter again on Monday. The Attorney General and \n     I spoke today and she asked for a meeting to discuss the \n     ``investigative team'' and hear our recommendations. The \n     meeting is now scheduled for Wednesday, 12/11/96, which you \n     and Bob Litt will also attend.\n       I intend to repeat my recommendations from Friday's \n     meeting. We should present all of our recommendations for \n     setting up the investigation--both AUSAs and other resources. \n     You and I should also discuss and consider whether on the \n     basis of all the facts and circumstances--including Huang's \n     recently released letters to the President as well as Radek's \n     comments--whether I should recommend that the Attorney \n     General reconsider referral to an Independent Counsel.\n       It was unfortunate that DOJ declined to allow the FBI to \n     play any role in the Independent Counsel referral \n     deliberations. I agree with you that based on the DOJ's \n     experience with the Cisneros matter--which was only referred \n     to an Independent Counsel because the FBI and I intervened \n     directly with the Attorney General--it was decided to exclude \n     us from this decision-making process.\n       Nevertheless, based on information recently reviewed from \n     PIS/DOC, we should determine whether or not an Independent \n     Counsel referral should be made at this time. If so, I will \n     make the recommendation to the Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essence of the document disclosed that there had \nbeen an effort by ranking officials in the Department of Justice to try \nto influence the FBI not to pursue an investigation on campaign finance \nirregularities in December of 1996 because at that time Attorney \nGeneral Reno was under consideration for reappointment. The relevant \npart of this document from Director Freeh to Mr. Esposito, who was his \ndeputy handling this matter:\n\n       I also advised the Attorney General of Lee Radek's comment \n     to you that there was a lot of ``pressure'' on him and PIS \n     [Public Integrity Section] regarding this case because the \n     ``Attorney General's job might hang in the balance'' (or \n     words to that effect). I stated that those comments would be \n     enough for me to take him and the Criminal Division off the \n     case completely.\n\n  This matter was not brought to the attention of the Judiciary \nCommittee as a matter of oversight. In my judgment, this is the kind of \na matter which the Director, on his own, without request, without \nknowledge by the oversight committee, without subpoena, as it was \ndisclosed some 4 years later, should have turned over as a matter of \noversight.\n  Another amendment which I intend to offer would give the national \nintelligence director a 10-year term on the analogy to the Director of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. That would enable the director of \nnational intelligence to have a substantial degree of independence \nsince his term would outlast the term of the President--4 years or, \nwith reelection, a total of 8 years.\n  We have seen in today's press reports of very substantial problems in \nthe FBI, where there are inadequate translators and a great deal of \ninformation from al-Qaida has gone untranslated. I have talked to FBI \nDirector Mueller, who tells me the information is dated, but there is \nstill a significant problem in having sufficient translators to handle \nthat important matter so we have our intelligence in hand.\n  The national intelligence director is going to have to be strong and \nindependent, with enough stature, with a tenure of a 10-year term, to \ncome to the Congress and be able to see to it that adequate funds are \nprovided for the intelligence community.\n  The media reports are full of information that show very substantial \nproblems on what would happen in Iraq after a military victory with the \ninsurgents. The national intelligence director is going to have to be \nstrong and independent and bring those matters to the attention of the \nCongress as well as to the executive branch.\n  It is my hope that in this legislation we will do a complete job and \nstructure the responsibilities of the national intelligence director to \ngive him the authority on budget and the authority on supervision, \ndirection, and control to effectively manage and oversee the entire \nintelligence community.\n  That is an abbreviated statement of a great many considerations. At \nthis time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator Specter is offering the first of \nwhat I anticipate will be many amendments to alter the authority of the \nnational intelligence director. He is arguing that the Collins-\nLieberman bill does not go far enough. Later on in this debate you will \nhear from those who believe our bill empowers the NID too far, with too \nmuch authority in the NID.\n  Our approach gives the national intelligence director full budget \nauthority, including the authority to execute, reprogram, and transfer \nfunds over the entire budgets of the National Security Agency, the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National \nReconnaissance Office, which are all now located within the Department \nof Defense.\n  Our bill also gives the NID enhanced tasking authority, the power to \ntransfer personnel and authority over the selections of the heads of \nthese agencies with concurrence from the Secretary of Defense.\n  What it does not do is sever the link between these agencies and the \nSecretary of Defense, nor does it give the NID exclusive control over \nthese agencies. And that would be the impact of Senator Specter's \namendment. He would sever the link between these agencies and the \nSecretary of Defense, and he would give the NID exclusive control over \nthese agencies. I think that would be a mistake.\n  I believe our legislation strikes the right balance in the \nrelationship that it sets forth between the NID and these agencies. I \nnote that our approach is consistent with the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission. It is consistent with the recommendations of the \nadministration. The 9/11 Commission, indeed, opposes adoption of \nSenator Specter's amendment. The Commission believes it would be a \nmistake to sever that link between these agencies and the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  In deciding to keep these agencies--the NSA, the NGA, and the NRO--\nwithin the Department of Defense, we were cognizant of the fact that \nthe NSA and the NGA are designated as combat support agencies. We did \nnot want to in any way weaken or break the bonds between these agencies \nand the military forces that serve in that capacity. Indeed, many \ncurrent and former defense officials warned that taking such a step \nwould be counterproductive and would risk breaking something that is \nworking well for the military today.\n  For example, at our hearings, Secretary Powell said:\n\n       We should not break the link between these intelligence \n     organizations and the organizations that they are supporting, \n     especially within the military context and the direct kind of \n     support that the NRO and similar organizations give to the \n     warfighter.\n\n  I would note that by severing that link, the Specter amendment would \ncreate some real anomalies. For example, in his proposal, he requires \nthat every 2 years, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would \nsubmit to the national intelligence director a report on the combat \nreadiness of these organizations. Why would a report on\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\ncombat readiness go to the national intelligence director rather than \nto the Secretary of Defense?\n  There are some other unanticipated consequences of the Specter \namendment that illustrate how wholesale changes to the status of NGA, \nNRO, and the NSA might have completely unintended consequences. For \nexample, title X, section 442(b) now provides that the National \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency shall improve means of navigating \nvessels of the Navy and the merchant marine by providing, under the \nauthority of the Secretary of Defense, accurate and inexpensive \nnautical charts, sailing directions, books on navigation, and manuals \nof instructions for the use of all vessels in the United States and of \nnavigators generally. The Specter amendment, in changing the Secretary \nof Defense to the national intelligence director, would make the \nnational intelligence director responsible for a navigation mapping \nresponsibility that has nothing to do with intelligence. That is just \nan example of some of the unintended consequences.\n  Again, the approach taken by Senator Specter--and I know he has given \nthis matter a great deal of thought--does not have the support of the \n9/11 Commission. It does not have the support of the administration. It \nwould sever the link between these combat support agencies and the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I will note that these three agencies within the Pentagon do serve \ncustomers other than the Secretary of Defense. There are other \nconsumers, such as the CIA, for the intelligence information they \nproduce. That is why our legislation does give the NID significant \nauthority over these agencies, including budget authority, the ability \nto transfer personnel, and the ability, with the concurrence of the \nSecretary of Defense, to name the heads of these agencies. That is the \nright balance. But to break that link between these agencies and the \nSecretary of Defense simply, in my judgment, does not make sense.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with great respect for Senator Specter, \nfriend and colleague, I rise to oppose this amendment.\n  I want to say that Senator Specter has been a very constructive \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee, not just on this matter \nbut on so many others that come before the committee. He has \ncontributed substantially to the strength of the bill that is before \nthe Senate that Senator Collins and I have offered. He and I talked \nquite seriously about this earlier in the year, and ultimately my \nconclusion was that it would construct a bridge too far.\n  We have a crisis, which the 9/11 Commission documents, which is that \nwe have an intelligence community, as we discussed yesterday and showed \non the graphs, without a leader, without anyone in charge. It is so \nfrustrating to the point of being infuriating to read the lengthy \nnarrative at the beginning of the 9/11 Report to see documented the \nfailure to connect the dots. The cases that Senator Specter mentioned--\none agency knowing something, not telling it to another agency, which \nmight well have either kept out some of the terrorists who struck us on \nSeptember 11--should have--or would have opened our eyes to the plot \nthat was being hatched that FBI agents came face to face with, this is \na system, the American intelligence community, without a leader.\n  The most urgent recommendation, according to Governor Kean and \nCongressman Hamilton, that the Commission makes to us is to create a \nstrong national intelligence director and then, right alongside that, a \nstrong counterterrorism center--connect the dots. We have done this. \nSenator Collins documented the various powers we have given to the \nnational intelligence director.\n  First, this has been a recommendation of commission after commission. \nGoing back to the late 1940s, when the National Security Act was \nadopted and the Central Intelligence Agency was created, post Second \nWorld War, there was the creation of the Director of Central \nIntelligence who was supposed to be not just the head of the CIA but \nthe overseer of our entire intelligence community. The position was \ntaken but hamstrung. It was not given the power. The DCI was the same \nperson as the head of the CIA. That contributed to the community being \nwithout a leader.\n  In this bill we separate these two positions. We create the \noverarching national intelligence director, separate from the head of \nthe CIA, and we give that national intelligence director real budget \nauthority, personnel authority and tasking, assignment coordinating \nauthority, which we are convinced will make us a lot safer and stronger \nagainst the threat of terrorism here at home and against Americans and \nothers throughout the world.\n  The Specter amendment goes further than that and would provide that \nnot only would the national intelligence director in the underlying \nbill direct, oversee, and execute the budgets of these agencies, but he \nor she would also supervise, direct, and control their day-to-day \noperations. That approach would create a department in everything but \nname and put the national intelligence director in charge of multiple \nagencies on a day-to-day basis.\n  One of the witnesses before our committee was Philip Zelikow, \nExecutive Director of the 9/11 Commission. We asked Dr. Zelikow: Did \nthe Commission consider creating a department of intelligence, giving \nthe national intelligence director the powers that the Specter \namendment would give?\n  Dr. Zelikow said: Yes, the Commission considered creating such a \ndepartment but decided against it on several bases.\n  And they are the bases of my opposition to the Specter amendment. \nFirst, the current job that the Director of Central Intelligence had--\nwhich was CIA Director, director of presumably the overall intelligence \ncommunity and principle intelligence adviser to the President--was in \nitself more than one person could do. To give powers to the national \nintelligence director for day-to-day operations of the agencies under \nhis or her control would again give more authority, more responsibility \nthan the Commission decided was appropriate and manageable.\n  The Commission also opted for what they considered to be a more \nmodern management approach. They didn't want to create another big \nFederal bureaucracy; they wanted to create, really patterned after some \nvery large and very successful private corporations in this country, a \ncentral management system, strong as our national intelligence director \nwould be, with budget, personnel, tasking authority, but not top heavy, \nagile, and not in response or in charge of the day-to-day decisions of \nall of the agencies under that position. That is what we have in the \napproach we are taking in this bill.\n\n  Senator Collins said some people will say--and you will hear of \namendments on this floor, as the debate goes on, from Members and those \noutside the Chamber who feel the bill Senator Collins and I have put \nbefore the Senate gives the national intelligence director too much \npower. They will try to strip away that power or fuzz it up so that it \nis not clear and the status quo can remain. There will be plenty of \nopportunity to argue against that when those amendments are filed.\n  But here we are in the middle of a war on terrorism, struck as we \nwere on September 11, under a continuing threat of attack, alerts all \nover, particularly in Washington and New York--real concern--and to do \nwhat looks like protecting the status quo of the particular authority \nof existing agencies doesn't make sense. There will be those who feel \nour bill goes too far.\n  I don't mean to put words into Senator Specter's mouth because he is \nvery eloquent, but this amendment suggests we have not gone far enough. \nThe Commission deliberately decided not to take the National Security \nAgency, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and National \nReconnaissance Organization out of the Department of Defense. The \nCommission was concerned, Dr. Zelikow said, about the balance between \nnational and departmental guidance, and they didn't want to tilt the \nbalance too far away from defense. The Commission's executive director \nportrayed the Commission's idea of a lean, creative command center this \nway:\n\n       Since terrorism poses such a revolutionary challenge to old \n     ways of executive management in our national security \n     bureaucracy,\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\n     counterterrorism requires an innovative response.\n\n  I believe the underlying bill does exactly that: real authority, \ndecisionmaking authority, but lean and, may I add, mean, because the \npeople who are threatening us are very mean.\n  The other thing the kind of structure we have created does is make it \nharder for the problems that many in the Senate and Committee on \nIntelligence cited in its report on prewar intelligence are worried \nabout, which is group-think. There is an increased danger that persons \nat the top of the daily operations of the organizations--there is a \ndanger that you will begin to have not the competition of ideas we want \nto see in our intelligence community and that we feel strongly will be \nencouraged by the national intelligence director we are creating by the \nlanguage in the bill, the focus on independence and objectivity of \nintelligence and by the national counterterrorism center, which is \nultimately the place where everybody who knows anything about a \nparticular problem--in this case terrorism--and maybe the director will \ncreate other centers on weapons of mass destruction for particularly \nproblematic countries like Iran or North Korea. Everybody in the \nGovernment who knows anything about that will sit down together to \nshare what they have collected in the way of intelligence, share their \nanalysis of it, and then plan jointly on how to stop it, how to deal \nwith the threat represented by those situations.\n  So I believe Senator Specter's intentions are very good, and I admire \nhim for them. But I think at this moment they are a bridge too far, \nboth in the substance of where he would take us and also, frankly, in \nterms of the probability of any such measure passing Congress. There is \nan urgency to our deliberations, as we have said over and over again. I \nthink if we reach too far, we may end up with nothing and nothing \nmaintains the status quo, which failed us on September 11 and will fail \nus again unless we act.\n  I oppose the amendment. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief reply at this \ntime, others will say the committee bill goes too far, and the \ncommittee bill stands between others who would reject any \nreorganization of the national intelligence community. The amendment I \nhave offered doesn't go to that point.\n  The question is, what is the best way to reorganize the national \nintelligence community? When reference is made to the comments by Mr. \nZelikow, the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, he made an \nanalysis of S. 2811, which is a bill similar to the amendment now \npending, but it is not the same. I think it is an overstatement to say \nthat the 9/11 Commission rejects the amendment I have offered because \nit hasn't been considered by the Commission.\n  Former Senator Bob Kerrey, who was vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee during my tenure as chairman, called me, unsolicited, and \nsaid that he favored the elements which I had offered and thought it \nwas preferable to have the national intelligence director with greater \nauthority, which I was proposing.\n  I believe it is a fair statement to say that the 9/11 Commission \nwould be pleased to see us move to establish a national intelligence \ndirector, whether it was along the lines of the committee report or \nwhether it was along the lines of my amendment. I say, too, that it is \nimportant to establish a national intelligence director with as many \npowers as we can reasonably give the national intelligence director. I \nthink that is what the 9/11 Commission is looking for. I don't think it \ncan be accurately said that the 9/11 Commission rejects the substance \nof my amendment. Certainly, former Senator Bob Kerrey, who was a member \nof the 9/11 Commission, was not, as far as I can say from an \nunsolicited call. He said he liked the substance of what I was \noffering.\n  I think other Senators are going to be interested in participating in \nthe debate. It was unknown, generally, what sequence would occur as to \nthe offering of the amendment. But I think others will want to come and \nbe heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senator Specter. I do so with regret but with conviction. \nRegarding the phrase ``direct and control their day-to-day \noperations,'' if somebody wants to make the national intelligence \ndirector strong, that will certainly do it. The question is, what does \nthat mean? What are the implications? That goes into the law, and then \npeople have to interpret what that law means. I think if there is \nanywhere we want to be quite clear, we want the American people, \nthrough public law, to understand how far the national intelligence \ndirector can go and, on the other hand, to what point can that \nparticular person not go.\n  We give that person all kinds of authority, and I think the \nappropriate authority, but when we get into managing and direct control \nof the day-to-day operations, that is a phrase which concerns me \ngreatly, and I say so not as one Senator from West Virginia but as vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  My understanding is that this was brought up in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and was defeated by a vote of 12 to 5, which is not \nnip and tuck.\n  I think the recommendations that were central to the 9/11 Commission \nwere very forthright, and Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have \nreflected in their bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, very strong \nmeasures: a unified budget--oh, there are some people around town who \nare not very happy about that, which is all right--personnel, \nmanagement authority over the national intelligence programs.\n  But then we come back to the phrase ``direct and control their day-\nto-day operations,'' and that makes me go to an argument which I am \nquite sure, since I was not on the floor, was used by both good \nSenators who are managing this bill. And that is, what I think they \ntried to do is they figured some people would want to have the national \nintelligence director stronger than what they proposed, and others \nwould want to have the national intelligence director weaker than what \nthey proposed. I heard cases on both sides.\n  As I hear those cases, I am drawn more back to the possibility of the \none I think is the more sensible approach as a person who has been in \ngovernment for a long time but also, quite frankly, I am interested in \npassing a bill and passing a bill that we are pretty sure will be doing \nno harm as a result of the passing of that bill. I am not sure the \nSpecter amendment meets that particular test.\n  We have all these agencies, and we want to create some sense of \norder, but we do not want to get unnecessarily in the way in places \nwhere we should not of the combatant commanders, which Senator Collins \nmentioned in her excellent opening statement yesterday. There are some \nthings which the military should be able to make decisions about \noutside of the national intelligence director, and they are allowed to \nso do on a modest basis, but on an important basis, by this bill.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill strikes exactly the correct balance on \nthis matter, and I think balance, generally speaking, is what works in \nthis country and balance is generally what gets bills passed in a \nclosely divided Senate.\n  Their bill explicitly acknowledges the connection and, at times, the \ntension with what I have just spoken about, and that is the needs of \nthe military and the needs of the intelligence community.\n  The Collins-Lieberman bill accommodates the uniformed military's \nlegitimate need to control its operations. I think that is right \nwithout shortchanging the consumers of the intelligence, such as the \nPresident of the United States, Congress, and senior officials \nthroughout the Government, such as the Secretary of State and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  Their bill correctly recognizes the new national intelligence \ndirector will have to rely on the expertise of his newly created \ndeputies which are left, to my way of thinking, in their bill very \nintelligently just floating a bit so that he can decide wisely how best \nto do that rather than decide everything in a period of a week or two.\n\n  I think Chairman Kean and Vice Chairman Hamilton have endorsed the \napproach contained in the Collins-Lieberman bill. That would be good\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\nenough for me on most matters, and it certainly is on this matter. The \nnotion that the national intelligence director established under this \nbill would not be sufficiently empowered to effectively manage the \nintelligence community is not borne out when one reads this \nlegislation, and that is what they are doing. They are doing the \nmanaging of the national intelligence aspect.\n  Without going on at great length, I like the balance. It is the \nnature of this body to seek out that kind of balance. We have to be \nrealistic that we are faced in the days ahead with some fairly strong \nprobable assaults upon this bill by those from the Armed Services \nCommittee and perhaps some from other committees, and our strength in \nbeing able to get a bill passed, in knowing we passed a good bill, is \nby sticking to a moderate and centrist course which, in fact, is quite \nradical in terms of everything which has taken place since the National \nSecurity Act of 1947. This bill is an enormous update.\n  I just wish to be understood as being strongly for the approach of \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his excellent comments. He states the case very well.\n  There are two final points that I would like to make on Senator \nSpecter's amendment, and that is, when we asked Philip Zelikow, the \nexecutive director of the 9/11 Commission, to comment on this, he gave \nus a history of why the Commission specifically rejected this approach, \nand we talked about many of the reasons.\n  But one other that he mentioned is that one damaging consequence of \nstripping NSA, NGA, and NRO out of the Department of Defense is that \nthen the Pentagon might well feel obligated to recreate the \ncapabilities within the Department at great expense and creating many \nmore opportunities for bureaucratic conflict. That was a point made by \nthe executive director in expressing his opposition to Senator \nSpecter's amendment and in giving us an insight into why the Commission \nspecifically rejected the route taken in this amendment.\n  I also note that Senator Specter's amendment, while it is intended to \ncreate clear lines of authority between the NID and the combat support \nagencies, in reality could well create much ambiguity and confusion. \nWhile the amendment gives the NID supervision, direction, and control \nover these combat support agencies, it keeps them housed in DOD \nbuildings, on DOD land, and the amendment does not take away from the \nSecretary of Defense the direction and control he currently has over \nthese agencies.\n  For example, the law that created the National Imagery and Mapping \nAgency, which is now the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, \nestablishes that Agency under the authority, direction, and control of \nthe Secretary of Defense. Yet under the Specter amendment, the NSA, the \nNGA, and the NRO would fall under the line authority of both Agencies. \nI think that would create tremendous confusion and ambiguity.\n\n  Mr. President, I see the time for the vote has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next 2 minutes will be equally divided by \nthe proponents and opponents prior to the vote occurring at 4:30.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: I believe we have 2 more minutes \nuntil 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And those 2 minutes will be equally divided.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I seek recognition to make a comment about the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we can get more into the details on \nrebuttal as to what Senator Collins has said. I do not think it is \naccurate that we are taking away key authority from the Department of \nDefense, but I want to print in the Record a letter signed by 14 \nSenators objecting to the committee bill saying that it ``does not give \nthe NID additional authorities will be required to provide the unity of \nleadership and accountability necessary for real intelligence reform. \nIn particular, we feel strongly that the NID must have day-to-day \noperational control of all elements of the Intelligence Community \nperforming national missions.'' It is signed by Senators Roberts, \nShelby, DeWine, Hatch, Lott, Snowe, Voinovich, Bayh, Graham, Wyden, \nBond, Hagel, Chambliss, and myself. There is the current chairman, \nSenator Roberts, and three prior chairmen, Senator Shelby, Senator \nGraham, and myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record together \nwith a memorandum from me to the members of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee dated December 5, 1995.\n  A December 9, 1996 memorandum has already been printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2004.\n     Hon. Susan Collins, Chairman,\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman: We would like \n     to congratulate both of you for your hard work to draft \n     legislation to reform and strengthen the Intelligence \n     Community. We have covered much ground over the last few \n     months, unraveling the complicated issue of intelligence \n     reform. As a result of your outstanding leadership, we are \n     close to enacting meaningful reform. We understand that your \n     bill includes many important provisions, particularly the \n     creation of a National Intelligence Director (NID) with \n     strong budget authority.\n       We are writing to you, however, to express our serious \n     concern that the current draft of the bill, as described by \n     your summary and after review by Governmental Affairs \n     Committee members and staff, does not give the NID additional \n     authorities that will be required to provide the unity of \n     leadership and accountability necessary for real intelligence \n     reform. In particular, we feel strongly that the NID must \n     have day-to-day operational control of all elements of the \n     Intelligence Community performing national missions. To \n     fulfill the historic intent of the National Security Act of \n     1947, we must provide the NID--as head of the Intelligence \n     Community--the additional authorities necessary to match the \n     position's responsibilities and to ensure accountability. To \n     address these concerns, we request the opportunity to meet \n     with you prior to any further committee action on the \n     legislation.\n       In addition to day-to-day operational control of all \n     elements of the Intelligence Community performing national \n     missions, some members also believe that we must either \n     explicitly create a new agency, or at least provide the NID \n     with supervision, direction, and control similar to a \n     department or independent agency head.\n       Clear lines of authority between the NID and our national \n     intelligence agencies, extending beyond budgetary control, \n     are critical to our success in countering 21st Century \n     national security threats. There must be no doubt in anyone's \n     mind that the NID is in charge and is accountable.\n       Thank you for you leadership under very challenging \n     circumstances, and we look forward to meeting with you prior \n     to the committee mark-up of intelligence reform legislation. \n     Working together, we can achieve the real intelligence reform \n     that we all seek.\n           Sincerely,\n         Pat Roberts, Mike DeWine, Trent Lott, George V. \n           Voinovich, Bob Graham, Christopher S.

The deposition \n     lasted about one hour and 45 minutes., The transcript is \n     available for your review.\n       L began working for the CIA in 1950 and during the period \n     from 1980 to 1991, L was Chief of Reports and Requirements in \n     CIA's Soviet East European Division. He was responsible for \n     determining the quality of Soviet sources, assessing the \n     authenticity of the intelligence, and disseminating those \n     reports to policymakers.\n       L readily conceded that he knew intelligence data came from \n     Soviet controlled sources and that he disseminated such data \n     to the highest levels of our government without disclosing \n     the fact that it came from such controlled sources.\n       When I expressed shock at this, L confidently responded \n     that he had acted entirely properly because disclosure of the \n     controlled source would have made it even harder to ``sell'' \n     the intelligence to policy makers, there was no reason to \n     believe the Soviets used deception, no customer could use it \n     unless his unit gave permission, and no customer would make \n     any decision based on one or two documents.\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\n       L boasted that often U.S. general officers came to him \n     directly for assessments of Soviet information much to the \n     consternation of his division director.\n       When L was told that his successor, Z, denied knowing that \n     such intelligence data came from a source known to be \n     controlled by the Soviets, L responded ``bullshit.'' Z \n     received only a letter of reprimand for passing on \n     intelligence data from Soviet controlled sources without \n     appropriate disclosures.\n       It is had to comprehend: (1) how L failed to understand \n     that his conduct posed a grave threat to U.S. national \n     security and was an unconscionable arrogation of power unto \n     himself; (2) how his superiors (some of whom reportedly knew \n     what he was doing) could permit him to function in this \n     manner for so long; and (3) why the Agency has not turned \n     heaven and earth to root out this kind of attitude and \n     conduct. From the Ames case and other matters, L's conduct \n     and attitude appears to represent a deep-seated institutional \n     problem for the Agency.\n       Detailed questioning must be undertaken of the supervisors \n     of L and Z, including the Directors, to determine how this \n     could have gone on so long. Extensive work remains to be done \n     to trace to whom the controlled data went, what decisions \n     such data influenced and what damage the U.S. sustained from \n     such decisions.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3711\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, do I have 1 minute remaining before \nthe vote begins?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this \nair cargo security amendment. This is an amendment that the Senate has \nvoted on twice and passed. It will add significantly to the security of \nour aviation community. The airports and the top of the airplane are \nvery safe. We have done a super job of creating those safe areas, but \nwhat we have not done is matched that with cargo security, what is in \nthe belly of the airplane. We want a seamless aviation system, and with \nthis amendment I think we will have the safest aviation system in the \nworld.\n  I am very proud to have the support of so many of my colleagues, and \nI hope we send a strong message that this amendment should be added to \nthe final bill. I appreciate the support of the chairman, the ranking \nmember, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and the Aviation \nSubcommittee as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I urge support for Senator Hutchison's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for not more than 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Hutchison's amendment. It \nreally strengthens the basic bill that we brought before the Chamber. \nIt would reorganize our intelligence community to better deal with the \nthreat of terrorism. We want this core proposal to be a vehicle for \nresponding to the other recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and to \nclose as many of the points of vulnerability that we have in America to \nterrorists as we possibly can.\n  The Commission said major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and \ngeneral aviation security. This amendment would go a long way toward \nending those vulnerabilities. I thank the Senator from Texas, and I \nurge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nconclusion of the vote I be recognized to speak in opposition to the \nSpecter amendment for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to Hutchison amendment No. 3711. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3706\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Specter \namendment. I wish to compliment the managers of the bill, Senators \nCollins and Lieberman. I thought their arguments were overwhelmingly \npersuasive in support of the President's position and indeed the 9/11 \nCommission that these agencies--the National Security Agency; the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the former Mapping Agency, as \nwe knew it; and the National Reconnaissance Office--have important \nintelligence functions. They are collection agencies. They must remain \nunder the managerial supervision of the Secretary of Defense. I feel \never so strongly about that.\n  These three agencies are designated in law as combat support \nagencies, servicing our troops, the men and women of the Armed Forces \nwherever they are in the world facing harm's way, today, tomorrow, and \nin the future.\n  The President announced, on September 8, that these three agencies \nwould not--I repeat, would not--be moved from the Department of \nDefense. This decision was based on two very important principles: One, \nno reform measures that the President advocates should disrupt ongoing \noperations in the war on terrorism. I am certain all colleagues fully \nappreciate the sensitivity of that extremely important decision and \nprinciple not to move these three agencies. Secondly, no ambiguity \nshould be introduced in the chain of command, from the President \nthrough the Secretary of Defense down to the combatant commanders. That \nis vital to the war on terrorism and indeed other military operations.\n  These three agencies are designated combat support agencies providing \ndirect intelligence support to the unified combatant commanders \ncurrently fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in other theaters.\n  The Secretary of Defense is accountable to the President. Under law--\nI shall turn to the law momentarily. To ensure that these agencies \nprovide the proper intelligence to our military customers, the \nSecretary of Defense must be able to direct them in executing their \noperational missions.\n  I would like to pause for a minute and draw to my colleagues' \nattention the law. It reads, for the Secretary of Defense:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director \n     of Central Intelligence, shall--\n       (1) ensure that the budgets of the elements of the \n     intelligence community within the Department of Defense are \n     adequate to satisfy the overall intelligence needs of the \n     Department of Defense. . . .\n\n  Further on down it reads:\n\n       (4) ensure that the elements of the intelligence community \n     within the Department of Defense are responsive and timely \n     with respect to satisfying the needs of operational military \n     forces. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\n\n  I do not see how the amendment of my colleague from Pennsylvania \nmodifies the existing law, and that is imperative if this amendment is \nto be effective.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention further to the law, and that is title \n10 with respect to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I read from \nsection 193:\n\n       (a) Combat Readiness.--(1) Periodically (and not less often \n     than every two years), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff shall submit to the Secretary of Defense a report on \n     the combat support agencies. Each such report shall \n     include--\n       (A) a determination with respect to the responsiveness and \n     readiness of each such agency to support operating forces in \n     the event of a war or threat to national security; and\n       (B) any recommendations that the Chairman considers \n     appropriate.\n\n  That law would have to be modified in some way were this amendment to \nbe adopted.\n  So, in conclusion, Mr. President and colleagues, I foresee a \npotential disruption to operations were this amendment to become law. \nNumbers are classified, but approximately one-half of the employees of \nthese agencies are Active-Duty military personnel.\n  In addition to national requirements, these agencies provide great \nvolumes of tactical-level support to the warfighter.\n  Also, in existing law, I draw to my colleagues' attention that the \nUnder Secretary of the Air Force is dual-hatted as a Director for the \nNRO. So that, too, would have to be amended and changed. Furthermore, \nthe Director of the NSA is dual-hatted. He is a Deputy Commander of \nStrategic Command for Information, warfighting responsibility.\n  So in conclusion, I strongly support the position of the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member and urge colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have listened with a keen interest, as \nI always do, when the Senator from Virginia speaks. The concerns which \nI have seen in my tenure on the Intelligence Committee and as chair--\nand I served with the Senator from Virginia on the Intelligence \nCommittee--is the dominance of the Department of Defense on the budget \nand the lack of coordination with the other intelligence agencies, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, and the counterintelligence branch of the \nFBI.\n  The citations of authority which the Senator from Virginia raises can \nall be accommodated. In a very careful way, very carefully crafted, we \nhave left the Department of Defense with the necessary intelligence \ngathering for them to perform their mission and their function.\n  When the national intelligence director has overall supervision and \nmanagement, it does not mean that the Secretary of Defense will not \nhave access to information from the NRO or the NSA or the other \nbranches. When we hear those citations of authority, they can all be \nmolded consistent with the amendment I have offered, which, as the most \nrecent enactment, governs and dominates.\n  So I know the sincerity and I know the perspective of the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee. When I had introduced S. 1718 back in \nApril of 1996, and it was referred to the Armed Services Committee, it \nwas emasculated, really, on a turf struggle. I think there is a very \nheavy overtone of the turf battle which is present here this afternoon \nat this moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the one thing we want to avoid is \npatchwork legislation. I have drawn to the attention of my colleague--\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I had the floor, but I \ndo yield it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. But, I say to the Senator, I would \nbe happy to enter into a colloquy with you on this point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then in that event I will stay standing.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would hope you do so.\n  I pointed out specific provisions of the law requiring certain \naccountability of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs. We do not want to do patchwork legislation.\n  My understanding, after reading and studying your amendment, is you \ntake these three entities out of the Department of Defense. I do not \nread into the amendment where there is a residual authority left in the \nSecretary to perform the functions as prescribed in title 10 and, to \nsome extent, title 50.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, through the Chair, I would inquire of the \nSenator from Virginia, what does he see which would stop those various \nofficers from complying with those requirements and still allow the \nnational intelligence director to have overall management? That is my \nquestion to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will wait for the Senator from West Virginia to answer. \nYou directed it to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I hadn't meant to promote Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am trying to inject a little lightheartedness.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If you are confused on the substance of the question, \nmaybe the court reporter could repeat it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, a little humor now and then is \nwell advised. But I understand precisely the question directed to me. \nLet us read your amendment. Would you read your amendment and show me \nwhere that residual authority under titles 10 and 50 are left in the \nSecretary of Defense?\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is nothing in the amendment which takes the so-\ncalled residual authority from the Secretary of Defense. The amendment \ngives to the national intelligence director management and supervision, \nbut it does not undercut the directions of the statutes to which you \nhave referred.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would draw that argument to the attention of the \ndistinguished manager of the bill. My understanding, in reading some of \nyour comments, is that I do not find in this amendment where there is a \nclear delineation of authority and that managerial responsibility, as \nrequired under titles 10 and 50, remains in the Secretary of Defense.\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator will yield on that point, I think this \npoints out the confusion and ambiguity I pointed out earlier due to the \nway the Specter amendment is drafted. I agree that it creates confusion \nand also that the implications of substituting the national \nintelligence director for the Secretary of Defense throughout the laws \ncreating these agencies creates a lot of unintended problems. That is \none reason I believe this amendment should be defeated.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the concept of unintended consequences is \nnot an unusual argument. It can be attenuated in many directions. My \nsubmission to this body is that the amendment is plain on its face, \nthat it seeks to create a national intelligence director who has the \nauthority to manage the intelligence community. When the Senator from \nVirginia cites responsibilities in existing law, there is nothing in my \namendment which undercuts that law, nothing at all. Ambiguity, like \nbeauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and in this situation, on the \nface of the amendment, there is no ambiguity.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am reading from section 305, Defense \nIntelligence Agency. I believe that is clear on the DIA, but I do not \nsee it with reference to the National Reconnaissance Office. ``The \nDirector of the National Reconnaissance Office shall be under the \ndirection, supervision, and control of the NID.'' I just see no \nresidual managerial authority left in the Secretary of Defense to \nfulfill his statutory requirements under titles 10 and 50.\n  ``Line of authority: The Director of National Reconnaissance shall \nreport directly to the national intelligence director regarding the \nactivities of the National Reconnaissance Office.'' I mean, there is \nthe clear English language.\n  I say to my good friend, he may be well intentioned, but I am \nsomewhat at a loss to find any reference in this amendment that \npreserves that residual responsibility which you have represented to \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I regret the Senator from Virginia is at \na loss, but that doesn't affect the plain language of the amendment and \nthe fact that it doesn't disturb the responsibilities under the section \ncited by the Senator from Virginia.\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I just hand you the amendment and ask you to point \nto the language which you feel leaves the residual authority in the \nSecretary of Defense?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think the amendment speaks for itself, I say to \nSenator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have given every opportunity to my colleague. I stand \nby my representations to my colleagues and I support the managers of \nthe bill in having this amendment defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the bottom line of the Specter amendment \nis that it would sever the reporting relationship between the heads of \nthese three combat support agencies and the Secretary of Defense. I \ndon't think that makes sense. I understand these three agencies serve \nconsumers of intelligence other than the Pentagon, other than the war \nfighters, but the Pentagon, the war fighter, is a very important \nconsumer of the intelligence produced by these agencies, and that is \nwhy in our legislation we gave a lot of thought to how to handle the \norganization of these agencies and the reporting requirements.\n  We followed the advice of the 9/11 Commission. We kept a reporting \nrelationship to the Secretary of Defense in acknowledgment of the \ncombat support agency role played by these organizations. But in \nrecognition of the fact that they also provide critical intelligence to \nthe CIA and to a host of other agencies and to the President, we \nrecognized that they are national as well.\n  What we have is a dual reporting responsibility to both the Secretary \nof Defense and the new national intelligence director. We do strengthen \nthe control of the national intelligence director in significant ways \nin acknowledgment that these are national assets. We give the director \ncontrol over the budget of these agencies. We allow the director to \nappoint the heads of these agencies with concurrence from the Secretary \nof Defense. The new national intelligence director can transfer \npersonnel and funds. But we should not sever the link between those \nagencies and the Secretary of Defense. That would be a big mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Specter amendment.\n  I appreciate the support of the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the distinguished manager would yield \nfor a question, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, in support \nof his amendment, submitted for the record a letter dated September 20, \n2004, signed by a number of colleagues. Here is a statement that I \nbelieve confirms the proposition I just enunciated, that the amendment \nwould strip the Secretary of all of his responsibilities as existing in \nother statutes. I will read it:\n\n       We are writing to you, however, to express our serious \n     concern that current draft of the bill, as described by your \n     summary and after review--\n\n  It is addressed to the chairman.\n\n       --by the Governmental Affairs Committee members and staff, \n     does not give the NID additional authorities that will be \n     required to provide the unity of leadership and \n     accountability necessary for real intelligence reform. In \n     particular--\n\n  This is the operative sentence.\n\n       --we feel strongly that the NID must have day-to-day \n     operational control of all elements of the intelligence \n     community performing national missions.\n\n  It goes on. So it is very clear.\n  I would say that they do single out the term ``national missions,'' \nbut these combat support agencies perform both national missions and \ntactical combat missions. They are not clearly separable. I mean the \nsoldier, sailor, airman, and marine in the field today relies on \nsatellite intelligence, which is a national mission of, say, the NRO, \nas well as the tactical support the NRO gives in various ways.\n  So I feel that as I read the amendment, it is totally contradictory \nof the desire of the 9/11 Commission, totally contradictory of the \nadvice and counsel that the President has given the Congress, am I not \ncorrect?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct and his points are well taken. In \nreading to me the statement from that letter, the Senator has brought \nup another important point. Do we really believe that the national \nintelligence director should have line authority, day-to-day \noperational authority over all of those agencies? We know that the 9/11 \nCommission found that one reason the CIA Director was not as effective \nas he should be was he had too many jobs. He is head of the \nintelligence community, he runs the CIA, and he is the principal \nadviser to the President.\n  Under the formulation proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, we \nwould be worsening that problem by giving the NID line authority, day-\nto-day operational authority. That person cannot possibly run all of \nthose agencies and still coordinate, oversee, and manage the \nintelligence community.\n  So I believe this amendment goes too far. The Specter amendment \nessentially creates a de facto department of intelligence, as my \ncolleague from Connecticut has pointed out, and that approach was \nspecifically rejected by the 9/11 Commission. They specifically \nconsidered what should be the reporting relationships of these three \ncombat support agencies. They rejected the approach taken by the \nSpecter amendment. The administration also opposes that approach. Our \ncommittee rejected that approach. Our witnesses did not think that \napproach was wise.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in opposition to the amendment offered \nby Senator Specter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I ask my distinguished colleague \nanother question? This is a letter which is now submitted for the \nRecord. It contains the names of about eight or nine other Senators. \nHave any of those Senators come to clarify this point? I would like to \nstudy what they have said.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in committee, some of the Senators who \nsigned that letter participated in the debate. They did not convince \nthe majority of the committee members. So far in this debate today, I \ndon't believe that other advocates of this approach have yet been \nheard, but they may well be heard tomorrow. I know Senator Bond wants \nto speak. I think there are both proponents and opponents who still \nwish to be heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hope to be on the Senate floor when they do that. I \nwonder if the managers of the bill might acquaint them with the title \n10 and title 50 provisions and ask where in the amendment those \nprovisions are modified; otherwise, we are going to end up with a \npatchwork. That is one thing I know this chairman and ranking member do \nnot wish to have.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator's point is well taken.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner, who chairs the \nArmed Services Committee, which the chairman of our committee and this \nranking member are privileged to serve on, for his statement, his \nreference to sections of statute that could be compromised and indeed \noverridden if this amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania were \nadopted.\n  I thought that the colloquy between Senator Warner and Senator \nCollins was very illuminating. I hope our colleagues had a chance to \nlisten to it because it did, I believe, ultimately explain why this is \na bridge too far, a motto from the Second World War, where the troops \nwere sent to take one bridge too far--I have the feeling that Senator \nWarner is going to know the background of this ``bridge too far'' \nreference--too far to hold the bridge and, as a result, the overall \neffort collapsed.\n\n  I am afraid this stretches too far and it weighs down the reforms we \nare trying to make. I believe the colloquy between Senator Warner and \nSenator Collins is a great argument for the balance we have struck. We \nleave the line authority over these national intelligence agencies with \nthe Defense Department. Without going into details--because it is \nclassified--thousands of men and women in uniform serve in these \nagencies. So we want to leave that line authority with the Secretary of \nDefense but create a reporting authority to the national intelligence \ndirector because the NID will oversee the entire intelligence \ncommunity.\n  This has been a wonderful learning experience for Senator Collins and \nme. We met with the head of the NSA, General Hayden, and the head of \nthe NGA, General Clapper, and it was fascinating to hear the extent to \nwhich they are not only providing day-to-day technical military \nintelligence to help their personnel in the field at Central\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nCommand today, and other commands, but the way in which they are also \nproviding, because of their extraordinary capabilities, daily \nassistance and intelligence security to law enforcement agencies. That \nis the balance we tried to strike.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will pose a question to both managers, \nalso members of the Armed Services Committee. As we proceed with this \nlegislation, I am sure you are bearing in mind that we recall the \naftermath of the 1991 war in which we participated in liberating \nKuwait. You will recall as a member of the committee that General \nSchwarzkopf came before us at that time as sort of an after-action \nreport. He talked in some detail about what he felt were shortcomings, \nparticularly in the tactical intelligence, as to what he needed as a \nwarfighter, as commander of the forces. That sounded alarms throughout \nthe system. It startled many of us that that shortfall existed to that \nextent. Immediately the then Secretary of Defense and the successive \nSecretary of Defense--particularly Secretary Rumsfeld--have done \neverything possible to strengthen and remove the weaknesses that were \nin the system at that time.\n  As we proceed on this bill, I hope we have been mindful of particular \ntactical strengths that have been built into the existing system. It \nwould be my fervent hope that nothing in this bill would roll back that \nprogress. I wonder if the managers might address that, since both are \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee and have experience with the \ngulf war and what has been done in the ensuing years.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for his question, my chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee. It is an important question, one that \nSenator Collins and I weighed as we went through this process of \naccepting the assignment from the bipartisan leadership to consider and \nrecommend to the Senate on the 9/11 Commission Report. We both take not \nonly our responsibility to protect America's security under the \nConstitution seriously, we take our membership on the Armed Services \nCommittee seriously. We have a purpose here. We want to put somebody in \ncharge. The 9/11 Commission Report says the intelligence community \ndoesn't have a leader. They are not coordinating their effort. As we do \nthat, we said we want to make sure we don't compromise the quality and \navailability of intelligence to our warfighters. In fact, we believe \nour proposal not only doesn't compromise the quality of intelligence, \nbut will ultimately improve it because there will be better \ncoordination.\n  Even from within some of these agencies, national assets under the \nDefense Department, high officials said to us that they don't benefit, \nthey don't think the military benefits, the warfighters benefit from \nthe current ambiguity. Make those lines clear, and all the customers, \nif I can use that term, of intelligence will benefit, including the \nmilitary.\n  Senator Warner knows that in specific regard to the so-called TIARA, \nor tactical intelligence budget of the military, that remains totally \nwithin the Defense Department, and so do most of the joint military \nintelligence programs. So the answer is a resounding yes. We understand \nthe uncertainty, the anxiety because of our bill. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations represent change. It does take the budget authority and \nput it under the national intelligence director for national \nintelligence programs, including these three within the Defense \nDepartment. So we understand the anxiety. But we think we put together \na balanced system that will not only first provide the No. 1 customer \nof intelligence, the President of the United States, with the best \nintelligence, with the coordinated unity of effort that he requires, \nbut do the same for the warfighters. That is our firm belief.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is reassuring. If I might further \ninquire of my distinguished colleague, I was given today, and I expect \nthe managers maybe earlier received this, in any event, this is the \nSeptember 28 communication from the Executive Office of the President \nto the Senate. It is entitled ``Statement of Administration Policy.'' \nHas that been printed in the Record as yet today?\n  Ms. COLLINS. It has not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, at this point in \nthe debate or at the conclusion of our colloquy, to print this \nStatement of Administration Policy in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2845, \n     commends the Committee for its expeditious attention to these \n     important intelligence reform issues, appreciates the \n     Committee's efforts to include important provisions proposed \n     by the Administration, including specific and detailed budget \n     authorities for the National Intelligence Director (NID), and \n     looks forward to working with the Congress to address the \n     Administration's concerns outlined below. This measure will \n     build upon actions already taken by the Administration, \n     including in the President's recently issued Executive \n     Orders, as well as upon the recommendations of the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 \n     Commission).\n       The Administration supports, in particular, the \n     establishment of a NID with full, effective, and meaningful \n     budget authorities and other authorities to manage the \n     Intelligence Community including statutory authority for the \n     newly created National Counterterrorism Center. The \n     Administration will oppose any amendments that would weaken \n     the full budget authority or any other authorities that the \n     President has requested for the NID. The Administration will \n     work in the legislative process to continue to strengthen and \n     streamline intelligence reform legislation and to make \n     adjustments to ensure that the President continues to have \n     flexibility in combating terrorism and conducting \n     intelligence activities.\n       The Administration is concerned about the excessive and \n     unnecessary detail in the structure of the Office of the NID. \n     In particular, provisions of S. 2845 would, in the aggregate, \n     construct a cumbersome new bureaucracy in the office of the \n     NID and in the Executive Office of the President with \n     overlapping authorities. Legislatively mandated bureaucracy \n     will hinder, not help, in the effort to strengthen U.S. \n     intelligence capabilities and to preserve our constitutional \n     rights. The Administration urges the Senate to delete or \n     significantly revise these problematic provisions.\n       The Administration opposes the Committee's attempt to \n     define in statute the programs that should be included in the \n     National Intelligence Program; the Administration believes \n     that further review is required. The Administration also \n     believes that the Committee bill's provision relating to the \n     NID's role in acquisition in major systems needs further \n     study to ensure that the requirements of major consumers are \n     met.\n       The Administration supports the strong information-sharing \n     authorities granted to the NID in the bill. The \n     Administration is concerned that the extensive authorities \n     and responsibilities granted to the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) to implement an information sharing network are \n     both outside of OMB's usual responsibilities and are \n     inconsistent with the goal of ensuring a NID with effective \n     authority to manage the Intelligence Community. These \n     responsibilities should be granted to the NID in such a way \n     as to remain consistent with section 892 of the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002. The Administration also believes \n     that the detail in which the legislation prescribes the \n     network is excessive; the network would be more likely to \n     accomplish its beneficial goal if the bill simply provided \n     the authority necessary for its establishment while \n     leaving the details to be worked out and altered as \n     circumstances require.\n       The Administration is also very concerned about the \n     provisions that would purport to reorganize the President's \n     internal policy staff by merging the National Security \n     Council and the Homeland Security Council. Based on the \n     constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the Congress \n     should not legislate and make permanent the internal \n     organization of the President's own Executive offices or \n     otherwise limit the flexibility needed to respond quickly to \n     threats or attacks.\n       The Administration is also concerned that the Committee \n     bill mandates disclosure of sensitive information about the \n     intelligence budget. The legislation should not compel \n     disclosure, including to the Nation's enemies in war, for the \n     amounts requested by the President, and provided by the \n     Congress, for the conduct of the Nation's intelligence \n     activities.\n       The Administration opposes the provision in the Committee \n     bill purporting to require the President to select a single \n     department or agency to conduct all security clearance \n     investigations. Although the Administration supports \n     improvements to the security clearance process, this \n     provision would impermissibly interfere with the President's \n     need for flexibility in conducting security clearance \n     investigations and does not recognize the special needs of \n     individual intelligence agencies.\n       The 9/11 Commission found that the creation of a NID and \n     National Counterterrorism Center, ``will not work if \n     congressional oversight does not change too.'' The \n     Administration notes that the bill does not address this \n     vital reform component or the parallel recommendation to \n     consolidate oversight for the Department of Homeland \n     Security. The Administration believes the legislation\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n     should also address the Commission's recommendation to ensure \n     rapid consideration by the Senate of national security \n     appointments.\n       The Administration notes that the Committee bill did not \n     include Section 6 (``Preservation of Authority and \n     Accountability'') of the Administration's proposal; the \n     Administration supports inclusion of this provision in the \n     Senate bill. The legislation should also recognize that its \n     provisions would be executed to the extent consistent with \n     the constitutional authority of the President: to conduct the \n     foreign affairs of the United States; to withhold information \n     the disclosure of which could impair the foreign relations, \n     the national security, deliberative processes of the \n     Executive, or the performance of the Executive's \n     constitutional duties; to recommend for congressional \n     consideration such measures as the President may judge \n     necessary or expedient; and to supervise the unitary \n     executive.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think it is a document that will be of \nvalue to all Members of the Senate if they have not received it.\n  I would like to draw the attention of the two managers to that \noperative paragraph 2:\n\n       The Administration supports, in particular, the \n     establishment of a NID with full, effective, and meaningful \n     budget authorities and other authorities to manage the \n     Intelligence Community including statutory authority for the \n     newly created National Counterterrorism Center. The \n     Administration will oppose any amendments that would weaken \n     the full budget authority or any other authorities that the \n     President has requested for the NID. The Administration will \n     work in the legislative process to continue to strengthen and \n     streamline intelligence reform legislation and to make \n     adjustments to ensure that the President continues to have \n     flexibility in combating terrorism and conducting \n     intelligence activities.\n\n  It is the operative phrase that ``the Administration will oppose any \namendments that would weaken the full budget authority,'' and the \npreceding sentence where they said ``a NID with full, effective, and \nmeaningful budget authorities.''\n  Mr. President, first, I would like to ask the two managers, is the \npurport of this paragraph consistent with all the several provisions in \nthe bill that refer to budget authority, in their judgment?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to answer the question of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, I believe it is consistent. I direct the Senator's \nattention to the very first sentence of this Statement of \nAdministration Policy where it states: ``The Administration supports \nSenate passage of S. 2845.'' That is the bill before us. That is the \nbill that is also known as the Collins-Lieberman bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Without diminishing in any way that very encouraging \nsentence, if you go on to read the totality of this communication, \nthere are expressly in here some reservations, but I will not get into \nthat at this point in time.\n  I want to go back to these words, ``full, effective, and meaningful \nbudget authorities.'' We just had a debate on the Specter amendment, \nwhich I believe, with no disrespect to my good friend and colleague, is \nan extreme viewpoint on this, and I am hopeful the Senate will not \nadopt it, but we do come back to this pivotal question, and tomorrow I \nhope to bring forth some amendments. Now that I see the expressed \nlanguage and the Senator assured me her bill tracks this, I have to \nhave some clarification--at least I shall seek clarification--of what \nis the remaining role of the Secretary of Defense with regard to those \nportions; namely, these three combat agencies, together with DIA, what \nis the residual area of collaboration, jointness, in the preparation of \nthe budget--preparation is part 1--and then the execution of the budget \nafter it goes through the authorization and appropriations process and \nbegins to come back to the several departments and agencies.\n  So let's talk about what the Senator believes this language--which is \nconsistent, as she says, with the language in the bill--I presume the \nSenator's language would not be modified or changed by this--what is \nleft to the Secretary of Defense in regard to the budget authority?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to respond to the question of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, our bill makes very clear that the budgets for the \ntactical intelligence programs remain under the authority of the \nSecretary of Defense. That is consistent with the position of the \nadministration, and it is also consistent with the position of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n\n  What we are seeking to do is to put national intelligence assets--the \nbudget for those programs--under the national intelligence director \nand, indeed, much of the budget for these agencies is currently within \nthe National Intelligence Program, or what is now known as the NFIP, \nthe National Foreign Intelligence Program, because as the Senator is \nwell aware, these agencies are providing intelligence not just to the \ncombatant commanders, the troops, DOD, but as one of the generals with \nwhom we met told us, he talks far more often to the Director of the CIA \nthan he does to the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I really think that is an important \nrepresentation the Senator has made, but I do not read in this language \nof the communication from the White House the distinction that she \ndraws between tactical and national. Can I refer the Senator again to \nthis language?\n  Ms. COLLINS. If we look at the administration's legislative language \nthey have sent up, they, too, exclude the tactical intelligence assets. \nI think what this language is intended to convey is, as one of our \nwitnesses said--as many of our witnesses said--the worst thing we could \ndo is to create a national intelligence director who did not have \nbudget authority. That power of the purse is arguably the most \nimportant authority given to the NID, but no one, to my knowledge, has \nadvocated giving the NID authority over the tactical intelligence in \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. I draw the attention of the distinguished managers to the \nwords ``the Administration will oppose any amendments that would weaken \nthe full budget authority. . . .'' It is the word ``full.''\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, that the President has requested for the NID.\n  Mr. WARNER. To me ``full'' is the whole basket. It could be \ninterpreted that way.\n  Ms. COLLINS. What I am telling the Senator is that if he looks at the \nlanguage sent up by the administration, he will see--and if he looks at \nthe language in our bill, he will see there has never been discussion \nin putting tactical intelligence--\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I acknowledge that, the JMIP and the TIARA \nin the language sent up. But it seems to me the writer of this could \nhave been somewhat more explicit in the communication because this is \nan important communication to guide Senators desiring to establish \ntheir voting pattern in connection with the Senator's bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I, obviously, am \nnot the author--\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I pressed the point far enough and I think the \nSenator from Maine has been very courteous in her responses. I just \nwant to bring to the attention of colleagues, when this says ``full,'' \nit is your understanding it did not include the JMIP, the TIARA, and \nthose programs; is that correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. That is correct, other than there may be some programs \nthat are now part of the JMIP that are not principally for--and I see \nmy colleague from Michigan joined us; we had a long debate in committee \nabout this--that are not principally used for joint military purposes, \nbut rather are national intelligence assets, and an example of that \nwould be DIA.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am privileged to be in this colloquy with my friends. I \nwould like to have the assurance of the ranking member of the committee \nthat he concurs in the statements just made by our distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. LIEBERMANN. Mr. President, my reflex is to say I do, but I must \nsay I was distracted for a while, so I do not know everything the \nSenator said.\n  Mr. WARNER. The question is the language sent up by the \nadministration did have a breakout of the budget authority as relates \nto certain parts of the overall programs performed by these combat \nagencies.\n  I ask our distinguished manager of the bill whether this language in \nthe communication today which said the administration opposed any \namendments, because I proposed to have an amendment tomorrow--it may be \nopposed by the administration, but I want to make sure that the phrase \n``full budget authorities'' is not amending what they sent up by way of \nlanguage.\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the sentence is subject to more than \none interpretation. So I am not sure what the meaning of it is, but I \ncan assure the Senator about what the intention of the underlying bill \nis and that is the way in which I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion and debating any amendments the Senator might have.\n  I found a quote that may be reassuring to the Senator. It is from \nGeneral Hayden, Director of the National Security Agency, when he \ntestified before the House Select Committee on Intelligence on August \n18 of this year about the 9/11 Commission recommendations. He said an \nempowered national intelligence director, with direct authority over \nthe national agencies, including his own, should not be viewed as \ndiminishing our ability or willingness to fulfill our responsibility as \ncombat support agencies, which I found reassuring. That is certainly \nour intention and I hope the Senator from Virginia will find that \nreassuring as well. That, combined with the possibility that the \nadministration might oppose one of the Senator's amendments, I hope \nwill lead the Senator to reconsider.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, time will tell. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted at this point in the Record a copy of the administration--I \nthink the Senator referred to it as a bill although it was never \nintroduced--language they sent up which made a clear reference and \ndistinction to what budget authority was given to the NID and what \nresidual remains in the Secretary of Defense. Am I correct on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have no objection. I think that would \nbe helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nmy understanding is, as the Senator said, this is not a complete bill. \nIt was legislative language for parts of what ultimately have been \ncovered in our bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. It was a communication from the administration----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. I guess to the managers of the bill or the committee. \nNevertheless, it is a document expressing the intentions, and the \ndistinguished chairman has clearly indicated that her bill tracks that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I do not want to give the impression that our \nlegislation tracks the administration's legislation in all respects, \nbecause it does not. What I was saying to the Chair and to the Senator \nfrom Virginia is there has never been support for bringing the tactical \nintelligence assets, bringing the budget for those programs under the \nnational intelligence director's control. Our legislation specifically \ncarves them out and keeps them under the control of the Pentagon. So I \nam a bit perplexed by this debate because nobody is proposing what the \nSenator seems to be fearing.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I asked that if a construction of this language we \nreceived today is full budget authority, it could lead someone to the \nconclusion that everything was transferred.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The full budget authority, in my view, applies to the \nnational intelligence assets.\n  Mr. WARNER. Good. And if they had inserted that in there, it would \nhave been clearer, I hasten to add. We are not going to debate this \nfurther. In fairness, having raised this question, I think the Senator \nhas brought considerable clarification. It may be the administration \nmay be more forthcoming about what they precisely meant by the use of \nfull budget authority in the use of this communication, but let me \nproceed in my questioning with regard to the residual authority of the \nSecretary of Defense over those budgets in the combat agencies, and I \nwould like to add DIA, which is also a combat agency.\n  As the Senator says in her bill, those sections which are tactical \nare in the discretion of the Secretary in the preparation of the \nbudget, and he would collaborate with the NID in preparing those \nsections. Now, on the national intelligence collection, I think the \nchairman agrees with me that the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nutilize that in carrying out their tactical missions, although it \nclassifies the NRO and the gathering in space as the national program. \nAm I correct? It does feed into the tactical portion?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. So, therefore, should not the Secretary of Defense have a \nvoice--and I would like to see how we can describe that voice--in the \ncompilation of that budget for the national program which in part \nsupports the efforts of the forces in the tactical missions?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would say to the Senator that the Secretary already \ndoes have a voice. There is a requirement that as the national \nintelligence director develops the budget to be recommended to the \nPresident, he must do it in consultation with the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of Energy for the part of the intelligence community \nthat is under the Secretary of Energy's control, et cetera.\n  In addition, we create a new entity called the joint intelligence \ncommunity council, which I think already has an acronym, on which the \nSecretary of Defense will serve, which serves as an advisory board to \nthe national intelligence director.\n  I also point out to the distinguished Senator from Virginia that \nultimately it is the President's call on the budget. These are \nrecommendations made by the national intelligence director. It is the \nPresident who ultimately decides.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is very helpful. I wonder if the \nSenator's staff would provide for the Record at this point an insertion \nof those references in the bill which supports the Senator's very \nimportant representation to the Senate just now, that the Senator feels \nhe has the consultation role and such other roles as to assure the \nSecretary of Defense that he has a voice in the preparation of the \nbudget.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Those provisions are extremely clear in the bill. I do \nnot see how they can be ambiguous.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just wanted to have the pages annotated. I think my \ncolleague witnessed several colleagues today saying it would be helpful \nif we could get a clearer understanding of some things, and I think the \nRecord today could be of help to those who want to see in the Senator's \nbill precisely those sections which underpin the Senator's important \nrepresentation. I ask if the Senator might consider putting that into \nthe Record.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would be happy to put the provisions in the Record. I \nquestion why it is necessary when everybody has the bill available. It \nis on page 12, for example, lines 20 through 25, in describing what the \nnational intelligence director shall do. It says:\n\n       Developing and presenting to the President an annual budget \n     for the National Intelligence Program after consultation with \n     the heads of agencies or elements, and the heads of their \n     respective departments . . .\n\n  I do not see how it could be clearer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was not challenging the language. I was \nsimply trying to get a reference. The Senator provided it, and I thank \nthe chairman.\n  If I could transition to the second part of this, the budget is \nprepared and approved by the President. It is then acted upon by the \nCongress by authorization and appropriation and it goes to the NID. Am \nI correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. After Congress acts.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. And the law is signed by the President.\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The appropriation is received by the NID for the \nnational intelligence program.\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Not for what is known as TIARA or JMIP.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman. That portion of the budget then \ngoes back to be administered by the Secretary of Defense; is that \nclear?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Which portion?\n  Mr. WARNER. That nonnational portion.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. It goes back to the Secretary of Defense. I thank the \ndistinguished chairman on that point.\n  I see on the floor my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\nArmed Services Committee. I wondered, since he followed this colloquy \nand I know he has worked very hard in this area with the Senator from \nVirginia, have some of his concerns which he has expressed to me been \ntouched on in this colloquy?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia has the floor. Who \nhas the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Virginia has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent I be able to respond to the \nSenator from Virginia without his losing the right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think I have the floor. I am quite happy \nto yield to my colleague to respond to my inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the first part of the inquiry, what is interesting to \nme, and ironic, is the Director of Central Intelligence has that same \nauthority the chairman just read from page 12, line 20, that is \nprovided to the NID, which is to develop and present to the President \nthe annual budget for the national intelligence program. That is the \nsame authority as exists in current law to the intelligence director. \nSo there is no change in terms of presenting and developing the budget.\n  Where the real changes take place are after the budget or after the \nappropriation is adopted, and then it depends--then the law will change \nwho it is that executes that budget authority. That is where we get \nvery complicated changes.\n  I think the discussion and debate is very important, that we analyze \nwhich specific programs, projects, and activities, budget execution--\nnot presentation or preparation--but execution is transferred to the \nNID from where it currently is. That is where I think we all would \nbenefit from a description of specific programs which are not \ntransferred. There are some in the tactical area. But there are also \nsome that are transferred--very few, perhaps 3 percent of the 80 \npercent of the budget that is transferred, in terms of budget execution \nto the NID--that in my judgment should not be transferred. A very tiny, \nfew programs, including the intelligence--the J-2 programs that are out \nin the combatant commanders, including the communications \ninfrastructure between the JCS and the combatant commanders. Those \nspecific programs--and I know my good friend from Virginia knows these \nprograms--those specific programs clearly belong in the Defense \nDepartment's budget execution, in my judgment. However, they are \ntransferred.\n  To try to answer the Senator's question, I think it would be very \nilluminating, in addition to what he has asked for, if we could take \nsome examples, and there are very few, of some programs where budget \nexecution is transferred to the NID that should not be. I emphasize \nagain, so this is not mischaracterized, I am talking here about less \nthan 3 percent of the 80 percent of the budget which is transferred.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I apologize for interrupting the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I am done.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The leaders have been waiting for Senator Lieberman and \nme since 5:30 for a meeting and they have summoned us again. I did not \nwant to walk off the floor without explaining to my distinguished \ncolleagues the fact that we have already kept our leaders waiting for \nmore than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, if I could make a preliminary statement, and then I \nwill be glad to yield. As a matter of fact, I will yield the floor. If \nyou seek the floor, I am going to yield it momentarily.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I was going to ask a question of the distinguished floor \nmanager. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his \ncourtesy.\n  It is my understanding we are not going to vote on the Specter \namendment as of this evening; is that right?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am sorry, I couldn't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is my understanding we are not going to vote on the \nSpecter amendment as of this evening; is that correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is correct. The vote will occur tomorrow.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Do we have an idea approximately what time tomorrow \nmorning?\n  Ms. COLLINS. We do not. We have not been able to determine how many \npeople still want to speak on the amendment. We are trying to \naccommodate those who do wish to speak.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. One Senator who is asking you some questions now would \nlike to speak, and I would like to have 20 to 25 minutes, if that would \nbe all right, speaking as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \nIf I could have an understanding? I know you will work very hard and I \nknow there has been a lot spoken tonight; I understand that. But I \nwould like to speak in favor of the Specter amendment, if in fact that \ncould be arranged, or have that understanding with the Senator.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would certainly welcome that. Perhaps we can try with \nthe help of the floor staff to order the series of speakers. We will \nmake sure the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee is \nprotected in that regard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent also that I be given 5 minutes in \nopposition to the Specter amendment tomorrow morning, and if I am not \nhere because of the full committee meeting we have at Armed Services, \nthat my statement be made part of the record at that time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We hope the Senator will be here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I thank the distinguished manager \nand ranking member for engaging in I think a very important colloquy. I \nwanted to make a record for some colleagues who have asked a number of \nquestions, and I think we made an interesting record here that \nwill help in their deliberations and thought processes.\n\n  I will have amendments tomorrow, hopefully to clarify some things \nwhich I feel should be clarified. They are constructive amendments, I \nsay to the distinguished chair and ranking member, because I want to be \ncooperative and supportive of the President and your efforts. But I do \nfeel very strongly that there are some amendments.\n  My colleague, Senator Levin, and I have worked together. It may well \nbe we will jointly put in some amendments tomorrow on this subject. Not \nin a manner of a turf battle. I am really quite in temper that that \nword continues to be brought up, because I personally am striving to do \nwhat is best for this country and to make our intelligence system \nstronger as a consequence of this legislative process. I think it can \nbe achievable. But I have to get clarifications. The language in this \nmessage that came up today about full budget authority seems to be \nsomewhat contradictory of some other things. But we will work it out.\n  I thank the distinguished managers and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Briefly, I thank Senator Warner for his statement in \nopposition to the Specter amendment and for the questions which he \nraised which I think have been helpful and clarifying. No doubt this \ndiscussion will continue in the days ahead.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is not very often that things come up \nthat require an immediate fix, but I think one has.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 2855 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to address the critical issue \nthat is before the Senate--reform of our intelligence community and \nrestructuring of the Federal Government to enhance our ability to wage \nthe global war on terror and protect our Nation from other threats.\n  I commend Senators Collins and Lieberman and their staffs for their \nhard work and leadership on this issue, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  I also thank the Senate leadership for making this a priority. There \nis no issue more important for us to address. In fact, I believe this \nlegislation is the most important I have worked on since coming to the \nSenate in 1999.\n  The war on terror is unlike any conflict we have fought--covert holy \nwarriors seeking to infiltrate our society and those of our allies to \ndo us grievous harm. Against this radical enemy, intelligence is of the \ngreatest importance. We must do everything we can to strengthen our \nintelligence capabilities. If you think of what we need to do about \nterrorism, we need to attack, we need to prevent, and we need to \nprepare. Intelligence is the greatest weapon we have in all three of \nthose categories.\n  Before I comment on this legislation before us, however, I would like \nto first offer some principles and thoughts that have guided my \ndeliberations.\n  First, we must do no harm. Great progress has been made since \nSeptember 11, 2001, to improve the operations of our intelligence \ncommunity and make our country more secure. There is no greater \nevidence of that than when I travel in Ohio to various large urban \nareas. I am so impressed with the cooperation that now exists as \ncontrasted to what was there before 9/11. Because we are making \nprogress, we must be sure that we do not inadvertently set back our \ncurrent efforts. We must implement additional improvements.\n  Second, we must not restructure the intelligence community to deal \nsolely with the threat of terrorism caused by Islamic extremists, as \npressing a concern as that is. There are many other threats that \nrequire close scrutiny by the intelligence community. Reform must \naddress the threats that will confront America 10 and 20 years in the \nfuture in addition to those faced today.\n  For example, the United States must continue to monitor regional \nconflicts which have the potential to undermine stability in various \nparts of the world such as India, Pakistan, China, and Taiwan. Regional \nconflicts, such as between India and Pakistan, are motivated by \npolitical, social, and historical reasons unique to their own \ncountries. In the event that regional conflicts should escalate to such \nproportions that chemical, biological, or even nuclear weapons would be \nused, as would be possible in the event of a conflict between India and \nPakistan, U.S. interests certainly would be threatened. The \nintelligence community must remain keenly aware of what is happening in \nother areas of the world so that the U.S. is not only prepared and able \nto respond but so that we can do everything in our power to prevent \nsuch a crisis from happening.\n  The United States must also monitor threats presented by rogue \nnations such as North Korea, rogue states that have the ability to \nfoster regional instability and harm U.S. interests. They, too, must be \nclosely monitored as dictators such as Kim Chong-il look to enhance \ntheir power and position. If not, the U.S. risks strategic surprise \nwhich would be devastating to our national security interests.\n\n  Additionally, the United States must address the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. These weapons have the ability to cause \ngrave harm to Americans and life as we know it if found in the wrong \nhands. They could be used by terrorists against cities in the United \nStates, they could be used in regional conflict, or they could be used \nby a rogue state to enhance its power.\n  Third, we should make it clear to the American people that the \ndifferent perspectives presented on the Senate floor are legitimate. A \nreview of the hearings held by various congressional committees during \nAugust and September demonstrated that many former Government officials \nwho have had distinguished careers in senior national security posts \nhold contradictory opinions on the 9/11 Commission recommendations and \nrelated national security issues.\n  Fourth, reforming the Federal Government to address the challenges of \nglobal terrorism is going to take several years to accomplish. It is \nnot going to happen that fast. It is my hope that during the next \nCongress we will address the critical challenges confronting the \nFederal law enforcement community, for example. For example, \nrationalizing responsibility and missions and personnel systems is \nvital to ensure that Federal law enforcement is best equipped to \nconfront foreign terrorists operating in the United States.\n  I am pleased that we have addressed some of the needs of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation in the legislation we are considering today. \nBut much more remains to be done, and it is important for our national \nsecurity to finish this job.\n  As my colleagues may know, I sponsored legislation that became law \nthat requires the Office of Personnel Management to study Federal law \nenforcement personnel systems and recommend improvements. I was \nconcerned that we were going forward with personnel changes and getting \nsome coordination between those law enforcement agencies and the \nhomeland security, but we were failing to do the same thing with law \nenforcement agencies that were outside of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The Office of Personnel Management has implemented that \nlegislation. They have made some significant recommendations on how we \ncan improve the relationships, classifications, and so forth, with \nthose outside of Homeland Security. It would be my hope that we \nimplement those recommendations.\n  Regarding the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, I strongly \nsupport creating a robust national intelligence director, but I have \nbeen wrestling with exactly how much authority we should give the new \nnational intelligence director. I appreciate the balance that Senators \nCollins and Lieberman were trying to achieve in their legislation. It \nis clear to me that these authorities should not be diminished.\n  In fact, in committee I offered an amendment that would give the \nnational intelligence director reorganization authority over the \nnational intelligence program so that the director could identify \nefficiencies and eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort. It is \nunfortunate that my amendment was weakened in committee, and I am still \nconsidering amendments to strengthen the management authority of the \nnational intelligence director.\n  The intelligence community budget process is extremely complex. \nIndeed, the manner in which these agencies interact with each other is \nprobably the most complicated interagency process in the Federal \nGovernment. The budgets of the 15 intelligence community agencies, \nincluding all those of the Armed Forces, are intertwined in the \nNational Foreign Intelligence Program, the Joint Military Intelligence \nProgram, the tactical intelligence and related activities.\n  The Collins-Lieberman legislation seeks to bring clarity to the \nsituation by defining a national intelligence program. However, we may \nbe able to improve this budget definition, and I will weigh all \namendments to do so carefully.\n  At the same time, we must be careful not to erode the budget \nauthority of the national intelligence director. I understand that some \nof my colleagues may offer amendments to give the national intelligence \ndirector a fixed term in an attempt to immunize this individual from \npolitical pressure. I would note that a host of other provisions, \nincluding a strong inspector general for the intelligence community and \nan ombudsman to specifically guard against political concerns, have \nbeen created to do exactly that.\n  Quite the contrary, a fixed term is unnecessary and could diminish \nthe effectiveness of the national intelligence director. A close and \ntrusting working relationship with the President is going to be key to \nthe success of the effectiveness of the national intelligence director. \nWe should not weaken this relationship by mandating a fixed-term \nappointment.\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee heard testimony from three former \nDirectors of Central Intelligence, and all agreed that the national \nintelligence director should serve at the pleasure of the President. An \nincoming President should not be stuck with a national intelligence \ndirector from a previous administration.\n  I know that the Presiding Officer, in his former capacity as Governor \nof the State of Tennessee and as a member of the Bush Cabinet, \nunderstands that if this individual doesn't have the confidence of the \nPresident of the United States, his or her effectiveness is going to be \ndiminished a great deal. So much of what this person can accomplish \nwill have a lot to do with that relationship with the President because \nthere are going to be situations where there are going to be \ndifferences of opinion. Finally, the boss has to decide them. If you \nhave somebody there that has the job and doesn't have the confidence of \nthe boss, we are in trouble.\n\n  Mr. President, although this legislation deals primarily with \nimproving structured roles and missions, the human capital challenges \nconfronting our intelligence community must not be overlooked.\n  In March of 2001--it seems like a long time ago--my Government \nManagement Subcommittee held a hearing entitled ``The National Security \nImplications of the Human Capital Crisis.'' The panel of distinguished \nwitnesses that day included former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, \na member of the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st \nCentury. Secretary Schlesinger concluded his testimony with these \nremarks:\n\n       As it enters the 21st century, the United States finds \n     itself on the brink of an unprecedented crisis of competence \n     in Government. The maintenance of American power in the world \n     depends on the quality of U.S. Government personnel, civil \n     and military, at all levels. We must take immediate action in \n     the personnel area to ensure that the United States can meet \n     future challenges. That fixing of the personnel problem is a \n     precondition for fixing virtually everything else that needs \n     repair in the institutional edifice of U.S. national security \n     policy.\n\n  He was so right. Secretary Schlesinger's insightful comments were \nreinforced by the 9/11 Commission on page 399 of the report. The \nCommission said ``significant changes in the organization of the \nGovernment.'' The Commission went on to say:\n\n       We know that the quality of people is more important than \n     the quality of the wiring diagrams. Some of the saddest \n     aspects of the 9/11 story are the outstanding efforts of so \n     many individuals straining, often without success, against \n     the boundaries of the possible. Good people can overcome bad \n     structures, but they should not have to.\n\n  I will never forget that after 9/11 the first thing that came to my \nmind was we didn't have the right people with the right knowledge and \nskills at the right place at the right time. If you go back and look at \nall of the report, it gets back to that situation and also the fact \nthat they weren't communicating with each other.\n  I am pleased that the Collins-Lieberman legislation includes some \nimportant human capital provisions. I offered an amendment in \ncommittee, which was unanimously accepted, that provides enhanced \nclassification and pay flexibilities for intelligence analysts at the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Specifically, my amendment enables the FBI to work with the OPM to \ndevelop new classification standards and pay rates for intelligence \nanalysts. The amendment also allows the bureau to improve their \nperformance management system for their intelligence analysts and \nestablishes two congressional reporting requirements. The amendment was \ncompletely within the spirit of the 9/11 recommendations, which noted \nthat the FBI should create a specialized and integrated national \nsecurity workforce consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and \nsurveillance specialists who are recruited, trained, rewarded, and \nretained to ensure the development of an institutional culture with \nstrong experience in intelligence and national security throughout the \norganization.\n\n  I thought the other incredible thing after 9/11 was the cry that went \nout: Can anybody speak Farsi? Can anybody speak Arabic? You would have \nthought that after the Persian Gulf war there would have been a very \naggressive effort, because of the instability of the area, for us to \nbring in people who could speak Farsi and Arabic. If you looked at the \nState Department a couple years ago, you would have found we had all \nkinds of linguists who could speak fluent Russian. But the threat had \nchanged. We didn't have the capacity to change with that threat. \nHopefully, with this new national intelligence director, we are going \nto be able to have that flexibility.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will provide the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation with essential human capital flexibilities specifically \ntargeted to building an elite cadre of intelligence analysts. In \naddition, Senator Lugar and I will offer another amendment to the bill \nto improve the Presidential appointment process, which has been broken \nfor decades. Over the coming days, I want to work with Senators Collins \nand Lieberman on this amendment.\n  This amendment addresses a critical recommendation in the 9/11 \nCommission Report. It is a problem I have been examining for years. \nDuring my time in the Senate, I have found political appointees to be \ndedicated and diligent professionals who want to make a difference for \nour country. They often leave high-paying corporate jobs only to find \ntheir commitment to our Nation requires an increase in workload and a \ndecrease in salary.\n  I talked to one individual who filled out the financial disclosure \nform and all that was required. He said that it cost him $200,000 to \npay the professional people to do all the things that were required in \nthis disclosure form that is now currently in effect with the Federal \nGovernment. I suspect that the President, when he appointed the \nSecretary of Education, had to go through all these forms, and so \nforth, and wondered to himself whether he ought to do it. Before they \neven begin to work for the Government, however, as I mentioned, they \nmust first navigate the complex, turbulent, and outdated Presidential \nappointment process--an area where reviews and recommendations for \nimprovement have gone unheeded far too long.\n  In 1937, a committee issued the first report on improving the \nPresidential appointment process. During the 67 years since this \ninaugural report, the appointment process has been formally examined 14 \nadditional times. After such extensive reviews, it is disconcerting for \nthis Senator that we have not been able to enact meaningful reform in \nthis area.\n  To capture the essence of the problem, understand first that the \nnumber of politically appointed positions has grown from 286 to 3,361 \nover the past 4 decades. This increase is straining an already \noverburdened system. And the time it takes to complete an appointment \nhas increased through the years from just over 2 months during the \nKennedy administration to 8 months in the current administration. I \nthink Secretary Rumsfeld said his team didn't go into place until 6 \nmonths after he had been appointed as Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President, 8 months is simply too long to fill an appointed \nposition. I am afraid that if we do not update the current system for \nprocessing Presidential appointees, we run the risk of driving good \npeople away from appointed Government service. Progress has been made \non this issue during the last several years.\n\n  First, on February 15, the Hart-Rudman commission issued their report \nentitled ``The Roadmap for National Security Imperative for Change,'' \nwhich in part examined the Presidential appointment process. The \nCommission's final report observes: The ordeals to which outside \nnominees are subjected are so great, above and beyond whatever \nfinancial or career sacrifice is involved, so as to make it prohibitive \nfor many individuals of talent and experience to accept public service.\n  Then on April 4 and 5, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \nheld 2 days of hearings on the state of the Presidential appointment \nprocess. During those hearings Paul Light from the Brookings \nInstitution said:\n\n       Past and potential Presidential appointees alike view the \n     process of entering office with disdain, describing it as \n     embarrassing, confusing, and unfair. They see the process as \n     far more cumbersome and lengthy than it needs to be.\n\n  By the way, I held a hearing a couple weeks ago, and Paul Light was \nthere,\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\nand he reiterated that same statement he made in 2001.\n  On May 16, 2001, the Governmental Affairs Committee passed Senator \nFred Thompson's bipartisan bill to streamline the Presidential \nappointments process that I cosponsored with Senators Akaka, Durbin, \nLieberman, and Lugar. Although it passed the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in the 107th Congress, it did not pass the full Senate. When \nSenator Fred Thompson left the Senate, I promised him I would continue \nto push for appointments reform. Therefore, in April of last year, I \nreintroduced the Presidential Appointments Improvement Act, and today I \nurge my colleagues to pass this important proposal.\n  What happens is that after the President comes in and he goes through \nthis line of getting people appointed, they get off on other things, \nand they forget about the problems they went through to get all their \nappointees. So it kind of goes to the bottom of the stack in terms of \npriorities. This 9/11 Commission implementation by the Senate gives us \na wonderful opportunity to do something about this problem that has \nlingered for so many years.\n  I am certain all my colleagues have read the recommendations in the \n9/11 Commission report. As you recall, one of the recommendations \nunderscored the importance of improving the Presidential appointment \nprocess. Specifically on page 422, the report states:\n\n       Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no \n     notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption \n     of national security policymaking during the change of \n     administration by accelerating the process for national \n     security appointments. We think the process could be improved \n     significantly so transitions can work more effectively and \n     allow more new officials to assume their responsibilities as \n     quickly as possible.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission report also noted that in 2001, the new \nadministration, like others before it, did not have its team on the job \nuntil at least 6 months after it took office. In fact, I commented to \npeople that after the length it took for the President to finally know \nhe was President, we lost that period of time once the President was \nelected and started building his team; they were just concentrating on \nwho was going to be the President. Once that was done, then they \nstarted to concentrate on who the people were going to be in the \nadministration.\n  They did a great job of taking care of the initial people, but, as \nyou know, it took a long time for them to start filling in that \norganization.\n  My amendment offers realistic governmentwide solutions to the \nproblems identified by the 9/11 Commission and the 14 other Commission \nstudies and reports that have detailed the importance of streamlining \nthe Presidential appointment process.\n  The four main provisions of the amendment include streamlining the \nfinancial disclosure forms for executive branch employees. Two, \nrequiring agencies to examine the number of Presidential-appointed \npositions and recommending to Congress which positions could be \neliminated. We are asking them to do it. Three, allowing Presidential \ncandidates to obtain a list of appointee positions 15 days after they \nreceive their party's nomination so they will have an idea of the kind \nof people they have to look for if they are elected President of the \nUnited States. And four, requiring the Office of Government Ethics to \nreview the conflict-of-interest laws.\n  The principles behind this amendment are simple, and given the \nbipartisan nature in which the original bill passed the Governmental \nAffairs Committee last Congress, I ask my colleagues to adopt this \namendment. Although it will not solve all the problems with the \nappointments process outlined in the 9/11 Commission report, the \namendment is an important first step for updating an outdated system.\n  I urge the Senate to support its adoption. Senator Lugar and I will \nbe working with Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman to try to obtain \ntheir support for this amendment and to also work out any of the \nproblems they may have with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Kansas is \nwaiting. I need to make a couple of very brief announcements, with the \nSenator's indulgence.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3731 to Amendment No. 3705\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have two amendments that have been \ncleared on both sides. Both of these amendments are second-degree \namendments to my underlying amendment No. 3705 regarding Homeland \nSecurity grants. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Inhofe-\nJeffords second-degree amendment No. 3731, which is at the desk, be \nconsidered and agreed to, with the motion to reconsider laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3731) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure the participation of the Under Secretary for \n   Emergency Preparedness and Response in the Threat-Based Homeland \n  Security Grant Program grant-making process for nonlaw enforcement \n                            related grants)\n\n       In section 406 of the amendment, redesignate subsections \n     (i) and (j) as subsections (j) and (k), respectively.\n       In section 406 of the amendment, insert after subsection \n     (h) the following:\n       (i) Participation of Under Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response.--\n       (1) Participation.--The Under Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response shall participate in the \n     grantmaking process for the Threat-Based Homeland Security \n     Grant Program for nonlaw enforcement-related grants in order \n     to ensure that preparedness grants where appropriate, are \n     consistent, and are not in conflict, with the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n       (2) Reports.--The Under Secretary for Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response shall submit to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n     Representatives an annual report that describes--\n       (A) the status of the Threat-Based Homeland Security Grant \n     Program; and\n       (B) the impact of that program on programs authorized under \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3732 to Amendment No. 3705\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nLevin second-degree amendment No. 3732, which is at the desk, now be \nconsidered and agreed to, with the motion to reconsider laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3732) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To give the Secretary of Homeland Security greater \n   flexibility in allocating funds for discretionary grants to local \n                              governments)\n\n       On page 36, strike lines 3 through 21, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 409.

Mr. President, I hope we can continue to work on the \nunderlying amendment with the goal of having a vote on it shortly. I \nalso want to announce to all of my colleagues that we do intend to vote \non Senator Specter's amendment tomorrow. I recognize there are a few \nSenators who have not been heard on it who desire to be heard, but we \ndo intend to conclude the debate and vote on Senator Specter's \namendment tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3731\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will never forget my visit to Ground \nZero. I hope that September 11 is an event that will never be repeated, \non any scale, in our country or anywhere in the world.\n  I share the goal of all my colleagues that our Nation be as prepared \nas possible, should such an event occur. However, in seeking to improve \nour capability to respond to terrorism, it is critical that we do not \nlose our capability to respond to natural disasters, which happen much \nmore frequently than terrorist events.\n  The Inhofe-Jeffords second degree amendment to the Collins' amendment \nwill ensure that as we seek to enhance our ability to respond to \nterrorist events, we do not lose our ability to respond to natural \ndisasters.\n  I thank my colleagues, the chair and ranking member of the Government \nAffairs Committee and Senator Carper, a cosponsor of the Collins \namendment for agreeing to accept this amendment.\n  The role of a first responder, whether responding to a terrorist \nevent or a natural disaster is, for the most part, the same. For \ndecades, the Federal, State, and local governments in this Nation have \npartnered together to plan, prepare, respond, and recover from both \nminor and major natural disasters.\n  We have a robust system for responding to these events, authorized \nthrough the Stafford Act and executed through FEMA. My home State of \nVermont has a long history with emergency management.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Bob Stafford of Vermont, served as \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee for many years \nand ushered the Stafford Act through Congress in 1974. The Stafford Act \nis the authorizing statute for emergency response activities at the \nFederal level, and it forms the basis for the emergency management \nsystem in this Nation. The Stafford Act gave structure to an emergency \nresponse process where virtually none existed in the past.\n  FEMA, which was formed in 1979 and incorporated into the Department \nof Homeland Security in the Homeland Security Act, is a robust agency, \nwith extensive experience in all-hazards planning, preparing, response, \nand recovery. It has a tradition of providing quick response to people \nin immediate need.\n  As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee during the \n107th Congress, I recognized the need to provide assistance to our \nfirst responders. I was struck during my visits to the Pentagon and the \nWorld Trade Center in particular at the inability of first responders \nto communicate with each other. To combat this and the other \nshortcomings we observed, I introduced S. 2664, the Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Act of 2003 with my colleague Senator Bob \nSmith. The EPW Committee reported that bill on June 27, 2002.\n\n  During this Congress, Senator Inhofe and I worked together to \nintroduce S. 930, the Emergency Preparedness and Response Act of 2003. \nThe EPW Committee reported that bill favorably on July 30, 2003, by \nvoice vote.\n  Before the formation of the Department of Homeland Security, I \nexpressed grave concerns about the proposal to incorporate FEMA into \nthe Department of Homeland Security. I was concerned at that time that \nthe robust agency we saw jumping every hurdle after September 11, 2001 \nto provide assistance to World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and to \nhundreds of natural disasters each year, would give way under the \npressure of the enormous bureaucracy of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and lose its ability to respond quickly and effectively to \ndisasters.\n  I remain concerned today. However, the administration prevailed and \nincorporated FEMA in DHS with the enactment of the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002.\n  Since the formation of DHS, FEMA has administered aid for 169 major \ndisasters, 29 emergency declarations, and 172 fire management \nassistance declarations--all natural disasters. That is 370 communities \nthat have received emergency assistance from the Federal Government and \nour Nation's first responders for natural disasters.\n  Over the last several weeks, we have seen record-breaking hurricanes \nrip through the southeast bringing high winds, flooding, tornadoes, and \nbeach erosion. In my home State of Vermont, we recently had a disaster \ndeclared for extensive flooding throughout the State.\n  The Inhofe-Jeffords second degree amendment ensures that FEMA, the \nagency responsible for administering our Nation's disaster response \nprograms, is involved in the distribution of funds to first responders \nand that grants made are consistent with the Stafford Act. This ensures \nthat we will not lose the level of preparedness and response that we \nhave seen at work in States like Florida over the last few weeks.\n  We obviously need to be prepared for the small percentage of the time \nwhen a terrorist event may occur, but we cannot ignore the day-to-day \noperations, which affect so many lives.\n  I thank my colleagues, the distinguished chair and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee as well as Senator Carper, a cosponsor of the Collins \namendment, for working with us to incorporate our second degree into \nthe underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending business be set aside and that the Foreign Relations Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nBrownback amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3728) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H. R. 4011), as amended, was read the third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \nwhat we are considering is something that has been negotiated \nextensively. It has passed the House of Representatives. It has been \nnegotiated extensively in the Foreign Relations Committee amongst the \nmembers interested. It is on the issue of North Korean human rights, or \nthe lack thereof, and U.S. policy.\n  This bill establishes for the first time--the first time in at least \na generation--a human rights principle toward North Korea. Everybody is \nfamiliar with the six-party talks that are going on regarding North \nKorea and nuclear weapons and the threatening nature of the North \nKorean Government, of its testing missiles, of it moving military \noperations to threaten people around the country, in South Korea, in \nJapan, and in particular the United States to give them direct aid to \nguarantee their security, and issues mostly surrounding the nuclear \nweapons development.\n  This bill brings into focus a United States Government position on \nNorth Korean human rights abuses, which are extensive, probably the \nworst human rights abuses in the world. It is at least in the top two \nor three, and that is saying something when you consider what is taking \nplace in the Sudan and Iran.\n  North Korea lost 10 percent of its population in the last 10 years to \nstarvation. We think they have something\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\naround 150,000 people, maybe more, in the gulag system, political \nprisoners. There is trafficking of individuals taking place within that \ncountry. They are counterfeiting money. They are drug running. They are \ngunrunning. This is a criminal enterprise that is taking place.\n  This bill deals with the human rights issues. It brings it front and \ncenter. The bill requires a report to be issued. It requires the \nSecretary of State to put forward a person of high distinction to press \nthe human rights agenda, and we hope to get the issue of human rights \nin North Korea elevated to the same level or in the level with the \ntalks in the six-party system.\n  The North Korean Government, when it talks about nuclear weapons \ndevelopment, will bluster and talk a great deal and say they need to be \nable to do this and they are threatening, but when you raise the issue \nof human rights, they go silent because there is no response to the \nshame of what they have done to their own people.\n  We are elevating this issue and making clear the United States \nGovernment position on the issue of human rights in North Korea. This \nis a very important bill. I am delighted we passed it this evening.\n  I wanted to give that brief explanation of this bill as it moves \nthrough the process, now to go back to the House and to the President.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine for yielding the floor and giving me \nthis time. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9806-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Nathan E. Stahl\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man who grew up \nin Highland, IN. PFC Nathan E. Stahl, 20 years old, died on September \n21, when the vehicle he was riding in was struck by a homemade roadside \nbomb in Iraq. With his entire life before him, Nathan chose to risk \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  A Highland native, Nathan graduated from Highland High School in \n2003, and joined the Army shortly thereafter. Nathan was assigned to \nthe 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit \nbased in Fort Lewis, WA. Due to the nature of Nathan's assignments, he \nwas never able to disclose exactly where he had been or where he was \ngoing to his family and friends. Despite these hardships, loved ones \nsay Nathan was living his dream by serving his country. The last time \nNathan saw his family was 3 months ago when he visited them for 9 days \nduring a period of authorized leave. Nathan faced his frequent \ndeployments willingly and fought bravely before sacrificing his life \nfor the worthy cause of freedom.\n  Nathan was the 35th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his mother, Towina; his father; his stepfather, Rodney; and his \ntwo sisters, Nichol and Abigail.\n  Today, I join Nathan's family, his friends and all Americans in \nmourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this \ntremendous loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nNathan, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  Nathan was known for his dedicated spirit and his love of country. \nAccording to family and friends, joining the Armed Forces was something \nNathan had wanted to do since he was a young boy. His mother, Towina, \ntold the Times of Northwest Indiana that she remembers Nathan at 13 \ninsisting that they visit an Army recruiter. He joined the Army only 6 \nyears later. Aside from being a soldier, Nathan enjoyed weight lifting \nand working on cars. Today and always, Nathan will be remembered by \nfamily members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, \nand we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Nathan's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Nathan's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Nathan E. Stahl in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Nathan's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Nathan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9806-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9806-S9807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OFHEO'S INVESTIGATION OF FANNIE MAE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight's, OFHEO, findings-to-date report on its ``Special \nExamination of Fannie Mae'' is deeply troubling. It raises serious \ndoubts about the ability of Fannie Mae's management to correct the \nsafety and soundness problems at Fannie Mae. What is most troubling is \nthat OFHEO had to use subpoenas in order to conduct its congressionally \nauthorized investigation of Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae's resistance to \ncooperate with this investigation is unacceptable.\n  Based on the findings in OFHEO's report, it is clear why OFHEO's \nrequests were repeatedly rebuffed by a stonewall of silence and why \nFannie Mae's management insisted on keeping its financial operations in \na black box. OFHEO's report shows among other things that Fannie Mae's \ntop management indulged in a windfall of bonuses after it improperly \nmanipulated the company's annual earnings. If these actions are found \nto be deliberately linked, then the board of Fannie Mae needs to take \nappropriate action and address the problem, just as the board of \nFreddie Mac did last year.\n  The boards of both GSEs have a fiduciary responsibility to their \nshareholders and the public to ensure that\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\nany improper actions by management are dealt with swiftly and \naccordingly. The confidence in the GSEs has a direct impact on the \nstability of the American economy. The American people and the markets \nmust have confidence in the operations of the congressionally chartered \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  We need to build upon legislation that several of my colleagues and I \nintroduced last year. The Senate Banking Committee passed a watered \ndown version of our legislation, but it is clear from OFHEO's findings \nthat it is not adequate. To prevent these serious actions from \noccurring, the new GSE regulator must have at a minimum the same powers \nand resources as those of other financial regulators such as the \nFederal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and \nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n  House Banking Subcommittee Chairman Richard Baker has scheduled a \nhearing next week to examine the problems at Fannie Mae. There are \nstill too many unanswered questions and I look forward to seeing the \nresults of the House hearing. Given the frequency of the accounting \nproblems, pattern of manipulation and questionable management actions \nat both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Congress can no longer look the \nother way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9807-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BOYS & GIRLS CLUB OF AMERICA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I know firsthand how well Boys & \nGirls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are. When I was a \nprosecutor in Vermont, I was convinced of the great need for Boys & \nGirls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from these kinds of \nprograms. In fact, after I became a U.S. Senator, a police chief was \nsuch a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys & Girls Club in his \ndistrict rather than helping him get a couple more police officers.\n  In Vermont, Boys & Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime and \nsupporting our children. The first club was established in Burlington \n62 years go. Now we have 20 club sites operating throughout the State \nin Addison, Chittenden, Orange, Rutland, Washington, Windham and \nWindsor Counties. There are also four new Boys & Girls Clubs in the \nworks in Winooski, Brattleboro, Barre and Vergennnes. These clubs will \nserve well over 10,000 kids statewide.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have \npushed for more Federal funding for Boys & Girls Clubs. Since 1998, \nCongress has increased Federal support for Boys & Girls Clubs from $20 \nmillion to $80 million in this year. Due in large part to this increase \nin funding, there now exist 3,300 Boys & Girls Clubs in all 50 States \nserving more than 3.6 million young people. Because of these successes, \nI was both surprised and disappointed to see that the President \nrequested a reduction of $20 million for fiscal year 2005. That request \nwill leave thousands of children and their clubs behind and we cannot \nallow such a thing to happen.\n\n  In the 107th Congress, Senator Hatch and I worked together to pass \nthe 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct, which included a provision to reauthorize Justice Department \ngrants to establish new Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. By authorizing \n$80 million in DOJ grants for each of the fiscal years through 2005, we \nsought to establish 1,200 additional Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. \nThis was to bring the number of Boys & Girls Clubs to 4,000, serving no \nless than 5 million young people.\n  The bill the House will pass today builds upon this: We authorize \nJustice Department grants at $80 million for fiscal year 2006, $85 \nmillion for fiscal year 2007, $90 million for fiscal year 2008, $95 \nmillion for fiscal year 2009 and $100 million for fiscal year 2010 to \nBoys & Girls Clubs to help establish 1,500 additional Boys & Girls \nClubs across the Nation with the goal of having 5,000 Boys & Girls \nClubs in operation by December 31, 2010.\n  If we had a Boys & Girls Club in every community, prosecutors in our \ncountry would have a lot less work to do because of the values that are \nbeing instilled in children from the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \nEach time I visit a club in Vermont, I am approached by parents, \neducators, teachers, grandparents and law enforcement officers who tell \nme ``Keep doing this!

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nagricultural disaster assistance package that was included in the \nSenate Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Many farmers and ranchers \nin my home State of South Dakota are suffering from their third, fourth \nand even fifth year of drought. As House and Senate differences are \nreconciled, I urge the conferees to retain the important disaster \nprovisions that were approved on such a wide bipartisan basis in the \nSenate.\n  The drought provisions I supported, along with Senator Daschle, will \nhelp farmers and ranchers survive a severe drought. While I would have \nhoped producers wouldn't be faced with a choice for assistance for \neither 2003 or 2004, I understand that money is short in these times of \nsoaring budget deficits. The Senate disaster assistance plan will \nprovide almost $2.9 billion to farmers and ranchers across the country \nwho are suffering from agricultural disaster. The $475 million for the \nLivestock Assistance Program, in addition to the $2.464 billion for the \nCrop Disaster Program, are critical to my State.\n  This drought package was introduced by my colleagues, Senator Baucus \nand Senator Burns, and with the help of Senator Daschle it was added as \nan amendment to the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security funding bill by \na voice vote. A voice vote reflects the overwhelming bipartisan support \nthis drought aid package has. It is frustrating that there are members \nof the House majority party who would reduce or even eliminate disaster \naid funding for ailing farmers and ranchers, or choose to gut other \ncrucial agricultural programs to pay for this necessary assistance.\n  In 2002, Senator Daschle and I proposed a $6 billion drought package, \nwhich was opposed by the President and some Members of the House. That \npackage was pared down to $3 billion before its passage. The current \npackage is very similar to the package that was approved for the 2001-\n2002 drought. Thanks to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nincluding Senator Daschle's efforts to secure an opportunity to address \nthis issue, we have a\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\ndrought package that will allow many family farmers and ranchers to \nstay in business through this extensive drought.\n  Over 23 groups expressed their support for the disaster assistance \nprovisions in the Homeland Security funding bill for fiscal year 2005 \nat the beginning of this week, including the National Farmers Union, \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, and \nNational Association of Wheat Growers, to name a few.

Mr. President, I rise in recognition of \nOctober as Spina Bifida Awareness Month.\n  Spina bifida is the Nation's most common, permanently disabling birth \ndefect. It is a neural tube defect that occurs when the central nervous \nsystem does not properly close during the early stages of pregnancy. \nEach year more than 4,000 pregnancies are affected and of these 1,500 \nbabies are born with spina bifida. The most severe form of spina bifida \noccurs in 96 percent of children born with this disease. However, \nthanks to the good work that the Spina Bifida Association of America is \ncarrying out to promote prevention and to enhance the lives of all \naffected by this condition, substantial progress is being made.\n  During Spina Bifida Awareness Month, a special effort is made to \nincrease public awareness about spina bifida and its prevention. Simply \nby taking a daily dose of the B vitamin, folic acid, women of \nchildbearing age have the power to reduce the incidence of spina bifida \nby up to 75 percent. Recent studies by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC, show that 40 percent of women of childbearing age \nnow report taking a vitamin containing folic acid every day. In \naddition, since the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, decision to \nfortify enriched grains with folic acid, CDC has documented a 26 \npercent decline in these birth defects. These simple changes that \nproduce profound effects clearly demonstrate the importance of \nawareness.\n  In addition to educating the public about spina bifida, the Spina \nBifida Association of America also addresses the needs of the spina \nbifida community. Founded in 1973, the association is the only national \norganization solely dedicated to advocating on behalf of the spina \nbifida community. Today, there are approximately 60 chapters serving \nover 125 communities nationwide.\n  I am honored to support the Spina Bifida Association and wish to \ncommend them for all of their hard work to prevent and reduce suffering \nfrom this birth defect. I greatly appreciate their efforts to improve \nthe lives of those 70,000 individuals living with spina bifida \nthroughout our country. I wish the Spina Bifida Association of America \nthe best of luck in its endeavors and urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the association's efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9808-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             KARA SHERIDAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Miss Kara \nSheridan, the granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs. Carl White of Ludlowe, KY. \nMiss Sheridan is a most extraordinary young lady. As I speak, Miss \nSheridan is representing the United States of America at the 2004 \nParalympic Games. The Paralympic Games are the biggest competition in \nthe world for athletes with a disability.\n  Miss Sheridan earned the honor of competing in the paralympics \nthrough hard work, perseverance and a spirit of hope. I believe that it \nis these three virtues which have also earned her a right to a place of \nhonor here on the Senate floor and in the hearts of her countrymen. She \nhas risen above the challenges posed by ostogenesis imperfecta, a rare \ngenetic condition that she was born with, and showed the world that \nperseverance and hope will always be rewarded.\n  Kara's achievements have come in many different forms throughout the \nyears. They include graduating from Wright State University magna cum \nlaude last year, participating in competitive swimming events, serving \non committees through the National Youth with Disabilities Council, and \nbeing awarded a scholarship to work on her master's degree from the \nUniversity of Miami. But the greatest honor that Kara has earned is the \naccomplishment of a hope so great that it seems nothing can deter her.\n  Miss Sheridan has shown to America and to the world what it looks \nlike to habitually do the right thing by hoping. Thanks to Miss \nSheridan, we have already been reminded of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9808-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF COLEEN JARVIS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my honor to speak in memory \nof the late Coleen Jarvis, Vice Mayor of the City of Chico and strong \nadvocate for women, children, and the less fortunate. She will always \nbe remembered for her love of family, politics and the people whom she \nserved so ably.\n  Coleen Jarvis dedicated her time and energy to improving her \ncommunity. She fought to improve conditions for women, children, and \nthe homeless. Coleen served as coordinate for the local rape crisis \ncenter and worked at Legal Services of Northern California, giving \nlegal aid to those in need. ``The community of Chico lost a \nresourceful, energetic, dedicated and smart leader in the too-soon \ndeath of Council Member Coleen Jarvis.'' said Butte County Supervisor \nJane Doaln. ``I first met Coleen when she worked on behalf of victims \nof rape and we continued our friendship and shared work on behalf of \nour loved community in many venues. Coleen had a deep commitment and \nworked very hard to improve our community and to remind us of our \nrightful duty to recognize and resolve the needs of the poor. We all \nwere better representatives due to her efforts. She is sorely missed.''\n  Coleen became an important community leader through her hard work. \nShe was elected to the Chico City Council in 1966, and served almost 8 \nyears. As a council member, she continued to fight for her progressive \nvalues. She was passionate about the issues and people she held dear. \nShe was known by her colleagues and friends as a giving person who \npossessed great integrity, drive, intellect, and wit with an energy and \nspirit that drove her to fight for what she believed in. Chico Mayor \nMaureen Kirk reflected, ``Coleen was a public servant full of \nintegrity, passion, commitment, empathy, inclusion, tolerance, and \nintelligence. Her legacy is the Torres Community Homeless Shelter, the \nfirst step in her quest to find a solution for homelessness. Coleen \nwill be sorely missed. In her 46 years, she accomplished more than 99 \npercent of us would accomplish in twice as many years.\n  Coleen Jarvis committed her life to her family and the world around \nher. She touched the lives of many, and her impact on her community \nwill be long remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9808-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9808-S9809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 POLISH DAILY NEWS CELEBRATES 100 YEARS\n\n   Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \ncongratulate the Polish Daily News, Inc., which celebrates its 100th \nanniversary of publishing the Polish Weekly. On Saturday, October 2, \n2004 the Polish community will celebrate this milestone at the American \nPolish Cultural Center in Troy. The Polish Weekly is a wonderful \nresource for the Polish-American community, providing a wealth of \ninformation on local issues as well as news from Poland.\n  Poles are the second largest immigrant ethnic group in Michigan. They \nhave thrived in communities throughout our State and continue to \nmaintain a strong connection to their rich heritage. Polish immigrants \nestablished\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\nthemselves throughout Michigan in great numbers towards the end of the \n19th century. In the pursuit of a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies, they settled in Polonias, or Polish neighborhoods. Many \narrived in search of job opportunities in our great automotive \nindustry. By 1904, Polish Americans were the largest and one of the \nmost influential ethnic groups in Detroit. By 1920, they made up nearly \none-fifth of Detroit's population. Polish people have enriched \nMichigan's culture and made metro Detroit a better place to live.\n  There were many institutions important to this growing immigrant \npopulation including cultural organizations, churches and the Polish \nAmerican press. The Polish Daily News has played a significant role in \nthis history, devoting itself to sustaining Polish culture and language \nand connecting the immigrant community to the political, cultural and \nsocial life of America.\n  I am delighted to have the opportunity to congratulate the Polish \nDaily News on reaching this significant 100-year milestone. \nGratulacje!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9809-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MS. TAMARA BRICKMAN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a special \nindividual who has been serving the great State of Oregon for years. \nTamara Brickman, a legislative coordinator at the Oregon Employment \nDepartment, is devoted to improving the lives of Oregonians by \nincreasing the efficiency of the State government and improving the \nquality of workforce training. Her knowledge of State and Federal labor \nlaws is expansive and impressive. My staff and I rely on her expertise \nfrequently when addressing workforce legislation in Congress.\n  Ms. Brickman is a native Oregonian, the fourth generation of her \nfamily to live in a small town named La Grande, not far from my \nhometown of Pendleton in the northeast corner of the State. She is a \ngraduate of Eastern Oregon University and a former intern of my \nesteemed predecessor in the Senate, Senator Mark Hatfield. According to \nMs. Brickman, it was in Senator Hatfield's office that her true passion \nfor public service blossomed.\n  Ms. Brickman began her career working for Oregonians as a teacher in \nLa Grande at an alternative high school and a job training facility for \nindividuals receiving public assistance. In January 1993, Ms. Brickman \ntook a job in the Senate Ethics, Elections, and Campaign Finance Reform \nCommittee of the Oregon State Legislature. In fact, Ms. Brickman served \nas a staffer in the Oregon Capitol when I carried my first bill on the \nSenate floor as an Oregon State Senator.\n  Before heading to law school at the University of Oregon, Ms. \nBrickman furthered her strong reputation in workforce training by \nrunning a federally-funded youth summer employment training program in \nUnion County in 1994 and 1995. The training program was part of the Job \nTraining Partnership Act, JTPA, now known as the Workforce Investment \nAct. Ms. Brickman taught disadvantaged youth in job skills and then \nfound community job placements for those students in local businesses.\n  After passing the Oregon State bar in 1998, Ms. Brickman held a range \nof legislative positions for a State senator, member of the U.S. House \nof Representatives, and the Oregon University System Chancellor's \noffice. For the last 3 years, Ms. Brickman has gone above and beyond \nthe call of duty at the Oregon Employment Department to help members of \nour congressional delegation pass unemployment extension benefits and \nfiscal state relief. Ms. Brickman never fails to share important \ninformation about the state of the workforce in ways that allow me to \ncraft timely legislation that responds to our State's needs. Her \ncommitment to Oregon's workers and families shines through in her \noutstanding work.\n  There are thousands of dedicated State and local government employees \nacross the country who serve their communities with the highest \ndistinction. In my opinion, few could match the professionalism of Ms. \nBrickman. It is my honor and pleasure to take the time today to \nrecognize Ms. Tamara Brickman for her dedication to Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9809-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BALLOON FIESTA--CHARACTER COUNTS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the good \nthat occurs when a community joins together. This relates to a \nwonderful program I have been proud to promote in New Mexico for the \npast 10 years--Character Counts--and the support it gets from the \nbusiness community.\n  We have had troubling and disappointing news over the past few years \nabout corporate scandals and questionable ethics in the corporate \nworld. So it is with great pleasure to be able to discuss a story about \nresponsible and caring business behavior.\n  For the fourth straight year, Northrop Grumman has teamed with other \nlocal organizations to help at-risk youth experience the Albuquerque \nInternational Balloon Fiesta.\n  On October 7 through 8, eight elementary-age students in the \nCharacter Counts education program run through the Albuquerque YMCA and \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho will be treated \nto a field trip to the Balloon Fiesta courtesy of the Northrop Grumman \nand its partners--Meals on Wheels and the Albuquerque International \nBalloon Fiesta organization. The children and their chaperones will be \ntreated to tethered balloon rides and generally feted throughout the \nday as special guests.\n  Now, this is more than just a simple do-good action by a major \ncorporation. For these children it is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure \nlinked to the Character Counts education program that builds into their \nlives the benefits of Respect, Responsibility, Trustworthiness, \nCitizenship, Fairness, and Caring. These are the six pillars of good \ncharacter.\n  The Balloon Fiesta outing is a joint effort by these companies and \norganizations with the Albuquerque Character Counts Cooperative. We \nknow these trips impact these children's lives. It is not only a reward \nfor excelling at Character Counts, but also an entertaining way for \nthem to broaden their horizons, meet community leaders and have a \nballooning experience they might not have otherwise ever experienced.\n  Character Counts is an incredibly successful character education \ninitiative. We are celebrating its 10-year history in New Mexico and \nthese annual balloon fiesta field trips for outstanding students are a \nkey component to helping youth become inspired by adults who are role \nmodels of the Character Counts pillars.\n  So I express my appreciation to the team of businesses and groups who \nhave helped make the overall Character Counts program a success in New \nMexico. In particular, I am pleased with Northrup Grumman, the YMCA, \nthe Boys and Girls Clubs, Meals on Wheels and Albuquerque International \nBalloon Fiesta for broadening the horizons for children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9809-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9809-S9810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING MARGARET (PEG) CURTIN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish a happy 70th birthday to an \noutstanding citizen and dear friend, Peg Curtin.\n  Peg was one of my earliest and strongest supporters when I first ran \nfor Congress in 1974. Peg's family and mine have been close since the \n1950s, when my father served in the House and then in the U.S. Senate.\n  For nearly three decades, Peg has compiled an outstanding record of \npublic and community service in Connecticut. She has truly given her \nheart and soul to the people of our State.\n  From 1974 to 1977, Peg was a union organizer for the American \nFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and a member of \nthe international staff of the AFL-CIO. In 1975, she was part of the \ntransition team of one of our State's most beloved Governors, the late \nElla T. Grasso. That year, Peg also began the first of 4 years as a \nmember of the New London City Council, including one year as the city's \nmayor. Among her many accomplishments was the development and \nimplementation of New London's first-ever affirmative action plan.\n  From 1979 to 1996, Peg devoted her time and energy to the State of \nConnecticut. For 12 years, she served as under secretary at the Office \nof Policy and Management's Division of Intergovernmental Relations. \nThere, her talents enabled her to handle a demanding and diverse array \nof tasks,\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\nfrom state labor negotiations to emergency assistance during natural \ndisasters. Peg then went on to manage labor relations for 6 years at \nthe University of Connecticut Health Center. She retired in 1996 after \nonce again winning a seat on the New London City Council, an office she \ncontinues to hold today.\n  Peg Curtin's public service is not limited to her official duties. \nShe has been involved in numerous charitable causes. There are far too \nmany for me to list here on the floor, but I will just mention a few: \nthe Connecticut Special Olympics, the American Red Cross, and the March \nof Dimes. It is only fitting that at tonight's celebration of Peg's \nbirthday, the proceeds for the events will benefit two of the causes \nabout which Peg cares so deeply--the New London Youth Organization and \nthe New London Parks Conservancy.\n  We in Connecticut are lucky to have Peg Curtin working on our behalf. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that our State is a better place today \nbecause of her efforts. I am privileged to call her my friend, and I \ntruly admire her commitment to service, charity, and community. It is \nmy pleasure to wish Peg a very happy birthday, and to send her my best \nwishes for many, many more wonderful years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9810-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        WALTER S. SMITH, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Chief \nJudge Walter S. Smith, Jr., of the Western District of Texas. Judge \nSmith has dedicated his life to public service and justice, and I am \npleased to commend him on his 20th anniversary on the Federal bench.\n  Judge Smith was born on October 25, 1940, to Dr. Walter S. Smith and \nMary Elizabeth Smith. He grew up in the central Texas town of Marlin. \nHe attended Baylor University where he received his bachelor of arts \nand his juris doctorate. While in law school, Judge Smith was editor of \nthe law review and served as president of the Phi Delta Phi law \nfraternity.\n  Judge Smith began his legal career in private practice in Waco, TX. \nIn 1979, he was appointed by Gov. Bill Clements to the 54th Judicial \nDistrict Court of McLennan County. Shortly thereafter, Judge Smith was \nappointed U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Texas.\n  In 1984, Senator John Tower recommended Judge Smith for an \nappointment to the Federal bench. President Ronald Reagan nominated him \nfor the position and he received a unanimous Senate confirmation on \nOctober 4, 1984. Judge Smith was sworn into office on October 6, 1984, \nand has served since then as the first and only resident United States \nDistrict Judge in the Waco Division. Judge Smith was elevated to the \nposition of chief Judge of the Western District of Texas on June 1, \n2003, a position he continues to hold.\n  During his legal career, Judge Smith has remained a member of the \nTexas Bar Association, the Texas Bar Foundation, the McLennan County \nBar Association, and the American Judicature Society.\n  In addition to being admitted to practice in the State of Texas, \nJudge Smith was also admitted to practice in Federal district courts \nfor the Western District of Texas, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand the United States Supreme Court. Judge Smith is particularly proud \nof his participation in the formation of the Abner V. McCall American \nInns of Court, for which he served as the first president.\n  During his years on the Federal bench, Judge Smith has traveled \nthroughout the Western and other Districts of Texas. In addition to \nWaco, he has held court in Austin, San Antonio, Pecos, El Paso, \nMidland, Laredo, Corpus Christi and Forth Worth.\n  Judge Smith is married to the former Brenda Derting. They have two \ndaughters, five granddaughters, and two grandsons. He is an ordained \nelder in the First Presbyterian Church and has been actively involved \nin church activities and community service.\n  During his career, Judge Smith has demonstrated the dedication and \npatience we seek on our judges. He is respected for his fairness and \ncommitment to justice. Judge Smith has been asked to make rulings on \nmany difficult cases throughout the years and has risen to the many \nchallenges with poise and dignity. His knowledge of the law and \nexperience make him a great judge. His dedication to his community and \nto the rule of law make him a remarkable public servant. I thank him \nfor his 20 years on the Federal bench in the Western District of \nTexas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9810-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bill was ordered referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 3428.

A bill to amend the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to establish \ncertain conditions under which a Farm Credit System institution can \nterminate its status as a System institution; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\n                                S. 2851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF FARM CREDIT SYSTEM STATUS.\n\n       Section 7.10 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C. \n     2279d) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Conditions for Certain Termination.--Notwithstanding \n     subsections (a) and (b), if the Farm Credit Administration \n     Board receives an official notification that a Farm Credit \n     System institution seeks to terminate its status as a System \n     institution, the Farm Credit Administration--\n       ``(1) shall hold not less than 1 public meeting or hearing \n     in each of the States served, as of the date of receipt of \n     the notification, by the institution; and\n       ``(2) shall not approve or disapprove the termination of \n     the institution as a System institution under subsection \n     (a)(2) until on or after the date that is 180 days after the \n     date of receipt of the notification.''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill I am \ncosponsoring with Senator Daschle. This important piece of legislation \nwould affect the way the Farm Credit Administration, FCA, handles any \npossible sale of one of its member institutions. This bill would \nrequire the FCA to hold hearings in all the States affected by the \nsale, which is what my good colleague from South Dakota and I have been \nadvocating since the time this proposed termination was announced. \nAdditionally, the bill would prohibit the FCA from approving the \ntermination plan no earlier than 6 months after the initial proposal is \nsubmitted. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation with Senator \nDaschle as it will give the Farm Credit System, FCS, and affected \nparties adequate time to discern long-term implications and \nconsequences of the possible sale of an FCS institution.\n  This bill is very timely, in that Rabobank, a Dutch bank, has made a \nbid to purchase Farm Credit Services of America, a Farm Credit System \nmember bank. This transaction is moving ahead at a rapid pace without \nany hearings in the affected region of the country which happens to \ninclude my home State of South Dakota. One of my greatest concerns \nabout the operation of the FCS is for farmers and ranchers to have the \nability to ask questions about the transaction and decide if it is in \ntheir best interest to allow the transaction to occur. We must ensure \nthat producers will always be able to have access to affordable credit, \nand that they are well-informed before they are obligated to vote on \nthe potential termination of the Farm Credit Services of America, FCSA.\n  The Farm Credit System has been in operation in the United States for \n88 years and has been serving farmers well. The system was formed to \nallow farmers and ranchers easy access to credit for purchases that are \nfundamental to their day-to-day operations. Given the myriad of \nchallenges producers face in our agricultural communities across \nAmerica, I am greatly concerned that this acquisition would place yet \nanother burden on our ranchers and farmers. I am fully committed to \nensuring our producers have adequate access to reliable credit, and \nsupport this legislation as a means to achieve that goal. I am hopeful \nthat my Senate colleagues will support this commonsense and imperative \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lugar, \n        Mr. Miller, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Sessions, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Talent, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2852. A bill to provide assistance to Special Olympics to support \nexpansion of Special Olympics and development of education programs and \na Healthy Athletes Program, and for other purposes; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Special \nOlympics Sports Empowerment Act. I am very pleased that Senator Reid \nhas joined me in introducing this legislation to authorize $15 million \nfor Special Olympics programs. We are also joined by 31 other \ncosponsors, both Republican and Democrat, conservative, moderate, and \nliberal, demonstrating the wide range of support for this legislation.\n  According to the World Health Organization, there are 170 million \nindividuals with mental retardation worldwide. Up to 7 million of these \nindividuals live in the United States. Unfortunately, these individuals \ntend to have much shorter lives--by 10-20 years--in most countries. In \ndeveloped countries, there is still significant preventable morbidity, \npain and suffering. This population is also generally underemployed, \nstigmatized and many experience violence or abuse at some point in \ntheir lives.\n  Thirty-six years ago, Mrs. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who had already \nbeen working for years with individuals with intellectual disabilities, \nfounded Special Olympics. In July 1968, Special Olympics held its first \ngames in Chicago, hosting 1,000 athletes. Over the years, Special \nOlympics has continued to serve many individuals with intellectual \ndisabilities around the world by providing year-round sports training \nand competitive opportunities. Special Olympics now serves over 1.5 \nmillion individuals with intellectual disabilities, their families and \ncommunities.\n  Special Olympics recognizes the value and dignity of every life. As \nwell as providing children and adults with intellectual disabilities \nwith the opportunity of athletic training and competition, these \nprograms provide participants with health screenings using the donated \ntime of voluntary health care providers. In addition, they help to \nimprove awareness throughout the world of the abilities and unique \ncontributions that individuals with intellectual disabilities can make, \nthus helping to dispel negative stereotypes.\n  The Special Olympics Sports Empowerment Act will aid an organization \nthat is already hard at work in assisting and providing affirmation to \nthese individuals and their families. It does this by, for the first \ntime, authorizing funding for Special Olympics over 5 years. It \nauthorizes $15 million in fiscal year 2005, and such sums as necessary \neach year through fiscal year 2009. This bill recognizes the success \nSpecial Olympics has had, will ensure that their funding is more \nstable, and will help Special Olympics to continue to increase the \nnumber of athletes and families they serve each year.\n  I am pleased to be sponsoring this legislation and to have the \nsupport of so many of my colleagues. I am hopeful that the Senate and \nHouse will act to pass this legislation during the 108th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2855. A bill to amend chapter 25 of title 18, United States Code, \nto create a general provision similar to provisions found in chapter 47 \nof such title, to provide for criminal penalties for the act of forging \nFederal documents; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the recent CBS incident involving the \nrecord of President Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard \nsheds light on the need for a Federal statute generally criminalizing \nthe forgery of Federal Government documents. I believe that when it \ncomes to crimes involving the fabrication of Federal documents or \nwritings, the Federal Government has an obligation to step in and show \nthe offenders there are serious consequences.\n  Many experts initially doubted the authenticity of the memos in \nquestion, which negatively and falsely characterized President Bush's \ntime in the Texas Air National Guard. We now believe these memos were \ncreated on a modern word processing computer rather than the 1970-era \ntypewriter, as alleged in the original CBS story.\n  LTC Jerry Killian was George Bush's commanding officer during his \nservice in Vietnam. Unfortunately, Lieutenant Colonel Killian died in \n1984 and therefore he could not defend his records that he so \naccurately discussed at that time about the quality of service of our \nPresident.\n  I would say this, though: That Colonel Killian's secretary Marion \nKnox typed all of his correspondence between the years 1956 and 1979. \nReferring to the memos in question, she said, ``I know I didn't type \n'em'.''\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\n  She was very clear. She didn't qualify it. She said, ``I know I \ndidn't type 'em'.''\n  It is clear that the documents CBS shared with American voters were \nmore than suspect. After the fact--since CBS cannot verify its \nreporting--I am pleased to see that CBS has belatedly retracted its \nstory.\n  We also now know that the Kerry campaign was aware CBS was planning \nto air the story 4 or 5 days before it was aired, while the White House \ndid not know about the airing of this story until the eve of the story \nbreaking. That shows an obvious bias. I don't think anyone can deny it.\n  President Bush stands by his honorable service in the Air National \nGuard. He should not have to worry about the threat of nefarious and \npetty efforts to defame his character.\n  I appreciated Dan Rather's words: ``I want to say personally and \ndirectly I am sorry,'' but saying I am sorry just doesn't cut it.\n  Under much pressure, CBS has appointed an independent panel to \ninvestigate its reporting of the President's service in the Texas Air \nNational Guard. I understand this panel is to be headed by former \nAttorney General Dick Thornburg and former Associated Press chief \nexecutive and former Pennsylvania Governor Lou Boccardi.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues from the House of Representatives \nwho were dismayed that CBS, a network that should be responsible for \nreporting objective news, involved itself in a campaign that misled the \npublic and slandered the President. Therefore, I am proposing \nlegislation to criminalize this type of action in general. Most people \nbelieve there is already a statute on the books that would have this \ncriminalized.\n  After learning of the CBS scandal, I was curious about the penalty. I \nfigured there had to be one for the forgery of Federal documents. In \nseeking the answer to this question, I called the Department of \nJustice. Their congressional relations office promptly responded: ``It \ndepends.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that communication be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Justice Department stated that similar \ncases were often charged under the general sections of the fraud and \nfalse statements chapter of the United States Criminal Code. Those \nsections have proven quite useful to the prosecutors at the Department \nof Justice.\n  I learned of a loophole in the existing law regarding forgery and \nfalse statements. I learned there are no general sections of the United \nStates Criminal Code for forgery in counterfeiting as there are in the \nother cases. Officials from the Department of Justice noted the absence \nof a general stand-alone statute that criminalizes the actions of those \nwho would forge documents of the Federal Government, regardless of the \nend they seek to achieve or what these documents are. Currently, the \nprosecution of such actions depends completely on the context and how \nforged documents were the means to an end.\n\n  Chapter 25 of title 18 of the United States Code addresses various \noffenses in counterfeiting and forgery. The current 45 sections of the \ncounterfeiting and forgery chapter essentially fall into four broad \ncategories.\n  This is very important, because if forgery takes place and they do \nnot fall into one of these four categories, then there is no penalty \ninvolved: No. 1, financial obligations. Obviously, this is not such a \ncase; No. 2, military and naval discharge certificates; No. 3, \ntransportation matters and motor vehicle documents; and No. 4, the \nseals of agencies, including courts, departments, and other agencies.\n  What we are saying is, if it doesn't fall into forgery, it doesn't \nfall into one of these four categories; there is no general statute \nthat would offer a penalty.\n  The legislative history of the 45 sections of the counterfeiting and \nforgery chapter indicate that the sections were enacted piecemeal \nwithout a unifying, overarching section. If forgery takes place but \ndoes not fall into one of these sections, there is no penalty.\n  Chapter 47 of title 18 of the United States Code regarding the fraud \nand false statements chapter also contains disparate sections enacted \npiecemeal.\n  In contrast, however, the fraud and false statements chapter does \nhave an overarching section, section 1001, that unifies its disparate, \npiecemeal parts as contrasted to the forgery statute.\n  In light of the recent situation involving President Bush's record, \nthese broad, disparate sections need to include, in general, the \nfabrication of Federal writings or memos.\n  In speaking with officials from the Department of Justice, I have \nalso become aware of concerns over whether the existing statute \nregarding fraud, 18 USCS 1001, can be used in this CBS incident. \nChapter 47 on fraud and false statements specifically condemns false \nstatements but only those with the intent to defraud the Federal \nGovernment. Again, this is talking about fraud and false statements, \nnot the forgery statute.\n  There are questions as to whether the ``intent to defraud the United \nStates or any agency thereof'' is applicable or whether it could \nsuccessfully be argued that instead it was the voters of the United \nStates who were initially defrauded, distinguishing in certain fashion \nthe ``United States'' from voters or the like.\n  These concerns validate the need to criminalize the specific act of \nforging Federal documents. Technically, in the CBS incident, it could \nbe argued that the forged Federal document did not monetarily or \notherwise tangibly take away from the Federal Government. I would argue \nthat it did harm the Federal Government by infringing on the Federal \nGovernment's copyright on its work. It certainly did affect millions of \nAmericans by giving them a false and misleading impression about a \nPresidential candidate. But it needs to be clarified.\n  As placed under chapter 25 of title 18, my bill would criminalize \ngeneral forgery of Federal Government documents, including those that \ncharacterize or purport to characterize official Federal activity, \nservice, contract, obligation, duty, or property.\n  If someone attempts to forge in the name of an official of the \nFederal Government a document or memo that addresses an official \nGovernment duty or act, that person should be held accountable. There \nneeds to be a Federal law prohibiting such forgery generally so \nprosecution of the same does not fall through the cracks.\n  Currently, there is no catchall section to address all forged Federal \nwritings, such as a vote from one official to another about a Federal \nservice.\n  I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and I honor those who \nserve in the National Guard. Not only has the CBS incident resulted in \nslander to the honorable National Guard service of President Bush, it \nalso highlights the risk of the records of other military service \nmembers and, moreover, all Federal servants governmentwide alike.\n  A civil servant at the General Services Administration, which the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee which I chair has to oversee, is \nequally deserving of being protected from a forgery of his or her work \nrecords. Right now there is no section in the forgery chapter of the \nUnited States Code that specifically addresses protection for General \nServices Administration personnel. This omission is a problem we must \ncorrect.\n  My legislation also includes language to condemn those who, knowingly \nor negligently failing to know, transmit or present any such forged \nFederal writing or record which characterizes official Federal \nactivities or service. This general criminalization of publishing \nforged documents follows existing provisions of the forgery code. If a \nmajor news network broadcasts a story based on alleged Federal \ndocuments, they must take the responsibility to verify those records.\n  While CBS may not have taken part in the creation of the memo in \nquestion, and indeed I think I join all of us Americans in yearning to \nknow who did forge these memos, the network still touted them as \nverified and broadcast the forged memos as truthful to millions of \nAmerican voters. I look forward to a full criminal investigation of who \ndid forge the documents.\n  I draw an analogy in distinguishing between murder and negligent \nhomicide. Those are crimes. Murder is intentional and negligent \nhomicide is\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\nnot, but in both crimes someone has been killed. While CBS may not have \nhad the intention to deceive its audience, the false information was \ncommunicated when it was negligently not verified and the damage was \ndone nevertheless.\n  If it were not for the work of many astute people working through the \nInternet and otherwise, this travesty would not have been on its way to \nbeing exposed and fully prosecuted criminally. CBS and its surrogates \npointedly disparaged the people who told the truth as mere second-class \njournalists of the Internet and table television and talk radio \npersuasions. Rather, it is CBS which has proven itself to be even less \nthan second-class journalism.\n\n  I note that numerous pundits have been discussing recently the very \nvitality of the networks is faltering with the explosion of other \nmedia. Pundits have cited CBS's additional poor judgment in failing to \ncover the political conventions as well as other media outlets did. CBS \nowes a separate apology to those truth tellers whom it slandered and \nwho have shown better judgment than CBS.\n  It can be difficult to communicate information without also conveying \none's personal conviction on a matter. However, in a free society such \nas ours, the news media has a responsibility to work to be fair and \nbalanced and to tell both sides of the story without letting a \njournalistic spin cloud their judgment.\n  Television, print, and the Internet are a powerful media. They shape \nour lives. They provide some part of the education of our children, \nwhether we like it or not. The time has come for the media to take \nresponsibility for its actions rather than manipulate public opinion to \nlobby the causes and politicians the media support. Facts, not \nconclusions or erroneous records, should be reported. Elections are a \npowerful example of why journalists must hold themselves to the highest \nof standards. People can then synthesize information for themselves.\n  In conclusion, I argue that the media has a grave responsibility to \nensure that what it reports is a true and accurate representation of \nthe facts. It could be argued that if CBS either forged the documents \nor knowingly represented forged documents as being true, there is no \npenalty under the law. We need to criminalize and establish the \nconsequences for forging Federal documents. I urge my colleagues to \nstand with me. I cannot imagine anyone not supporting such a piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n       There's no stand-alone federal offense for forging \n     government documents.\n       The criminal penalties for the forgery would depend upon \n     the circumstances, the context, basically the underlying \n     facts of the matter--what type of document, for what purpose, \n     what was done with it, what was intended--a lot of various \n     factors that would influence the decision about how it would \n     be charged and hence what the penalties would be.\n       There is no stand-alone forgery of government documents \n     offense. It depends on the context of the matter.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague and \nChairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Mr. \nCochran in introducing this piece of legislation to correct a \ncontinuing problem at the U.S. Department of Agriculture with funding \nfor technical assistance for agricultural producers and landowners \nparticipating in agricultural conservation programs.\n  The 2002 farm bill contains a historic increase in funding for \nconservation programs, including for the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program (EQIP), the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program \n(FRPP), the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), the Wetlands \nReserve Program (WRP), the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the \nGrassland Reserve Program (GRP) and the Conservation Security Program \n(CSP). These programs provide our nation's producers and landowners the \nfinancial and technical means to protect and enhance natural resources, \nincluding water, air, soil and wildlife habitat.\n  To realize the environmental benefits made possible by this large new \ninvestment in conservation, it is essential that farmers, ranchers and \nlandowners receive professional technical assistance to help them plan, \ndesign and carry out effective and workable conservation practices in \ntheir specific operations. This technical assistance is provided by \nemployees of USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and, under \nthe 2002 farm bill, private sector providers.\n  Because technical assistance is so crucial to the effectiveness of \nconservation programs, the 2002 farm bill included sufficient money for \ntechnical assistance as an integral part of the mandatory funding \nprovided for each of the conservation programs. The legislation \nrequires USDA to use mandatory funds to carry out the conservation \nprograms, ``including the provision of technical assistance.''\n  By providing funding in this manner, Congress acted to remedy the \nsubstantial and continuing shortfalls in technical assistance for \nmandatory conservation programs under the 1996 farm bill--which on \nseveral occasions necessitated limited stop-gap funding in \nappropriations measures. These shortfalls resulted from application of \na limitation on transfers from the Commodity\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\nCredit Corporation (CCC), often referred to as ``the section 11 cap''. \nThe only conservation program not affected by this limitation was EQIP. \nThat is because the statutory language creating and funding EQIP \nspecifically identified technical assistance as an integral function of \nthe program, thereby creating a funding stream through the program \nfunds directly and outside the limitation on Section 11 transfers from \nCCC.\n  In drafting the 2002 farm bill, Congress was thus fully aware of the \nrecurrent shortages of technical assistance funds which plagued the \n1996 farm bill's mandatory conservation programs and the manner in \nwhich EQIP technical assistance had been exempted from the limitation \non CCC transfers. The wording and structure of the 2002 bill closely \ntrack the 1996 bill's EQIP language to specify clearly that technical \nassistance is an integral part of the bill's mandatory funding for each \nof the conservation programs, and hence not subject to the limitation \non CCC transfers. Further, the 2002 farm bill's statement of managers \nunmistakably indicates that technical assistance is an integral part of \nmandatory funding, following the model used for EQIP in the 1996 bill.\n  We believed that the language in the 2002 farm bill solved the \nproblem by fully funding technical assistance through the mandatory \nprogram funds without the limitation on transfers from the CCC. \nNevertheless, the administration, through the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Department of Justice, construed the bill so that all \nconservation technical assistance fell under the Section 11 cap--even \nfor EQIP. The U.S. General Accounting Office disagreed with the \nAdministration's position and concluded that under the farm bill \ntechnical assistance is a part of the mandatory funds for each \nconservation program and not within the limitation on CCC transfers.\n  The limitation on technical assistance under the administration's \ninterpretation meant that much of the investment we made in the farm \nbill conservation programs would go unused for lack of technical \nassistance to plan for and carry out the conservation practices on the \nground. To move beyond the impasse created by the misinterpretation of \nthe farm bill by the administration, Congress added language to the \n2003 Consolidated Appropriations Act specifying that certain transfers \nof funding from the CCC for technical assistance are not subject to the \nSection 11 cap if the funds come directly from the funds provided for \nseveral of the conservation programs.\n  This was only a partial solution. To limit the budget cost, technical \nassistance funds for all conservation programs (except CSP) are \ntransferred from the funds provided for a subset of programs, namely \nEQIP, WHIP, GRP and FRPP, that have annual funding limits in the farm \nbill. As a result, technical assistance funds for WRP and CRP have been \ntaken from the annual mandatory funds provided for the four dollar-\nlimited programs. This has resulted in a diversion of over $200 million \nto pay for technical assistance for CRP and WRP that would otherwise \nhave gone directly to agricultural producers and landowners through \nEQIP, WHIP, CRP and FRPP.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will take the next step and \npermanently fix the technical assistance funding problem. It will cure \nthe shortage of technical assistance funding so funds will no longer be \ntaken from EQIP, WHIP, GRP or FRPP to pay for technical assistance for \nCRP and WRP. And, it will finally restore the original intent of the \n2002 farm bill to have technical assistance funding come out of the CCC \nfunding provided for each conservation program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9817-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9817-S9818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 436--DESIGNATING THE SECOND SUNDAY IN THE MONTH OF \n         DECEMBER 2004 AS ``NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 436\n\n       Whereas approximately 80,000 infants, children, teenagers, \n     and young adults of families living throughout the United \n     States die each year from myriad causes;\n       Whereas the death of an infant, child, teenager, or young \n     adult of a family is considered to be one of the greatest \n     tragedies that a parent or family will ever endure during a \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas a supportive environment, empathy, and \n     understanding are considered critical factors in the healing \n     process of a family that is coping with and recovering from \n     the loss of a loved one; and\n       Whereas April is National Child Abuse Prevention month: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates the second Sunday in the month of December \n     2004 as ``National Children's Memorial Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Children's Memorial Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities in remembrance of the many infants, \n     children, teenagers, and young adults of families in the \n     United States who have died.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nwould designate the second Sunday in December as ``National Children's \nMemorial Day.''\n  The resolution would set aside this day to remember all the children \nwho die in the United States each year. While I realize the families of \nthese children deal with the grief of their loss every day, I would \nlike to commemorate the lives of these children with a special day as \nwell.\n  The death of a child is a shattering experience for any family. I \nhave had constituents share their heart-wrenching stories with me about \nthe death of their son or daughter. I have heard heroic stories of kids \nbattling cancer or diabetes, and tragic stories of car accidents and \ndrownings.\n  Each of these families has had their own experience, but they must \nall continue with their lives and live with the incredible pain of \nlosing a child. Establishing a day to remember children who passed away \nwill lend encouragement and support to bereaved families as they work \nthrough their grief. It is important for these families to know that \nthey are not alone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 437--CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH IRWIN MILLER OF \n                           COLUMBUS, INDIANA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Bayh) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. COLEMAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 2845, to reform the intelligence community and \nthe intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United \nStates Government, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       On page 129, strike line 21 and all that follows through \n     page 137, line 23, and insert the following:\n       (6) The United States needs to implement the \n     recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States to adopt a unified incident \n     command system and significantly enhance communications \n     connectivity between and among civilian authorities, local \n     first responders, and the National Guard. The unified \n     incident command system should enable emergency managers and \n     first responders to manage, generate, receive, evaluate, \n     share, and use information in the event of a terrorist attack \n     or a significant national disaster.\n       (7) A new approach to the sharing of intelligence and \n     homeland security information is urgently needed. An \n     important conceptual model for a new ``trusted information \n     network'' is the Systemwide Homeland Analysis and Resource \n     Exchange (SHARE) Network proposed by a task force of leading \n     professionals assembled by the Markle Foundation and \n     described in reports issued in October 2002 and December \n     2003.\n       (8) No single agency can create a meaningful information \n     sharing system on its own. Alone, each agency can only \n     modernize stovepipes, not replace them. Presidential \n     leadership is required to bring about governmentwide change.\n       (c) Information Sharing Network.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The President shall establish a trusted \n     information network and secure information sharing \n     environment to promote sharing of intelligence and homeland \n     security information in a manner consistent with national \n     security and the protection of privacy and civil liberties, \n     and based on clearly defined and consistently applied \n     policies and procedures, and valid investigative, analytical \n     or operational requirements.\n       (2) Attributes.--The Network shall promote coordination, \n     communication and collaboration of people and information \n     among all relevant Federal departments and agencies, State, \n     tribal, and local authorities, and relevant private sector \n     entities, including owners and operators of critical \n     infrastructure, by using policy guidelines and technologies \n     that support--\n       (A) a decentralized, distributed, and coordinated \n     environment that connects existing systems where appropriate \n     and allows users to share information among agencies, between \n     levels of government, and, as appropriate, with the private \n     sector;\n       (B) the sharing of information in a form and manner that \n     facilitates its use in analysis, investigations and \n     operations;\n       (C) enabling connectivity between Federal and State \n     agencies and civilian authorities and local first responders \n     in the event of a terrorist attack or significant national \n     disaster;\n       (D) building upon existing systems capabilities currently \n     in use across the Government;\n       (E) utilizing industry best practices, including minimizing \n     the centralization of data and seeking to use common tools \n     and capabilities whenever possible;\n       (F) employing an information access management approach \n     that controls access to data rather than to just networks;\n       (G) facilitating the sharing of information at and across \n     all levels of security by using\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\n     policy guidelines and technologies that support writing \n     information that can be broadly shared;\n       (H) providing directory services for locating people and \n     information;\n       (I) incorporating protections for individuals' privacy and \n     civil liberties;\n       (J) incorporating strong mechanisms for information \n     security and privacy and civil liberties guideline \n     enforcement in order to enhance accountability and facilitate \n     oversight, including--\n       (i) multifactor authentication and access control;\n       (ii) strong encryption and data protection;\n       (iii) immutable audit capabilities;\n       (iv) automated policy enforcement;\n       (v) perpetual, automated screening for abuses of network \n     and intrusions; and\n       (vi) uniform classification and handling procedures;\n       (K) compliance with requirements of applicable law and \n     guidance with regard to the planning, design, acquisition, \n     operation, and management of information systems; and\n       (L) permitting continuous system upgrades to benefit from \n     advances in technology while preserving the integrity of \n     stored data.\n       (d) Immediate Actions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Executive \n     Council, shall--\n       (1) submit to the President and to Congress a description \n     of the technological, legal, and policy issues presented by \n     the creation of the Network described in subsection (c), and \n     the way in which these issues will be addressed;\n       (2) establish electronic directory services to assist in \n     locating in the Federal Government intelligence and homeland \n     security information and people with relevant knowledge about \n     intelligence and homeland security information; and\n       (3) conduct a review of relevant current Federal agency \n     capabilities, including--\n       (A) a baseline inventory of current Federal systems that \n     contain intelligence or homeland security information;\n       (B) the money currently spent to maintain those systems; \n     and\n       (C) identification of other information that should be \n     included in the Network.\n       (e) Guidelines and Requirements.--As soon as possible, but \n     in no event later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall--\n       (1) in consultation with the Executive Council--\n       (A) issue guidelines for acquiring, accessing, sharing, and \n     using information, including guidelines to ensure that \n     information is provided in its most shareable form, such as \n     by separating out data from the sources and methods by which \n     that data are obtained; and\n       (B) on classification policy and handling procedures across \n     Federal agencies, including commonly accepted processing and \n     access controls;\n       (2) in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties \n     Oversight Board established under section 211, issue \n     guidelines that--\n       (A) protect privacy and civil liberties in the development \n     and use of the Network; and\n       (B) shall be made public, unless, and only to the extent \n     that, nondisclosure is clearly necessary to protect national \n     security; and\n       (3) require the heads of Federal departments and agencies \n     to promote a culture of information sharing by--\n       (A) reducing disincentives to information sharing, \n     including overclassification of information and unnecessary \n     requirements for originator approval; and\n       (B) providing affirmative incentives for information \n     sharing, such as the incorporation of information sharing \n     performance measures into agency and managerial evaluations, \n     and employee awards for promoting innovative information \n     sharing practices.\n       (f) Enterprise Architecture and Implementation Plan.--Not \n     later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Director of Management and Budget shall submit to \n     the President and to Congress an enterprise architecture and \n     implementation plan for the Network. The enterprise \n     architecture and implementation plan shall be prepared by the \n     Director of Management and Budget, in consultation with the \n     Executive Council, and shall include--\n       (1) a description of the parameters of the proposed \n     Network, including functions, capabilities, and resources;\n       (2) a delineation of the roles of the Federal departments \n     and agencies that will participate in the development of the \n     Network, including identification of any agency that will \n     build the infrastructure needed to operate and manage the \n     Network (as distinct from the individual agency components \n     that are to be part of the Network), with the delineation of \n     roles to be consistent with--\n       (A) the authority of the National Intelligence Director \n     under this Act to set standards for information sharing and \n     information technology throughout the intelligence community; \n     and\n       (B) the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security and \n     the role of the Department of Homeland Security in \n     coordinating with State, tribal, and local officials and the \n     private sector;\n       (3) a description of the technological requirements to \n     appropriately link and enhance existing networks and a \n     description of the system design that will meet these \n     requirements;\n       (4) an enterprise architecture that--\n       (A) is consistent with applicable laws and guidance with \n     regard to planning, design, acquisition, operation, and \n     management of information systems;\n       (B) will be used to guide and define the development and \n     implementation of the Network; and\n       (C) addresses the existing and planned enterprise \n     architectures of the departments and agencies participating \n     in the Network;\n       (5) a description of how privacy and civil liberties will \n     be protected throughout the design and implementation of the \n     Network;\n       (6) objective, systemwide performance measures to enable \n     the assessment of progress toward achieving full \n     implementation of the Network;\n       (7) a plan, including a time line, for the development and \n     phased implementation of the Network;\n       (8) total budget requirements to develop and implement the \n     Network, including the estimated annual cost for each of the \n     5 years following the date of the enactment of this Act;\n       (9) an estimate of training requirements needed to ensure \n     that the Network will be adequately implemented and property \n     utilized;\n       (10) an analysis of the cost to State, tribal, and local \n     governments and private sector entities for equipment and \n     training needed to effectively utilize the Network; and\n       (11) proposals for any legislation that the Director of \n     Management and Budget determines necessary to implement the \n     Network.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3727. Mr. CORNYN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 2845, to reform the intelligence community and the \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States \nGovernment, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of State, the Government of \n     North Korea is ``a dictatorship under the absolute rule of \n     Kim Jong Il'' that continues to commit numerous, serious \n     human rights abuses.\n       (2) The Government of North Korea attempts to control all \n     information, artistic expression, academic works, and media \n     activity inside North Korea and strictly curtails freedom of \n     speech and access to foreign broadcasts.\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\n       (3) The Government of North Korea subjects all its citizens \n     to systematic, intensive political and ideological \n     indoctrination in support of the cult of personality \n     glorifying Kim Jong Il and the late Kim Il Sung that \n     approaches the level of a state religion.\n       (4) The Government of North Korea divides its population \n     into categories, based on perceived loyalty to the \n     leadership, which determines access to food, employment, \n     higher education, place of residence, medical facilities, and \n     other resources.\n       (5) According to the Department of State, ``[t]he [North \n     Korean] Penal Code is [d]raconian, stipulating capital \n     punishment and confiscation of assets for a wide variety of \n     `crimes against the revolution,' including defection, \n     attempted defection, slander of the policies of the Party or \n     State, listening to foreign broadcasts, writing `reactionary' \n     letters, and possessing reactionary printed matter''.\n       (6) The Government of North Korea executes political \n     prisoners, opponents of the regime, some repatriated \n     defectors, some members of underground churches, and others, \n     sometimes at public meetings attended by workers, students, \n     and schoolchildren.\n       (7) The Government of North Korea holds an estimated \n     200,000 political prisoners in camps that its State Security \n     Agency manages through the use of forced labor, beatings, \n     torture, and executions, and in which many prisoners also die \n     from disease, starvation, and exposure.\n       (8) According to eyewitness testimony provided to the \n     United States Congress by North Korean camp survivors, camp \n     inmates have been used as sources of slave labor for the \n     production of export goods, as targets for martial arts \n     practice, and as experimental victims in the testing of \n     chemical and biological poisons.\n       (9) According to credible reports, including eyewitness \n     testimony provided to the United States Congress, North \n     Korean Government officials prohibit live births in prison \n     camps, and forced abortion and the killing of newborn babies \n     are standard prison practices.\n       (10) According to the Department of State, ``[g]enuine \n     religious freedom does not exist in North Korea'' and, \n     according to the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom, ``[t]he North Korean state severely \n     represses public and private religious activities'' with \n     penalties that reportedly include arrest, imprisonment, \n     torture, and sometimes execution.\n       (11) More than 2,000,000 North Koreans are estimated to \n     have died of starvation since the early 1990s because of the \n     failure of the centralized agricultural and public \n     distribution systems operated by the Government of North \n     Korea.\n       (12) According to a 2002 United Nations-European Union \n     survey, nearly one out of every ten children in North Korea \n     suffers from acute malnutrition and four out of every ten \n     children in North Korea are chronically malnourished.\n       (13) Since 1995, the United States has provided more than \n     2,000,000 tons of humanitarian food assistance to the people \n     of North Korea, primarily through the World Food Program.\n       (14) Although United States food assistance has undoubtedly \n     saved many North Korean lives and there have been minor \n     improvements in transparency relating to the distribution of \n     such assistance in North Korea, the Government of North Korea \n     continues to deny the World Food Program forms of access \n     necessary to properly monitor the delivery of food aid, \n     including the ability to conduct random site visits, the use \n     of native Korean-speaking employees, and travel access \n     throughout North Korea.\n       (15) The risk of starvation, the threat of persecution, and \n     the lack of freedom and opportunity in North Korea have \n     caused large numbers, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of \n     North Koreans to flee their homeland, primarily into China.\n       (16) North Korean women and girls, particularly those who \n     have fled into China, are at risk of being kidnapped, \n     trafficked, and sexually exploited inside China, where many \n     are sold as brides or concubines, or forced to work as \n     prostitutes.\n       (17) The Governments of China and North Korea have been \n     conducting aggressive campaigns to locate North Koreans who \n     are in China without permission and to forcibly return them \n     to North Korea, where they routinely face torture and \n     imprisonment, and sometimes execution.\n       (18) Despite China's obligations as a party to the 1951 \n     United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees \n     and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, \n     China routinely classifies North Koreans seeking asylum in \n     China as mere ``economic migrants'' and returns them to North \n     Korea without regard to the serious threat of persecution \n     they face upon their return.\n       (19) The Government of China does not provide North Koreans \n     whose asylum requests are rejected a right to have the \n     rejection reviewed prior to deportation despite its \n     obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating \n     to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to \n     the Status of Refugees.\n       (20) North Koreans who seek asylum while in China are \n     routinely imprisoned and tortured, and in some cases killed, \n     after they are returned to North Korea.\n       (21) The Government of China has detained, convicted, and \n     imprisoned foreign aid workers attempting to assist North \n     Korean refugees in proceedings that did not comply with \n     Chinese law or international standards.\n       (22) In January 2000, North Korean agents inside China \n     allegedly abducted the Reverend Kim Dong-shik, a United \n     States permanent resident and advocate for North Korean \n     refugees, whose condition and whereabouts remain unknown.\n       (23) Between 1994 and 2003, South Korea has admitted \n     approximately 3,800 North Korean refugees for domestic \n     resettlement, a number that is small in comparison with the \n     total number of North Korean escapees but far greater than \n     the number legally admitted in any other country.\n       (24) Although the principal responsibility for North Korean \n     refugee resettlement naturally falls to the Government of \n     South Korea, the United States should play a leadership role \n     in focusing international attention on the plight of these \n     refugees, and formulating international solutions to that \n     profound humanitarian dilemma.\n       (25) In addition to infringing the rights of its own \n     citizens, the Government of North Korea has been responsible \n     in years past for the abduction of numerous citizens of South \n     Korea and Japan, whose condition and whereabouts remain \n     unknown.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SPECIAL ENVOY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA.\n\n       (a) Special Envoy.--The President shall appoint a special \n     envoy for human rights in North Korea within the Department \n     of State (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Special Envoy'').

ASSISTANCE PROVIDED INSIDE NORTH KOREA.\n\n       (a) Humanitarian Assistance Through Nongovernmental and \n     International Organizations.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) at the same time that Congress supports the provision \n     of humanitarian assistance to the people of North Korea on \n     humanitarian grounds, such assistance also should be provided \n     and monitored so as to minimize the possibility that such \n     assistance could be diverted to political or military use, \n     and to maximize the likelihood that it will reach the most \n     vulnerable North Koreans;\n       (2) significant increases above current levels of United \n     States support for humanitarian assistance provided inside \n     North Korea should be conditioned upon substantial \n     improvements in transparency, monitoring, and access to \n     vulnerable populations throughout North Korea; and\n       (3) the United States should encourage other countries that \n     provide food and other humanitarian assistance to North Korea \n     to do so through monitored, transparent channels, rather than \n     through direct, bilateral transfers to the Government of \n     North Korea.\n       (b) United States Assistance to the Government of North \n     Korea.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States humanitarian assistance to any \n     department, agency, or entity of the Government of North \n     Korea shall--\n       (A) be delivered, distributed, and monitored according to \n     internationally recognized humanitarian standards;\n       (B) be provided on a needs basis, and not used as a \n     political reward or tool of coercion;\n       (C) reach the intended beneficiaries, who should be \n     informed of the source of the assistance; and\n       (D) be made available to all vulnerable groups in North \n     Korea, no matter where in the country they may be located; \n     and\n       (2) United States nonhumanitarian assistance to North Korea \n     shall be contingent on North Korea's substantial progress \n     toward--\n       (A) respect for the basic human rights of the people of \n     North Korea, including freedom of religion;\n       (B) providing for family reunification between North \n     Koreans and their descendants and relatives in the United \n     States;\n       (C) fully disclosing all information regarding citizens of \n     Japan and the Republic of Korea abducted by the Government of \n     North Korea;\n       (D) allowing such abductees, along with their families, \n     complete and genuine freedom to leave North Korea and return \n     to the abductees' original home countries;\n       (E) reforming the North Korean prison and labor camp \n     system, and subjecting such reforms to independent \n     international monitoring; and\n       (F) decriminalizing political expression and activity.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Agency for \n     International Development shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report describing compliance with \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 203.

ELIGIBILITY FOR REFUGEE OR ASYLUM CONSIDERATION.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to clarify \n     that North Koreans are not barred from eligibility for \n     refugee status or asylum in the United States on account of \n     any legal right to citizenship they may enjoy under the \n     Constitution of the Republic of Korea. It is not intended in \n     any way to prejudice whatever rights to citizenship North \n     Koreans may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of \n     Korea, or to apply to former North Korean nationals who have \n     availed themselves of those rights.\n       (b) Treatment of Nationals of North Korea.--For purposes of \n     eligibility for refugee status under section 207 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157), or for \n     asylum under section 208 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1158), a \n     national of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall \n     not be considered a national of the Republic of Korea.\n\n     SEC. 303.

UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES.\n\n       (a) Actions in China.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of China has obligated itself to provide \n     the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) \n     with unimpeded access to North Koreans inside its borders to \n     enable the UNHCR to determine whether they are refugees and \n     whether they require assistance, pursuant to the 1951 United \n     Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the \n     1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and Article \n     III, paragraph 5 of the 1995 Agreement on the Upgrading of \n     the UNHCR Mission in the People's Republic of China to UNHCR \n     Branch Office in the People's Republic of China (referred to \n     in this section as the ``UNHCR Mission Agreement'');\n       (2) the United States, other UNHCR donor governments, and \n     UNHCR should persistently and at the highest levels continue \n     to urge the Government of China to abide by its previous \n     commitments to allow UNHCR unimpeded access to North Korean \n     refugees inside China;\n       (3) the UNHCR, in order to effectively carry out its \n     mandate to protect refugees, should liberally employ as \n     professionals or Experts on Mission persons with significant \n     experience in humanitarian assistance work among displaced \n     North Koreans in China;\n       (4) the UNHCR, in order to effectively carry out its \n     mandate to protect refugees, should liberally contract with \n     appropriate nongovernmental organizations that have a proven \n     record of providing humanitarian assistance to displaced \n     North Koreans in China;\n       (5) the UNHCR should pursue a multilateral agreement to \n     adopt an effective ``first asylum'' policy that guarantees \n     safe haven and assistance to North Korean refugees; and\n       (6) should the Government of China begin actively \n     fulfilling its obligations toward North Korean refugees, all \n     countries, including the United States, and relevant \n     international organizations should increase levels of \n     humanitarian assistance provided inside China to help defray \n     costs associated with the North Korean refugee presence.\n       (b) Arbitration Proceedings.--It is further the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) if the Government of China continues to refuse to \n     provide the UNHCR with access to North Koreans within its \n     borders, the UNHCR should initiate arbitration proceedings \n     pursuant to Article XVI of the UNHCR Mission Agreement and \n     appoint an arbitrator for the UNHCR; and\n       (2) because access to refugees is essential to the UNHCR \n     mandate and to the purpose of a UNHCR branch office, a \n     failure to assert those arbitration rights in present \n     circumstances would constitute a significant abdication by \n     the UNHCR of one of its core responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 305. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Immigration Information.--Not later than 1 year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 12 months \n     thereafter for each of the following 5 years, the Secretary \n     of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit \n     a joint report to the appropriate congressional committees \n     and the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate on the operation of this title \n     during the previous year, which shall include--\n       (1) the number of aliens who are nationals or citizens of \n     North Korea who applied for political asylum and the number \n     who were granted political asylum; and\n       (2) the number of aliens who are nationals or citizens of \n     North Korea who applied for refugee status and the number who \n     were granted refugee status.\n       (b) Countries of Particular Concern.--The President shall \n     include in each annual report on proposed refugee admission \n     pursuant to section 207(d) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(d)), information about specific measures \n     taken to facilitate access to the United States refugee \n     program for individuals who have fled countries of particular \n     concern for violations of religious freedom, identified \n     pursuant to section 402(b) of the International Religious \n     Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)). The report shall \n     include, for each country of particular concern, a \n     description of access of the nationals or former habitual \n     residents of that country to a refugee determination on the \n     basis of--\n       (1) referrals by external agencies to a refugee \n     adjudication;\n       (2) groups deemed to be of special humanitarian concern to \n     the United States for purposes of refugee resettlement; and\n       (3) family links to the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3729.

Res. 438\n\n       Whereas 2004 marks the tenth anniversary of the enactment \n     of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-\n     322, 108 Stat. 1902);\n       Whereas since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act \n     of 1994, communities have made significant progress in \n     reducing domestic violence such that between 1993 and 2001, \n     the incidents of nonfatal domestic violence fell 49 percent;\n       Whereas since created by the Violence Against Women Act of \n     1994, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has answered \n     over 1,000,000 calls;\n       Whereas States have passed over 660 State laws pertaining \n     to domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault;\n       Whereas the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 has helped \n     make strides toward breaking the cycle of violence, but there \n     remains much work to be done;\n       Whereas domestic violence affects women, men, and children \n     of all racial, social, religious, ethnic, and economic groups \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas on average, more than 3 women are murdered by their \n     husbands or boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas women who have been abused are much more likely to \n     suffer from chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended \n     pregnancies, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted \n     infections, including HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas only about 10 percent of primary care physicians \n     routinely screen for domestic violence during new patient \n     visits, and 9 percent routinely screen during periodic \n     checkups;\n       Whereas each year, about 324,000 pregnant women in the \n     United States are battered by the men in their lives, leading \n     to pregnancy complications, including low weight gain, \n     anemia, infections, and first and second trimester bleeding;\n       Whereas every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is \n     sexually assaulted;\n       Whereas almost 25 percent of women surveyed had been raped \n     or physically assaulted by a spouse or boyfriend at some \n     point in their lives;\n       Whereas in 2002 alone, 250,000 women and girls older than \n     the age of 12 were raped or sexually assaulted;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 12 women has been stalked in her \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas some cultural norms, economics, language barriers, \n     and limited access to legal services and information may make \n     some immigrant women particularly vulnerable to abuse;\n       Whereas 1 in 5 adolescent girls in the United States \n     becomes a victim of physical or sexual abuse, or both, in a \n     dating relationship;\n       Whereas 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing \n     someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend;\n       Whereas annually, approximately 8,800,000 children in the \n     United States witness domestic violence;\n       Whereas witnessing violence is a risk factor for having \n     long-term physical and mental health problems (including \n     substance abuse), being a victim of abuse, and becoming a \n     perpetrator of abuse;\n       Whereas a boy who witnesses his father's domestic violence \n     is 10 times more likely to engage in domestic violence than a \n     boy from a nonviolent home;\n       Whereas the cost of domestic violence, including rape, \n     physical assault, and stalking, exceeds $5,800,000,000 each \n     year, of which $4,100,000,000 is spent on direct medical and \n     mental health care services;\n       Whereas 44 percent of the Nation's mayors identified \n     domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness;\n       Whereas 25 to 50 percent of abused women reported they lost \n     a job due, in part, to domestic violence;\n       Whereas there is a need to increase the public awareness \n     about, and understanding of, domestic violence and the needs \n     of battered women and their children;\n       Whereas the month of October 2004 has been recognized as \n     National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a month for \n     activities furthering awareness of domestic violence; and\n       Whereas the dedication and successes of those working \n     tirelessly to end domestic violence and the strength of the \n     survivors of domestic violence should be recognized: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Domestic \n     Violence Awareness Month; and\n       (2) expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     continue to raise awareness of domestic violence in the \n     United States and its devastating impact on families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9864-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nENCOURAGING THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE TO SELECT NEW YORK CITY \n                 AS THE SITE OF THE 2012 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 707, S. 2742.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2742) to extend certain authority of the Supreme \n     Court Police, modify the venue of prosecutions relating to \n     the Supreme Court building and grounds, and authorize the \n     acceptance of gifts to the United States Supreme Court, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 2742, which is a short but important piece of legislation that \nSenator Hatch and I have cosponsored at the request of the Supreme \nCourt. This legislation would renew authority to provide security for \nthe Justices when they leave the Supreme Court. Recent reports of the \nassault of Justice Souter when he was outside of the Supreme Court \nhighlight the importance of security for Justices. If no congressional \naction is taken, the authority of Supreme Court police to protect \nJustices off court grounds will expire at the end of this year.\n  Another provision in this legislation allows the Supreme Court to \naccept gifts ``pertaining to the history of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States or its justices.'' The Administrative Office of the \nCourts currently has statutory authority to accept gifts on behalf of \nthe judiciary. This provision would grant the Supreme Court authority \nto accept gifts but it would narrow the types of gifts that can be \nreceived to historical items. I think this provision strikes the proper \nbalance.\n  Finally, this legislation also would provide an additional venue for \nthe prosecution of offenses that occur on the Supreme Court grounds. \nCurrently, the DC Superior Court is the only place of proper venue \ndespite the uniquely Federal interest at stake. This legislation would \nallow suit to be brought in United States District Court in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hatch \namendment at the desk be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read \nthe third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3729) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for authority to accept gifts pertaining to the \n         history of the Supreme Court, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 2, lines 22 and 23, strike ``for the purpose of \n     aiding or facilitating the work of the United States Supreme \n     Court,'' and insert ``pertaining to the history of the United \n     States Supreme Court or its justices,''.\n\n  The bill (S. 2742), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 2742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9866-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \ntomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of the intelligence \nreform bill. We had very good debate on the bill today, disposing of \ntwo very important amendments. We also had good debate on the pending \nSpecter intelligence consolidation amendment today as well. We would \nlike to get a reasonable time agreement for that amendment and vote \nearly tomorrow morning. Tomorrow we will lock in an amendment list to \nthis bill. This is the first step in the process for the Senate to show \nthe commitment to finish this bill.\n  Further, we need to reach an agreement to have amendments filed at \nthe desk so that all Members will be able to see legislative text. We \nwill do this at some point, I am quite sure, late tomorrow afternoon. I \nhave talked about the scheduling changes that confront the Senate this \nweek. In order to complete this important bill, we will need Senators \nto make themselves available to offer their amendments and to agree to \nreasonable debate times.\n  I will continue consulting with the Democratic leader as to the \nvoting schedule for the remainder of the week and next week. It is \nclear that this cannot be business as usual. It is a very important \nbill before the Senate. We have a number of issues in terms of \nappropriations, continuing resolutions, extensions on other bills that \nhave to be dealt with over the coming days. I continue to ask all our \nMembers to be prepared to adapt their schedules for this extraordinary \npiece of legislation that is in the Senate as well as these other \npieces of legislation coming before the Senate.\n  I had the opportunity over the course of today to talk to the \nDemocratic leadership as well as members of our caucus and other \nMembers of the Senate, and it is clear that we have a lot of work to do \nin a short period of time. Thus, even though we will do our very best \nto work around individual Members' schedules, we will have to change \nthe pace of the last several weeks or several months, meaning the \npotential for voting on Friday, voting for sure on Monday. Suggestions \nhave even come forward that in order to meet all of our objectives on \nall these bills before our departure on October 8 we should even \nconsider working through this Saturday and Sunday.\n  I mention all of those, and no decisions have been made except that \nthe fact that so many people are coming forward to say we have a lot to \ndo means we will have to vote through this week every day starting \nright at 9:30. We will not have morning business tomorrow. We will go \nstraight into the bill and continue through Wednesday, Thursday, Friday \nand, clearly, have a full working day on Monday as well.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair, Senator Daschle has met with \nSenator Frist on more than one occasion today. These are extraordinary \ntimes. Not only do we have a Presidential election, but these are \nextraordinary times because of the threat facing our country.\n  This legislation, the two leaders believe, should be expedited. It \ndeals with that very threat. Everyone should listen very closely to \nwhat the majority leader said. That is, we have to take a look at \nFriday, weekend, Monday. This is for real. We are running out of time. \nThe two leaders agree that we have to work very hard to complete the \nagenda we have ahead of us, which is a lot in a very short period of \ntime.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, I thank Chairman Warner for \nassisting in getting the Under Secretary of the Navy confirmed today--\ntonight. The Under Secretary reported out on May 12, 2004. I thank our \ndistinguished colleague for working so hard and assisting in getting \nthis accomplished tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/28/senate-section/article/S9866-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
