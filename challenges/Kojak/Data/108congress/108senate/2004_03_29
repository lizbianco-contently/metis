FINDINGS.\n\n       [The Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \n     Program established by the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) \n     has succeeded in moving families from welfare to work and \n     reducing child poverty.\n       [(A) There has been a dramatic increase in the employment \n     of current and former welfare recipients. The percentage of \n     working recipients reached an all-time high in fiscal year \n     1999 and continued steady in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. In \n     fiscal year 2001, 33 percent of adult recipients were \n     working, compared to less than 7 percent in fiscal year 1992, \n     and 11 percent in fiscal year 1996. All States met the \n     overall participation rate standard in fiscal year 2001, as \n     did the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n       [(B) Earnings for welfare recipients remaining on the rolls \n     have also increased significantly, as have earnings for \n     female-headed households. The increases have been \n     particularly large for the bottom 2 income quintiles, that \n     is, those women who are most likely to be former or present \n     welfare recipients.\n       [(C) Welfare dependency has plummeted. As of June 2002, \n     2,025,000 families and 5,008,000 individuals were receiving \n     assistance. Accordingly, the number of families in the \n     welfare caseload and the number of individuals receiving cash \n     assistance declined 54 percent and 58 percent, respectively, \n     since the enactment of TANF. These declines have persisted \n     even as unemployment rates have increased: unemployment rates \n     nationwide rose 50 percent, from 3.9 percent in September \n     2000 to 6 percent in November 2002, while welfare caseloads \n     continued to decline.\n       [(D) The child poverty rate continued to decline between \n     1996 and 2001, falling 20 percent from 20.5 to 16.3 percent. \n     The 2001 child poverty rate remains at the lowest level since \n     1979. Child poverty rates for African-American and Hispanic \n     children have also fallen dramatically during the past 6 \n     years. African-American child poverty is at the lowest rate \n     on record and Hispanic child poverty is at the lowest level \n     reported in over 20 years.\n       [(E) Despite these gains, States have had mixed success in \n     fully engaging welfare recipients in work activities. While \n     all States have met the overall work participation rates \n     required by law, in 2001, in an average month, only just over \n     \\1/3\\ of all families with an adult participated in work \n     activities that were countable toward the State's \n     participation rate. Five jurisdictions failed to meet the \n     more rigorous 2-parent work requirements, and 19 \n     jurisdictions (States and territories) are not subject to the \n     2-parent requirements, most because they moved their 2-parent \n     cases to separate State programs where they are not subject \n     to a penalty for failing the 2-parent rates.\n       [(2) As a Nation, we have made substantial progress in \n     reducing teen pregnancies and births, slowing increases in \n     nonmarital childbearing, and improving child support \n     collections and paternity establishment.\n       [(A) The teen birth rate has fallen continuously since \n     1991, down a dramatic 22 percent by 2000. During the period \n     of 1991-2000, teenage birth rates fell in all States and the \n     District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. \n     Declines also have spanned age, racial, and ethnic groups. \n     There has been success in lowering the birth rate for both \n     younger and older teens. The birth rate for those 15-17 years \n     of age is down 29 percent since 1991, and the rate for those \n     18 and 19 is down 16 percent. Between 1991 and 2000, teen \n     birth rates declined for all women ages 15-19--white, African \n     American, American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander, and \n     Hispanic women ages 15-19. The rate for African American \n     teens--until recently the highest--experienced the largest \n     decline, down 31 percent from 1991 to 2000, to reach the \n     lowest rate ever reported for this group. Most births to \n     teens are nonmarital; in 2000, about 73 percent of the births \n     to teens aged 15-19 occurred outside of marriage.\n       [(B) Nonmarital childbearing continued to increase slightly \n     in 2001, however not at the sharp rates of increase seen in \n     recent decades. The birth rate among unmarried women in 2001 \n     was 4 percent lower than its peak reached in 1994, while the \n     proportion of births occurring outside of marriage has \n     remained at approximately 33 percent since 1998.\n       [(C) The negative consequences of out-of-wedlock birth on \n     the mother, the child, the family, and society are well \n     documented. These include increased likelihood of welfare \n     dependency, increased risks of low birth weight, poor \n     cognitive development, child abuse and neglect, and teen \n     parenthood, and decreased likelihood of having an intact \n     marriage during adulthood.\n       [(D) An estimated 24,500,000 children do not live with \n     their biological fathers, and 7,100,000 children do not live \n     with their biological mothers. These facts are attributable \n     largely to declining marriage rates, increasing divorce \n     rates, and increasing rates of nonmarital births during the \n     latter part of the 20th century.\n       [(E) There has been a dramatic rise in cohabitation as \n     marriages have declined. Only 40 percent of children of \n     cohabiting couples will see their parents marry. Those who do \n     marry experience a 50 percent higher divorce rate. Children \n     in single-parent households and cohabiting households are \n     at much higher risk of child abuse than children in intact \n     married and stepparent families.\n       [(F) Children who live apart from their biological fathers, \n     on average, are more likely to be poor, experience \n     educational, health, emotional, and psychological problems, \n     be victims of child abuse, engage in criminal behavior, and \n     become involved with the juvenile justice system than their \n     peers who live with their married, biological mother and \n     father. A child living in a single-parent family is nearly 5 \n     times as likely to be poor as a child living in a married-\n     couple family. In\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\n     2001, in married-couple families, the child poverty rate was \n     8 percent, and in households headed by a single mother, the \n     poverty rate was 39.3 percent.\n       [(G) Since the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, child support \n     collections within the child support enforcement system have \n     grown every year, increasing from $12,000,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 1996 to nearly $19,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2001. The \n     number of paternities established or acknowledged in fiscal \n     year 2002 reached an historic high of over 1,500,000--which \n     includes more than a 100 percent increase through in-hospital \n     acknowledgement programs to 790,595 in 2001 from 324,652 in \n     1996. Child support collections were made in well over \n     7,000,000 cases in fiscal year 2000, significantly more than \n     the almost 4,000,000 cases having a collection in 1996.\n       [(3) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 gave States great flexibility in \n     the use of Federal funds to develop innovative programs to \n     help families leave welfare and begin employment and to \n     encourage the formation of 2-parent families.\n       [(A) Total Federal and State TANF expenditures in fiscal \n     year 2001 were $25,500,000,000, up from $24,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2000 and $22,600,000,000 in fiscal year 1999. \n     This increased spending is attributable to significant new \n     investments in supportive services in the TANF program, such \n     as child care and activities to support work.\n       [(B) Since the welfare reform effort began there has been a \n     dramatic increase in work participation (including \n     employment, community service, and work experience) among \n     welfare recipients, as well as an unprecedented reduction in \n     the caseload because recipients have left welfare for work.\n       [(C) States are making policy choices and investment \n     decisions best suited to the needs of their citizens.\n       [(i) To expand aid to working families, all States \n     disregard a portion of a family's earned income when \n     determining benefit levels.\n       [(ii) Most States increased the limits on countable assets \n     above the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC) program. Every State has increased the vehicle asset \n     level above the prior AFDC limit for a family's primary \n     automobile.\n       [(iii) States are experimenting with programs to promote \n     marriage and father involvement. Over half the States have \n     eliminated restrictions on 2-parent families.

Mr. President, I rise to reiterate how important it is \nthat Congress and the administration act to protect the American people \nfrom rising gas prices. I call on the Bush administration to stop its \ncampaign of inaction on this critical consumer issue.\n  This week the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, \nwill vote on whether to cut their cartel's production by 1 million \nbarrels a day. This vote comes at a time when the American Automobile \nAssociation tells us that the national average price of gasoline is the \nhighest it has ever been. Of course, we know it is not yet the peak \ndriving season. In California, consumers consistently pay over $2 a \ngallon. In my home State, it is $1.80, and in some towns, $1.85, such \nas Eugene and Medford. Consumers in Oregon are getting clobbered.\n  The vote OPEC will be making comes at a time when according to the \nAssociated Press private gasoline inventories are already down by 2.5 \nmillion barrels. The vote comes at a time when, in spite of these very \nlow supplies, the Bush administration stubbornly persists in filling \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve instead of steps that I and others \nfavor, which are to put more oil on the market.\n  In my view, it is imperative that the United States push OPEC in \nevery possible way not to cause further harm to our already injured \ngasoline market and to vote against any further production cuts. The \nLundberg Survey tells us that even if OPEC were to agree this week not \nto cut production, we would still face skyrocketing prices. Here is how \nI read that: If OPEC doesn't agree not to cut production, the problem \nwill be that much worse.\n  When oil prices were high in September of 2000, then-candidate George \nW. Bush blasted former President Clinton for not pushing OPEC to \nincrease production. Prices at that time were not as high as they are \ntoday. And at least the administration at that time was making some \nefforts to wring some relief out of OPEC. But still then Texas Governor \nBush said:\n\n       We need to be mindful of the power of strong and consistent \n     diplomacy. We need to start playing with chips we have earned \n     in the past on behalf of American consumers.\n\n  If anybody has chips to play now in order to get a fair shake for the \nconsumer, it is this President. Certainly he has chips to play with the \ndomestic oil producers who enjoy the tax breaks he favors and \nenvironmental breaks and help when those companies are having \ndifficulty supplying their refineries.\n  With regard to the OPEC vote, we ought to be clear. I hope the \nPresident of the United States will follow the advice he gave years \nago. I hope he will do everything possible to push those OPEC countries \nnow, telling them they should not allow the gas problem in this country \nto worsen with yet another production cut. Pushing OPEC to stop a \nplanned production cut is the very least this administration could do \nfor the gasoline consumer. It would be the least that could be done, \nbut at least it would be something. At least it would end the weeks' \nlong, months' long campaign of inaction that this administration has \nwaged as gasoline prices have crept higher and higher and clobbered \nconsumers in every part of the United States.\n  For several weeks now OPEC's per barrel price has been well above \ntheir target per barrel price range of $22 to\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n$28. OPEC committed to keeping prices in this range. They long ago \ndiscarded that commitment, and yet nobody has heard anything from the \nadministration until just in the last week or so, as I and others \nstarted calling for answers.\n  We sure heard from the White House last week when OPEC prices dropped \nto $35.51 per barrel. They said: Well, we are making progress. But the \nfact is, that amount is more than $7 higher than the top of OPEC's \ntarget price range. So any pressure this administration has put on OPEC \nis a day late and more than $7 short. Taking credit after the fact for \na pittance of accommodation from OPEC is not going to solve this \nNation's gasoline price problems, and it certainly is not going to \nprovide the consumer any real relief.\n  I will tell you what else is not going to help American consumers. \nThat is for the administration to continue to turn a blind eye to the \nrampant anticompetitive and anticonsumer practices that are plaguing \nour country's gasoline markets. Scores of communities, including those \nin my State, have few if any choices for the gasoline consumer. \nNationwide the gas market in Oregon and at least 27 other States is \nconsidered tight oligopolies where four companies control more than 60 \npercent of the gasoline at the pump. In these tightly concentrated \nmarkets, numerous studies have found oil company practices have driven \nthe independent wholesalers and detailers completely out of the market. \nThey use red lining and zone pricing. The fact is, with these and other \npractices, the independent stations can't compete. They go out of \nbusiness, and the oil companies can widen their net to grab even more \ncash from the consumers.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, when they have looked at these \npractices in the past, have admitted that they are anticompetitive and \ndrive prices higher. They just say they don't have the power to do much \nabout it. I don't think that is true. To be fair, the past \nadministration didn't do a whole lot either when it came to going to \nbat for the consumer to stop these oil company anticompetitive \npractices. But this administration has proven that if they want to make \nsomething happen administratively, they certainly can do it. They have \ndone that in area after area.\n  It seems to me that if the administration will end its campaign of \ninaction to stop the price-pumping shenanigans of private oil \ncompanies, they could certainly take steps now to help the American \nconsumer.\n  In December of 2002, they stepped in to stop filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve to keep more oil on the market, when the oil \ncompanies couldn't keep their refineries full. But now when American \nconsumers are paying $2 a gallon at the pump, we don't see any effort \nto stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. So the fact is, what \nthis administration is unwilling do for the driving public, they are \nwilling to do for big oil.\n  What ought to be done in the face of this campaign of inaction? \nCertainly, you can make a start by having congressional action. I \nsponsored S. 1737, which would give the Federal Trade Commission \nadditional tools to promote competition in these very tight markets. \nThey would have the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent \ncompanies from gouging consumers. That is a vehicle that can be used \nright now to help the American consumer. We are certainly going to have \nproblems in the days ahead. And even the oil companies admit that the \nmarket won't solve the problems on its own.\n  Last August a report by the Rand Corporation revealed that even oil \nindustry officials are predicting more price volatility in the future. \nLast November the Energy Information Administration also issued a \nreport on the causes of last summer's record high gas prices.\n  They said--and this is the position of the Federal Government--\n``There is continuing vulnerability to future gasoline price spikes.''\n  The Congress needs to act now before gasoline rises to $3 per gallon, \nand we are hearing that from some independent oil industry analysts.\n  The administration, however, has the power to act now. They need to \nbe on the phone. They need to be pushing OPEC today. They need to get \noff the dime at the Federal Trade Commission, where action can be taken \nadministratively. Rising gas prices don't just hit families in the \npocket during the weekly fill-up; those rising gasoline prices are \nproducing a disturbance and causing ripples throughout our economy. \nThere are huge consequences of this price manipulation.\n  When gasoline costs more, businesses' transportation costs go up. \nTheir profits go down. So either the price of the goods they sell to \nconsumers has to go up, or the number of people they employ must \nplummet. So higher gas prices either mean bigger costs for consumer \ngoods, or fewer jobs in an economy that certainly cannot afford to lose \nany more.\n  Let me close by saying that I hope my legislation, S. 1737, will pass \nin the days ahead. Right now, consumers are getting socked at the pumps \nin person. That is not acceptable to me and should not be acceptable to \nany Member of the Senate. It is time to stand up to the status quo.\n  It is time for the Bush administration to take the lead. They ought \nto do it with OPEC and with the Federal Trade Commission. If the \nadministration doesn't support the proposals I offer today, they ought \nto end their campaign of inaction and offer their own. I hope we will \nhave a chance to debate this on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last December, there were news reports \naround the country about the disappearance of a young student at the \nUniversity of North Dakota whose name was Dru Sjodin.\n  I am sorry to tell you that Dru Sjodin has never been found. It is \nlikely that she has been murdered. The person who allegedly committed \nthat murder is now under lock and key in a North Dakota jail, awaiting \na trial. And, as is too often the case, the man that apparently \ncommitted this crime had earlier been released from prison for \ncommitting similar offenses.\n  Let me talk for a moment about this case and about some legislation I \nhave introduced in the Senate--bipartisan legislation--to respond to \nit.\n  Dru Sjodin was a student at the University of North Dakota. On a \nDecember afternoon, she was abducted in a parking lot at the shopping \ncenter in Grand Forks, ND.\n  The suspect who was arrested for that disappearance was a man named \nAlfonso Rodriguez, Jr. Law enforcement has released some details, \nsaying that a knife with blood of the type of Dru Sjodin's blood was \nfound in the automobile of Mr. Alfonso Rodriguez.\n  Mr. Rodriguez had only been released 6 months earlier from a 23-year \nsentence that he served in a prison for a previous rape and sexual \nassault in Minnesota. In fact, the Minnesota Department of Corrections \nhad rated Mr. Rodriguez a ``type 3'' sexual offender, meaning that he \nwas at the highest risk for reoffending.\n  In an evaluation conducted in January 2003, a little over a year ago, \na prison psychiatrist wrote that Mr. Rodriguez had demonstrated ``a \nwillingness to use substantial force, including the use of a weapon, in \norder to gain compliance from his victims.''\n  Yet Mr. Rodriguez was released in May of 2003--not yet a year ago--by \nthe Minnesota Department of Corrections. He had served 23 years; he had \nserved his full sentence, and the Department of Corrections released \nhim and imposed no further supervision for his release.\n  The Minnesota Department of Corrections could have recommended that \nthe State Attorney General seek what is known as a civil commitment. \nThat means a State court would have required Rodriguez to be confined \nin prison as long as he posed a significant threat to the public, even \nif he had already served his original sentence. But the Attorney \nGeneral was not notified of Mr. Rodriguez's release, and so no action \nwas taken there.\n  Upon his release, Mr. Rodriguez went to live in Crookston, MN, \nunsupervised, just a short distance from the Grand Forks, ND, shopping \nmall where Dru Sjodin was abducted. Mr. Rodriguez was listed on a list \nof sexual predators in Minnesota. But each State has listings of sexual \npredators. If concerned\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\ncitizens in Grand Forks, ND, wanted to know whether there was a sexual \npredator living nearby, they would have accessed the North Dakota \nsexual predator list and would not have found Mr. Rodriguez's name, \ndespite the fact that he lived just a short distance from that Grand \nForks shopping center, across the state line.\n  In my judgment, we have to do much, much better than that. A recent \nstudy found that 72 percent of the highest risk sexual offenders commit \nanother sexual assault within 6 years of being released. And the Bureau \nof Justice statistics tell us that sex offenders released from prison \nare over 10 times more likely to be arrested for a sexual crime than \nindividuals who have no record of sexual assault at all.\n  We just cannot continue to release sexual predators from prison with \nno supervision whatsoever and let them prey on an unsuspecting public. \nSo I have offered legislation that I hope will deal with some of the \nbreakdowns that have occurred in this case. The legislation I have \noffered is cosponsored by Senator Coleman and Senator Dayton from \nMinnesota, and by my colleague, Senator Conrad, from North Dakota.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add as a cosponsor Senator Johnston from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will define what the bill does. First, \nit directs the Department of Justice to create a national registry of \nsex offenders, which would be accessible to the public. This isn't \ndifficult. You just aggregate the State lists so you have a national \nlist. All Americans who live near State borders will be able to access \nthat list.\n  Second, this legislation will try to ensure that the highest risk sex \noffenders are not released at all. The bill requires that States \nprovide automatic and timely notification to the States' attorneys of \nthe planned release of any high-risk sex offender. Before the release, \nthe State's attorney shall be formally notified. That will give them \ntime to pursue civil commitment cases for those who are the most \ndangerous, in order to continue to keep them in prison. They are able \nto do that under current law. My bill doesn't change current State \nlaws, but it requires notification of the States' attorneys when \nsomebody who is a type 3 high-risk sexual predator is about to be \nreleased from prison.\n  Third, the bill provides that for those high-risk sexual predators \nwho are released after serving their full sentences, there will be \nintensive State supervision for a period of not less than one year.\n  Mr. President, in developing this piece of legislation, we have \nworked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the \nVanished Children's Alliance, the National Council of Cities, and many \nothers. A companion bill to my legislation has been offered in the \nHouse by Paul Gillmor from Ohio and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota. That, \ntoo, is a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Dru Sjodin, was, by all accounts, a wonderful person. I visited with \nher family and with her roommate in college. It is a tragedy the likes \nof which we see very seldom in our part of the country. Dru Sjodin has \nbeen missing since December. They have had search parties, the National \nGuard has searched, and her family is still out searching even after \nthe formal law enforcement search has discontinued.\n  This young woman walked out of a shopping center in the town of Grand \nForks, ND, and was abducted by someone who had just been released after \n23 years in prison as a sexual predator.\n  We have to do a lot better than that to protect the American people. \nThis is a tragedy. It is heartbreaking just to talk about this, but in \nthe name of Dru Sjodin and so many other victims of crime, this \nCongress needs to do better.\n  One way to do better is to create and require the creation of a \nnational registry of sexual predators so that we know where they are \nand where they live, not just by State, but where they are across this \ncountry, so one can identify them by sorting ZIP Codes or any other \ndefinition one wants. That is important.\n  And when the highest risk sexual predators are about to be released \nfrom American prisons, I believe States' attorneys must be notified so \nthey can properly take action for civil commitment in cases where they \nbelieve it is necessary. Mr. Rodriguez, in my judgment, should have \nbeen in prison, not walking the streets of Grand Forks, ND.\n  It is easy, perhaps, to suggest criticism of those who did not do \ntheir job. But that is not the point. The point is to try to protect \nothers in the future. I hope in the future, whether it is in Grand \nForks, ND, or along the streets of any other American city, that no \none--no one--has to confront a sexual predator who was just released \nfrom prison, and who we knew was violent. We should anticipate such \ncases, and make use of civil commitment laws. I hope this legislation \nmoves us in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation \nand hope we can take action on this legislation in the Congress soon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3256-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senate will continue \nconsideration of H.R. 4.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we begin debate on what the public \nat large would refer to as a welfare reform bill, a bill that would \nbuild upon very major changes that were made after 60 years of the \nprevious welfare legislation that did not accomplish its goals to one \nnow where we have had an opportunity since 1996 to move people from \nwelfare to work.\n  The public at large and sometimes even I refer to this legislation as \nwelfare reform, but our legislation is entitled ``The Personal \nResponsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act.'' If you \nhear us use the acronym P-R-I-D-E, PRIDE, this is the legislation that \nis before the Senate. I am very happy that we are finally able to \nconsider this legislation.\n  Going back to 1996, after years of debate and even after two vetoes \nby President Clinton, we finally had a Republican Congress pass, and a \nDemocratic President sign, the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. I emphasize that because the \nissue of welfare is highly charged politically. When you are going to \nmake major changes, as we did in 1996, it takes bipartisanship to \naccomplish those changes. That bipartisanship was between Democratic \nPresident Clinton and a Republican-controlled Congress.\n  The enactment of welfare reform ended the entitlement aspect of \nwelfare, the cash assistance part of it. The impetus for welfare reform \nwas generated by a number of factors, including public sentiment that \nthe welfare system needed overhauling. When campaigning for President, \nPresident Clinton promised, in his words, ``to end welfare as we know \nit.'' For the Republicans, during the campaign for Congress in 1994 \nwhen the Contract With America was the watch word of Republicans, \nwelfare reform was a key part of that. So we had a President promising \nto end welfare as we know it, we had Republicans putting it in their \nContract With America, and, finally, after 2 years, the legislation was \npassed at that time.\n  I would categorize the PRIDE legislation as moving on and fine-tuning \nthat basic underlying legislation which has sunset. The sunset was in \nthe 1996 legislation. When legislation sunsets, it must be reenacted by \nthe Congress of the United States or that part of the code goes off the \nbooks.\n  Quite honestly, there are Americans who have needs. There is still \nneed for\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nassistance, but the goal of that assistance is still as it has always \nbeen: to move people from welfare to work.\n  In the years leading up to the enactment of welfare reform in 1996, \nthe AFDC roles soared and costs increased. From 1988 through 1992, \nwelfare spending increased by billions of dollars. The welfare system \nwas attributed by many to contributing to a culture of isolation and \ndependence, persisting from one generation to another. Despite dire \npredictions to the contrary, the reforms in the 1996 act have produced \nvery positive results.\n  The welfare caseload has dropped dramatically. Between fiscal year \n1997 and fiscal year 2002, the average monthly number of welfare \nrecipients fell by 5.8 million or 53 percent of the previous high. \nChild poverty has also been reduced. Between 1996 and 2001, the \nnational child poverty rate fell by 20 percent. This decline is even \nmore marked for certain groups. We see the African-American children \npoverty rate dropping from nearly 40 percent to 30 percent, the lowest \nrate on record.\n  The Hispanic child poverty rate dropped from just slightly over 40 \npercent to 28 percent, the largest 5-year drop on record.\n  Employment rates of adult recipients has increased. In fiscal year \n2001, 27 percent of the adult recipients were employed, rising to about \n2.4 times the 1996 employment rate of 11 percent.\n  These reforms all stemmed from a work-first approach that emphasized \nan adult's attachment to the workforce. I believe we should continue \nand this legislation does build upon a work-first approach, and yet the \nneed for reform continues.\n  There are key provisions in the 1996 act which have not yielded the \ndesired results. Additionally, there are further reforms which should \nbe enacted, things that we have learned from the 1996 act, and we are \nfine-tuning the present legislation through this legislation before us. \nAs an example, the 1996 bill envisions a contingency fund which would \nprovide additional matching grants to needy States during economic \ndownturns.\n  However, during the recent recession, the first real test of the \ncontingency fund, no State was able to access the contingency fund. \nThis is because States must raise their own spending considerably \nduring a recession to meet the contingency fund State spending \nrequirements.\n  I am sure it was not the intent of the authors of the 1996 bill to \nmake the contingency fund inaccessible. The PRIDE bill before the \nSenate includes provisions which would liberalize the contingency fund \nto make it more accessible to needy States and to help more citizens of \ntheir States who have the need.\n  Another example would be the work participation rate. The 1996 \nwelfare reform bill envisioned a participation rate of 50 percent by \n2002. However, because of the way the caseload reduction credit has \nworked, many States have a marginal or even nonexistent work \nparticipation requirement, meaning they are meeting the requirements of \nexisting Federal law without putting one more person from the welfare \nrolls into the payrolls. The fact that the caseload reduction credit \nhas effectively neutralized the work participation rate requirement is \nthen a fundamental flaw in this 1996 law that PRIDE corrects.\n  The PRIDE bill does, in fact, correct this by replacing the caseload \nreduction credit with an employment credit. To ensure that the credit \ndoes not undermine the work participation rate, the credit would have a \nphased-in cap. Many have advocated that there needs to be a stronger \nmessage sent to States on the value of education as a means of getting \nout of poverty. Some have also indicated the need for increased child \ncare funding, as well as needed improvements to child support and \nenforcement policies.\n  The PRIDE legislation before the Senate increases opportunities for \neducation, opportunities for training, as well as support for the \nfamilies by increased funding for child care. Additionally, the PRIDE \nbill provides child support enhancements with more child support going \nto families. These reforms are a critical means that help families get \noff and stay off of welfare.\n  Two of the four purposes of the 1996 welfare act dealt with \nstrengthening two-parent families. So far, very few States have taken \nthe opportunity to develop and to implement innovative programs and \npolicies to address the issues of healthy two-parent marriages, even \nthough the 1996 law is very flexible on how that is to be done--\nobviously too flexible from the standpoint of it being a requirement \nthat the State ought to meet.\n  I strongly support marriage promotion activities as a means of \nimproving child well-being. Let nobody in this body or outside this \nbody say there is anything in this language that has anything to do \nwith forcing people into the institution of marriage. Well short of \nthat, this legislation does and should do things to emphasize the \nimportance of people who are in a married relationship, that they are \nless apt to be on welfare than families who are single parent.\n\n  This legislation provides funding for healthy marriage promotion \nactivities, as well as research, demonstrations and technical \nassistance to States in developing effective programs. Thus, while the \n1996 act made significant reforms, there remains more that should be \ndone to strengthen the current welfare delivery system. Those reforms \nare included in the PRIDE bill now before the Senate.\n  Recognizing the improvements that the 1996 reforms made, our Senate \nFinance Committee began deliberations by working off of current law and \nimproving it with priorities identified by Senators on and off the \nFinance Committee, as well as ideas that are coming from President \nBush's administration.\n  The Senate Finance Committee deliberations in many ways continued the \nwork done in the 107th Congress on the issues of welfare reform. As \nMembers know, the bill that then-Chairman Baucus produced in the second \nhalf of the 107th Congress, which went by the acronym WORK bill, was \nbased on the so-called tripartisan agreement at that time. This \ntripartisan agreement was a series of policy agreements reached by \nSenators Breaux, Rockefeller, Lincoln, and Jeffords from the Democratic \ncaucus, and Senators Hatch and Snowe from the Republican caucus. These \nMembers, along with then-Chairman Baucus, continued to play strong and \nimportant leadership roles on the Finance Committee relative to welfare \nreform.\n  I had a chance to review the work of the last Congress, which was the \ntripartisan agreement, and I noted similarities between what the \ntripartisan group proposed, what the PRIDE Act before us has in it, and \nalso the House-passed bill that passed early last year. That House-\npassed bill is largely based upon President Bush's proposal for welfare \nreform. I refer my colleagues to the various charts that I am going to \nput before them now, which highlight the many areas of common ground \nbetween last year's WORK bill and the House bill, and the PRIDE bill by \nwhich the present title is before the Senate. Admittedly, not all the \ndetails are exactly the same, but as my colleagues will see from these \ncharts, there is a great deal of common ground between these three \nbills. I think it is important to emphasize the similarities because \ntoo often on the Senate floor we have emphasis upon disagreements.\n  This common ground is building upon the bipartisanship that took \nplace in 1996 to move us to the present program.\n  There is common ground regarding keeping what works from the 1996 \nreform bill. Going down the chart from top to bottom, all three bills \nmaintain the basic block grant, continue the policy of no individual \nentitlement to assistance, and retain the lifetime 5-year time limit.\n  Both the bill of Senator Baucus, of last session, and the legislation \nnow before the Senate would maintain current sanction policy. The PRIDE \nbill continues to allow for 12 months of education and training, while \nthe House bill scales that back to 4 months and the bill of Senator \nBaucus would have increased that to 24 months.\n  Additionally, both the WORK bill and the PRIDE bill would maintain \nthe current list of core work and work readiness activities, although \nthe WORK bill would allow 8 weeks to be spent in job research.\n  Now we have a chart that deals with improving State flexibility. \nBefore I describe what is on this chart, we have had a great deal of \nemphasis upon letting States use this Federal legislation\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nwith some degree of flexibility. Frankly, it is very difficult for us \nto pour a mold in Washington called welfare reform and have it fit all \n50 States exactly the same way. What it might take for the State of \nIowa to meet the needs of a welfare family in Waterloo, IA, might be \nentirely different than in New York City. If you try to solve it in \nexactly the same way, you are probably going to waste money in New York \nor Waterloo or you might not accomplish as much in one city for that \nmoney as opposed to another. So let Albany, as the capital of New York, \nor let Des Moines, IA, as the capital of my State--let the legislators \nthere and administrators there fit this to meet their various needs.\n  I want to point, though, to the common ground in terms of improving \nState flexibility. Again, I am referring to the three proposals: The \nSenate bill from the last Congress, the Senate bill from this Congress, \nand the House-passed bill that is now in the Senate for our \nconsideration. All three proposals would allow for adults on \nassistance, with barriers to work, to engage in activities designed to \naddress those barriers and allow those barrier removal activities to \ncount toward a State work requirement for 3 months, provide for \nincreased access to emergency or contingency funds during an economic \ndownturn, and allow States to use their unobligated balances or \ncarryover funds for any welfare-related purpose. That would include \nchild care, whereas currently States can only use these funds for cash \nassistance. We give States much more flexibility to meet their needs \nbecause they know their needs better than we do.\n  Both the Senate bill of the 107th Congress as well as the Senate bill \nof the 108th Congress would allow for an additional 3 months of barrier \nremoval activities if combined with work. Both the WORK bill and the \nPRIDE bill include a provision allowing States to count longer duration \npostsecondary education towards their work requirement. This is a \nprovision patterned after the State of Maine's Parents as Scholars \nProgram.\n  We also have common ground between these three pieces of legislation \non strengthening work requirements and leading people into the world of \nwork. For 60 years we put welfare recipients out of sight, out of mind, \nout to the edges of society, guaranteeing a life of poverty. What we \nstarted doing in 1996, and we intend to continue to do through this \nlegislation, is move people from the world of welfare to the world of \nwork. The motivation behind that is you have to be in the world of work \nto have a chance to move up the economic ladder. You cannot move up the \neconomic ladder in the world of welfare. But where there are 138 \nmillion Americans in the world of work, that is where we need to have \nas many welfare recipients as we can so they can move out of poverty.\n\n  No child should be sentenced to a life of poverty, and I think we are \nshowing in the 1996 legislation, which we are now refining, that this \nhelps people move up the economic ladder. At least there is opportunity \nto move up the economic ladder where there is no opportunity to do that \nif you are relying on a welfare check.\n  I want to again emphasize there is common ground relative to \nstrengthening the work requirement. All three bills would increase a \nState's required participation rate, raise the time spent in core or \npriority activities, as well as assign partial credit for hours below \nthe standard. The PRIDE bill and the House bill would raise the \nstandard hour. The PRIDE bill and the WORK bill would replace the \ncaseload reduction credit with an employment credit based on \nlegislation introduced by the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  There is common ground on promoting healthy families. All three bills \nwould provide for universal engagement of improved child support \nprovisions, healthy marriage grants, as well as for responsible \nfatherhood grants. Both the WORK and the PRIDE bills would extend \ntransitional medical assistance for 5 years, with program \nsimplification that was authored by Senator Breaux of Louisiana.\n  It would allow for caregiving for a disabled child to count as work, \nand would require States to develop presanction review policies.\n  I have worked very hard to make sure that this is a bipartisan \nproduct. I have also been continually mindful of concerns raised by \nDemocratic colleagues that they have about this provision. In areas \nwhere we differ, I am more than happy to let the Senate work its will, \nand there are outstanding issues. There are key differences between \nlast year's Senate Finance Committee bill and this year's Senate \nFinance Committee bill. In my opinion, the most significant ones are \nthe level of child care funding available for States, about which there \nis going to be an amendment that we are going to be dealing with \nshortly. Another one would be 24 months versus 12 months of allowable \neducation and training. Another one would be eligibility for legal \nimmigrants, for welfare, Medicaid, and the children's health insurance \nprogram. Another one would be continuation of the expired State aid to \nfamilies of dependent children waiver; and, fifth, the standard hours \nfor calculating a State's work participation rate.\n  I am also aware there are Members who may wish to consider provisions \nincreasing the work requirement by broadening the family's account \ntoward the participation rate as well as increasing the standard hour.\n  Additionally, I have had Members tell me they want to consider \namendments requiring States to pose a full check sanction on adults who \nfail to comply with their self-sufficiency plans.\n  These are all things to which the Senate is entitled, guaranteed, to \nhave a healthy debate on. These are things that will be settled on the \nfloor of the Senate, if people want to pursue these differences of \nopinion.\n  However, at this point I want to spend some time discussing the \nissues surrounding the work requirement in PRIDE, specifically the \nissue of work hours for individuals receiving assistance. I want to \nclarify, first of all, something for the record. There is no Federal \nhour requirement on an adult receiving assistance.\n  I want to say that another way.\n  The Federal Government cannot make an individual welfare recipient \nwork 40 hours or 30 hours or 1 hour. Just as there is no longer an \nindividual entitlement to welfare, there is no individual requirement \nfor work hours. As the great baseball leader Casey Stengel used to say, \nLook it up.\n  There is a Federal requirement on the States to engage welfare \nclients in a variety of meaningful activities in order to meet a \nFederal work participation rate, and there are severe penalties on \nStates for failure to meet the Federal work participation rate.\n  Currently, in order for a State to count an adult recipient toward \nthe calculation of that State's work requirement, that adult must be \nengaged in priority work or work-related activities for at least 30 \nhours.\n  As you know, the majority of families receiving welfare don't want to \nbe on welfare. A recent study by the Mathematica Policy Research \nInstitute of low-income families in my State revealed that many of \nthose who ask for assistance ``felt that it sacrifices their \nindependence and pride to do so.''\n  In hearings as well as in townhall meetings in my State of Iowa, \nadults receiving assistance told me they desire to work. I took at \ntheir word Iowans who spoke to me of their desire to work, and that is \nwhy I have worked so hard to bring a bill forward that would encourage \nStates to redouble their efforts to engage adults receiving assistance \nin meaningful activities and better prepare them to enter the world of \nwork.\n  Consider the hypothetical case of Sara, a mom with two kids, who \nfinds herself in a crisis. A victim of domestic abuse, Sara is trying \nto make a better life for herself and her children. To that end, she \nmoves out of her abuser's home and attempts to find a way to support \nher family. Lacking a number of basic skills as well as needing some \ncounseling to deal with her history of abuse, Sara presents with a \nnumber of challenges and needs welfare to help support her family.\n  Under current law, States have a limited capacity to deal with Sara's \nissues and have those activities count toward a State work \nparticipation rate. Under current law, a State cannot count any \ndomestic violence counseling that may be offered to Sara toward their \nwork participation rate.\n  Sara knows she must work to support her family, so she begins \nimmediately\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\nlooking for work. She spends 6 weeks looking for a job and finally \nfinds a part-time job as a waitress working 6 hours a day for 4 days a \nweek. She continues to look for a better paying job for an hour a day \nas well as spending another hour a day in counseling provided to her by \nher own State.\n  I think many of us would agree that Sara is doing everything she can \nto try to move toward self-sufficiency and that her State by engaging \nher in counseling is doing its part as well. However, under current \nlaw, because she is only part time and because a State cannot count her \njob search after 6 weeks, and under current law domestic violence \ncounseling can never count, Sara does not count toward that State's \nparticipation rate, regardless of how hard she or the State make the \neffort for her to be in the work force. In other words, you either meet \nthe 30-hour standard and count or you don't.\n  Currently, the States report that the majority of adults--57 \npercent--receiving assistance engage in 0 hours of activity. Clearly, \nit is more difficult for States to work with adults who are not doing \nanything than to work with an adult working 29 hours and get her \nengaged in meaningful activities for another 5 hours.\n  It can be argued as well that it is more meaningful to help an adult \nmove from 0 to 20 hours of activity than to move an adult from 29 hours \nto 34 hours of activity; but under current law, a State has no \nincentive to work with that particular individual. It doesn't give them \ncredit, to the Federal Government, for doing the State's part under the \nwelfare-to-work law requirements\n  The administration's proposal for welfare reform reauthorization--\nlast year's Senate bill called the WORK bill and this year's PRIDE \nbill--allows States to get partial credit for hours below that standard \nhour requirement.\n  As my colleagues know, the standard hour is when an eligible parent \nor parents count as ``one family'' for purposes of calculating a \nState's work participation rate. Partial credit for hours below the \nstandard would give States a very strong incentive to work with adults \nwho may not be ready for full-time employment. I think we can all agree \nit is better for these adults to be doing something rather than \nnothing, languishing on welfare rolls until the time limit kicks in and \nthey have to go off assistance, having no skills to go get a job or \nskills to support their family.\n  I have another chart I would like to bring to your attention.\n  Our PRIDE bill is unique, however, insomuch as the legislation would \nestablish a series of ``tiers'' where partial credit is assigned along \nwith a band of hours.\n  For work or work-readiness activities in the 20-23 hour range, a \nState may claim credit for an adult with a child age 6 or older \ncounting as .675 of an entire family. For hours of 24-29 range, a State \nmay claim credit for an adult counting as .75 of a family. And for \nhours in the 30-33 range, a State may claim credit for an adult \ncounting as .875 of a family.\n  The PRIDE bill, consistent with last year's tripartisan proposal, \nestablishes a separate lower standard hour for parents with a child \nunder the age of 6 because of the greater need for attention of that \nchild. However, PRIDE sets a standard hour at 24, whereas the \ntripartisan proposal would have continued to set the standard hour for \na parent with a child under age 6 at 20 hours. States can also capture \na modest amount of extra credit for hours above this standard.\n  As a result of these provisions in the PRIDE Act, the Congressional \nResearch Service has calculated that overall, the nationwide work \nparticipation rate for States increases from a national average of 29 \npercent--without waivers--to 41 percent under our PRIDE legislation.\n  There are some States that have very low participation rates. I have \nincluded a number of provisions specifically intended to help those \nStates. Additionally, I am willing to work with Members representing \nthose States on measures we can take to assist those States in making \nimprovements in the way services are delivered and clients being \nengaged in those States.\n  When we talk about the work hours as they relate to the PRIDE bill, I \nthink it is important to bear in mind that the significant hour is not \nwhether it is 34 or 40 or 37, but the significant number of hours is 20 \nbecause that is where the partial credit begins.\n  Additionally, when we talk about the hours in the work requirement, \nthe important hour again is not 30 or 40, but the important hour is 24 \nbecause that is the threshold for core work activities.\n  Once a client meets the 24-hour threshold for core work activities, \nStates can count unlimited education, counseling, job search, or other \nbarrier-removal activities toward the State's participation rate.\n  So then, we go back to Sara, the young mother to whom I previously \nreferred, who, under current law--even though she was working 24 hours, \nand in counseling, and even looking for another job--did not count at \nall toward a State's participation rate and, consequently, would not \nget much attention from that State--the attention that is needed to \nimprove people's economic growth.\n  Under the legislation before the Senate this year, as opposed to what \ncurrent law has been since 1996, Sara would have up to 6 months allowed \nin barrier-removal activities, including domestic violence counseling \nand substance abuse counseling, that counts toward this State's \nparticipation rate, meeting the requirements of Federal law.\n  Once the 6 months are up, she has an additional 12 months that she \ncan spend in education and training.\n  Once those 12 months are up, if she works for 24 hours a week, spends \nan hour a day, 5 days a week, in domestic-abuse counseling, and looks \nfor a better job for an hour a day, 5 days a week, she then has reached \nthe point where she counts as one family, where the State recognizes \nher as a very significant individual, where the State, by paying \nattention to her, is going to get some credit. In other words, under \nthe legislation now before the Senate, Sara does count; whereas, under \ncurrent law, Sara does not count.\n  During the past 3 years of debate on the issue of welfare reform, I \nhave heard a number of different perspectives on the best approach to \ntake for the next phase of welfare reform.\n  Some have argued the way to go is to increase the time that adults \nreceiving assistance spend engaged in meaningful work activity. The \ncorrelation between full-time work and increased earnings is \ncompelling.\n  Some have suggested that increasing the amount of time allowed for \neducation and training is more important than increasing the time spent \nworking. The correlation between increased education and increased \nearnings, of course, is compelling as well.\n  Others believe that encouraging marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock \nbirths would net the best result.\n  Still others have suggested that increasing State flexibility should \nbe an integral part of any reform effort.\n  I firmly believe that when it comes to welfare reform, there is, in \nfact, no such thing as ``one size fits all.'' While education may be \nthe best approach for some, it may not be for others. Encouraging \nhealthy family formation may be just what one family needs, but perhaps \nthat approach would not be in the best interest of another family under \ndifferent circumstances.\n  The PRIDE bill takes a blended approach to welfare reform and strives \nto find balance among all these perspectives.\n  The legislation before the Senate increases the emphasis on work and \nwork-readiness activities, as well as increasing the flexibility for \nStates to engage adults in education and training activities. The PRIDE \nlegislation also provides resources to encourage States to develop \ninnovative family formation programs, while making it clear that \nparticipation in those programs must be voluntary, and the program must \nbe developed with domestic violence professionals.\n\n  I have a chart speaking to the factors that influence poverty rates. \nThis approach is consistent with the latest research; in other words, \nthe approach of flexibility--``one size fits all'' not working.\n  We have a recent policy brief that was released by the Brookings \nInstitution, and it was drafted by Ron Haskins and Isabel Sawhill. It \nis entitled ``Work and Marriage: The Way to End Poverty and Welfare.'' \nThe authors, using Census data and simple modeling, simulate\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\nthe effects of various factors on the poverty rate for families with \nchildren.\n  The poverty rate for families with children, in 2001, was 13 percent. \nNow, surely, everyone agrees that a central purpose of welfare reform \nis the reduction of poverty. As this chart clearly shows, the least \neffective factor in reducing poverty was to double a family's welfare \nbenefit. The most effective single way to reduce poverty was to work \nfull time. Indeed, according to these authors of the Brookings \nInstitute policy brief:\n\n       [F]ull-time work eliminates almost half of the poverty \n     experienced by families with children.\n\n  However, the most effective approach to reducing poverty was a \ncombination of work, marriage, education, and family-size reduction.\n  As colleagues can see from this chart, when the blended approach is \nadopted, poverty is reduced a staggering 9.3 percent, going from 13 \npercent down to 3.7 percent.\n  I find these numbers to be quite compelling. I am pleased that they \nreinforce the approach taken in this legislation before the Senate.\n  I know there are colleagues who have many thoughts on these pieces of \nlegislation, and we are going to have a very lively debate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2937\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Snowe, and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Grassley. He has worked very long and hard on this \nissue, and it has been very good to work with him. He has thought a lot \nabout these issues. He has worked hard to try to find a middle ground. \nHe wants to get things done, and I deeply appreciate that.\n  We are here today to reauthorize the 1996 welfare reform law. The \n1996 law has actually worked pretty well. I think all commentators \nwould agree with that statement. In fact, it has worked much better \nthan people thought it would work. It is not broken. It is not broken \nat all. And I think we need to guard against ``fixing'' something that \nis not broken. You know the old saying: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.'' I think that applies to the 1996 welfare statute.\n  As we go forward, we might ask ourselves whether we might do better \nsimply extending the existing 1996 law. Yes, we could make some \nmodifications. We would increase, for example, funding for child care \nto help parents get to work. But as the Senate considers proposed \nchanges, we might ask whether it would be better to stick with the 1996 \nact.\n  I will spend a little time today talking about the House bill. The \nHouse bill does not stick with the 1996 bill. The House of \nRepresentatives has\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nmade, frankly, some pretty dramatic changes--``fixes'' to a program \nthat many of us believe is not broken.\n  The Senate bill that Chairman Grassley has crafted tries to chart a \nmiddle course. Thus, the bill before us presents an opportunity to \nreflect on the lessons we have learned since 1996, and to incorporate \nthose lessons in the new bill.\n  We accomplished what we set out to do in 1996, and I am proud to have \nplayed a role in passing that law.\n  The 1996 welfare reform law was a landmark. The old system had \nfailed.\n  We were spending billions, but we had little to show for it. So we \ntried something new. We tried, in the words of the introduction to the \n1996 act ``to end the dependence of needy parents on government \nbenefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage.''\n  At the same time, the 1996 act was very controversial. In retrospect, \nit is clear that by and large we were headed in the right direction. I \ncall attention to the chart next to me. This chart essentially tells \nthe story. It is entitled ``Welfare Recipients as a Percentage of \nPopulation.'' Hundreds of thousands of people have left welfare and \nleft welfare for work. The number of folks on welfare, as you can tell, \nas a percentage of the American population, beginning in 1988, rose up \nto its peak in about 1994 and 1995. Then we passed the 1996 statute, \nand it has plummeted dramatically.\n  The next chart shows the changes in welfare recipient caseloads, from \n1996 to 2001. It shows that all States have shared in the success. The \ncaseload reduction has been highest for those States in red, that is \ngreater than a 70-percent reduction. In States represented by orange, \nthe reduction in welfare caseload has been between 50 and 70 percent. \nAnd States represented in yellow have a caseload reduction of less than \n50 percent but very significant. My State of Montana is an orange \nState. Montana reduced its welfare caseload by 56 percent between 1996 \nand 2001.\n  The New York Times reported last week that even with the weak economy \nwe have experienced lately, welfare rolls have declined in the past 3 \nyears in most States. That is, caseloads have decreased even as \nunemployment, poverty, and the number of food stamp recipients have \nincreased.\n  For example, in the State of Illinois, the number of families on \nwelfare fell 45 percent since January 2001. In New York, the number of \nfamilies on welfare declined about 40 percent since January of 2001. \nAnd in Texas, the number of families on welfare has declined 11 \npercent, again, in the last 3 years.\n  I would like now to show another chart. This is the child poverty \nrate. The child poverty rate has also declined since 1996, overall by \nabout 23 percent. As you can see, the child poverty rate in 1988 was \nroughly 20 percent. It increased during the 1990s, through 1992, and \npeaked around 1993. It has declined very significantly since that peak \nin 1993. However, look at the end, 2000 to 2002. It looks as though it \nis starting to increase slightly.\n  But despite our success, there is still more to be done. We are not \nout of the woods. Too many troubled families remain on the rolls. Too \nmany families struggle to raise children in poverty. In 2002, there \nwere 34.6 million Americans below the official poverty level. For a \nfamily of two, poverty is $12,490. 34.6 million Americans below that \nlevel. Thirty-seven percent of families in poverty are working.\n  I have another chart. This is the poverty rate. As this chart shows, \n1 in 10 Americans still live in poverty. That share has gone up in the \nlast couple years with the recession, and close to 17 percent of our \nchildren live in poverty. In Montana, 19 percent of all children live \nin poverty. Nationwide, 1 in 10 Americans.\n  Those numbers are simply too high. We must provide better \nopportunities for poor families to move off welfare, into the \nworkforce, and out of poverty for good. As successful as the 1996 bill \nhas been, these figures show there is more we have to do.\n  In my view, doing more means focusing more attention on the hardest \ncases; that is, on families who face complicated and difficult \nchallenges. For example, children with disabilities, adults with little \nor no education or work skills, people with mental health issues or \nsubstance abuse problems. Those are the hardest cases. We also need to \nfocus on the single mother with an autistic son who cannot care for \nhimself after school when she is at work.\n  We need to focus on families affected by mental health concerns that \nlimit their ability to engage in continuous full-time employment, and \nfamilies who have been hit by a health crisis and need help. Doing more \nmeans building on the partnership we established with the States back \nin 1996. It means letting States maintain the flexibility they have \nused to design their current successful welfare-to-work strategies. How \ndoes it best work for each State? All States are different, with \ndifferent populations, different issues. It means giving States new \noptions to address especially troubled families. And at the same time, \nit means maintaining and increasing help in building the work support \nsystem.\n  We learned, with the major reform in 1996, that getting a job is not \nalways a ticket out of poverty. We helped to get people off the welfare \nrolls by a dramatic amount, an average of about 50 percent, but still \npeople who leave are having a very tough time finding jobs. They are in \nvery dire straits. People find that the jobs pay too little. In \nMontana, we have the highest number of people working more than one job \njust to make ends meet because we have low wages and a poor economy. \nThose families who are just off of welfare are struggling. They need \naccess to education, to training. They need the opportunity to address \nmany of the barriers that prevent them from getting a job and keeping a \njob, and they need access to benefits such as food stamps, health care, \nand child care.\n\n  Child care is a huge concern. If you want to make a lasting \ndifference, we need to provide further help with child care, further \nhelp with health care, transportation, and other things that will help \nparents stay off welfare and thrive in the job market.\n  The success of the 1996 bill should have meant a quick and simple \nreauthorization, because we all, both sides, can agree that the law \nworks. But some want to leave the successful 1996 law behind them and \nmake dramatic changes. I call this a cut-and-run approach--leaving the \nStates and, more importantly, low-income families behind. The House-\npassed welfare reauthorization bill embodies this cut-and-run attitude. \nThe House bill would force States to use expensive workfare--or ``make \nwork''--models of welfare reform, where welfare recipients would \nparticipate in large-scale, unpaid, make-work programs such as cleaning \nup trash.\n  The House bill work requirements would force States to put welfare \nrecipients into make-work jobs. I mentioned trash pickup. There are \nmany other examples. Cleaning the streets is good for the streets, but \nwhere does it leave the welfare recipient after the cleanup is over? At \nthe end of a make-work job, welfare recipients have learned no new \nskills, and they are no closer to having a real job.\n  The House bill would push recipients into make-work programs instead \nof real private sector jobs that provide the meaningful work experience \nnecessary to survive in the job market. States mostly rejected this \none-size-fits-all workfare model years ago. States don't like it. They \nknow it doesn't work. State and local administrators have told us they \nneed, more than anything else, a full menu of strategies for the \ndifferent needs of individual parents, families, and communities.\n  The House bill, however, makes it harder to design services and \nstrategies that meet local needs. And it also fails to provide adequate \nfunding. As welfare rolls have fallen, States have used freed-up TANF \nfunds to support low-income working families--often those who have left \nwelfare to work in recent years. This is common sense and a proven \nstrategy for success. It works.\n  For a single mother, providing child care assistance can be the \nsingle most important factor for workplace success. But the lack of \nfunding in the House-passed bill means States would have little choice \nbut to shift funds away from programs that help keep low-income parents \nworking to much more expensive make-work programs for those still on \nwelfare.\n  This would be a mistake, as it would force working families to return \nto the\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nwelfare rolls. It would mean cutting and running on those working \nfamilies whose success we have been celebrating.\n  It doesn't make sense to abandon work supports to pay for make-work \nactivities, but States report that the approach in the House bill would \ndo just that: it would require States to cut funding for these \nsuccessful work support services to pay for large, expensive, and \nunproven make-work programs for those remaining on the rolls.\n  Education and training clearly are critical factors in getting people \ninto jobs that pay more. In a rural State such as Montana, access to \neducation and training represents a clear path out of poverty. We need \nto ensure that America's needy families have access to such paths. And \nStates need flexibility so they can provide these programs.\n  All States are different. In States such as mine, making welfare \nreform work means making it work for American Indians. More than a \nquarter of American Indians live in poverty--more than twice the \nnational average. In Montana, American Indians make up a full one-half \nof our welfare caseload. We needed flexibility to address that.\n  I appreciate that the chairman has included provisions to help Native \nAmericans. But to make a real difference for welfare reform in Indian \ncountry will require real resources.\n  Tribes need support to operate TANF for themselves and help with \neconomic development. Our work is not done when there are still places \nin America where most adults don't have jobs. Flexibility must be \nmaintained.\n  Back in 1996, we asked the States to design a welfare program to \naddress their specific needs. Some States applied for waivers to do \njust that. Those waivers have been a vital aspect to welfare reform's \nsuccess. It is important to allow States to continue with their waivers \nand to ensure States continue to have flexibility to make welfare \nreform work. Dictating prescriptive requirements and unfunded mandates \nto States is unnecessary, particularly when so many parents are already \nparticipating in work-related activities.\n  In sum, the House bill is sure to undermine the success of the 1996 \nlaw. It would effectively eliminate the ability of States to employ \nproven welfare-to-work strategies, and it would virtually wipe out the \nprogress made in the last 6 years to use TANF and child care funds to \n``make work pay.''\n  The House approach would force States to divert dollars to make-work \nprograms. It would thus divert funds from child care, where funds are \nneeded. Future funding for child care and other work supports would be \nharder than ever to secure.\n  It seems to me that the House program is designed to fail. The House \napproach is difficult for would-be recipients to access. And States \nwill have a hard time making it work. In the prophetic words of one \nTANF administrator:\n\n       [The House approach] is part of a larger effort . . . to \n     set unattainable goals for States, so that Washington can \n     generate budget savings and say that social programs don't \n     work.\n\n  That would be irresponsible. That would be breaking something that is \nfixed. Whatever we do here, we need to ensure that TANF continues to \nwork.\n  I applaud Chairman Grassley for trying to do better. Compared with \nthe House-passed bill, chairman's bill has fewer mandates and less need \nfor States to adopt workfare programs, which I find so reprehensible in \nthe House-passed bill.\n  Yet I remain concerned that the bill before us doesn't provide States \nwith enough new flexibility in areas such as training and education, or \nin determining welfare-to-work strategies, particularly in States with \nspecific needs like rural States. I am also concerned that it doesn't \nprovide enough child care funding.\n  During this debate, Senators will offer amendments to address these \nshortcomings. An amendment will be offered to increase child care \nfunding so that parents can go to work. Senators Snowe and Dodd will \noffer that amendment today. I believe the chairman already has offered \nthat amendment on behalf of Senators Snowe and Dodd.\n  An amendment will be offered on this bill that will allow recipients \nto continue their education to gain job skills. Senators Levin \nand Jeffords will offer that amendment.\n\n  Amendments will be offered making TANF work for immigrants. Senators \nGraham and Clinton will focus their efforts on these initiatives. Also, \nan amendment will seek to preserve the flexibility that States had \nunder the 1996 law. Senators Bingaman and Wyden will be offering that \none.\n  Of course, we should also protect the civil rights of workers and of \nchildren in this law. We should make sure to get the balance right \nbetween State incentives and accountability.\n  Welfare reform is working. Let's build on that success and build on \nour partnership with States. By continuing to work together, we can \nachieve a successful bill.\n  We can strengthen existing programs to address the needs of America's \nstruggling families. We can give further support to those who have \nsuccessfully moved from welfare to work.\n  Let us not cut and run. Let us not ``fix'' what is not broken. \nRather, let us build on the success of the 1996 law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an amendment \nthat I know has already been offered to the Senate on the pending \nlegislation, the Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for \nEveryone Act, known as the PRIDE Act.\n  I am proud to have authored this amendment along with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Dodd. Without question, Senator Dodd has been a \nfearless and unyielding champion in increasing both the quality of and \nfunding for child care in America. He has been a tremendous friend to \nfamilies and children. I appreciate his dedication and advocacy to \nthese causes.\n  It is regrettable that Senator Dodd could not be here today in person \nto offer this amendment. As our colleagues know too well, disasters do \noccur from time to time in our States, and they understandably take \nprecedent. He is in Connecticut today addressing issues related to a \nmajor highway accident that closed Interstate 95 last Thursday. This \naccident had an enormous impact on the people of Connecticut but also \nother States that rely on the interstate for travel or commerce. It is \na loss of billions of dollars. Senator Dodd is working with State and \nFederal officials to restore travel in this vital transportation \nartery, and today he is where he should be--working on behalf of the \npeople in his State. I look forward to hearing from him tomorrow on \nthis amendment.\n  I also want to recognize and thank Senators Hatch, Alexander, and \nCarper, who approached me sometime ago on this vital issue regarding \nchild care in the welfare reauthorization and a strong desire to work \ntogether to ensure that this issue would be addressed and be given \npriority consideration in the Senate. I appreciate their efforts as \nwell as the commitment and dedication of other cosponsors: Senators \nBingaman, Rockefeller, Collins, Landrieu, Murray, Jeffords, Boxer, \nChafee, Lincoln, Clinton, and Mikulski. I appreciate the fact that they \nhave made it a broad bipartisan amendment.\n  Before I explain the amendment before us and why it is such a \ncritical component of this debate, I, too, want to recognize the work \nof the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, who has \nbeen tireless in his perseverance, patience, and commitment to ensuring \nthat the reauthorization of this legislation would be completed in this \nCongress. The fact that we have been able to report this legislation \nout of the Finance Committee is in no small part due to his efforts to \nmake sure it became a reality. I thank the majority leader, as well, \nfor his commitment to this issue so that we were able to bring up this \nbill, finally, for consideration.\n  Also, I want to recognize the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Baucus, for their work, along with the \nmajority leader and Chairman Grassley, who\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nscheduled this debate so that, hopefully, we can complete the work on \nthis reauthorization.\n  It goes without saying that this day is long overdue regarding our \nactions for this reauthorization. We have had six extensions in 18 \nmonths after the original expiration of this law.\n  As we well recall, in 2002, the Finance Committee did pass this \nlegislation, but, regrettably, it was not brought up on the floor for \nSenate consideration. So we have had to repeatedly extend this \nlegislation, and the States and the caseloads were left without any \nkind of specific blueprint for action in the future.\n  Today, hopefully, we begin the last leg of this journey toward giving \nthe States their plan of action for the next 5 years with respect to \nwelfare reform and build upon the successes of the past, as well as \naddressing some of the remaining issues that certainly have manifest \nitself in the last 5 years with respect to what my amendment will be \naddressing.\n  The bill before us today is predicated on the administration's \nproposal which not only strengthens work requirements, but also allows \nStates to concentrate on removing barriers to employment, giving TANF \nrecipients up to 6 months during which time they can focus, without \ninterruption, on becoming more employable, to remove those barriers \nthat prevent them from being able to seek employment. So that means \nthey can have the opportunities for adult literacy, substance abuse \ntreatment, or taking advantage of other educational opportunities, such \nas vocational education or technical training.\n  Moreover, the bill rightly recognizes that some families have longer \nterm barriers that they must also face and overcome. For example, this \nlegislation includes provisions which ensure that under certain \ncircumstances, caretakers for disabled dependents meet the requirements \nfor obtaining support as well. I thank Senator Grassley for working \nwith me to include these provisions.\n  Another example of how this bill will improve the employability and \nlikelihood of successful transition from welfare to work, the bill \nbefore us today includes provisions based on a widely praised program \nthat happens to be located in my State of Maine, known as the Parents \nas Scholars Program.\n  We should be able to agree that increased education is another \ncritical factor in whether a person will transition off welfare, be \nable to not only maintain a job, but to secure one that provides a \ndecent income. That is why I have championed these provisions \nrepeatedly which will allow a number of qualified, motivated welfare \nparents to take part in longer duration and postsecondary education \nwhile on the caseload.\n  Parents as Scholars has been extraordinarily successful in my State, \nwith graduates averaging a 50-percent increase in salaries, and with 90 \npercent of working graduates leaving welfare behind permanently. It is \nbecause of this record of success that I am very pleased that during \nthe Finance Committee markup, my amendment giving all TANF parents \nacross the Nation the benefit of accessing this education program was \naccepted.\n  This program, as I said, has been not only successful, but I think it \nalso ultimately will be widely available across the country because \naccess to education should not be a question of geography.\n  This legislation also reflects our desire to afford the States \nflexibility by providing partial credit toward a State's work \nparticipation rate when there is partial compliance with hourly \nrequirements by recipients. I believe this is a commonsense addition to \ncurrent law that will fuel this program's success for years to come, \nwhile laying the groundwork for States to help clients become employed \nand stay employed, which, after all, was the original goal of the \nlandmark 1996 reform act.\n\n  I thank Senator Lincoln for offering this provision because I do \nthink it goes a long way to addressing some of the issues that were \nraised in the last welfare reform act.\n  I am very pleased this legislation before us also builds upon the \ntripartisan legislation on which many of us on the Finance Committee \nworked in 2002. Senator Hatch, Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Rockefeller, and I included provisions that \nnow have also been incorporated in this legislation concerning child \nsupport distribution, the employment credit, education and training \nrequirements, and much of our universal engagement provisions and \nadjustments to the contingency fund.\n  At the same time, this bill also reflects a considerable good-faith \neffort to close some of the political and policy gaps that existed \nwithin the committee at the time of the markup. I know many of my \nRepublican colleagues would have preferred additional workups similar \nto what the President had proposed--40 hours instead of the 34--but we \nwere willing to compromise in order to advance this benchmark \nlegislation.\n  It was in the spirit of that compromise that I supported the \nlegislation in the Finance Committee, recognizing that, yes, I would \nhave preferred a significantly greater funding for child care, but at \nthe same time I know there has been some disagreement on this side of \nthe aisle as to how much we can even afford or should do with respect \nto child care funding in the welfare reauthorization. I refrained from \noffering that amendment in the committee so that we could have the \nopportunity to bridge these gaps on the floor of the Senate and to move \nthis legislation forward.\n  The amendment I am offering today will provide $6 billion in new \nmandatory child care funding which I think represents an attempt to \nguarantee that there will be no structural weaknesses in the PRIDE Act \nthat may undermine its ultimate effectiveness or success.\n  I am very pleased that Chairman Grassley gave me the opportunity to \nhave priority recognition to offer this amendment today that was part \nof the agreement we reached in the Finance Committee because I hope it \nwill set a bipartisan tone for the debate to come.\n  This reauthorization is critical to almost 5 million people who are \non welfare today. I am convinced it is our duty and our obligation to \ndo all that we can to clear the political barriers, the policy \nbarriers, overcome all the obstacles that we ultimately engage in on \nthe floor of the Senate, but, in the final analysis, we ought to be in \na position to vote on the welfare reauthorization and extend this law.\n  This $6 billion increase in new mandatory child care certainly should \nmove us in that direction. I am adding this today because I think this \namount is commensurate with the real and current needs. To understand \nhow these needs developed and why this amount of funding is essential \nis important to understand because as we set out to reauthorize the \n1996 law, we have to reexamine some of the decisions and some of the \nchoices that were made at the time that now has led us to this point \nthat I think compels us to offer more money in terms of child care.\n\n  One of the decisions that Congress made back in 1996 was to ensure \nthat we would have the necessary support systems to allow welfare \nrecipients, as they transition into the workplace and access full-time \nemployment, to have all of the support that is going to be absolutely \nvital to make that employment a success, as well as accessible.\n  These types of assistance to working parents who generally are \nemployed at minimum-wage jobs allow them to make ends meet and to make \na permanent transition from welfare to work. One of the most critical \ntypes of work support we can offer these families is quality child \ncare. Without good child care, a parent is left with only two choices: \nto leave a child in an unsafe and often unsupervised situation, or not \nto work, both of which are lose-lose situations.\n  If the aim of welfare reform is to move people off the welfare rolls \nand on to the payrolls, providing support in the form of quality \naffordable child care is a prerequisite to realizing that goal. Of \ncourse, as with anything else, child care comes with a price. In some \nStates, it can cost as much as a year's tuition in a public college. \nFactor in additional costs of infant care or odd-hour care, such as \nnights or weekends or care for children with special needs, and the \nchallenge increases significantly. So for a parent working toward \nfinancial independence, typically earning minimum wage, it is not hard \nto see how child care can be the budget\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nbuster that compels a family to retreat back into welfare.\n  This battle was also fought by families who are employed in full-\ntime, lower wage jobs, families not receiving cash welfare assistance, \nbut who only earn $15,000 to $20,000 per year.\n  Almost 2 years ago, a constituent of mine came to Washington to \ntestify before Senator Dodd's Subcommittee on Children and Families. \nSheila Merkinson, a resident of Maine, testified her childcare costs \nabsorbed almost 48 percent of her weekly income. Even though she is \neligible for aid, she receives no childcare assistance because the need \nexceeds the income eligibility requirements in our State.\n  At that time, Sheila stated she had been on the waiting list for \nchildcare subsidies 6 months, four of them while she was working, and \nsleeping on a couch during that entire time period because she could \nnot afford to pay the rent on her $18,000 yearly income.\n  I also remember reading several years ago about a mother in Maine \nwhose only choice for a steady job was working the night shift at the \nlocal mill. Because she lived in a rural area with no family nearby, \nshe was forced to choose between losing her job or tucking her \nelementary schoolage children into bed at night, locking the doors \nbehind her, and going to work. Affordable childcare was not a reality \nfor her and so she did what she deemed was best, to go to work and earn \nthe money she required to support her children. In the end, the courts \nmade a third choice for this mother. They took her children away from \nher.\n  We have no rhyme or reason to put people who care about their own \nchildren in untenable situations where they are compelled to make these \nunpalatable choices. This amendment will help ensure we can prevent \nthese types of circumstances so many families face in the real world \ntoday.\n  These are but two of the life stories that bring me to the point of \noffering this amendment and providing the mandatory childcare funds of \nmore than $6 billion for the next 5 years. These are families who \nreally are the essence of what this debate is all about.\n  Back in 1996, as this chart would illustrate, Congress recognized \nwhen we created the TANF program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies, formed the childcare and development block grant, because we \nhad a myriad of programs that provided various funding streams for \nchildcare, we had a commitment to serve the families on welfare. That \nis why we consolidated more than four programs into the childcare and \ndevelopment block grant, so that we had a commitment to serve not only \nthose who are on welfare, those who are transitioning off welfare, \nthose who were not on welfare but were at the risk of falling onto \nwelfare caseloads.\n  Finally we decided we should coordinate and consolidate these \nprograms to create this block grant with the intent of serving those \nlow-income families that may be employed but still require some kind of \nassistance because of the high cost of childcare. We have this \ncoordinated development block grant on childcare that is aimed at \nserving the needs of each of these populations.\n  While the Federal law sets the ceiling, the States are able to \ndetermine their own eligibility requirements. Yet according to most \nestimates, only one in seven eligible children receives this kind of \nassistance. It is not surprising when one considers that in 2003 alone, \nnearly every State reduced childcare spending and 16 States reduced \neligibility levels so fewer children would qualify.\n\n  Even when our eligibility guidelines are high, most States are unable \nto attain them. In fact, according to the 2004-2005 State plans in at \nleast five States, a family is not eligible for the childcare \ndevelopment block grant if the family earns more than $20,000 per year. \nSo clearly there remains a pressing need.\n  While the focus of this debate is the TANF population, as well it \nshould be, it cannot be to the exclusion of all of those lower income \nfamilies who are not on welfare. I am convinced that access to this \ncritical work support makes all the difference in a successful \ntransition from welfare to work, and to help ensure these families do \nnot retreat back into welfare, and at the same time that we allow them \nto achieve self-sufficiency. That is the goal of any welfare reform act \nand that is what it should be. According to a 2002 study, single \nmothers with young children who receive childcare assistance are 40 \npercent more likely to be employed after 2 years than mothers who did \nnot receive such assistance.\n  The study goes on to say former welfare recipients who receive \nchildcare are 82 percent more likely to be employed after 2 years than \nthose who do not receive such support. These findings make sense, as \nfar too often, for many single parents, unaffordable, unavailable, or \nunreliable childcare is the chief barrier to steady employment.\n  Over the past few years, States have been experiencing unprecedented \nfiscal crises which are resulting in cutbacks to crucial services for \nlow-income families and children. Severely limited resources are \ndriving States to make some difficult tradeoffs, when it comes to \npolicies, among equally deserving groups of eligible families. It is \nnot unreasonable for a State to conclude that TANF families subject to \nwork requirements in a maximum 5-year time limit or families \ntransitioning off TANF should get priority over families who have not \nreceived welfare.\n  However, as a result of these decisions many vulnerable low-income \nworking families who require childcare assistance will not be able to \nsupport their families and remain off welfare. That is a reality.\n  The worst-case scenario would be one in which limits on childcare \nsubsidies for lower income working families begin to act as a \ndisincentive. Families transitioning off welfare or low-income families \nstruggling to stay off welfare rolls could easily deduce the effort \nsimply was not worth it.\n  In May of 2003, GAO issued a report that suggests this possibility \nmay exist. It states that a change in priority status can result in \nfamilies losing benefits.\n  For example, in two States, families who leave TANF lose all of their \nbenefits. In seven States, when a family comes to the end of a State's \ntransition period, this can result in their losing assistance \naltogether.\n  Considering that childcare for a single child can easily cost between \n$4,000 and $10,000 yearly, it is not difficult to understand why a \nfamily affected in this way might have no other choice but to remain on \nwelfare.\n  Providing a firm foundation and the tools necessary to make a \nsuccessful transition to independence was the promise we made and one \nwe must honor. So the amendment we are offering to this pending \nlegislation would fulfill our commitment to the States by increasing \nthe amount of mandatory childcare funding that is authorized under this \nlegislation. We can do that today by passing this bipartisan amendment.\n\n  I know some would say there is an abundance of funding and that the \nestimates of unmet needs are baseless. My response to those critics is \nthis: Ask the more than 605,000 eligible children on waiting lists in \n24 States and the District of Columbia if there is sufficient funding. \nMany have argued since there are waiting lists in only less than half \nthe States, then the rest of the States do not have unmet needs. Well, \nthis is patently untrue.\n  The truth of the matter is not every State keeps a waiting list. \nAgain, they feel it is a fruitless endeavor, because they are elevating \nexpectations knowing that those expectations simply cannot be fulfilled \nbecause they do not have the funding for childcare. Many States cap the \nnumber of names allowed to appear on the waiting list, again because \nthey know they will not be able to fulfill their requirements. They do \nnot want to create the kind of hope among people that they will get the \nsupport ultimately when they know it simply will not be possible.\n  Consider that if one is a mother residing in California and she went \nto the State's welfare office and they told her get in line, she is No. \n280,001. How likely is it she will bother to put her name on the \nwaiting list? If a counselor in New York City told a mother her child \nwould be No. 46,001, would she take the time to sign up? And even if \nshe did, would she ultimately get the childcare support she needed? Not \nlikely.\n  Another question is: How many childcare slots would be generated by \nthe $6 billion included in our amendment? We cannot say for certain, \nbut if we do not provide this funding there\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nwill be hundreds of thousands of children without any support under \nthis welfare reauthorization.\n  We currently have 2 million children receiving child care subsidies. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would cost $4.5 \nbillion to ensure that all 2 million children currently--I emphasize \ncurrently--receiving subsidies will be able to continue receiving that \nlevel of support over the next 5 years, during the course of this \nreauthorization. The underlying legislation that is before the Senate \nincludes $1 billion in mandatory childcare funding which, according to \nCBO, may well cover the estimated cost for the new work requirements \nand the State participation rates of somewhere between $1 billion to \n$1.5 billion of increased child care as they relate to these expanded \nrequirements under this legislation.\n  Just to maintain exactly what is in current law for the 2 million \nchildren costs $4.5 billion, and the increase, the new increase under \nthis legislation, would require another $1 billion to $1.5 billion.\n  What we are saying is, just given where we are today, we could have \n400,000 children removed from the caseload without this kind of money--\n400,000 if we do not support the pending amendment.\n  It is imperative that we pass this amendment to ensure the States \nwill be in a position to provide the level of support they are \ncurrently providing to these families--just to maintain the status quo.\n  The legislation of the chairman provides a strong start by adding the \n$1 billion to pay for these increased work requirements, but I believe, \nSenator Dodd believes, and all the cosponsors of this amendment believe \nwe should and must do more. The PRIDE Act seeks to build upon our very \nsuccessful effort in 1996. We transformed the welfare system as we know \nit. It is landmark legislation that was an unprecedented success. We \nwere able to convert an old entitlement system into a temporary program \nthat helps our most fragile population take those critical first steps \ntoward economic self-sufficiency. I believe our amendment strengthens \nthis effort by ensuring that mothers struggling to move themselves off \nthe welfare rolls will have the kind of assistance they need in order \nto succeed.\n  The good news is we will be able to do this with the kind of support \nthat is essential. We have an offset in this amendment that includes \nthe Customs user fees on merchandise that is processed through Customs. \nIt is obviously important so we don't have a budget point of order. \nSome have said we have used this in the past and most specifically it \nis on the legislation that is also being currently considered by the \nSenate on the Foreign Sales Corporation Act for international tax \nrelief for manufacturers. However, that legislation includes up to $130 \nbillion in revenue offsets. We are using $6 billion of the $17 billion \nthat has been incorporated in that legislation regarding Customs fees.\n  I believe there will be sufficient offsets to address both that \nlegislation and this one as well. The amendment we are offering today \nbuilds on the work that has been incorporated in the underlying \nlegislation that was reported out of the Finance Committee. Like many \nof my colleagues on that committee, Chairman Grassley, Senator Dodd, \nand all of those who support this effort here today, we are trying to \nbuild upon the major steps that were taken in the 1996 Act, which I \nthink has made great strides toward helping lower-income families \nachieving the American dream and ultimately achieving self-\ndetermination and self-sufficiency.\n  There is an important difference between giving someone a handout and \noffering them a hand up. I believe this amendment to the PRIDE Act \nbuilds upon that distinction. That is why I am so pleased to have the \nkind of bipartisan support that has been given to this amendment. I do \nbelieve it is a strong step in the right direction. Granted, it is not \ngoing to address all the demands and needs across America, but \ncertainly it will go a long way toward understanding and recognizing \nthe reality that if we don't do this, we leave families and children in \nan untenable situation.\n  I happen to believe this amendment will strengthen our ability to \npass this welfare reauthorization, that the States need to give \nguidance and direction for the future. We cannot allow States to live \nin statutory limbo and we can't allow families to live in limbo as \nwell.\n  I hope this amendment will receive strong support here in the Senate, \nreflecting the strong bipartisan cosponsorship of this amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the pending amendment is the \nSnowe-Dodd amendment. I join with the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Connecticut in hoping that the Senate will welcome and \nsupport this amendment. I pay tribute to the Senator from Maine for her \nlongstanding work in support of child care, and, of course, I commend \nmy friend and colleague from Connecticut who unfortunately is not here \ntoday but wanted very much to be here today. He will be speaking in \nstrong support of this amendment during its consideration tomorrow.\n  As we know, Senator Dodd is the leader on children's issues. A number \nof those issues go through the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and all of us on that committee welcome his leadership on \nthis issue as well many others.\n  I commend our leaders, and I commend the floor managers.\n  This will be the first amendment that we will consider. And, \nhopefully, it will have strong support. I will take the time at another \ntime to outline the extraordinary needs of child care in my own State. \nBut I rise for a different purpose at this time.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Iowa on his feet. I intend to \nspeak briefly about the minimum wage issue, and then to offer it not as \na substitute but to get in the queue for consideration of amendments as \nwe are considering this welfare reform program.\n  The Senator from North Dakota was here a moment ago and desired the \nopportunity to be able to speak. I don't know whether there is any \nreason to object. He wanted to have an opportunity to speak for up to \n20 minutes, I believe, following my statement. Generally, I wanted to \ntalk to the floor managers about that, but I didn't have the \nopportunity to do so. If there is a Republican who wants to speak after \nI speak, then he could be the one who might be recognized after that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't think we have any objection to \nthat. The only speaker I had on this side who wanted to speak was the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander. He wanted to speak for a little \nwhile on the amendment of the Senator from Maine. Other than that, I \ndon't have any requests on this side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that he be able \nto follow for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend and \ncolleague from Iowa talking about this legislation. And one of the \nphrases he expressed was that no one who works in this country ought to \nlive in poverty. I agree with that. I think one of the best ways of \ndoing it is to ensure that work pays.\n  One of the best ways to make sure work pays is to make sure that \nthose who are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder--those who make \nthe minimum wage--are going to have a livable wage.\n  What we know is that we have not increased the minimum wage for some \n7 years. As a result of the failure of increasing the minimum wage in 7 \nyears, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has decreased \ndramatically. If we are interested in making work pay, we have to make \nwork pay, and that means an increase in the minimum wage.\n  At the appropriate time during the course of this debate, we will \nhave the\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\nopportunity to vote on an increase in the minimum wage to make the \nminimum wage go up from $5.15 to $7 an hour for those families working \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year.\n  Let me share with the Members what has happened to the purchasing \npower of the minimum wage. If we go back to 1968, the minimum wage \ntoday would be $8.50 an hour. It is now $5.15. If we look at the \nconsistency, the purchasing value, it will be $4.98 in the next few \nyears if we don't act now.\n  Look at this chart. The minimum wage no longer lifts a family out of \npoverty. Look at this red line indicating what a family of three would \nneed in order to be able to rise out of poverty. In 1968, we were able \nto--and, again, briefly around 1980--get the minimum wage up so \nfamilies could live outside of poverty.\n\n  If you look at the flat line, you will see that the lines are going \ndown. The poverty line is here. People are working longer and harder \nand have difficulty making ends meet.\n  Every day that we delay the minimum wage, workers fall farther and \nfarther behind. All of the gains of 1996 in minimum wage increases have \nalready been lost.\n  This welfare bill is about workers. It is about moving people from \nwelfare into work. It is very interesting. Of those single mothers who \nmoved off welfare into work before the recession began, one-half of \nthose jobs have now been lost due to the recession. I don't know what \npercentage of those people used up all their benefits, but a good chunk \nhave. I don't know what those individuals are doing, but we do know \nthat the amount of poverty, child poverty and hunger in the families \nacross this country, is continuing to go up.\n  We lose sight of the fact that over the history of the minimum wage, \nthis has been a bipartisan effort. If you look back over the number of \ntimes this has been raised--10 or 11 times--go back to Franklin \nRoosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, President Kennedy, Lyndon \nJohnson, and President Ford, President Carter, and then it was \nPresident Bush, then it was President Clinton, this has been a \nbipartisan effort. Republicans and Democrats alike understand if people \nare going to work hard, we ought to be able to make sure they are \ntreated fairly.\n  The increase in the minimum wage that we are talking about in this \namendment would mean $3,800 in additional income once it's fully phased \nin over the period of the 2\\1/2\\ years. That would be more than 2 years \nof child care; it would be 2 years of health care. It would be full \ntuition to a community college for a child who is the son or daughter \nof a minimum-wage worker. It would be a year and a half of heat or \nelectricity for a family. It would be more than a year of groceries, \nand more than 9 months of rent. That may not sound like much to many \naround here, but those are the facts. It would make an enormous \ndifference to people who are working.\n  What we see is 3 million more Americans today are living in poverty. \nThere were 31 million in the year 2000, and now it is 34.6 million, \nwhich means 3 million more people are living in poverty.\n  We can do something about that by increasing the minimum wage.\n  One of the saddest comments that I discovered as we looked through \nthe various factual material in preparation for this debate is, \naccording to the Families and Work Institute, three of the top four \nthings children would like to change about their working parents is \nthey wish their parents were less stressed out by work, less tired \nbecause of work, and could spend more time with them.\n  This is a family issue. We hear a great deal in this body about \nfamily issues and family values. Increasing the minimum wage is a \nfamily issue.\n  Who are these people? Who are these people who earn the minimum wage?\n  Well, first of all, they are the men and women who work in buildings \nall over this country at nighttime from which American commerce has \ntheir offices. In large buildings and small, they work in long, \ndifficult, tough jobs, but they are men and women of pride. They are \nmen and women of dignity. They take pride in doing a job well. They are \nnot only cleaners, but they are also assistant teachers in many of the \nschools across this country.\n  They also work in nursing homes helping to take care of parents--\nparents who have served in the Armed Forces, fought in the Korean war, \nperhaps even in Vietnam, and maybe going back to even World War II--men \nand women who brought this country out of the Depression, men and women \nwho have suffered and sacrificed to benefit their children. Many \nminimum-wage workers work in these nursing homes--men and women of \ndignity.\n  Sixty-one percent of those who receive the minimum wage are women. \nThis is a women's issue because the great majority of recipients of the \nminimum wage are women. It is a children's issue because many of those \nwomen have children. They are single heads of households, and many of \nthem have children. So it is a women's issue, it is a children's issue, \nand it is a civil rights issue because so many of those who work at the \nminimum wage are men and women of color.\n  And, most of all, it is a fairness issue. The issue that is going to \nbe before the Senate is whether we believe someone who works 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks of the year, ought to have a living wage. And if there \nis one issue Americans understand, it is the issue of fairness.\n  This is about fairness. This issue is about fairness. That is why we \nwelcome the opportunity to offer this amendment. It should not be a \npartisan issue. We should not be denied the opportunity to have the \nvote, and we are going to stay after it until we have the vote.\n  So I wanted to take a few moments on this issue because it is a \nmatter of such importance. I am going to go over the statistics in \ngreater degree about what has been happening to women and to children \nin poverty in this country. I am going to do that at a time when I will \nhave the chance to have the full debate for the consideration of this \namendment.\n  I have the amendment. I indicated to the floor managers that I \nintended to offer it. I ask unanimous consent that after the \nconsideration of the Snowe-Dodd amendment, that the amendment which I \nsend to the desk now, on behalf of myself and Senator Daschle, be \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be \nconsidered within the first four amendments that we have on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, we are beginning to see what we \nhave seen at other times; that is, on the other side there is \nobjection. We listened to them talk about how they wanted to have \nworkers work in this country, and now, evidently, there is objection. \nAnd I do not consider this to be by my friend, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, but there is clearly an objection by the Republican \nleadership to get a consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that before we have final passage, we have a \nvote, up and down, on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President--and I \nwill object--I want to take advantage of this opportunity to say that \nthere are a lot of very important pieces of legislation that we have \nbefore this body that are bipartisan that need to be passed.\n  Two weeks ago, we had a bill dealing with outsourcing and the efforts \nto create manufacturing jobs in America by giving a tax advantage to \nmanufacturers that manufacture here. It is a bipartisan bill, voted out \nof the Senate Finance Committee with only two dissenting votes, and \nthose were Republican votes. So, overwhelmingly, people on the other \nside of the aisle know that bill has to pass.\n  But time after time we deal with nongermane amendments that distract \nfrom the efforts of this Senate to do things that create jobs in \nAmerica and, in this particular instance, move people from welfare to \nwork.\n  So I do not think it is wrong for some of us to take exception to the \nefforts to stall important pieces of legislation getting through this \nbody, and that is why I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since the Senator from Iowa has talked \nabout delaying the legislation, I ask unanimous consent that the debate \non the minimum wage amendment be no more than 20 minutes, with 10 \nminutes to each side, and that we have consent that we vote on this \namendment up and down before final passage--that we have 20 minutes on \nthe amendment, since there has been the thought that we are trying to \ndelay this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I remind my good friend--and he is my \nfriend--about the report from the Finance Committee. If we go to page \n4: ``STRENGTHENS WORK''--``STRENGTHENS WORK.'' This bill is about work. \nAnd here we are asking for a minimum wage. To do what? To work.\n  What is possibly the reason or the justification to object to us even \nconsidering increasing the minimum wage? What we have here is objection \nto even considering an increase in the minimum wage, which is at its \nlowest level in history, for 7 million Americans.\n  They are talking about getting Americans out of welfare into work. We \nare trying to make work pay, and there is objection.\n  Look what it says on page 21:\n\n       The Committee bill recognizes that the success achieved by \n     TANF and Work First programs are a result of a sustained \n     emphasis on adult attachment to the workforce.\n\n  What more could be relevant to the workforce and strengthening work \nthan an increase in the minimum wage?\n  I do not know what this objection is. Why does the majority even \nrefuse us the opportunity to vote? That is what I am asking. Call the \nace an ace. What is the objection to having accountability, to find out \nif you are for it or against it? We are giving a 20-minute time limit, \n10 minutes on each side. I will take 5 minutes. I will take 2 minutes. \nI will take 1 minute, then call the roll.\n  What can possibly be the objection to calling the roll when we have \nincreased it 11 times under Republican and Democratic administrations \nin the past?\n  Where is the delay tactic? Where is the objection? Where is the fact \nthat this is not relevant to the substance at hand? This, of course, is \nthe substance at hand. Of course it is. It is about making sure that \npeople who work hard--men and women of dignity--are going to be able to \nreceive a livable wage. And we are denied--at least at the outset--the \nopportunity to even have this amendment considered.\n  I say to the Senator, this amendment ought to be voice-voted this \nafternoon. That is what it should be: It should be voice-voted. \nRepublicans, in the history of the minimum wage, have voted for \nincreases in it, and now we have instructions--evidently, \ninstructions--not to permit even a short time limit on increasing the \nminimum wage: No, you can't vote on that issue. We are not going to let \nyou. We control the Senate.\n  We heard from the Senator from Iowa: We want no one who works to have \nto live in poverty. I remember listening to the Senator from Iowa just \nabout an hour and a half ago: No one who works ought to live in \npoverty. He gave that speech. Now he will not even let us do something \nabout getting people out of poverty. He objects to us having it within \nthe next four amendments--to even consider it prior to the time of \npassage, with a 20-minute time limit--refuses.\n  Talk about arbitrariness and the abuse of power. This is it. This \nbody ought to be able to vote on questions affecting working families. \nWe ought to be able to vote on the minimum wage. We ought to be able to \nvote on overtime. We ought to be able to vote on unemployment \ncompensation. What in the world is wrong with the other side to try and \nprohibit this institution from taking positions on these issues and to \nvote up or down? What were we sent here for?\n  I say to my friend--and he is my friend--this issue is just not going \nto go away. He has given his response that he is going to do everything \nthat is parliamentarily possible to deny this institution considering \nan increase in the minimum wage. He just stated that. He made the point \nthat it was not relevant, that it was somehow going to delay, that it \nwas somehow not pertinent, even though we are talking about jobs and \ntrying to get people to work. That is the thrust of the whole bill. And \nhe would deny us the opportunity to consider this amendment for 15 \nminutes, 16 minutes, what we offered.\n  I think we are on notice now. Are we supposed to assume the majority \nis only going to permit amendments which they approve? Is that going to \nbe the new rule of the U.S. Senate? After 230 years, we are only going \nto permit votes which we, the Republicans, approve? That is what we are \nsaying. Is that the institution the American people thought they had in \nthe U.S. Senate? Is that what they thought we were doing here? Come on. \nCome on. That is not the Senate I was elected to or that I believe in \nand that the American people do.\n  We can either do this nicely and try to work out some kind of \nagreement and accommodation or we are going to use all of the other \nkinds of parliamentary rules that we know how to use and do it in ways \nwhich will insist on a vote. But if the Republican leadership thinks \nthat we are going to go on and on and on without an increase in the \nminimum wage, I want to clear them of that thought because this is \ncoming at you. People have waited too long, worked too hard, and \nchildren are being disadvantaged.\n  I listen to the speeches about children. There are children out \nthere, sons and daughters of minimum wage workers, whose lives would be \nsignificantly and dramatically advanced. Maybe that parent would be \nable to buy a birthday present, take the child to a movie.\n  But no, no, no, we are the Republicans, and we are not going to let \nyou vote. We are not going to let you vote in the Senate. That is what \nyou are saying. Well, we are going to come back to it.\n  I am going to speak to one other issue, and then I see others who \nwant to address the Senate. I will then yield the floor.\n\n\n           White House Responsiveness to the 9/11 Commission\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in my lifetime, there have been national \ncatastrophes of such magnitude that they are seared in the collective \nAmerican memory forever. In each case, the Nation was able to draw on \nthe strength of its institutions and its leaders to carry on with the \nstrong support of our citizens. The attack on Pearl Harbor, for \nexample, plunged us into war, but unified us as a people, and brought \nout the best in our elected leaders.\n  In Watergate, on the other hand, the integrity of our most basic \ninstitutions was threatened by an executive run amok. But the \nlegislative branch, acting on a bipartisan basis, and the judicial \nbranch, led by a unanimous Supreme Court, vindicated the Framers' trust \nthat a nation based on checks and balances and the separation of powers \ncould survive one branch's abuse of power.\n  Two and a half years ago we suffered another tragedy of historic \ndimensions. In one brief morning nearly 3,000 of our people were killed \nby an enemy who had openly declared war against us, had already struck \nat us in a variety of forms and places at home and abroad, and had put \nour government, if not our people, on notice that they would strike \nagain.\n  The families and friends of the dead and injured were not the only \nvictims. We all suffered. Our peace of mind suffered; our trust in our \nsurroundings suffered; our liberty to move freely around the Nation and \nthe world suffered. And our confidence in the public institutions which \nprotect and defend us suffered.\n  The quality and integrity of our response as a Nation and as \nindividuals will determine how history views us as defenders of \nAmerica's ideals. Can we restore security without sacrificing liberty? \nCan we identify and fill the gaps in our defense against known and \nunknown enemies, without reducing the essential quality of life and \nfreedom in our Nation?\n  We in Congress have begun to answer those questions, and the 9/11 \nCommission is a key element of our answer. Over the initial objections \nof the executive branch, and with the help and support of the victims' \nfamilies, we\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nhave delegated to that distinguished group of Commission members the \ncontinuation of the essential fact-finding process begun by our own \nIntelligence Committees. We have also asked the Commission to suggest \nsolutions for the problems they identify. We have invested \nextraordinary powers in that Commission to meet the extraordinary \ndemands of their assignment.\n  This Commission is as eminent and experienced a body as anyone could \nhope for. Some have complained that it is too ``establishment.''\n  It includes two former Republican governors, a former Republican \nSenator, a former Republican Secretary of the Navy, a former Reagan \nWhite House Counsel, a Navy veteran who was both a governor and \nSenator, a former General Counsel of the Department of Defense and \nDeputy Attorney General who sits on a CIA advisory Committee, a former \nchairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, a former member of \nthe House Intelligence committee, and a former Watergate investigator \nnow at a distinguished law firm. Its executive director served on the \nNational Security Council under former President Bush and on the \ntransition team for the current President Bush.\n  The Commission is entitled to respect and cooperation from everyone \nit deals with in all parts of the Government, especially the White \nHouse.\n  The Commission has properly chosen to operate in public to the \nfullest extent possible. Secrecy will only sow seeds of suspicion and \ndilute the Nation's confidence in its independence and its conclusions. \nIt has done nothing to suggest to anyone that it will not be fair and \njust and sensitive to the needs of the individuals and institutions it \ndeals with. On the other hand it is operating on an extremely tight, \nCongressionally mandated, time schedule.\n  It does not have the time or the inclination, and should not have the \nneed, to fight in the courts of law or in the court of public opinion \nto obtain the information it deserves and the public deserves.\n  Thus the current controversy over the testimony of National Security \nAdviser Condoleezza Rice can and should be resolved quickly. The public \nand the Congress should not stand for anything less than full and \nprompt cooperation from the White House. For a national tragedy of \nthese proportions, the buck stops at the White House. Three thousand \npeople died on our shores and on their watch. There should not be the \nslightest question that any White House staff member asked by the \nCommission to testify under oath and in public must do so.\n  As Colin Powell said yesterday, the presumption must be that \neverything be done in the open, so that sunshine can infuse the \nprocess.\n  It is not a question of law; the law fully permits members of the \nWhite House staff to testify.\n  It is not a question of precedent. As former Navy Secretary Lehman, a \nCommission member, said yesterday, many previous Presidents have \npermitted such testimony on important matters, and the importance of \nthe issue here makes clear that this President should do the same. \nSurely, 9/11 is more important than Richard Kleindienst's confirmation, \nBilly Carter's activities, or who said what to whom about an Arkansas \nbank.\n  Yet in those cases, and many others, top White House officials \ntestified in public and under oath.\n  It is not a question of principle. That line was crossed in this case \nwhen the National Security Adviser went before the Commission in \nsecret. If the White House genuinely believes that the Commission is a \ncreation of the legislature, she has already subjected herself to the \nlegislature's inquiries.\n  As Secretary Lehman has said, it is ``self-defeating'' for the White \nHouse to refuse to allow Condoleezza Rice to testify fully in public. \nThat course leads to suspicion that they have something to hide.\n  Mr. Lehman says there is no smoking gun in what she has said in \nsecret, so unless the White House is afraid she may say something \ndifferent in public under oath, why are they holding her back?\n  It is an insult to Ms. Rice to deny her the chance she says she \nwants, to testify in public. She has proven herself an articulate \nspokesperson for the President over the past 3 years. Unless the White \nHouse fears that she will disclose some dire secret, she should be free \nto respond in public to the Commission's questions, as she has \nresponded on numerous occasions in press interviews in recent days. \nTelevision interviews are no substitute for answering the Commission's \nquestions under oath.\n  There need be no compromise of executive privilege if she testifies, \nIf she is asked a question that she thinks the President, rather than \nshe, should answer, she can and will say so, and leave it to him to do. \nBut otherwise, as Colin Powell also said yesterday, the presumption \nought to be for sunshine, openness, light.\n  The Commission has also asked unanimously for an appearance by the \nPresident and Vice President in public under oath. They refused and \noffered in essence to meet in private for a brief conversation with the \nChair and Vice Chair of the Commission. The public outcry at that \nminimal proposal led the White House to suggest some flexibility on the \ntime, but not on anything else.\n  The President faces a difficult decision about whether to testify in \npublic and under oath. He was our leader when 9/11 occurred. That may \nwell turn out to be a benefit to him in the months to come, but with \nthat benefit goes a heavy burden. It is his responsibility to answer \nquestions that only he can answer, admit failings if there were \nfailings, apologize if apology is called for, and reassure us all that \nwhatever was broken has been fixed. It will take courage and leadership \nfor him to step forward, face the Commission, and risk the \nconsequences.\n  I urge President Bush, as the Nation focuses on the question of his \nown appearance, to remember the example of President Gerald Ford.\n  One of the most difficult decisions he made as President was to \npardon President Nixon. President Ford had the courage to defend that \ndecision under oath and in public before a congressional committee. His \npardon was not popular at the time, and it may well have cost him the \npresidency in the 1976 election. But he felt strongly that the public \nneeded to hear from him personally about why he thought the pardon was \nessential to the national interest. So he made the truly unprecedented \ndecision to come to the Hill to testify under oath himself. As he later \nsaid, ``The bigger the issue, the greater the need for political \ncourage.''\n  The current White House political staff has chosen a different \napproach. They have pressed the attack button on their quick-response \nmachine in an attempt to destroy Richard Clarke and destroy his \ncredibility about the events leading up to 9/11 under both the Clinton \nand Bush administrations, and the President's Republican allies in \nCongress are aiding and abetting this new and obscene example of the \npolitics of personal destruction.\n  It is sheer hypocrisy for the White House to encourage Condoleezza \nRice to appear on television to dispute Mr. Clarke's testimony to the \nCommission, and then prevent her from presenting her views to the \nCommission itself.\n  Many of us in the Senate will propose a resolution tomorrow urging \nthat Dr. Rice be permitted to testify in public and under oath. There \nwill be ample opportunity after that for the President to decide \nwhether he himself is willing to testify in public and under oath as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from North Dakota wants to speak. First, I \nask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes before the Senator from \nNorth Dakota speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwould like as part of that request that I be given an additional 10 \nminutes. I think they reserved 20 minutes for me before. I may not take \nit all, but I would like to have that amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to respond somewhat to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  First of all, I hope he understands this is a Monday--not that Monday \nis\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nnot just as important as any other day of the week. But it was \nannounced last week there would be no votes today. His amendment \ndoesn't have anything to do with votes today, but there are a lot of \nMembers not here who ought to have some input when a nongermane \namendment comes up. So I object for the reasons of myself as well as \nothers.\n  Also, you can see from the debate of the Senator from Massachusetts \nthat he feels very strongly about the importance of that amendment \nwhich he offers on the minimum wage. There is nothing wrong with the \nissue of the minimum wage coming up. But for this Senator from Iowa, \nwho is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, with issues I am \ntrying to respond to in a bipartisan way, and to issues that are raised \nas much from the other side of the aisle as they are from this side of \nthe aisle--I mentioned the FSC/ETI bill of 2 weeks ago. I mentioned the \nwelfare reform bill this week. There is a bipartisan consensus--maybe I \nshould not say consensus--there is an agreement we ought to have the \nlegislation before the Senate and passed. In the face of FSC/ETI, it \nwas responding as much from the other side as this side that that \nlegislation to encourage manufacturing in the United States, to create \njobs in the United States ought to pass. When it comes to a vote, it \nwill probably pass 90-10. But the legislation was held up 2 weeks ago \nby people on the other side of the aisle with nongermane amendments.\n  Now we have welfare reform, sunset last October. We have extended it \ntwo or three times since then, so we have to continue the welfare \nreform programs. There is a consensus we ought to deal with this \nlegislation and get some permanency to our welfare-to-work legislation. \nWhat happened? Right out of the box, people from the other side of the \naisle--legitimate issues or not--are trying to stop legislation \nimmediately in its tracks that will pass this body by a very wide \nmargin. Have they ever thought maybe some of these pieces of \nlegislation ought to stand on their own rather than hooking them onto \nbills unrelated to theirs?\n  I don't object to the issue of increasing the minimum wage. What I \nobject to is the constant harassment on the part of people on the other \nside of the aisle to keeping legislation from moving along very quickly \nthat everybody knows needs to pass. This is just not Republican pieces \nof legislation dealing with welfare reform. It is just not Republican \nlegislation dealing with encouraging manufacturing and creating jobs in \nmanufacturing in America. These pieces of legislation are doing what \nthe Senate ought to be doing to get things done, working in a \nbipartisan way.\n  If you work in a bipartisan way to bring legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate, why is the other side of the aisle always trying to slow \ndown that legislation? It seems to me that is what we are dealing with. \nThere are times to deal with pieces of legislation, but not in this \nway, harassing all the time.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to ask him a question on the \nSenator's time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is the Senator from North Dakota aware that \non the 2 amendments that have been offered on the last 2 pieces of \nlegislation--overtime and now the Kennedy minimum wage amendment--on \nour side we would be willing to take 10 minutes on each amendment, 10 \nfor us and 10 for the other side, 10 for us and 10 for the other side, \nfor a total of 20 minutes on our side of the aisle for these 2 pieces \nof legislation. Would the Senator agree the slowdown is not coming from \nus, but from them? We are asking for an additional 20 minutes on 2 \namendments and we can move on to the rest of the legislation. Will the \nSenator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I will go further than that and say I served on the \nFinance Committee with our distinguished chairman. I strongly supported \nthe FSC/ETI bill that was previously before the Senate. An amendment \nwas offered on overtime. It is entirely reasonable to offer an \namendment. Senators have a right to offer an amendment on any bill at \nany time, other than on those bills that are privileged. They offered \nto do it on a short time agreement. Now, today, on the welfare reform \nbill, the Senator from Massachusetts offered a very short time \nagreement on an amendment to increase the minimum wage. It is entirely \nreasonable and appropriate for Senators to offer amendments on pending \nlegislation.\n  I don't think the Senator from Iowa, who is my friend, and whom I \nrespect and work with closely on many issues, should feel harassed. It \nis not a matter of harassment. These are important issues that deserve \nto be voted on. There is no reason not to vote on them, either in the \ncontext of the welfare reform bill in the case of minimum wage, or in \nthe context of the FSC/ETI bill, which some have called a jobs bill, \nwith respect to the issue of overtime. Those issues are entirely in \norder and reasonable to discuss.\n\n\n                            The War In Iraq\n\n  Mr. President, I asked for time today not to speak on this issue, but \non the war against terror and the war in Iraq. These issues have come \nmuch more to the public attention as a result of the events of the last \nseveral weeks. As I have watched those events unfold, I have felt more \nstrongly the need to come to this floor to speak up and to talk about \nwhere I believe we have taken a wrong path in the war on terror, where \nI believe we have gotten the priorities wrong.\n  When we were attacked on September 11, 2001, we recognized we were at \nwar with a terrorist organization that would stop at nothing, a \nterrorist organization that would turn civilian airliners into flying \nbombs that would kill nearly 3,000 innocent Americans. The President \nand the American people recognized al-Qaida posed an immediate threat \nto this country. We agreed that defeating al-Qaida was our top national \nsecurity priority, and we vowed to bring Osama bin Laden and his al-\nQaida terrorist organization to justice. As President Bush said in \nconvening his cabinet at Camp David after the 9/11 attacks: ``There is \nno question that this act will not stand. We will find those who did \nit. We will smoke them out of their holes, we will get them running, \nand we will bring them to justice.''\n  We had an outpouring of sympathy, good will, and cooperation from all \nover the world, as we began the war on terrorism. Today, it has now \nbeen 930 days since the attacks of 9/11. And Osama bin Laden is still \nat large.\n  We have not found him. We have not smoked him out of his holes, and \nwe have not brought this mass murderer of innocent Americans to justice \nafter 930 days. In fact, Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida organization \ncontinue to mount attacks. Just 3 weeks ago, al-Qaida claimed \nresponsibility for the bombings in Madrid, Spain. Spanish authorities \nhave arrested Islamic terrorists in connection with that tragic attack, \nand al-Qaida continues to threaten further attacks against this \ncountry.\n  When I saw the news footage of the bombings in Spain and when I heard \nal-Qaida threatening more attacks on America, it deeply angered me. I \nbelieve it raises several questions. Most fundamentally, why have we \nnot, to use the President's words, smoked Osama bin Laden out, run him \ndown and brought him to justice? Why is Osama bin Laden still able to \nthreaten our country more than 2 years after we agreed that putting an \nend to his threats was our top priority? Why, if his organization has \nbeen disrupted and Osama bin Laden has been isolated, as some in the \nadministration claim, are Islamic terrorists linked to al-Qaida able to \norganize and coordinate significant synchronized attacks such as the \nones in Madrid? How is he still able to produce and distribute these \ntapes and messages exhorting others to kill more Americans?\n  As I asked these questions, it reminded that on April 30, 2001, less \nthan 5 months before the 9/11 attacks, CNN reported that the Bush \nadministration's release of the annual terrorism report contained a \nserious change from previous reports. Specifically, CNN reported that \n``there was no extensive mention of alleged terrorist mastermind Osama \nbin Laden,'' as there had been in previous years. When asked why the \nadministration had reduced the focus, ``a senior Bush Department \nofficial told CNN the U.S. Government made a mistake in focusing so \nmuch\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\nenergy on Bin Laden.'' In retrospect, that was a shocking misjudgment \nof the priorities in fighting terrorism. But I fear that even after 9/\n11, the administration has continued its failure to focus on al-Qaida.\n  A Newsweek article from last fall reported:\n\n       . . . bin Laden appears to be not only alive, but thriving. \n     And with America distracted in Iraq, and Pakistani President \n     Pervez Musharraf leery of stirring up an Islamist backlash, \n     there is no large-scale military force currently pursuing the \n     chief culprit in the 9/11 attacks.\n\n  It is not just Newsweek. USA Today reported just this past weekend:\n\n       In 2002, troops from the 5th special forces group who \n     specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for \n     Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next \n     assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with \n     expertise in Spanish cultures.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that because this to me does not add \nup. It does not make common sense.\n\n       In 2002, troops from the 5th special forces group who \n     specialize in the Middle East were pulled out of the hunt for \n     Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to prepare for their next \n     assignment: Iraq. Their replacements were troops with \n     expertise in Spanish cultures.\n       The CIA, meanwhile, was stretched badly in its capacity to \n     collect, translate and analyze information coming from \n     Afghanistan. When the White House raised a new priority, it \n     took specialists away from the Afghanistan effort to ensure \n     Iraq was covered.\n\n  I find these reports deeply disturbing. We know who attacked us on 9/\n11. It was al-Qaida. It was not Iraq. Yet we have top Pentagon and \nintelligence officials saying that we shifted resources away from al-\nQaida to focus on Iraq. We have 130,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, but only \n11,000 in Afghanistan. What Earthly sense does this make? Al-Qaida \nattacked America, not Iraq.\n  Those 11,000 troops are doing important work in Afghanistan--keeping \nthe peace and recently renewing efforts to mop up Taliban strongholds \nthat have been gathering strength. And the administration now has plans \nfor a spring offensive to go after bin Laden. But according to our own \nofficials, for most of the past 2 years, we had no large-scale military \nforce dedicated to pursuing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.\n  So I have to ask, why not? Why was there no large-scale military \nforce pursuing bin Laden for most of the past 2 years? Why did we allow \nour post-9/11 focus on bin Laden to be distracted? Why have we let new \nal-Qaida organizations grow up all around the world to attack us and \nour allies?\n  It seems to me the administration's priorities were misplaced. We \nallowed our attention to be diverted by Saddam Hussein and Iraq.\n  Many of us did not believe there was sufficient evidence to justify a \npreemptive attack on Iraq in the first place. We believed it was not in \nthe national security interests of the United States to attack Iraq; \nthat instead, we ought to keep our eye on the ball and keep the \npressure on al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden because it was they--al-Qaida \nand Osama bin Laden--who attacked America on September 11, not Iraq.\n  We feared attacking Iraq would leave us responsible for occupying and \nrebuilding a country in a profoundly dangerous and undemocratic region \nof the world, tying down resources we needed to meet other threats, \nincluding Iran, North Korea, and al-Qaida.\n  We feared that attacking and occupying Iraq would deepen and energize \nanti-American sentiment in the Islamic world, helping to fuel \nrecruitment by al-Qaida and other radical Islamist terror \norganizations.\n  And we feared that a war with Iraq would inevitably slow down our \nefforts to capture Osama bin Laden.\n  In my statement on this Senate floor just minutes before the Senate \nvoted to authorize the President to go to war in Iraq, I said:\n\n       I believe defeating the terrorists who launched the attacks \n     on the United States on September 11 must be our first \n     priority before we launch a new war on a new front. Yet \n     today, the President asks us to take action against Iraq as a \n     first priority. Mr. President, I believe that has the \n     priority wrong.\n\n  That is what I said moments before the vote authorizing the President \nto go to Iraq. I believe it was right then. I believe it is even more \nclearly right now.\n  I also warned:\n\n       The backlash in the Arab nations could further energize and \n     deepen anti-American sentiment. Al-Qaida and other terrorist \n     groups could gain more willing suicide bombers.\n\n  I think we have seen, tragically, that this was true. Our troops in \nIraq are constantly under attack. Our allies, including most recently \nthe Spanish people, have been victimized by terrorists.\n  I warned that the cost of invasion and occupation of Iraq could be \nextremely high, diverting resources from other national priorities. And \nthat, too, has turned out to be accurate. CBO now estimates that the \ncost of the war and occupation in Iraq will total more than $300 \nbillion.\n  In just the last couple of days, the American people have learned \nthat all of these concerns were shared at the very highest level of the \nWhite House. But the President ignored those warnings.\n  The top counter-terrorism adviser to President Bush, Richard Clarke, \nrecently published a book detailing his experiences with the war on \nterrorism. In it, Clarke writes that President Bush and other top \nofficials urged him to find a link between 9/11 and Iraq, even though \nhe told them that there was no such link. He writes that the shift of \nfocus from al-Qaida to Iraq ``launched an unnecessary and costly war in \nIraq that strengthened the fundamentalist, radical Islamic terrorist \nmovement worldwide.''\n\n  As Clarke put it on ``60 Minutes'' the weekend before last:\n\n       Osama bin Laden had been saying for years, ``America wants \n     to invade an Arab country and occupy it, an oil-rich Arab \n     country.'' He had been saying this as part of his propaganda.\n       So what did we do after 9/11? We invaded an oil-rich and \n     occupy an oil-rich Arab country which was doing nothing to \n     threaten us. In other words, we stepped right into bin \n     Laden's propaganda. And the result of it is that al-Qaida and \n     organizations like it, offshoots of it, second generation al-\n     Qaida have been greatly strengthened.\n\n  These are the words of Mr. Clarke, the former Bush counter-terror \nofficial who has just published a book on the subject. I spent part of \nthis weekend reading the book by Mr. Clarke. It is entitled ``Against \nall Enemies.'' I would urge my colleagues and those who might be \nlistening or watching to get that book and read it. Whether one agrees \nwith his conclusions or not, Mr. Clarke is warning and alerting us, \nbased on a lifetime of experience in four different administrations \nover 30 years fighting terrorists, of where we may have gone wrong. \nThese are lessons that are absolutely essential for us to learn.\n  Mr. Clarke was not only an official in this Bush White House. He was \nalso an official, an anti-terror chief, in the Clinton administration. \nBefore that, he was in the previous Bush administration at a high level \nof responsibility. Before that, he served in the Reagan administration. \nThis is a man of credibility. This is a man of qualifications. This is \na man of deep experience who is attempting to warn us of mistakes that \nare being made.\n  The charges he is making are serious charges. We know who attacked \nour country on 9/11. It was not Saddam Hussein or Iraq. It was Osama \nbin Laden and al-Qaida. But because the administration wanted to go to \nwar in Iraq, Clarke suggests, we not only diverted resources from the \nhunt for Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership, we strengthened \nal-Qaida and gave it time and space to develop offshoots that will \ncontinue to threaten this country even if we do eventually capture bin \nLaden, which I pray we do.\n  It is not just Mr. Clarke who is making these assertions. Read the \nbook by Secretary of the Treasury O'Neill. I have read that book, ``The \nPrice of Loyalty,'' as well. He makes clear the Bush administration, in \nits earliest weeks, were focused on attacking Iraq.\n  So I think we need to ask why we allowed ourselves to be distracted \nby Saddam Hussein. We need to ask why we took the focus off of finding \nOsama bin Laden and bringing him to justice? And we need to ask why the \nPresident decided that going after Iraq not al-Qaida and Osama bin \nLaden--was the priority, and see how that judgment has stood the test \nof time.\n  The President and his top officials made two main arguments for going \nto war in Iraq: Iraq was allied with al-Qaida, and Iraq had weapons of \nmass destruction that it could use to attack this country. That is what \nhe told the American people when he was persuading the Congress and the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\npeople that we should launch a war against Iraq.\n  In recent days and weeks, the evidence shows we have been pursuing \nthe wrong priorities. Let us look at what we know now.\n  On the question of a link to al-Qaida, the polling shows that 70 \npercent of Americans believe Saddam Hussein was behind September 11. \nOver half believe that Iraqis were the hijackers of the planes. Let me \nrepeat that. The polling shows 70 percent of Americans believe Saddam \nHussein was behind September 11. Fifty percent believe it was Iraqis on \nthe planes that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\n  The fact is, of course, not a single Iraqi was among the hijackers of \nthe airliners that were turned into flying bombs. The vast majority of \nthe 19 hijackers were Saudi Arabians, as, of course, is Osama bin \nLaden. Fifteen of the 19 were Saudis. Two were from the United Arab \nEmirates, one from Egypt and the other from Lebanon.\n  Not a single Iraqi was involved in the attack. That is the fact.\n  However, the American people believe there is a link because again \nand again the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, \nand other top administration officials have done everything they could \nto link Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida in the minds of the American \npeople.\n  They offered up two specific assertions to support this allegation: \nOne, the Vice President and others in the administration said \nrepeatedly that there was a link because one of the hijackers, Mohammed \nAtta, had met with an Iraqi agent in Prague. But what does the most \nrecent evidence show?\n  The fact is, the CIA and the FBI have concluded this report was \nsimply not true. It was not true because Mohammed Atta was not in \nPrague; he was in the United States, in Virginia Beach, VA, preparing \nfor the 9/11 attacks.\n  As The Washington Post reported on September 29:\n\n       In making the case for war against Iraq, Vice President \n     Cheney has continued to suggest that an Iraqi intelligence \n     agent met with a September 11, 2001, hijacker 5 months before \n     the attacks, even as the story was falling apart under \n     scrutiny by the FBI, CIA and the foreign government that \n     first made the allegation.\n\n  Second, the President and other top officials said al-Qaida \nmaintained a training camp in Iraq, but what they did not tell the \nAmerican people was that the training camp was in a part of Iraq \ncontrolled by the Kurds, not by Saddam Hussein. The Kurds, by the way, \nare our allies. Once again, this is a disturbing bit of information \nused in a way that I believe fundamentally misled people.\n  Yet Vice President Cheney, as recently as last fall, said that Iraq \nwas ``the geographic base of the terrorists who have had us under \nassault for many years, but most especially on 9/11.''\n  President Bush himself was forced to correct the record just a few \ndays later, when a reporter asked him about the Vice President's \nstatement. The President was very clear. He said there is no evidence \nthat Saddam Hussein was involved in the 9/11 attacks on this country. \nHere it is in the New York Times, September 18, 2003, ``Bush Reports No \nEvidence of Hussein Tie to 9/11.''\n  But that did not stop the administration from making statements over \nand over again linking Iraq with al-Qaida, and with terrorists more \ngenerally, to create the impression the war in Iraq was part of our \nresponse to the 9/11 attacks and the war on terrorism. As Richard \nClarke, the top counter-terrorism official in the White House during \n2001 and 2002, puts it:\n\n       The White House carefully manipulated public opinion, never \n     quite lied, but gave the very strong impression that Iraq did \n     it.\n       They did know better. We told them. The CIA told them. The \n     FBI told them. They did know better. And the tragedy here is \n     that Americans went to their death in Iraq thinking that they \n     were avenging September 11, when Iraq had nothing to do with \n     September 11. I think for a commander in chief and vice \n     president to allow that to happen is unconscionable.\n\n  These, again, are the remarks of the top counter-terrorism official \nin the Bush administration.\n  In fact, it is unlikely there would be any strong linkage between \nIraq and al-Qaida because Saddam Hussein was secular, Osama bin Laden \nis a fundamentalist. In many ways, they are mortal enemies.\n  I graduated from an American Air Force base high school in Tripoli, \nLibya--in North Africa--in 1966. Anybody who has lived in that culture \nunderstands very well the deep divisions between those who are secular \nand those who are fundamentalists. It is a deep division. But it is as \nthough our administration in Washington is unaware of it because, \nrepeatedly, they have suggested the two were tightly linked. In fact, \nthey were sworn enemies. Who do you think it is we are digging up in \nthose graves in Iraq? They are, by and large, fundamentalists whom \nSaddam Hussein found profoundly threatening to his secular regime.\n\n  I think it is time for America to think very carefully about the path \nwe are going down and to think very carefully about whether the \nstrategy this administration has adopted is a strategy to secure our \nfuture, or whether there is a better strategy to be pursued.\n  What we do know is Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida organized the attack \non the United States. That is who is responsible. That is who we should \nbe going after. Instead, what we are hearing is that military and \nintelligence resources were shifted to Iraq, taking resources away from \nthe search for Osama bin Laden. I have to ask again, Why? Why are we \nspending time and energy trying to prove a link with Saddam instead of \nspending the same time and energy trying to find Osama bin Laden and \ndefeating al-Qaida?\n  The other thing that was asserted repeatedly in making the case that \nIraq should be the priority, rather than al-Qaida, was that there were \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq--nuclear weapons, chemical and \nbiological weapons. The President and top officials repeatedly warned \nof Saddam's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear \nweapons in particular.\n  We had rhetoric about nuclear holy wars and mushroom clouds, and the \nstatements were assertions. The administration did not say that Iraq \nmight--or might not--have weapons of mass destruction. It asserted \naffirmatively that, without a doubt, Iraq had these weapons and that \nthey posed an immediate threat to this country.\n  This chart lists a few of the many administration statements on \nIraq's nuclear weapons. The first one is a quote of the Vice President \nin a speech to the VFW National Convention. He said:\n\n       Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein has \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  We have quote after quote from this administration. The President \nsaid:\n\n       The Iraqi regime is seeking nuclear weapons. The evidence \n     indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons \n     program.\n\n  Ari Fleischer, the President's press spokesman said:\n\n       We know for a fact there are weapons there.\n\n  It goes on and on. Secretary Powell said:\n\n       He has so determined that he has made repeated covert \n     attempts to acquire high specification aluminum tubes from 11 \n     different countries, even after inspections resumed.\n\n  And, again, Vice President Cheney:\n\n       We know he is out trying once again to produce nuclear \n     weapons. We believe Saddam has in fact reconstituted nuclear \n     weapons.\n\n  These were the statements made over and over by this administration. \nOn chemical and biological weapons, the story was the same. The \nadministration repeatedly asserted that Saddam had revived his chemical \nand biological weapons program and had stockpiles of weapons that posed \na grave, immediate danger to the United States.\n  We all knew that Iraq had possessed and used chemical weapons in the \n1980s. And we all knew that intelligence had not conclusively \ndemonstrated that all these weapons had been destroyed. But the \nadministration went well beyond that consensus, suggesting that there \nwas new evidence of renewed chemical and biological weapon production.\n  This next chart I have lists a few of the many administration \nstatements on Iraq's chemical and biological weapons. Again, the \nPresident's chief spokesman said:\n\n       The President of the United States and the Secretary of \n     Defense would not assert as plainly and bluntly as they have \n     that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction if it was not true \n     and if they did not have a solid basis for saying it.\n\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\n\n  That was Ari Fleischer.\n  Again, later the next year:\n\n       We know for a fact that there are weapons there.\n\n  Secretary Powell:\n\n       We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his \n     weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more.\n\n  President Bush:\n\n       The Iraqi regime has actively and secretly attempted to \n     obtain equipment needed to produce chemical, biological, and \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  Again, President Bush:\n\n       Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves \n     no doubt that the Iraqi regime continues to possess and \n     conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.\n\n  The President's chief spokesman Ari Fleischer:\n\n       Well, there is no question that we have evidence and \n     information that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, \n     biological and chemical particularly . . . all this will be \n     made clear in the course of the operation, for whatever \n     duration it takes.\n\n  Mr. President, assertion after assertion. These statements, and \ndozens more like them, painted a frightening picture of the threat \nposed to this country by Iraq. They created a mood in this country that \nbuilt support for attacking a country that had not first attacked us or \nour allies, and to do so for the first time in our history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, these statements did not suggest that ``maybe'' \nSaddam had weapons of mass destruction. They did not suggest that \n``probably'' Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. They stated \nclearly and unequivocally that he had them. There was one only problem \nwith these statements. All the evidence that has emerged since the war \nsuggests that they were wrong. All the evidence we have now shows the \nadministration knew at the time the statements were made that its own \nintelligence undercut the statements it was making.\n  What we know now is that we have occupied Iraq for 10 months. We have \nfull, unrestricted access to the whole country, more than 1,000 \ninvestigators searching for illegal weapons, and they have found none. \nSaddam did not have nuclear weapons or any serious effort to acquire \nthem in the near term. I think this quote from the January 28 \nWashington Post sums up the most recent finding:\n\n       ``U.S. weapons inspectors in Iraq found new evidence that \n     Saddam Hussein's regime quietly destroyed some stockpiles of \n     biological and chemical weapons in the mid-1990s,'' former \n     chief inspector David Kay said yesterday.\n       The discovery means that inspectors have not only failed to \n     find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq but also have found \n     exculpatory information . . . demonstrating that Saddam \n     Hussein did make efforts to disarm well before President Bush \n     began making the case for war . . .\n       ``If weapons programs existed on the scale we \n     anticipated,'' Kay said, ``we would have found something that \n     leads to that conclusion. Instead, we found other evidence \n     that points to something else.\n\n  I think the attached graphic from the Washington Post sums up the gap \nbetween the statements and what we now know. On biological weapons, \nevidence since March of 2003? No. No weaponized agents found.\n\n  On chemical weapons?\n  No. No weapons found. Appears none were produced after 1991.\n  On nuclear weapons?\n  No. No evidence of any active program.\n  I do not fault the administration for thinking that there might be \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I myself thought it probable that \nSaddam possessed these weapons. But for me the real question was \nwhether these weapons posed such a serious, imminent threat that they \njustified a preemptive attack on Iraq. Did we have solid evidence of an \nimmediate danger? For me, at the time, the answer was no. Today, with \nthe benefit of hindsight, with the Bush administration's own top \nweapons inspector acknowledging that the pre-war statements were wrong \nand that Saddam, in fact, was disarming before the war, the answer is \neven clearer: No.\n  I am not the only one who has reached that conclusion. For example, \nformer President Reagan's Secretary of the Navy, James Webb, recently \nwrote:\n\n       Bush arguably has committed the greatest strategic blunder \n     in modern memory. To put it bluntly, he attacked the wrong \n     target. While he boasts of removing Saddam Hussein from \n     power, he did far more than that. He decapitated the \n     government of a country that was not directly threatening the \n     United States and, in so doing, bogged down a huge percentage \n     of our military in a region that never has known peace. Our \n     military is being forced to trade away its maneuverability in \n     the wider war against terrorism while being placed on the \n     defensive in a single country that never will fully accept \n     its presence.\n       There is no historical precedent for taking such action \n     when our country was not being directly threatened. The \n     reckless course that Bush and his advisers have set will \n     affect the economic and military energy of our Nation for \n     decades. It is only the tactical competence of our military \n     that, to this point, has protected him from the harsh \n     judgment that he deserves.\n\n  In my view, it was a clear alternative to a preemptive attack that \nhad worked for us for more than half a century--aggressive containment \nand isolation. The Soviet Union had biological and chemical weapons. We \nnever attacked them. China had biological and chemical weapons. We \ndidn't attack them. Cuba had missiles. We didn't attack them. In every \none of those cases we used containment, and it worked. But we did not \nuse containment in Iraq. We broke with our history and launched a \npreemptive attack on a country that had not first attacked us or our \nallies.\n  Now we have the responsibility for trying to occupy and rebuild Iraq. \nNow we have moved resources out of the hunt for Osama bin Laden to deal \nwith the dangers of the occupation of Iraq, and we have not yet \nsucceeded in capturing bin Laden or shutting down al-Qaida.\n  I again must ask why have we not brought Osama bin Laden to justice? \nWhy do we allow ourselves to be distracted by a war with Iraq when we \nhave other, better options that allow us to keep the focus on al-Qaida?\n  It has been more than 30 months. It has been 930 days since the 9/11 \nattacks on this country, but Osama bin Laden is still at large. We all \nhope he will soon be caught, but every day our attention is diverted is \nanother day America is at risk. That makes me question our policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to \nconclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  That makes me question our policy. It makes me question why for most \nof the last two years we have had no large-scale force hunting for bin \nLaden. It makes me question why our military and intelligence assets \nthat could be hunting down al-Qaida have instead been diverted to Iraq. \nIt makes me concerned when intelligence experts tell us al-Qaida has \nused that breathing space to decentralize its operations so it will be \nharder to disrupt and destroy al-Qaida in the future, even if we do \ncapture bin Laden.\n  In the past few weeks, the administration has announced it has \nstepped up the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Sending a few thousand troops \nnow is certainly a positive step. But I must ask with all due respect, \ncould we have captured Osama bin Laden months ago had we kept the focus \non al-Qaida? Could we have prevented the Madrid attack had we kept the \nfocus on dismantling al-Qaida rather than going to war in Iraq?\n  Where was the effort to find Osama bin Laden for the past two years? \nAnd why do we not have tens of thousands of troops rather than just a \nfew thousand to hunt him down so he does not remain free to plot \nagainst this country and our allies?\n  As Flynt Leverett, former CIA analyst and National Security Council \nstaffer for President Bush, observed in a Washington Post article this \npast Sunday:\n\n       We took the people out [of Afghanistan] who could have \n     caught them. But even if we got bin Laden or [his top aide \n     Ayman] Zawahiri now, it is two years too late. Al-Qaeda is a \n     very different organization now. It has had time to adapt. \n     The administration should have finished this job.\n\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\n\n  I can only reach one conclusion. We have been distracted. We have \nbeen diverted. We have taken our eye off the ball. We have lost focus \non the real war on terrorism--the war on al-Qaida and the terrorists \nwho viciously attacked our country.\n  To put it bluntly, we have lost time and momentum and initiative in \nthe war on the terrorists who actually attacked us while we went after \na dictator--vicious and nasty as he was--who posed little immediate \nthreat to this country.\n\n  If we look across the evidence, I believe in many ways the United \nStates simply made a mistake of judgment on what was most important. \nThe President and his advisers believed--and I believe they sincerely \nbelieved--the priority was to go after Iraq. But the evidence we now \nhave suggests they were chasing red herrings rather than real evidence \nof a national security threat.\n  Don't get me wrong. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in \npower in Iraq. But going to war with Iraq at the expense of our \ncredibility and at the expense of our readiness to deal with other \nthreats, at the expense of vigorously hunting down al-Qaida and bin \nLaden, has been the wrong priority.\n  That is exactly what concerned this Senator, that a preemptive war \nagainst Iraq--a country that had a low-level threat against this \ncountry, according to our own intelligence agencies--has distracted us \nfrom going after the man and the organization that attacked this \ncountry. It was not Iraqis who attacked this country. It was al-Qaida \nthat attacked this country. Saddam Hussein was not the heart of that \noperation. Osama bin Laden was the leader of that operation.\n  It was Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida that engineered the vicious \nattacks on America on September 11. It is unacceptable that Osama bin \nLaden is still at large and broadcasting threats against this country \n930 days after the attacks of September 11.\n  So I ask a final time: Why? Why has bin Laden eluded capture for 930 \ndays? Why are we not focusing our efforts on bringing him to justice \nand defeating his network of terror?\n  I think the American people deserve an answer to that question. I \nthink Members of this Chamber deserve an answer to that question. \nHolding Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida to account for this attack should \nbe our top priority. It is time to refocus our priorities and to win \nthe war against al-Qaida. Stopping bin Laden and al-Qaida before they \ncan launch another attack that kills innocent Americans should be our \nhighest national security priority.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is a \nunanimous consent agreement in place as to who might speak. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 minutes ahead of those in \nqueue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend Senator Conrad. \nAnd he is my friend. We use that term around here loosely, but he is in \nfact a good friend. I differ with him very fundamentally.\n  I have learned in the superheated atmosphere of the Senate that I \nmust make this disclaimer: I do not challenge his patriotism, but I \nchallenge his accuracy and his conclusions.\n  I think we should also understand that as we differ on this, we are \nnot attacking someone's patriotism. That canard has been thrown across \nthe aisle at those of us who stand to defend the President and differ \nwith our colleagues.\n  I will return to the floor at a later time for more extensive \ncomments on Senator Conrad's speech. But I want to make these points \nwhich I think get neglected over and over and were neglected in his \npresentation.\n  He quoted David Kay, the President's arms inspector, as saying they \nare admitting now there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. \nWhat he failed to quote from David Kay was the statement that after \nconcluding his inspection in Iraq, David Kay came to the conclusion \nthat Saddam Hussein was in fact more dangerous than we thought he was \nwhen we launched the war. I think that is the point that keeps being \nignored and must be emphasized again.\n  Senator Conrad says we didn't invade Russia when they had weapons of \nmass destruction; that we didn't invade China when they had weapons of \nmass destruction; and, why, therefore, did we invade Iraq when it turns \nout they didn't have them? We did it because we thought he had the \nweapons of mass destruction, and we thought that made him dangerous. It \nis not the possession of the weapons that is the problem. It is the \ndanger that is the problem.\n  Great Britain has weapons of mass destruction, but they are in no \nsense dangerous. We thought Saddam Hussein was.\n  It is unfair to quote David Kay as saying there were no weapons and \nthen not finish the quotation with his statement that even without \nweapons Saddam Hussein was more dangerous than we thought when we \nentered the war.\n  If you are going to use David Kay as your authority, you must use \nDavid Kay's entire conclusion. Saddam Hussein was, according to David \nKay, more dangerous than we thought. Yet somehow he is being cited as \nto the source to say we should not have gone ahead.\n\n  This next major thrust of his statement was: Well, because we got \ndistracted with Iraq, we have not dealt with al-Qaida and terrorism. \nThat is the subject which I will address at some length when the \nSenator from Tennessee is finished.\n  The fact is, you cannot single out al-Qaida as a terrorist group as \nif it operates in a vacuum. I remember my high school history teacher \nsaying, over and over to us: You cannot cut a seamless web of history. \nYou cannot divide the threat of terror into neat little sections and \nsay, we can deal with the one and the others do not really matter.\n  I will be discussing and presenting on the floor here at a relatively \nclose future time the statement that appeared this morning in the Wall \nStreet Journal that is a summary of the Kissinger lecture, given at the \nLibrary of Congress, by George Shultz. I had the privilege and honor of \nhearing George Shultz present that lecture. In it he makes the clear \npoint that the war on terror, the threat from terror, goes all the way \nback to his experience in the Reagan administration, when he was \nSecretary of State. And it manifests itself in a variety of places and \nin a variety of ways.\n  There is no distraction in the war on terror by virtue of what we are \ndoing in Iraq. Saddam Hussein financed terror. Saddam Hussein \ncountenanced terror. Saddam Hussein provided sanctuary for terrorists. \nIf we were going to launch a war on terror, and said we were going to \nrule out Iraq as part of that war, we would have been irresponsible.\n  Yes, the first attack went against al-Qaida and al-Qaida's sanctuary \nin Afghanistan. But al-Qaida fled and sought sanctuary elsewhere. And \none of the main places where terror found sanctuary and finance was in \nIraq. And we thought Iraq was dangerous enough to invade, in \nfulfillment--as George Shultz points out--of the clear United Nations \nmandate that went back decades. We acted in accordance with that \nmandate. We enforced the United Nations resolutions in full compliance \nwith United Nations procedure and the vote of both Chambers of this \nCongress.\n  It was not a distraction. It was part of the overall recognition on \nthe part of the Bush administration that this was not a law enforcement \nproblem where we needed to identify the criminal, arrest him, and \nprosecute him. This was, indeed, a true war, across a wide spectrum of \nchallenge, where we had to deal with dangerous problems, the most \ndangerous of which, again, according to David Kay--who has been quoted \nby those who are attacking the administration--was Saddam Hussein: more \ndangerous than we thought when we launched the war.\n  I think we should keep that in mind as we go forward in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2937\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment offered by Senators Dodd and Snowe on \nchildcare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, is there any limit on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon to speak on \nthe welfare reform legislation that the Finance Committee has worked \non. I compliment Chairman Grassley and the Senator from Montana for \ntheir hard work in bringing this important piece of legislation \nforward.\n  I am going to comment on two aspects of the bill.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Before I do that, Mr. President, I have been sitting here listening \nfor a while. I think it is important to complete the story of what the \nSenator from North Dakota was saying.\n  Let me be specific about this. As I heard his remarks, he was \nbasically saying the President of the United States made a mistake when \nhe decided the United States should use force to change the regime in \nIraq.\n  I suppose one could come to that conclusion. There were some in the \nSenate who did. But I think it is important, if we are going to begin \nto read quotations and comments from those who have come to that \nconclusion today, that we finish the story, as Paul Harvey said.\n  Here is the rest of the story. Here is what others were saying, \nothers were thinking, at the time President Bush had to look at the \nwhole world and look at this different world that we are in and make a \ndecision.\n  It is true that it has been against the traditions of the United \nStates to make a preemptive strike. That was a major discussion during \nthe Cuban missile crisis. Bobby Kennedy brought that up in the \ncouncils. He was right to do that. And I am sure in President Bush's \ncouncils that was discussed.\n  But, suddenly, we were facing a different kind of enemy. We were \nfacing terrorists. And we had just experienced an unexpected attack. \nThere are some even today who say that someone should have imagined \nthat a handful of men would hijack two airplanes and fly them into the \nWorld Trade Center. Maybe someone should have. But I can assure you \nthat during the 1990s, there was no one running for President of the \nUnited States who expressed that thought or who had that thought in the \nremotest back of his mind that such a thing like that could happen. \nTerrorism, yes. But that kind of attack? No.\n  So, suddenly, we are in this new environment. And the President of \nthe United States is doing what I would hope any President would do of \neither party when confronted with radically different circumstances. He \nasked some questions and he took some action.\n  Now, it is important for us to remember that at the same time the \nPresident was making decisions about whether we should invade Iraq to \ndefend ourselves, to prevent a terrorist attack--because there was a \nthreat there to American lives and American safety--there were others \nin our Government who also had a chance to consider that information, \nand to talk about it, and to vote on it.\n  We voted on it here. I was not here yet, but I remember the \noverwhelming majority--bipartisan majority--in this Senate that \nauthorized the use of military force against Iraq. And I can remember \nvery well what was said.\n  So if the issue is whether a prudent President--who is sworn to \nuphold the oath to defend the United States of America--made a wise \njudgment to challenge Saddam Hussein, whether he could have done that \nbased upon the facts presented to him, let's take a look at what other \npeople, other well-informed people were saying and thinking at the \ntime.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota read some quotations. Let \nme read some more. Here is a member of the Senate's own Intelligence \nCommittee, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, one of our \nmost distinguished and wisest Senators, a man who has been a Governor, \nwith whom I have served, a man who is also on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Here is what the Senator from West Virginia, speaking on the \nSenate floor, said on October 10 of the year 2002, about the time the \nPresident of the United States was looking at this information. Senator \nRockefeller said:\n\n       There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is \n     working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will \n     likely have nuclear weapons within the next 5 years. He could \n     have it earlier if he is able to obtain fissile missile \n     materials on the outside market, which is possible--difficult \n     but possible.\n       We should also remember we have always underestimated the \n     progress that Saddam Hussein has been able to make in the \n     development of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Now, that was not the Vice President of the United States. That was \nnot Secretary Rumsfeld. That was not President Bush. That was the \nSenator from West Virginia, a member of our Intelligence Committee, a \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, who was coming up with his \nown conclusions.\n  Here is another quotation made on the Senate floor on October 9, \n2002, about the same time. This came from the distinguished junior \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry:\n\n       I believe the record of Saddam Hussein's ruthless, reckless \n     breach of international values and standards of behavior, \n     which is at the core of the cease-fire agreement, with no \n     reach, no stretch, is cause enough for the world community to \n     hold him accountable by the use of force if necessary.\n  That was Senator Kerry, at about the time that President Bush was \nhaving to make this terrible decision.\n  I want to move on to other issues. But I don't think it serves our \npurpose as a country to dredge up comments that show some second-\nguessing, some second thoughts on one side, but not look back at what \nother distinguished, fairminded reasonable men and women were saying.\n  Here is what Senator Biden said at about the same time on the Senate \nfloor, October 9, 2002:\n\n       If the world decides it must use force for his failure to \n     abide by the terms of surrender, then it is not preempting, \n     it is enforcing. It is enforcing, it is finishing a war he \n     reignited, because the only reason the war stopped is he sued \n     for peace.\n\n  And finally, here is what the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nsaid on October 10, 2002:\n\n       In the 4 years since the inspectors left, intelligence \n     reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his \n     chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery \n     capability, and his nuclear program. It is clear, however, \n     that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to \n     increase his capability to wage biological and chemical \n     warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\n\n  Those are the conclusions of the distinguished Members of the other \nside who know a lot about this, the same conclusion President Bush had. \nWe don't have to listen to what the administration tells us here. We \nhave our committees. We travel the world. Some of us have been in other \nadministrations. We read. We listen. We talk. We come to our own \nconclusions. The conclusions of most Senators was the same as the \nconclusion of the President, that as terrible as it was, this was a \ntime we needed to act.\n  There is one other quotation I would like to mention before I turn to \nthe Welfare Reform Act. This is a comment of a former President of the \nUnited States who has, to his great credit, not backed away insofar as \nI have heard from this remark. President Bill Clinton said, on February \n17, 1998, in an address for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Pentagon \nstaff:\n\n       Now let us imagine the future. What if he fails to comply \n     and we fail to act or we take some ambiguous third route \n     which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this \n     program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press \n     for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the \n     solemn commitments that he made. Well, Saddam Hussein will \n     conclude that the international community has lost its will. \n     He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to \n     rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, \n     some way, I guarantee you, he will use the arsenal. And I \n     think every one of you who has really worked on this for any \n     length of time believes that, too.\n\n  That was President Clinton in 1998 in an address to the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and the Pentagon staff.\n  The No. 1 issue on all of our minds is the war in Iraq. But I would \nhope we could look forward and not look backward in recrimination. That \nis not too much to hope in a Presidential election year. I believe the \npeople of this country want President Bush and Senator Kerry to say \nwhere do we go from here, how do we win the peace, how do we secure \nfreedom, how do we get the men and women home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, what can we do to help\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\ntheir families. That is what the focus ought to be rather than reading \nlong, incomplete lists of second-guessing quotations to try to pin the \nblame on a decision that was broadly and widely shared based upon \ninformation that had been piled up over 10 or 12 years. That does not \nserve our process well.\n  I came to the floor today on another matter. I am glad I had a chance \nto mention former President Clinton in terms of doing it. I remember \nwell. In my second term as Governor in the mid-1980s, I was privileged \nto serve as chairman of the National Governors Association and created \nthe first welfare reform task force. I asked then-Governors Pete DuPont \nand Bill Clinton, who was vice chairman of that association, to be the \nco-chairs, working with me to figure out something better. And we did, \nand they did most of that work and that leadership.\n  The work that the Governors started that year continued. Ten years \nlater, when Bill Clinton was President in 1996 and there was a \nRepublican Congress, Congress passed the landmark welfare reform \nlegislation which today we call TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies.\n  That 1996 welfare-to-work legislation was very controversial at the \ntime. It was controversial because it got us out of the rut that we had \nbeen in for 30 or 40 years of creating a permanent class of welfare and \ncaused us to rethink that. It is possible that it only could have been \ndone with the President of one party who had immersed himself in the \nsubject and who talked about it and believed in it and a Congress of \nanother party. It was that big a change.\n  It changed the way we think about welfare, from a program that \nfosters dependence to a program that serves as temporary assistance, a \nprogram that restores dignity and encourages people to stand on their \nown two feet. That welfare-to-work program that President Clinton and \nthe Republican Congress created 10 years ago--many Members of the House \nwho were there at the time are now in the Senate--has been a very \nsuccessful program and one in which they can take pride.\n  From a high of 5 million in 1994, welfare caseloads have dropped by \nover 50 percent. But since 2000, the national caseload has leveled off \nat slightly above 2 million. In more than half the States, including my \nown of Tennessee, caseloads are growing. And in every State, the \nremaining 50 percent on the welfare rolls present a bigger challenge.\n  There are some other warning signs. The number of families is rising \nwho have exhausted their 60-month or 5-year time limit for Federal aid \nunder TANF. We have a 5-year limit. We don't want permanent welfare. \nAnd a number of families have exceeded that 5-year limit so they are \noff welfare.\n  Another warning sign is the remaining caseload holds a rising \nproportion of Black and Hispanic families. Another is that unemployment \namong single mothers, which declined sharply in the early years of our \nwelfare-to-work program, went back up in 2001 and 2002.\n  Finally, another warning signal is in response to their own fiscal \ncrises--we can remember we had to send a $20 billion welfare check of \nour own to the States last year--some States have recently had to \nrestrict cash benefits and support services, spreading limited \nresources even thinner.\n  The President and the Congress recognized from the beginning that \nhelping people go from dependence to independence would be expensive in \nthe short run. It would take some money. If you are saying to somebody \nwho is down and out and in the third generation of welfare dependence, \nwe want you to change your lifestyle and we are going to offer in \nexchange for that childcare, education opportunities, job training, \ncounseling, removal of barriers to work, offering all that, that takes \npeople, that takes work, and that takes money.\n  We have provided money over a period of time. One of the most \nsuccessful of those programs has been the childcare voucher. Not \neveryone likes to call it a voucher because some people don't like \nvouchers. The Pell grant is a voucher for college students, the \nStafford student loans is a voucher for college students, and the \nchildcare grant is a voucher. It is money that goes through the \nStates--I think it is about $8 billion or so--to more than 2 million \npersons who are getting off welfare. As we say, largely to women who \nhave children: We want you to go to work. They may say: What about our \nchildren? And we say: Here is a childcare grant that you may take to \nany accredited institution that you can. That is what we mean by \nvoucher.\n  That has been a big success as well. That is the reason why even \nthough the Senate committee, in my judgment, has done an excellent job \nof bringing to the Senate the reauthorization or renewal of this \nwelfare reform bill and has increased the amount of money available for \nchildcare, I agree with Senator Snowe of Maine that we need to increase \nthe money for childcare more.\n  Senator Snowe spoke about that today at great length, so I don't feel \nthe need to go into great length about it. Basically, the Snowe \namendment, which I am glad to cosponsor, adds an additional $6 billion \nover 5 years for childcare. Both the House and the Senate versions of \nthe welfare reform bills we are considering increase both the hours the \nparents are required to work each week and the number of welfare \nparents each week who are required to work.\n  If we are going to require that the only parent who is at home go to \nwork, and if that person is poor, and if that person is still on \nwelfare after we have been working for 10 years to try to get as many \npeople as possible off, we certainly are going to have to say as part \nof our deal we will help with childcare if you will go to work. That is \nthe whole idea.\n  Childcare is the linchpin between welfare and work. Studies show \nformer welfare recipients who receive childcare assistance are 82 \npercent more likely to be employed after 2 years than those who don't; \n65 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 and 79 percent \nof mothers with children ages 6 to 13 are in the labor force in our \ncountry today. As I mentioned earlier, about 2.5 million children \nreceive our Federal childcare vouchers through the State. Childcare is \nexpensive. It costs as much as a 4-year college--between $4,000 and \n$10,000 per child annually sometimes.\n  I got a personal dose of learning about this in 1996 when I was under \nthe mistaken impression the people of the United States wanted me to \nrun for President of the United States. I got the message earlier that \nyear that they preferred Bob Dole, the former majority leader. I went \nhome to Tennessee. I received a call from Major Werthy of the Salvation \nArmy. He said, ``I have been hearing what you had to say.'' I had been \nsaying a lot about personal responsibility. He said, ``I am calling to \ndraft you and put your feet where your mouth has been for the last few \nyears.'' So I went to work for the Salvation Army in Nashville and \nhelped create something called the Red Shield Family Initiative. This \nbasically became Nashville's way of implementing the Federal law.\n  Congress and the President decided we are going to change things. If \nyou will get off welfare, we will give you help, childcare, job \ntraining. We will knock barriers out of the way and counsel you about \ndrugs and work with you. Then somebody has to actually do all that. In \nNashville a whole group of people got together, led by the Salvation \nArmy. It included the metropolitan government, the State of Tennessee, \nall sorts of social services, and it included childcare centers. Down \nin the area of town where we have the most difficult circumstances, we \nhad almost a mall, such as a shopping mall that exists to create a one-\nstop place for a mom on welfare who wanted to get off, so they could \nthen be helped. There have been some wonderful stories that have come \nout of that Red Shield Family Initiative, but I can tell you they came \nout slowly, one by one.\n\n  Tamika Payton was in the ninth grade. This is an example Major Werthy \ntalked to me about. In the ninth grade, she was a ward of the State \nwhen she had her first child. She grew up with an abusive mother who \nwas addicted to drugs. She was removed from the care of her mother and \nplaced in the care of her aunt, who was also abusive, so she ran away. \nThis is Tamika's story, but it is a story that occurs all over America. \nShe had two more children before becoming connected to the Family First \nProgram, which is what we call Tennessee's welfare-to-work program. \nBecause of the\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\nchildcare certificate, the vouchers she receives through the Tennessee \nFamily First Program, the ones we pay for with Federal tax dollars, she \nnow has a full-time job, she is working on her GED, her high school \ndegree, and her children attend the McNealy Child Care Center, a \nnationally accredited childcare agency in the area where this Red \nShield Family Initiative of the Salvation Army exists.\n  In Tennessee, the State pays $105 a week for Tamika's 1-year-old, \n$105 a week for her 2-year-old child, and $90 a week for her 4-year old \nchild. In Nashville, the average cost of a quality childcare center \nranges between $100 and $150 a week. These vouchers we are voting for \ncome within that range. Tamika's dream is to get her high school degree \nand then to attend Tennessee State University.\n  In other words, what is happening with Tamika Payton is exactly what \nthe Republican Congress and President Clinton hoped would happen in \n1996 when this started. But as we consider the welfare reform \nlegislation, I think it is very important that we remember in \nWashington, DC, while we may create large frameworks and set standards \nand provide money, it is people such as the Red Shield Family \nInitiative in Nashville, in Portland, in Austin, in New York City, who \nare doing the work--they have got to work one by one by one. So I will \nsupport and vote for Senator Snowe's amendment to add an additional $6 \nbillion over 5 years for child care, because if in this welfare reform \nauthorization we are going to require the only parent in the house to \nwork away from home--more work than we have required before--then we \nwill have to pay more for more childcare. We cannot require more work \nwithout paying more for more childcare.\n  There is one other concern I have. It will be the subject of an \namendment I intend to introduce along with Senators Nelson, Carper, and \nVoinovich later this week. We are working with the chairman and his \nstaff to try to make certain it is consistent with the objectives of \nthe general legislation, which we believe it is. This amendment would \ncreate a 10-State demonstration project designed to test the premise \nthat if States had greater flexibility, States could do a better job \ngetting people off welfare and becoming truly self-sufficient. Senators \nNelson, Carper, Voinovich, and I are all former Governors. We know the \nimportance of reducing welfare rolls. We all served as Governors of \nStates in the AFDC days, when we had Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren. We all strongly support the welfare-to-work concept. But \nespecially with this last group of men and women--mostly women--who are \nmoving from welfare to work, we have the tougher cases. It will be \nharder for us to decide from here exactly how each of those persons we \nare trying to help can get from where they are to where we want them to \ngo. We should not presume to have all of the answers.\n  Here is how our demonstration project would therefore work. The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services would approve plans for up to 10 \nStates. These plans would include what we call measurable outcome \ngoals. In other words, in plain English, are we helping this person \nmove toward self-sufficiency, toward independence, to get on their own \ntwo feet and off welfare? We would, in those 10 demonstration States, \nenforce the 60-month time limit for TANF benefits and require, as in \nthe Senate bill, the self-sufficiency employment plan for each \nrecipient. In other words, each individual would have a plan for that \nperson's progress.\n  We agree with the idea of no permanent welfare. While work continues \nto be at the heart of what we expect States to focus on, States will \nneed to decide how best to meet each person's need, is taking into \nconsideration individual circumstances. As wise as we may hope we are, \neach one of us is not going to be able to meet each Tamika Payton and \nmake a judgment as to how Tamika can get on her two feet with her three \nchildren, succeed in life, and never receive a welfare check again. So \nin exchange for greater flexibility, we will ask the States to achieve \nbetter results and be measured against true outcome goals, a feature \nneither in the current law nor in the Senate and House bills.\n\n  These are the kinds of goals that our legislation will include: One, \nwork, employment, growth in the percent of recipients employed in that \nState; two, removal of barriers to stable employment. By that I mean \ndrug treatment success. That is a barrier to stable employment. \nEducation level, that is a barrier to stable employment. Attainable \nmarketable skills, that is a barrier to stable employment.\n  I remember visiting a welfare human services office in my State in \n2002. I asked them what worked best. What they told me was: Get them \ninto school. If we get them into school, we never see them again. What \nthe welfare office hopes for from its clients is they do not see them \nagain, at least they do not see them again in terms of assistance and \nchecks. They want them to be on their own.\n  Job retention is a measurable outcome goal. Earnings is a measurable \noutcome goal. Child well-being--whether the children of that mom have \nprenatal care, and for the pregnant mother--immunization rates of the \nchildren, the percent of children in child care, overall improvement in \nthe children's education, test results.\n  Within those specific measurable outcomes--employment, removing \nbarriers to employment, job retention, earnings, and child well-being--\na State's plan would say: We believe we know better how to get to the \ngoal of sufficiency; give us a chance to do that. Each State would be \nrequired to enter into a performance agreement with the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to meet certain targets to coordinate with \nother programs, to work with the Secretary to demonstrate that a \nreasonable workforce participation rate is being maintained, to have an \nevaluation plan that includes accountability for the benchmarks.\n  This will test the best way to help those on welfare today get off \nwelfare for good.\n  It would help some of those we now see in Tennessee who we were able \nto help because our State has unusual flexibility, but without that \nflexibility, we believe we would not have been able to serve them as \nsuccessfully.\n  Mr. President, there are many examples in my own experience, and I am \nsure in every State's experience, of how local ingenuity, local caring, \nworking with persons who are in trouble, one by one, has helped them \nsucceed.\n  I would like to see us take this next step with welfare reform. I \nbelieve since it had a bipartisan origin with a Democratic President of \nthe United States who invested years in trying to understand it, and a \nnew Republican Congress that made it a priority, that we owe this \nimportant legislation, this welfare reform bill, our full attention for \na few days. We can surely put aside some of these other issues long \nenough to help men and women get on their own two feet in this great \ncountry of ours, particularly to continue a program that for 10 years \nhas worked so well.\n  My goal will be to do what I can as one Senator to make sure we focus \non welfare reform; No. 2, to support the Snowe amendment that makes \nsure that if we require more work, we provide for more child care; and, \nNo. 3, to work with the committee to try to see if we can find a way so \nthat a limited number of States during this 5-year period can have \nsomewhat more flexibility in working with these difficult cases so when \nthis comes back around again in 4, 5, or 6 years, we can see what we \nhave learned.\n  Too often as programs go on, the restrictions from Washington pile \nup. I would like to see a countervailing effort, countervailing \nmovement within this legislation that continues to increase flexibility \nbecause, after all, it is stated right at the beginning of the 1996 \nlaw, giving States more flexibility is key to the success of welfare \nreform.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will take a few moments at this time. \nCertainly the issue of welfare reform is critical. The Senator from \nTennessee has outlined the phenomenal successes to date led by \nRepublicans both in the House and the Senate and now, of course, the \nFinance Committee has come forward with a reauthorization that is \ncritical to our country. But in talking about that issue, one of the \nthings that all welfare reform runs subject to is the ability, as we \nask people to leave welfare, to find a job.\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\n  Something that frustrates me at this moment is what is occurring \nwhile the Congress of the United States refuses to act that will have a \nvery real impact on the economy of our country and the ability to \ncreate jobs.\n  Just this morning, as constituents across this country by all of the \nSenators pulled up in front of their gas pumps to fill their tanks, \nthey paid the highest price for regular gas ever in the history of this \ncountry. Prices in California have skyrocketed out of sight, and it is \ntrue across the Nation.\n  That is a fact. That happened this morning, and gas people are \ntelling us that it will happen morning after morning as gas prices \nratchet up across this country.\n  There is another fact out there. Congress has searched for an \nagreement and debated what to do about this for well over 3 years. The \nHouse and the Senate passed energy bills in the past year and led the \nAmerican people to believe that they could solve this problem. Those \nreports came back from the Senate and the House. The Senate passed \ntheirs; the House passed theirs. The Senate could not get there for one \nreason or another and, as a result, a message was sent out to the \nAmerican people that the Senate of the United States could not come to \nan agreement on an energy bill. That is a fact.\n  Here is another fact. The reason energy prices continue to rise is \nthat the Senate, not the House, failed to get the 60 votes necessary to \nsolve what is becoming a major national crisis in this country. Let me \nrepeat that. The Senate of the United States failed to get cloture, a \nvote that is critical to moving beyond the 60-vote margin to allow a \nnational energy policy to go forward.\n  So if you grew a little angry this morning when you paid the highest \nprice you have ever paid for gas at the pump, call your Senator. No, \nnot your State Senator, call your United States Senator and ask he or \nshe how they voted on a national energy bill last year, and ask them if \nthey supported developing a national energy policy for this country.\n  I do believe Americans are finally getting it. They are finally \nbeginning to understand the crunch of high gas prices not only at the \npump but natural gas prices and electricity prices. Americans, like I \nsaid, are paying more for all levels of energy ever in this country.\n  Does that have an impact on job creation and the viability of our \neconomy? You bet it does. Does it have an impact on welfare, people \nlosing their jobs instead of being able to get off welfare from a \nreform bill and get out into the economy and find jobs? You bet it \ndoes. Jobs, all kinds of opportunities in this country, recreational \nopportunities, all of these kinds of issues are impacted by the cost of \nenergy in our country today.\n  What about the cost of growing food in our country? I just had an \nIdaho banker in my office in the last week. He has called all of his \nbank branch managers together and said: Look at all your fine lines of \ncredit to see whether we can afford to bump them up 25 or 30 percent \nbecause the average farmer is going to pay 25 or 30 percent more for \ninput costs in production this year than they did last year, and it is \nall going to be as a result of the cost of energy, and it is all going \nto be because this Senate failed to act in a strong bipartisan way to \nsolve this problem.\n  America's working men and women ought to be growing angry because \ntheir home heating bills this winter were the highest they ever paid in \na pretty cold and drawn-out winter. They paid more for the gas to heat \ntheir home. They paid more for oil than they ever paid.\n  Why? Let me repeat that. Because the Senate of the United States \nfailed to respond. Many on the other side are now saying we have a \njobless recovery, that we are not creating all kinds of jobs we ought \nto create even though our economy is beginning to grow. Well, if the \ncost of production is forced to an alltime level and we have to compete \nwith goods and services from all over the world that may be being \nproduced in a climate where energy is half the cost than it is in this \ncountry as relates to natural gas, maybe there is a reason why the \neconomy is sluggish and not moving as quickly as it should today.\n  My State, an agricultural State, a high-tech State, is also a tourism \nand recreation State. What is going to happen this summer when mom and \ndad and the four, three, or two kids get in the motor home and fill it \nup and it is going to cost another $10, $15 or $20 every time they stop \nto fill up their motor home? Well, they may not be traveling to my \nState of Idaho this year or other places in the Nation and spending \ntheir money and feeding the economy of the States that appreciate a \nrecreational economy.\n  I mentioned a few moments ago, average working men and women paid \nhistoric gas prices to heat their homes this year. Here is a very \nfascinating and very frustrating figure: Residential, commercial, and \nindustrial consumers have paid $130 billion more over the last 46 \nmonths, compared with 4 years before, than ever in the history of our \ncountry. That is an 86-percent increase in approximately 4 years in the \nprice of natural gas. Why? The Congress of the United States, the \nSenate, did not pass a bill that would have allowed greater \nexploration, that would allow the necessary kind of pipeline \ndevelopment.\n  The bill we would like to bring to the floor today would allow a gas \npipeline to be brought down out of Alaska where we are pumping billions \nof cubic feet of natural gas back into the ground that could be coming \nto the Lower 48. That would not have caused this figure.\n  The increased price of natural gas has cost industrial consumers $66 \nbillion, residential consumers $39 billion, and commercial consumers \n$25 billion. Every penny of the $130 billion could have been prevented \nif the Congress of the United States had acted.\n  We knew this perfect storm was coming. We have looked at it for the \nlast 5 years. We knew that with the Clean Air Act we were going to push \npeople toward natural gas, and yet we closed our public lands, we made \nit much more difficult to certificate, and we slowly but surely walked \naway from production at a time when Federal policy was increasing the \nuse of natural gas to alltime highs.\n  What is the impact on the farmer of my State? Let me give a few \nfigures. Everything from diesel fuel to the cost of fertilizer has gone \nup. It is skyrocketing. Some fertilizer costs will go up nearly 100 \npercent this year. It might mean less fertilizer is used. It may mean \nfood production could flatten out or even go down in this country.\n  What about the profitability of the farmer? If the farmer is not \nprofitable, if he is not making money, my guess is he is going to turn \nto his Senator or his Congressman and say, I have had a bad year; can \nyou help me a little bit? Maybe the reason he had a bad year is because \nthe Senate of the United States has refused for 5 years to look at a \ncomprehensive energy policy.\n  Loss of manufacturing jobs, plant shutdowns, corporate bankruptcies--\nsome of these have been tied to the high cost of energy. Residential \nelectric bills and certainly, as a result of that, higher food costs \nare all a part of it.\n  We like to get people off welfare. We want them to have self-dignity \nand worth. We want them to have a job on their own and we are willing \nto help them get there. But we flatten out our economy through Federal \nrule and regulation in part because we will not develop a national \nenergy policy.\n  What is the solution? Well, some of my friends on the other side, an \nattorney general out in California, said it is time to investigate the \nbig oil companies again; it is their fault. Now I would like to say: It \nain't their fault anymore. We are not letting them explore. We are not \nletting them develop. We are saying, this land is off; this land is \noff; you cannot go offshore; you cannot do this; you cannot do that. \nSlowly but surely we have ratcheted up our dependence on foreign \nproviders, now teetering at around 60 percent. The Middle East, oh, \nwell, we can blame OPEC; Venezuela, we can blame the politics of \nVenezuela. We sure do not want to blame ourselves for having failed to \ncome together in the development of a national energy policy.\n  The Governor of Rhode Island said this recently: The high cost of \nnatural gas is taking a toll on our economy across New England and \nacross the Nation. In today's competitive world, manufacturers cannot \nraise prices to compensate for higher energy costs.\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\nThe only long-term solution is to increase supply.\n  My guess is that when we talk about increasing supply, the land \noffshore Rhode Island is off limits to exploration and development.\n  The vice president of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau put it this way: One \nof the industry's highest dependence on natural gas as a feedstock and \ncritical to American agriculture is the fertilizer industry. Natural \ngas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all \ncommercial nitrogen fertilizers in the United States, accounting for \nnearly 90 percent of the farmers' total cost of anhydrous ammonia. Our \ndomestic fertilizer production capacity has already experienced a \npermanent loss of 25 percent over the last 4 years, and an additional \nincrease in costs, recommending the potential of another 20 percent \nshutdown of that industry.\n  Well, I could go on with quote after quote. I know I am not talking \nabout reauthorization of the Welfare Reform Act at this time, but an \neconomy that employs people is in direct relationship to getting people \noff welfare and getting them into a good-paying job. That is what an \neconomy that grows is all about.\n  When this Senate refuses to pass a national energy policy and by that \nfailure drives up energy costs, we drive jobs offshore, we drive jobs \nunderground, and most assuredly those who are out looking for a job for \nthe first time in this economy are not going to find that job; they are \ngoing to want to come back to their Government and ask for help and \nassistance.\n  I thought it was appropriate that we speak about a national energy \npolicy, about a job-creating economy, when we are talking about welfare \nreform. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for the work he \nhas done, the very bipartisan effort once again to do what is right \nand responsible in the area of welfare reform.\n\n  Let me challenge this Senate, Democrat and Republican alike, to do \nwhat is right when it comes to a national energy policy. Get this \ncountry back into the business of producing oil instead of using \nexcuses that it is somebody else's fault that the price of gas at the \npump is now at a national alltime high. I will tell my colleagues whose \nfault it is: Call your U.S. Senator. It is his fault that gas is now \nhigh today. Do not let them duck and hide and blame big oil or blame \nOPEC or blame someone else. Blame your Senator. Call him today. It is \nhis or her fault we do not have a national energy policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. He has \nwaited patiently all day. I didn't realize he had left for his office \nto come back. I thank him. It is generous of him to give me an \nopportunity to share some moments with reference to this bill and the \nissues raised on the floor.\n  As I listened to the previous speaker, my colleague and friend from \nthe State of Idaho, explain the energy problems of America, I certainly \nconcur with his conclusion. The cost of energy is high. That is an \ninput for business as well as for families. As those costs go up, it \nbecomes more difficult for our businesses in America to be competitive. \nFrankly, families find themselves facing inflation and heightened \nexpenses just to drive a car to work or to use the car in a small \nbusiness. As energy costs, like the cost of gasoline, go up, this \nconclusion is inescapable.\n  But I have to question the premise of the Senator from Idaho; that \nis, the problem is we are not drilling for enough oil in America. That \ncertainly is one of the problems. Having an adequate supply is \nessential. Those of us who believe we have to continue to look for \nenvironmentally responsible sources for oil and gas think that should \nbe part of a national effort and a national energy policy.\n  What is missing in the speech from the Senator from Idaho was any \nreference at all to the conservation of energy. Over the weekend in \nChicago I bought a copy of Consumer Reports, the April issue on the \n2004 automobiles. I went through it out of curiosity to find how many \nmiles per gallon the most popular cars in America are getting. You will \nfind time and time again that you are lucky to find a fuel-efficient \ncar anywhere in the range of 20 miles per gallon. Very few of them are \ngetting more than 20 miles per gallon.\n  If you put this in historic context it means that in the last 60 \nyears we have decided, as a nation, in our buying habits and in the \nproduction of automobiles, that we want heavier, less fuel-efficient \ncars, and that we are prepared to be more reliant on foreign sources \nfor fuel.\n  We are paying the price for it. Now we are seeing shortages because \nwe are not engaged in any discussion or commitment to conservation of \nenergy or the fuel efficiency of our energy-using vehicles and \nmachinery. We are paying the price for it.\n  We cannot drill enough oil and gas to take care of our profligate \nhabits when it comes to energy. Let me add, as we burn this energy \nwithout any concern for conservation, we are undoubtedly adding to \nglobal warming, air pollution, and serious environmental problems that \nwe visit on our children.\n  The Energy bill to which the Senator from Idaho referred must \ninclude, I would assume, some provision for greater fuel efficiency for \ncars and trucks. But, lo and behold, it does not. There is nothing in \nthat bill to deal with fuel efficiency. The original bill wanted to \npropose drilling for oil in the ANWR. That was defeated on the Senate \nfloor. But, sadly, the bill that finally came to us for a vote had \nlittle or nothing in it that would move us toward more fuel-efficient \nvehicles.\n  My friend from Utah, who is seeking recognition at this point, is the \nmodel for the Senate. If you look at my tall, lanky friend from Utah, \nhe goes out of this building, down the steps, and folds himself into a \nPrius, if I am not mistaken?\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is an insight, and the question is whether or not the \nSenator wanted a ride in a car that throughout its history has a 53.1 \nmiles-per-gallon history.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What a model Senator. I am happy to give him credit where \nit is due. I have watched him fold himself in and out of that car, and \nI have commended him in the past and I will continue to commend him. \nBut isn't it ironic that you have to go to Japan to buy these hybrid \nvehicles? Finally, Detroit, in a year or so, may be producing them.\n  My response to the Senator from Idaho is, yes, let's have a policy \ndebate about energy in America. But for goodness' sake, let's not \nbelieve the key to America's energy future is just finding more \nenvironmentally sensitive places to drill for oil--offshore, wilderness \nareas. Let's also commit ourselves to conservation of energy.\n  Let me address another issue. If we are talking about the \ncompetitiveness of American business, it is not just the input of \nenergy costs. You will find many businesses resist hiring new employees \nbecause they don't want to pay\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\nfor their health insurance. Health insurance has become a breaker for \nbusinesses large and small.\n  Those good American companies, patriotic companies, if you will, that \nprovide health insurance for their employees, when they sell the \nproduct in competition around the world, have to bring into the cost of \nthat product the cost of health insurance for their employees.\n  The obvious question is, What are you doing, Senator? What is the \nSenate or House or Congress or the President doing to deal with these \nskyrocketing health insurance costs? The answer is: Nothing. For at \nleast 3 years and even longer we have been afraid to even discuss the \nissue, as this system has fallen apart in front of our eyes.\n  So if you are talking about businesses being more competitive and \njobs being created and making certain that our products have a chance \nin world commerce, energy cost is important but so is the cost of \nhealth insurance. This Congress has done nothing.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of \nArkansas and Senator Tom Carper of Delaware that tries to create a \nsystem much like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program so that \nsmall businesses have access to the same private insurance pool as \nFederal employees across America. It would give them at least an \nopportunity for enrollment in a competitive atmosphere where prices \ncould come down as a result.\n  Let me address the bill before us, though, because it relates to this \nas well. Imagine the situation of the employees still working today--\nthank goodness many are and have not lost their jobs, or are in low-\npaying jobs--and they happen to have children. One of the concerns, of \ncourse, is what happens to the kids when these employees go to work. \nThis bill before us is welfare reform. I voted for it when it first \ncame out, but a lot of Democrats didn't.\n  My friend and mentor and one of my best influences in politics was \nthe late Paul Simon of Illinois, and he thought it was a terrible bill. \nI disagreed with him. I didn't very often, but I did on this bill, and \nI voted for welfare reform. Thank goodness the Clinton boom occurred \nright after we voted for welfare reform, and a lot of people came off \nwelfare to find work.\n\n  Now we are in the sad state of affairs under the Bush administration \nwhere we have lost more than 2.6 million manufacturing jobs since the \nPresident took office. We have lost manufacturing jobs for 43 \nconsecutive months. Frankly, as a result of that, the jobs remaining \nare not paying as well. So now you have a person struggling to get by, \nthey have a low-paying job, and children; they are worried about \ndaycare.\n  This bill, thank goodness, has a provision that is going to be added \nby the Senator from Maine in a bipartisan amendment in which Senator \nSnowe has suggested that we add $6 billion for daycare. It is long \noverdue. Some 16 million children under the age of 13 live in low-\nincome families, and they need childcare. Only 1 in 7 are eligible to \nreceive current Federal subsidies for childcare.\n  The funding in the original Senate bill wouldn't even serve the \nchildren served today. So the bill that comes before us is not \nadequate. In 15 States there are waiting lists of families that cannot \nafford to pay for childcare, and they are hoping to get a subsidy which \nis not there.\n  Let me also tell you it is an expensive proposition. Full-day \nchildcare can cost between $4,000 and $10,000 a year. It is comparable \nto the cost of college tuition. These are low-income families \nstruggling to deal with the reality of childcare. Twenty-five percent \nof America's families with young children earn less than $25,000 a \nyear.\n  We have to make certain we not only take care of the childcare but \nalso afterschool care. A lot of kids today get out of school at 2:30 or \n3 in the afternoon and have nowhere to go. They are latchkey children \nwho go home. What happens during that period before a responsible adult \nis on the scene? For some kids they watch television, they sit around \nand eat junk food; some do homework; some get in serious trouble--\ninvolvement with drugs and gangs and guns and pregnancy. Problems \noccur. Afterschool programs mean kids are in a healthy environment \nwhere they can learn instead of being exposed to the streets or left \nalone in a circumstance where they might not come out of it in a \npositive fashion.\n  Childcare works--not only childcare for smaller children but \nafterschool care as well. We need to make that commitment. If we are \nsaying to a welfare mother we want her to step forward and change her \nlife, let us accept the reality that if she is going to go, in good \nconscience, forward to get a job and acquire the skills and move \nforward, her first concern is her kid. Making sure her kids are taken \ncare of in a safe way during the day and afterschool.\n  Senator Snowe of Maine, my Republican colleague, has that bipartisan \namendment which I hope is going to be adopted very quickly.\n  How much time do we have remaining under the unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I would like to close on an unrelated \ntopic. I am in the process of reading a book, ``Against All Enemies,'' \nby Richard Clarke, and as I started reading the book I was struck by \nthe first chapter. You may remember Mr. Clarke served as the terrorism \nadviser and coordinator under President Clinton and then again under \nthis President Bush. He has been working for some 30 years as a \nprofessional in this field. He has made some statements over the last \n10 days which have become a source of headlines across America.\n  The administration has spent more time since he first appeared on \n``60 Minutes'' 7 or 8 days ago discrediting Richard Clarke than I have \never seen spent on any other individual. It is clear what he has said \nis painful to them. What he said is he believes this administration--\nthe Bush administration, and the Clinton administration for that \nmatter--could have done a better job in anticipating the threat of al-\nQaida.\n  He says in his book, of course, that he thinks they were too focused \non Iraq, even though there was no connection between Iraq, Saddam \nHussein, and 9/11 and the al-Qaida terrorists responsible for it.\n  These statements have enraged the White House. They have sent \neveryone out--from the President on down--stating publicly that Richard \nClarke is out to sell books.\n  If you read the first chapter of this book, you will get a much \ndifferent impression of this Richard Clarke, who to many is just \nanother faceless bureaucrat working in the White House. You will learn \nwhen you read this book--or others will tell you--that on 9/11 after \nthe World Trade Center was struck in New York, it was Richard Clarke in \nhis capacity as coordinator to deal with terrorism in the White House--\nwho had I guess as much as any single person in the Government--who had \na particular personal responsibility to deal with the safety of the \nPresident and the Vice President and the Cabinet, the continuity of \nGovernment, and the whole question of grounding aircraft around this \ncountry. He was the man who was at the controls at that point in time \nas everyone was trying to deal with what was going on.\n  I say that in a positive fashion because I do not know that I have \never heard many say what I have just said. But it tells me that a man \nwho spent 30 years dealing with the intelligence and domestic security \nand terrorism who is now being discredited in a matter of 7 or 8 days \nas a person who can't be trusted to share his insights on what happened \nraises some important questions.\n  I honestly believe Richard Clarke has done us a service. He says in \nthis book the Clinton administration could have done a better job. He \nsays the Bush administration could have done a better job. And, \nfrankly, we all could have done a better job, including Members of \nCongress, the Senate and the House. That is something we ought to face \nup to.\n  Let me also add he appeared last week before the 9/11 Commission. The \nSeptember 11 Commission is a bipartisan commission cochaired by \nGovernor Kean of New Jersey and former Congressman Lee Hamilton of \nIndiana--two good men, professionals who\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\nare trying to get at the bottom of why 9/11 occurred and what we could \nhave done to avoid it.\n  They have had testimony from Mr. Tenet, who is Director of the CIA, \nfrom Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld, and his predecessor, Secretary \nCohen. They are going to entertain testimony from President Clinton and \nPresident Bush. They certainly had Mr. Clarke before them, and I think \nthat is all well and good. I think all of those leaders in Government \nwho were involved in the decisionmaking should sit and meet with this \ncommission to get to the bottom of how America can be safer, which \nbrings us to the story of the day.\n\n  I can't understand why Condoleezza Rice, who has served this \nadministration and this country so well, is resisting an invitation to \nappear before the 9/11 Commission. If the President can find time, if \nformer President Clinton, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and the head \nof the CIA can find time, certainly it is not a matter of scheduling.\n  Second, she has made a number of appearances, as you know, on \ntelevision on ``60 Minutes'' last night, and many other shows. So she \nis prepared to entertain questions from reporters. Why is she resisting \nthis opportunity to testify? To say it has never been done, that it is \nunprecedented, let me say thank goodness 9/11 had never occurred before \nand it was unprecedented.\n  Let us gather together in a bipartisan fashion. Ms. Rice should come \nbefore the bipartisan commission and answer as many questions as openly \nand honestly as she can without ever crossing the line in the area of \nnational security. But as she resists this opportunity to share her \nfeelings about the preparation of the defense of America, she \nshortchanges the process which is simply trying to make America a safer \nnation.\n  Let us keep this bipartisan. Let us entertain not only Mr. Clarke but \nalso Ms. Rice in terms of her views and memories of what happened on \nthat fateful day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have listened to the debate that has \nbeen swirling around the country with respect to Iraq. The debate comes \nup again with respect to the commission which is currently meeting.\n  I cannot respond to all of the specifics that come along. I am \ntempted to, but I will not because I want to spend the time that is \nallotted to me by setting the total record before those who might be \nlistening so we can understand that many of the original statements or \noriginal positions with respect to Iraq that are being repeated over \nand over again are, in fact, false.\n  I remember our colleague across the aisle, the late Senator Moynihan \nfrom New York, one of my dear friends and one of the Senators for whom \nI have the highest regard, quoted something. He probably didn't think \nof it himself, but it was more or less his mantra, as he said to me: \n``Everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not to his own facts.''\n  We keep hearing things said over and over again with respect to the \nwar in Iraq as if they were fact. It is time to set the overall record \nstraight.\n  We heard one statement that there was absolutely no connection \nbetween 9/11 and Iraq. The other one we hear over and over again is the \nreason we went into Iraq is because we thought Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction. Some make it a little more stark than \nthat.\n  There was a group that marched on the Utah State Legislature wearing \nT-shirts that said, ``Bush Lied To Us. There Were No WMDs,'' as if the \nPresident of the United States George W. Bush himself alone was the \nonly authority for the notion that there were weapons of mass \ndestruction; and, once again repeating the false position that the only \nreason we went into Iraq is because we believed they had weapons of \nmass destruction.\n\n  To quote another individual not nearly as well known as Pat Moynihan \nbut my high school history teacher, she would always say to us, ``You \ncannot cut the seamless web of history.'' I want to take this \nopportunity to lay out the whole seamless web of the history of \nterrorism and do our best to understand it so we can realize the first \nstatement that there was no connection between Iraq and 9/11 and the \nsecond statement that the only reason we went in is because Bush lied \nto us about weapons there, are not true. And I hope we can get the \ndialog back to the facts.\n  I am distressed at what has happened to the dialog on this issue. I \nmust comment. On television was the former Vice President of the United \nStates with his hand with a clenched fist raised, the blood vessels \nstanding out on his neck, screaming at the top of his voice, speaking \nof the President, ``He has betrayed this country.''\n  To say the President has betrayed his country is to accuse him of \ntreason, which is one of the crimes specifically listed in the \nConstitution as an impeachable offense. We have not heard that kind of \nrhetoric from a politician as highly placed as Al Gore since the 1950s. \nAnd the politician who used to speak like that was a member of this \nChamber. His name was Joe McCarthy, and the President whom he accused \nof treason was Harry Truman.\n  Let us step away from that kind of rhetoric in this debate and review \nthe facts.\n  I had the opportunity of attending the Kissinger Lecture at the \nLibrary of Congress which was given by George Shultz, former Secretary \nof State. It was one of the most cogent and lucid statements of where \nwe are with respect to the war on terror I have ever heard. An update \nof that appeared in today's Wall Street Journal. I would like to quote \nfrom that those points which address the issues I have talked about, \nand ask unanimous consent that the entire piece be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, former Secretary of State George Shultz \nbegins with this comment:\n\n       We have struggled with terrorism for a long time. In the \n     Reagan administration, I was a hawk on the subject. I said \n     terrorism is a big problem, a different problem and we have \n     to take forceful action against it. Fortunately, Ronald \n     Reagan agreed with me but not many others did. [Don Rumsfeld \n     was an outspoken exception.]\n\n  Twenty-five years ago, it was on the radar screen of an American \nadministration--in this case one headed by Ronald Reagan--that \nterrorism was a problem.\n  Secretary Shultz goes on to discuss this and then makes this comment:\n\n       Today, looking back on the past quarter century of \n     terrorism, we can see that it is the method of choice of an \n     extensive, internationally connected ideological movement \n     dedicated to the destruction of our international system of \n     cooperation and progress. We can see that the 1981 \n     assassination of President Anwar Sadat, the 1993 bombing of \n     the World Trade Center, the 2001 destruction of the Twin \n     Towers, the bombs on the trains in Madrid, and scores of \n     other terrorist attacks in between and in many countries, \n     were carried out by one part or another of this movement. And \n     the movement is connected to states that develop awesome \n     weaponry, with some of it, or with expertise, for sale.\n\n  Let me emphasize that last sentence again. Speaking of international \nterrorism that was involved in all of these things, going back to the \nassassination of Sadat in 1981, he says:\n\n       And the movement is connected to states that develop \n     awesome weaponry, with some of it, or with expertise, for \n     sale.\n\n  All right. Do we have an example of such a state that has developed \nawesome weaponry that may be for sale? Yes.\n  Quoting again from Secretary Shultz, he speaks directly of Saddam \nHussein and Iraq. He adds to this Kim Jong Il of North Korea, and then \nsays:\n\n       They seize control of state power and use that power to \n     enhance their wealth, consolidate their rule and develop \n     their weaponry. As they do this, and as they violate the laws \n     and principles of the international system, they at the same \n     time claim its privileges and immunities, such as the \n     principle of non-intervention into the internal affairs of a \n     legitimate sovereign state. For decades these thugs have \n     gotten away with it. And the leading nations of the world \n     have let them get away with it.\n\n  Yes, we have heard much on this floor about America must not invade \nanother sovereign state. That is precisely what Secretary Shultz is \ntalking about when he says, these states that develop awesome weaponry \nand cooperate with terrorism for the purpose of\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\nupsetting the international order, then claim the immunities of the \ninternational order for themselves--as he says: ``such as the principle \nof non-intervention into the internal affairs of a legitimate sovereign \nstate.''\n  He goes on to summarize all that happened in Iraq. And again, those \nwho will read the entire piece as it appears following my statement can \nget all of those details. But after he recites the details of what \nSaddam Hussein has done, he turns to David Kay, the man who is quoted \nagain and again as the authority for the statement on the T-shirt that \nsays: ``Bush Lied To Us.''\n  Well, let's see what David Kay really said. I said in my previous \nstatement David Kay told this Congress, testifying before the Armed \nServices Committee, that Saddam Hussein was, in fact, more dangerous \nthan we thought when we started the war. But these are the portions of \nDavid Kay's position Secretary Shultz chooses to highlight, and I think \nthey are the right ones to bring out.\n  Quoting again:\n\n       As Dr. David Kay put it in a Feb. 1 interview with Chris \n     Wallace, ``We know there were terrorist groups in state still \n     seeking WMD capability. Iraq, although I found no weapons, \n     had tremendous capabilities in this area. A marketplace \n     phenomena was about to occur, if it did not occur; sellers \n     meeting buyers. And I think that would have been very \n     dangerous if the war had not intervened.''\n\n  Sellers of what? Buyers of what? Who would the sellers be? Who would \nthe buyers be? The sellers, obviously, would be the Iraqis. The buyers \nwould be the terrorists. And what are we talking about?\n  Back to Secretary Shultz:\n\n       When asked by Mr. Wallace what the sellers could have sold \n     if they didn't have actual weapons, Mr. Kay said: ``The \n     knowledge of how to make them, the knowledge of how to make \n     small amounts, which is, after all, mostly what terrorists \n     want. They don't want battlefield amounts of weapons. No, \n     Iraq remained a very dangerous place in terms of WMD \n     capabilities, even though we found no large stockpiles of \n     weapons.''\n\n  Just think about that for a second: the knowledge to make them.\n  If I could give a very homely example, last week my wife and I were \ncelebrity chefs at the March of Dimes gala, and we won a prize, and \npeople all said: Is this an old family recipe? We had to admit, no, we \ncalled a chef in Salt Lake City at one of the finest restaurants there, \nwho happens to work as a judge at these kinds of celebrity cook-ins, \nand he gave us a recipe he thought would win. We have been celebrity \nchefs four times. We have called him all four times. We have won three \nout of four.\n  The capacity to tell somebody how to make something will produce that \nsomething just as much as having that something yourself. This chef did \nnot participate, but his recipes participated, and his recipes won. All \nwe had to do was be the willing buyers in the case; and he was the \nwilling seller. I will add, just for the record, no money changed hands \nwith respect to the recipe. But the example is there, and that is what \nDavid Kay is talking about.\n  Going back to Secretary Shultz, he says:\n\n     . . . in the long run, the most important aspect of the Iraq \n     war will be what it means for the integrity of the \n     international system and for the effort to deal effectively \n     with terrorism. The stakes are huge and the terrorists know \n     that as well as we do. That is the reason for their tactic of \n     violence in Iraq. And that is why, for us and for our allies, \n     failure is not an option. The message is that the U.S. and \n     others in the world who recognize the need to sustain our \n     international system will no longer quietly acquiesce in the \n     take-over of states by lawless dictators who then carry on \n     their depredations--including the development of awesome \n     weapons for threats, use, or sale--behind the shield of \n     protection that statehood provides. If you are one of these \n     criminals in charge of a state, you no longer should expect \n     to be allowed to be inside the system at the same time that \n     you are a deadly enemy of it.\n\n  Secretary Shultz concludes his piece with this comment:\n\n       If we put this in terms of World War II, we are now \n     sometime around 1937. In the 1930s, the world failed to do \n     what it needed to do to head off a world war. Appeasement \n     never works. Today we are in action. We must not flinch. With \n     a powerful interplay of strength and diplomacy, we can win \n     this war.\n\n  Put it in context, put it in the historic pattern, and we realize \nthis is all connected and that the action with respect to Iraq was a \nvery proper, significant, indeed, essential part of the overall war on \nterrorism. If we had not moved ahead, we would have been irresponsible.\n  The summary is in the callout that is put in the paper that says:\n\n       The U.S. had no choice: We had to oust Saddam Hussein, or \n     face the gravest threat.\n\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I might use that 4\\1/2\\ minutes, then, to address the \nfundamental question of the future nobody talks about. We are spending \nall of this time rehashing the past. Here is the fundamental question \nof the future: What happened to Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction? The assumption raised by the statement that ``Bush lied to \nus about the weapons'' is that the weapons never existed.\n  Well, the first person to convince me the weapons existed was \nMadeleine Albright. The first President to tell me the weapons existed \nwas William Jefferson Clinton.\n  The first group that insisted weapons were there was working for the \nUnited Nations. This was not a partisan thing put together by George W. \nBush. The weapons were clearly in Iraq, and the question is not why \ndidn't Bush tell us the truth about them; the question is, what \nhappened to them? That is the question we need to address. That is the \nquestion of the future we are ignoring in all of this debate about who \nsaid what at what point in the past.\n  As I see it, there are four possibilities of what happened to the \nweapons Saddam Hussein had. No. 1, we got them all in the bombing in \n1998. We must remember, as we try to truncate the history, the war in \nIraq began in 1991. The U.N. resolution that called for the war was \nnever suspended. It was renewed with acts of war in 1998. A heavy 4-day \nperiod of solid bombing is an act of war. President Clinton carried \nthat out with the approval of this Congress. So the first possibility \nis that bombing destroyed all of the weapons of mass destruction.\n  The second possibility, Saddam Hussein himself dismantled his \nstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction in an effort to convince the \nU.N. inspectors they were not there so the inspectors would leave him \nalone and he could go back to building them after the inspectors were \ngone. There is some suggestion that was in fact what happened, that he \ndid not intend to disarm, as U.N. Resolution 1441 required he do. All \nhe intended to do was deceive, and that is where the weapons went.\n  Possibility No. 3, they were trucked over the border. Some of them \ngot into Syria or other places and into the hands of others who still \nhave them.\n  And possibility No. 4, they are still in Iraq and we simply have not \nfound them. When people ask me, which of these four possibilities do \nyou think is the most likely, I say: All of the above. I believe we \ndestroyed a good portion of his weapons in the 1998 bombing. I believe \nhe himself dismantled others in a deliberate attempt to deceive the \nU.N. inspectors. I believe some of them did get out of the country and \nare in the hands of other bad actors somewhere. And I believe there are \nprobably still some hidden away somewhere in the desert in Iraq.\n  Unless the first answer is the only one that is correct and they were \nall destroyed in the bombing, they are still around somewhere. The \ncapacity to build them was still around, as David Kay pointed out, \nbefore we went in and removed that.\n  If there are some of them still around, why aren't we looking for \nthem? Why aren't we paying attention to where they might be? I believe \nthe American military is still on the alert for them. I believe the \nAmerican intelligence community is still looking to where they might \nbe. But in the debate we have here on the Senate floor, this question \nis never raised. It is never given any attention. Instead we spend all \nof our time looking backward and trying to assign blame instead of \nlooking forward and trying to solve problems.\n  I commend Secretary Shultz's presentation to all. It is a clear \nhistoric perspective over a quarter century from one of our senior \nstatesmen that makes it clear the rhetoric surrounding this issue has \nbeen inappropriate and focused on the wrong thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n          [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, Mar. 29, 2004]\n\n                            An Essential War\n\n                         (By George P. Shultz)\n\n       We have struggled with terrorism for a long time. In the \n     Reagan administration, I was a hawk on the subject. I said \n     terrorism is a big problem, a different problem, and we have \n     to take forceful action against it. Fortunately, Ronald \n     Reagan agreed with me, but not many others did. (Don Rumsfeld \n     was an outspoken exception).\n       In those days we focused on how to defend against \n     terrorism. We reinforced our embassies and increased out \n     intelligence effort. We thought we made some progress. We \n     established the legal basis for holding states responsible \n     for using terrorists to attack Americans anywhere. Through \n     intelligence, we did abort many potential terrorist acts. But \n     we didn't really understand what motivated the terrorists or \n     what they were out to do.\n       In the 1990s, the problem began to appear even more \n     menacing. Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were well known, but \n     the nature of the terror threat was not yet comprehended and \n     our efforts to combat it were ineffective. Diplomacy without \n     much force was tried. Terrorism was regarded as a law \n     enforcement problem and terrorists as criminals. Some were \n     arrested and put on trial. Early last year, a judge finally \n     allowed the verdict to stand for one of those convicted in \n     the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Ten years! Terrorism is \n     not a matter that can be left to law enforcement, with its \n     deliberative process, built-in delays, and safeguards that \n     may let the prisoner go free on procedural grounds.\n       Today, looking back on the past quarter century of \n     terrorism, we can see that it is the method of choice of an \n     extensive, internationally connected ideological movement \n     dedicated to the destruction of our international system of \n     cooperation and progress. We can see that the 1981 \n     assassination of President Anwar Sadat, the 1993 bombing of \n     the World Trade Center, the 2001 destruction of the Twin \n     Towers, the bombs on the trains in Madrid, and scores of \n     other terrorist attacks in between and in many countries, \n     were carried out by one part or another of this movement. And \n     the movement is connected to states that develop awesome \n     weaponry, with some of it, or with expertise, for sale.\n       What should we do? First and foremost, shore up the state \n     system.\n       The world has worked for three centuries with the sovereign \n     state as the basic operating entity, presumably accountable \n     to its citizens and responsible for their well-being. In this \n     system, states also interact with each other--bilaterlly or \n     multilaterally--to accomplish ends that transcend their \n     borders. They create international organizations to serve \n     their ends, not govern them.\n       Increasingly, the state system has been eroding. Terrorists \n     have exploited this weakness by burrowing into the state \n     system in order to attack it. While the state system weakens, \n     no replacement is in sight that can perform the essential \n     functions of establishing an orderly and lawful society, \n     protecting essential freedoms, providing a framework for \n     fruitful economic activity, contributing to effective \n     international cooperation, and providing for the common \n     defense.\n       I see our great task as restoring the vitality of the state \n     system within the framework of a world of opportunity, and \n     with aspirations for a world of states that recognize \n     accountability for human freedom and dignity.\n       All established states should stands up to their \n     responsibilities in the fight against our common enemy, \n     terror; be a helpful partner in economic and political \n     development; and take care that international organizations \n     work for their member states, not the other way around. When \n     they do, they deserve respect and help to make them work \n     successfully.\n       The civilized world has a common stake in defeating the \n     terrorists. We now call this what it is: a War on Terrorism. \n     In war, you have to act on both offense and defense. You have \n     to hit the enemy before the enemy hits you. The diplomacy of \n     incentives, containment, deterrence and prevention are all \n     made more effective by the demonstrated possibility of \n     forceful preemption. Strength and diplomacy go together. They \n     are not alternatives; they are complements. You work \n     diplomacy and strength together on a grand and strategic \n     scale and on an operational and tactical level. But if you \n     deny yourself the option of forceful preemption, you \n     diminish the effectiveness of your diplomatic moves. And, \n     with the consequences of a terrorist attack as hideous as \n     they are--witness what just happened in Madrid--the U.S. \n     must be ready to preempt identified threats. And not at \n     the last moment, when an attack is imminent and more \n     difficult to stop, but before the terrorist gets in \n     position to do irreparable harm.\n       Over the last decade we have seen large areas of the world \n     where there is no longer any state authority at all, an ideal \n     environment for terrorists to plan and train. In the early \n     1990s we came to realize the significance of a ``failed \n     state.'' Earlier, people allowed themselves to think that, \n     for example, an African colony could gain its independence, \n     be admitted to the U.N. as a member state, and thereafter \n     remain a sovereign state. Then came Somalia. All government \n     disappeared. No more sovereignty, no more state. The same was \n     true in Afghanistan. And who took over? Islamic extremists. \n     They soon made it clear that they regarded the concept of the \n     state as an abomination. To them, the very idea of ``the \n     state'' was un-Islamic. They talked about reviving \n     traditional forms of pan-Islamic rule with no place for the \n     state. They were fundamentally, and violently, opposed to the \n     way the world works, to the international state system.\n       The United States launched a military campaign to eliminate \n     the Taliban and al Qaeda's rule over Afghanistan. Now we and \n     our allies are trying to help Afghanistan become a real state \n     again and a viable member of the international state system. \n     Yet there are many other parts of the world where state \n     authority has collapsed or, within some states, large areas \n     where the state's authority does not run.\n       That's one area of danger: places where the state has \n     vanished. A second area of danger is found in places where \n     the state has been taken over by criminals or warlords. \n     Saddam Hussein was one example. Kim Jong Il of North Korea is \n     another.\n       They seize control of state power and use that power to \n     enhance their wealth, consolidate their rule and develop \n     their weaponry. As they do this, and as they violate the laws \n     and principles of the international system, they at the same \n     time claim its privileges and immunities, such as the \n     principle of non-intervention into the internal affairs of a \n     legitimate sovereign state. For decades these thugs have \n     gotten away with it. And the leading nations of the world \n     have let them get away with it.\n       This is why the case of Saddam Hussein and Iraq is so \n     significant. After Saddam Hussein consolidated power, he \n     started a war against one of his neighbors, Iran, and in the \n     course of that war he committed war crimes including the use \n     of chemical weapons, even against his own people.\n       About 10 years later he started another war against another \n     one of his neighbors, Kuwait. In the course of doing so he \n     committed war crimes. He took hostages. He launched missiles \n     against a third and then a fourth country in the region.\n       That war was unique in modern times because Saddam totally \n     eradicated another state, and turned it into ``Province 19'' \n     of Iraq. The aggressors in wars might typically seize some \n     territory, or occupy the defeated country, or install a \n     puppet regime; but Saddam sought to wipe out the defeated \n     state, to erase Kuwait from the map of the world.\n       That got the world's attention. That's why, at the U.N., \n     the votes were wholly in favor of a U.S.-led military \n     operation--Desert Storm--to throw Saddam out of Kuwait and to \n     restore Kuwait to its place as a legitimate state in the \n     international system. There was virtually universal \n     recognition that those responsible for the international \n     system of states could not let a state simply be rubbed out.\n       When Saddam was defeated, in 1991, a cease-fire was put in \n     place. Then the U.N. Security Council decided that, in order \n     to prevent him from continuing to start wars and commit \n     crimes against his own people, he must give up his arsenal of \n     ``weapons of mass destruction.''\n       Recall the way it was to work. If Saddam cooperated with \n     U.N. inspectors and produced and facilitated their \n     destruction, then the cease-fire would be transformed into a \n     peace agreement ending the state of war between the \n     international system and Iraq. But if Saddam did not \n     cooperate, and materially breached his obligations regarding \n     his weapons of mass destruction, then the original U.N. \n     Security Council authorization for the use of ``all necessary \n     force'' against Iraq--an authorization that at the end of \n     Desert Storm had been suspended but not cancelled--would be \n     reactivated and Saddam would face another round of the U.S.-\n     led military action against him. Saddam agreed to this \n     arrangement.\n       In the early 1990s, U.N. inspectors found plenty of \n     materials in the category of weapons of mass destruction and \n     they dismantled a lot of it. They kept on finding such \n     weapons, but as the presence of force declined, Saddam's \n     cooperation declined. He began to play games and to obstruct \n     the inspection effort.\n       By 1998 the situation was untenable. Saddam had made \n     inspections impossible. President Clinton, in February 1998, \n     declared that Saddam would have to comply with the U.N. \n     resolutions or face American military force. Kofi Annan flew \n     to Baghdad and returned with a new promise of cooperation \n     from Saddam. But Saddam did not cooperate. Congress then \n     passed the Iraq Liberation Act by a vote of 360 to 38 in the \n     House of Representatives; the Senate gave its unanimous \n     consent. Signed into law on October 31, it supported the \n     renewed use of force against Saddam with the objective of \n     changing the regime. By this time, he had openly and utterly \n     rejected the inspections and the U.N. resolutions.\n       In November 1998, the Security Council passed a resolution \n     declaring Saddam to be in ``flagrant violation'' of all \n     resolutions going back to 1991. That meant that the cease-\n     fire was terminated and the original authorization for the \n     use of force against Saddam was reactivated. President \n     Clinton ordered American forces into action in December 1998.\n       But the U.S. military operation was called off after only \n     four days--apparently because President Clinton did not feel \n     able to lead the country in war at a time when he was facing \n     impeachment.\n       So inspections stopped. The U.S. ceased to take the lead. \n     But the inspectors reported\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\n     that as of the end of 1998 Saddam possessed major quantities \n     of WMDs across a range of categories, and particularly in \n     chemical and biological weapons and the means of delivering \n     them by missiles. All the intelligence services of the world \n     agreed on this.\n       From that time until late last year, Saddam was left \n     undisturbed to do what he wished with this arsenal of \n     weapons. The international system had given up its ability to \n     monitor and deal with this threat. All through the years \n     between 1998 and 2002 Saddam continued to act and speak and \n     to rule Iraq as a rogue state.\n       President Bush made it clear by 2002, and against the \n     background of 9/11, that Saddam must be brought into \n     compliance. It was obvious that the world could not leave \n     this situation as it was. The U.S. made the decision to \n     continue to work within the scope of the Security Council \n     resolutions--a long line of them--to deal with Saddam. After \n     an extended and excruciating diplomatic effort, the Security \n     Council late in 2002 passed Resolution 1441, which gave \n     Saddam one final chance to comply or face military force. \n     When on December 8, 2002, Iraq produced its required report, \n     it was clear that Saddam was continuing to play games and to \n     reject his obligations under international law. His report, \n     thousands of pages long, did not in any way account for the \n     remaining weapons of mass destruction that the U.N. \n     inspectors had reported to be in existence as of the end of \n     1998. That assessment was widely agreed upon.\n       That should have been that. But the debate at the U.N. went \n     on--and on. And as it went on it deteriorated. Instead of the \n     focus being kept on Iraq and Saddam, France induced others to \n     regard the problem as one of restraining the U.S.--a position \n     that seemed to emerge from France's aspirations for greater \n     influence in Europe and elsewhere. By March of 2003 it was \n     clear that French diplomacy had resulted in splitting NATO, \n     the European Union, and the Security Council . . . and \n     probably convincing Saddam that he would not face the use of \n     force. The French position, in effect, was to say that Saddam \n     had begun to show signs of cooperation with the U.N. \n     resolutions because more than 200,000 American troops were \n     poised on Iraq's borders ready to strike him; so the U.S. \n     should just keep its troops poised there for an indeterminate \n     time to come, until presumably France would instruct us that \n     we could either withdraw or go into action. This of course \n     was impossible militarily, politically, and financially.\n       Where do we stand now? These key points need to be \n     understood:\n       There as never been a clearer case of a rogue state using \n     its privileges of statehood to advance its dictator's \n     interest in ways that defy and endanger the international \n     state system.\n       The international legal case against Saddam--17 \n     resolutions--was unprecedented.\n       The intelligence services of all involved nations and the \n     U.N. inspectors over more than a decade all agreed that \n     Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction that posed a \n     threat to international peace and security.\n       Saddam had four undisturbed years to augment, conceal, \n     disperse, otherwise deal with his arsenal.\n       He used every means to avoid cooperating or explaining what \n     he has done with them. This refusal in itself was, under the \n     U.N. resolutions, adequate grounds for resuming the military \n     operation against him that had been put in abeyance in 1991 \n     pending his compliance.\n       President Bush, in ordering U.S. forces into action, stated \n     that we were doing so under U.N. Security Council Resolutions \n     678 and 687, the original basis for military action against \n     Saddam Hussein in 1991. Those who criticize the U.S. for \n     unilateralism should recognize that no nation in the history \n     of the United Nations has ever engaged in such a sustained \n     and committed multilateral diplomatic effort to adhere to the \n     principles of international law and international \n     organization with the international system. In the end, it \n     was the U.S. that upheld and acted in accordance with the \n     U.N. resolutions on Iraq, not those on the Security Council \n     who tried to stop us.\n       The question of weapons of mass destruction is just that: a \n     question that remains to be answered, a mystery that must be \n     solved. Just as we also must solve the mystery of how Libya \n     and Iran developed menacing nuclear capability without \n     detection, of how we were caught unaware of a large and \n     flourishing black market in nuclear material, and of how we \n     discovered these developments before they got completely out \n     of hand and have put in place promising corrective processes. \n     The question of Iraq's presumed stockpile of weapons will be \n     answered, but that answer, however it comes out, will not \n     affect the fully justifiable and necessary action that the \n     coalition has undertaken to bring an end to Saddam Hussein's \n     rule over Iraq. As David Kay put it in a February 1 interview \n     with Chris Wallace, ``We know there were terrorist groups in \n     state still seeking WMD capability. Iraq, although I found no \n     weapons, had tremendous capabilities in this area. A \n     marketplace phenomena was about to occur, if it did not \n     occur; sellers meeting buyers. And I think that would have \n     been very dangerous if the war had not intervened.''\n       When asked by Mr. Wallace what the sellers could have sold \n     if they didn't have actual weapons, Mr. Kay said: ``The \n     knowledge of how to make them, the knowledge of how to make \n     small accounts, which is, after all, mostly what terrorists \n     want. They don't want battlefield amounts of weapons. No, \n     Iraq remained a very dangerous place in terms of WMD \n     capabilities, even though we found no large stockpiles of \n     weapons.''\n       Above all, and in the long run, the most important aspect \n     of the Iraq war will be what it means for the integrity of \n     the internationals system and for the effort to deal \n     effectively with terrorism. The stakes are huge and the \n     terrorists know that as well as we do. That is the reason for \n     their tactic of violence in Iraq. And that is why, for us and \n     for our allies, failure is not an option. The message is that \n     the U.S. and others in the world who recognize the need to \n     sustain our international system will no longer quietly \n     acquiesce in the take-over of states by lawless dictators who \n     then carry on their depredations--including the development \n     of awesome weapons for threats, use, or sale--behind the \n     shield of protection that statehood provides. If you are one \n     of these criminals in charge of a state, you no longer should \n     expect to be allowed to be inside the system at the same time \n     that you are a deadly enemy of it.\n       September 11 forced us to comprehend the extent and danger \n     of the challenge. We began to act before our enemy was able \n     to extend and consolidate his network.\n       If we put this in terms of World War II, we are now \n     sometime around 1937. In the 1930s, the world failed to do \n     what it needed to do to head off a world war. Appeasement \n     never works. Today we are in action. We must not flinch. With \n     a powerful interplay of strength and diplomacy, we can win \n     this war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3283-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3283-S3288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OIL SUPPLY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last Thursday a press release from the \nDepartment of Interior came across my desk that at first glance \nappeared to be the announcement of an April fool's joke. The press \nrelease stated beginning April 1, the Interior Department will deliver \nabout 115,000 barrels of oil per day to the Department of Energy for \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I thought this was an April fool's \nprank because this is about the worst possible time for the \nadministration to be taking oil off the market for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  Crude oil and gasoline prices are historic highs and inventory levels \nare near historic lows. Consumers are paying record prices at the gas \npumps. Manufacturers and farmers and a whole lot of other folks are \npaying high prices for diesel fuel. Our airlines face soaring fuel \ncosts and so does the trucking industry. Our economy, which has major \nproblems, will be weakened further by high energy prices.\n  To make the timing even worse, the Department of Interior plans to \nbegin its oil deliveries to the DOE on April 1, the same date the OPEC \ncartel is scheduled to start cutting its oil production. The purpose \nand effect of OPEC's cuts are to raise oil prices further. The effect \nof the administration's stated plans to keep filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve regardless of the price of oil, if implemented, will \nbe the same, principally because tight supplies and private inventories \nwill become even tighter due to the administration's additional demands \nfor oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Regrettably, the Interior Department's announcement is no April \nfool's joke. To the contrary, it is another misstep in the \nadministration's illogical and counterproductive practice of putting \noil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, regardless of the price of \ncrude oil.\n  Over the past 2 years, this practice has pushed up oil prices with \nminimal improvement to our overall energy or national security and with \ngreat detriment to our economic security.\n  Let's just review what has happened with energy prices. Crude oil \nprices have been steadily increasing over the past 2\\1/2\\ years. Last \nweek crude oil reached a 13-year high of over $38 per barrel. So far \nthis year, crude oil is averaging about $35 per barrel. In 2003, a \nbarrel of crude oil cost on average over $31. That was a record at that \npoint. Climbing crude oil prices have led to higher prices for refined \nproducts, including gasoline, home heating oil, jet fuel, and diesel \nfuel.\n  Today, as well as four times in the last 10 days or so, the price of \ngasoline reached a record high. Nationally the average price of a \ngallon of gasoline is now $1.75. In Michigan, the average price of a \ngallon of unleaded is up to $1.78. There are fears prices could go over \n$2 if there is even a small interruption in supply.\n  The DOE's Energy Information Administration, the EIA, projects prices \nwill rise on average to $1.83 per gallon\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\nthis spring, and that prices will remain at high levels throughout the \nyear, averaging nearly $1.70 per gallon over the course of the entire \nyear. These high oil and gasoline prices are hurting consumers and \nbusinesses. The EIA recently stated the average consumer paid $200 more \nfor gasoline in 2003 than the previous year. Prices this year are \nalready a dime per gallon more than in 2003. Over the course of a year, \neach 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline takes $1 \nbillion out of the pockets of American consumers.\n  Following the laws of supply and demand, the principal reason oil \nprices are so high is the amount of crude oil in private sector \ninventories in the United States is so low.\n  In fact, our private sector inventories are hovering around record \nlow levels. In January, crude oil inventories fell to levels lower than \nat any time in the 28 years the Department of Energy has been tracking \nthose inventories.\n  Why are supplies so low? This administration's oil policies are \npartly responsible. Since late 2001, the Department of Energy has taken \nmillions of barrels of oil off the market and put them into the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  In late 2001, the reserve held about 560 million barrels of oil. \nSince then, day after day, for over 2 years, the Department of Energy \nhas added an average of about 100,000 barrels of oil per day to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve without regard to the price of oil.\n  Today, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds nearly 650 million \nbarrels, or 93 percent of its capacity of 700 million barrels.\n  DOE plans to keep on adding oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nno matter what the price, no matter how dangerously low private sector \ninventories are. In April, the DOE plans to add about 200,000 barrels \nper day to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, just as it has been doing \nthis month.\n  By taking oil off the market and pushing up prices when supplies were \ntight and prices were high, filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has \ndecreased the amount of oil in private inventories. That is because \nwhen current prices are high, companies with oil in inventory will draw \nfrom those inventories to supply oil to their customers--including the \nSPR--before they buy expensive new oil.\n  From April 2002 through the end of last year--a period in which the \noil markets were extremely tight, reflecting high prices and low \nsupplies--oil inventories in the private sector decreased by almost as \nmuch as the petroleum reserve inventory increased. From April 2002 to \nDecember 2003, the Department of Energy deposited about 78 million \nbarrels of oil in the petroleum reserve. During this same period, the \nUnited States private sector inventories declined by about 61 million \nbarrels. So the 78 million barrels of oil that were deposited into the \npetroleum reserve are shown by this red line in the last approximately \nyear and a half, the decline in the private inventories is shown by \nthis white line over the same period. So you can see from the chart \nthat the amount deposited in the reserve is almost the same--slightly \nmore--as the decline in private inventories. That means, despite \nfilling the reserve for almost 2 years, the total oil in inventory, \nprivate and public reserve, in the United States during this period \nincreased by only 17 million barrels--under 2 percent.\n  Several studies have demonstrated that the decrease in U.S. private \ninventories since April 2002 is directly related to filling of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. While there are other factors as well, \nsuch as OPEC production limits and increased global demand for crude \noil, especially in China, the filling of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve has been a major contributor to the decrease in private sector \ninventories.\n  Goldman Sachs, one of the largest and most successful crude oil \ntraders in the world, reported the following on January 16th of this \nyear:\n\n       Large speculative positions, builds in Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserves, and low inventory coverage have contributed to \n     current price levels.\n\n  Goldman Sachs also stated:\n\n       Past government storage builds [build-ups] will provide \n     persistent support to the market\n\nand that\n\n     current plans for the injection of 130,000 [barrels/day] of \n     royalty-in-kind barrels into the petroleum U.S. Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve (SPR) between now and the end of September \n     . . . will likely provide even further support.\n\n  Here, the word ``support'' means keeping prices high.\n  In early 2002, the Department of Energy's own staff warned that \nfilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a tight market would reduce \nprivate sector inventories and raise prices and tried to persuade the \nadministration to postpone putting oil into the reserve so oil supplies \nwould be more plentiful.\n  In the spring of 2002, as prices were rising and inventories falling, \nthe Department of Energy's own petroleum reserve staff warned the \nfollowing:\n\n       Commercial inventories are low, retail prices are high, and \n     economic growth is slow. The Government should avoid \n     acquiring oil for the Reserve under these circumstances.\n\n  The administration chose to ignore those warnings. The reserve \ndeliveries proceeded. As the DOE staff predicted, oil supplies \ntightened and prices climbed.\n  Last week, the Secretary of Energy repeated the administration's \nposition that it would not suspend shipments of oil into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, despite the high prices and low private inventories \nof oil. The Secretary rejected criticism of the Energy Department's \nposition by claiming that the amount of oil placed in the reserve is \ntoo small to make any difference in the price of oil.\n  But in 2002, the Department of Energy's own staff refuted that very \nclaim. The DOE Strategic Petroleum Reserve staff explained how taking \nthese barrels off the market for an extended period of time would \nresult in a large decrease to the overall supply of oil on the market. \nThis is the DOE staff warning, which was ignored by the DOE and the \nadministration:\n\n       If we look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the \n     perspective of daily supply and demand, the SPR fill rates \n     are inconsequential. The fill rate is 100,000 to 170,000 \n     barrels per day compared to world production and consumption \n     of 75 million barrels per day. However, when OPEC countries \n     are determined to maintain discipline in their export quotas, \n     the cumulative impact of filling the SPR becomes more \n     significant when compared to U.S. and Atlantic basin \n     inventories. Essentially, if the SPR inventory grows, and \n     OPEC does not accommodate that growth by exporting more oil, \n     the increase comes at the expense of commercial inventories. \n     Most analysts agree that oil prices are directly correlated \n     with inventories, and a drop of 20 million barrels over a 6-\n     month period can substantially increase prices.\n\n  In fact, commercial inventories did fall, on average, by 20 million \nbarrels in each of the 3 successive 6-month periods. So what the DOE \nexpert staff said is exactly what has come to pass.\n  ``Most analysts agree,'' they said, ``that oil prices are directly \ncorrelated with inventories, and a drop of 20 million barrels over a 6-\nmonth period can substantially increase prices.''\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds by far the largest strategic \noil reserves in the world. In contrast, U.S. private sector oil \ninventories have fallen well below normal levels. Private sector \ninventories of gasoline are also well below average.\n  In an article explaining why oil prices are so high, this week's \nedition of The Economist reports the following:\n\n       Another fact . . . propping up oil prices may be what [a] \n     trader calls ``supply-disruption risk.''\n\n  And then The Economist goes on as follows:\n\n       These worries have, in part, been fueled by a most \n     unexpected source: the American Government. Despite the high \n     prices, American officials continue to buy oil on the open \n     market to fill their country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \n     When prices are high, why buy, you might ask, and thereby \n     keep them up? The Senate has asked that question as well. It \n     passed a non-binding resolution this month calling on the \n     Bush administration to stop SPR purchases; but Spencer \n     Abraham, the Energy Secretary, has refused.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the Energy Secretary and this administration \nwill reconsider that refusal because the day after the Senate adopted \nour amendment I cosponsored with Senator Collins to cancel the planned \nshipments of 53 million barrels to the SPR, oil prices in New York and \nLondon fell by $1 per barrel on the news that this oil might not be \nplaced in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But after the Department of \nEnergy and key Members of Congress announced opposition to our \namendment, even though it was adopted in the Senate, oil prices went \nright back up.\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\n  This real-world price change shows that the cancellation of the \ncurrently planned shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would \nprovide some immediate relief from high oil and gasoline prices and \nalso provide long-term relief, as the additional oil supplies would \nenable inventories to be built back up to normal levels.\n  In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last \nweek, the Secretary of Energy cited ``national security'' as the \nrationale for continuing to fill the SPR despite high oil prices and \nlow supplies. This rationale is unpersuasive for two reasons.\n  First, the 50 million barrels of oil that the administration plans to \nput into the SPR over the next year could be more productively used to \nreplenish private sector inventories. Putting this oil into the SPR \nwill raise our governmental inventories from 650 to 700 million \nbarrels, an increase of about 8 percent; whereas keeping it on the \nmarket could boost our private inventories from 290 million barrels to \n340 million barrels, an increase of about 17 percent. We, therefore, \ncan get more bang for our buck--or, in this instance, bang for our \nbarrel--by keeping this oil on the market.\n  Typically, a variety of interruptions in oil supplies can occur in \nthe commercial marketplace. These disruptions may be caused by bad \nweather, political unrest, or mechanical failure in the actual \nproduction of oil. Although any particular disruption may not be \nforeseeable, based on past history it can be predicted, in general, \nthat some such disruption will occur sooner or later. Because our \nprivate inventories are so low, those inventories will not be available \nto cover any such disruptions.\n  Since the SPR was established over a quarter century ago, we have \nnever needed to release more than 30 million barrels from the SPR at \nany one time. At the outbreak of the first gulf war, in early 1991, we \nreleased 30 million barrels. In the fall of 2000, the last time we \nreleased oil from the SPR, we released around 30 million barrels. Even \nafter we lost all oil production in Iraq last year, this administration \ndid not release any oil from the SPR. It, therefore, appears, for the \ntime being, that holding the SPR at the current level of 650 million \nbarrels, which is 93 percent of capacity, would be sufficient security \nto cover events that are reasonably foreseeable.\n  Because current inventory levels in the private sector may be \ninadequate to cover minor supply disruptions, in the event of such a \ndisruption the price of oil would likely spike to well over $40 per \nbarrel, gasoline prices would jump to well over $2 per gallon, and we \nmight even have to tap into the SPR. The way to avoid this painful \nscenario is to raise private sector inventories by keeping millions of \nbarrels of oil on the market rather than putting them into the SPR. It \ndoes not make sense to increase our ability to respond to the most \nunlikely events at the expense of our ability to respond to the more \ncertain ones.\n  Adding more oil to the SPR will increase our energy security only \nslightly while decreasing our economic security significantly. We \ncannot measure our national security solely by the number of barrels of \noil in the SPR. Our economic well-being is also critical to our \nnational security. In deciding whether or not to put oil into the SPR, \nthe administration should adopt a broader view of what is important to \nour national security.\n  Affordable gasoline for American consumers is important to our \neconomic and national security. Affordable jet fuel and the health of \nour airline industry is important to our economic and national \nsecurity. Affordable diesel fuel and the health of our manufacturing, \ntrucking, chemical, and agricultural industries is important to our \neconomic and national security. When oil, gasoline, jet fuel, and \ndiesel fuel prices are at or near record high levels, we should \nconsider the importance of increasing the supply of oil to these \nindustries as well as to the SPR program.\n  This real-world price change shows that cancellation of the currently \nplanned shipments to the SPR would provide immediate relief in the oil \nand gasoline markets, and also provide long-term relief as the \nadditional oil supplies would enable inventories to be built back to \nnormal levels.\n  It is bad enough that the Department of Energy has refused to suspend \nSPR deposits. To make matters worse, the Department of the Interior has \nnow announced that it too will take even more barrels off the market \nstarting April 1.\n  Currently, the administration plans to remove 5.6 million barrels \nfrom the market and put them in the SPR during the month of April--\nabout 190,000 barrels per day. The latest announcement means that, \nbeginning April 1, the administration will be taking even more \nbarrels--for a total between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day--of \noil off the market.\n  How much oil is 200,000-300,000 barrels per day? A lot. It is as much \noil as we import from many countries, or as much as we get domestically \nfrom major oil-producing states. In December 2003, for example, we \nimported 211,000 barrels per day from Kuwait. In the same month, the \nState of Louisiana produced 244,000 barrels daily. Oklahoma produced \nabout 180,000 barrels a day.\n  Moreover, by taking more oil off the market for the SPR when prices \nare high, the administration is needlessly increasing the cost of the \nSPR program for the taxpayers. In effect, the taxpayers will be paying \nover $35 per barrel for this oil for the SPR. By canceling these \nexpensive deliveries, we could use the money obtained from the sale of \nthis oil for our urgent homeland security needs. Indeed, this is just \nwhat the Levin-Collins amendment would do.\n  The administration sometimes claims that if we suspend SPR deliveries \nto increase supplies, OPEC might reduce production to counter our \nefforts. This is not a very good reason for not doing anything to \nimprove our situation. To begin with, we shouldn't avoid doing \nsomething that makes sense for our national interests because we're \nafraid that OPEC might respond by taking action adverse to those \ninterests. We must determine our own security, and not act in fear of \nOPEC. If they act negatively to us, we should have a response ready. \nSecond, OPEC has not threatened to take any such action. The \nadministration shouldn't project actions that OPEC hasn't even hinted \nat.\n  In fact, an article from last Friday's Oil Daily indicates that the \neffect of the Senate Budget Resolution amendment to postpone SPR \ndeliveries is having a positive effect on OPEC--that in the wake of the \npassage of our amendment some OPEC members ``are doubly keen to \nreassure major consumers that they are happy to meet any shortfall [in \nsupply].''\n  Finally, the same argument could be made against any proposal to \nincrease our domestic oil supplies. If we accepted this argument, there \nwould be no point in us trying to increase supplies in any manner \nwhatsoever. It is always possible that OPEC will counter our measures \nto increase our energy supplies, but we cannot be paralyzed into \ninaction by fear of what OPEC might do.\n  I support filling the SPR, but not at any price. It is time for the \nadministration to consider the effect of filling the SPR on our \neconomic security. It is time for the administration to protect \nAmerican consumers and businesses rather than just the SPR program. It \nis time to count jobs and growth, not only barrels of oil. It's time to \nstop filling the SPR.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Department of the Interior press \nrelease regarding the reservation of oil for the SPR program, a recent \narticle from The Economist on high oil prices, an article from last \nFriday's Oil Daily, and a bipartisan letter to the President from 53 \nHouse members urging the suspension of shipments to the SPR be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, \n                Office of Public Affairs, Mar. 24, 2004]\n\n Strategic Petroleum Reserve Exchange Contracts Awarded; MMS, Wyoming \n                          Team up on RIK Sale\n\n       Three major oil companies have been awarded contracts by \n     the Minerals Management Service (MMS) for the exchange of an \n     estimated 100,405 barrels per day of Gulf of Mexico Royalty-\n     in-kind (RIK) crude oil to support the national Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve Fill Initiative unveiled by President \n     George W. Bush in November 2001.\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\n       With these contracts, MMS will take its oil royalties in-\n     kind (in the form of product), rather than in value (cash), \n     from offshore federal lease operators and deliver it to \n     onshore oil market centers where the Department of Energy \n     (DOE) will take custody of the oil. The DOE, in turn, will \n     exchange the RIK oil for oil of suitable quality that can be \n     delivered to Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage sites \n     located in Texas and Louisiana.\n       The RIK program provides a deliberate and cost-effective \n     means to continue filling the nation's Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve in support of national objectives for energy security \n     and to mitigate potential supply disruptions.\n       Contracts in the latest sale were awarded to ChevronTexaco, \n     Shell Trading and ExxonMobil. Delivery on the six-month \n     contracts is scheduled to begin April 1, 2004. The oil will \n     be delivered from more than 100 facility metering points in \n     the gulf of Mexico.\n       The MMS RIK Program Office will also ship an additional \n     12,135 barrels per day of royalty crude oil directly to DOE \n     at onshore market centers, with one producer transporting an \n     additional 2,700 barrels per day directly to the DOE. That \n     translates to a total of approximately 115,000 barrels per \n     day of wellhead oil being committed to the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve Fill Initiative. To date, approximately 646 \n     million barrels of oil have been added toward the approximate \n     700 million barrel capacity of the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve.\n\n\n                           joint wyoming sale\n\n       The Minerals Management Service also announced that it has \n     again teamed with the State of Wyoming for the sale of \n     royalty crude oil produced in Wyoming. The February sale was \n     the 12th in a series of joint sales dating back to 1998 when \n     the State of Wyoming and the MMS first entered into the \n     Wyoming Oil Pilot Program.\n       Three firms were awarded contracts for approximately 1,300 \n     barrels per day of both Federal and State sweet and general \n     sour production. Winning bidders were Teppco, Nexen and \n     Tesoro Refining. Delivery is scheduled to begin April 1, \n     2004, and continue through Sept. 30, 2004.\n       The Minerals Management Service is the federal bureau in \n     the U.S. Department of the Interior that manages the nation's \n     oil, natural gas and other mineral resources on the Outer \n     Continental Shelf in federal offshore waters. The bureau also \n     collects, accounts for, and disburses mineral revenues from \n     Federal and American Indian lands. MMS disbursed more than $8 \n     billion in 2003 and more than $135 billion since it was \n     created in 1982. Nearly $1 billion from those revenues go \n     into the Land and Water Conservation Fund annually for the \n     acquisition and development of state and federal park and \n     recreation lands.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, Mar. 27, 2004]\n\n                        A Burning Question; Oil\n\n       Why are oil prices so high?\n       Many people have been wondering why oil has become so \n     costly. Its spot price has been close to $40 a barrel; one \n     year forward, it fetches well over $30; and this week petrol \n     prices hit record highs in the United States. Weekly, \n     analysts have been tweaking their forecasts upwards.\n       The answer may come as a surprise. The usual culprit is the \n     Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the cartel \n     that tries to manipulate prices by adjusting agreed output \n     quotas. In February OPEC shocked the markets by announcing \n     that its members were to slash their ``cheating'' on official \n     quotas by 1.5m barrels per day (bpd); the quotas themselves \n     were to be trimmed by another 1m bpd at the beginning of \n     April.\n       However, industry experts say that OPEC countries have \n     hardly cut output at all in recent weeks. So freely are they \n     still cheating that only Saudi Arabia, the kingpin of the \n     cartel, has much spare capacity left. What is more, OPEC \n     ministers might not cut their quotas after all. Some are \n     wavering, and the oil might keep gushing. The ministers are \n     due to meet in Vienna on March 31st.\n       If OPEC is not turning off the spigot, what explains the \n     run-up in prices? One reason is surely demand: the strongly \n     growing economies of America and China are guzzling more oil. \n     If this goes on, OPEC's capacity constraints might bite. \n     However, Algeria's oil minister, Chakib Khelil, thinks \n     speculation is a more likely answer. He wants OPEC to cut \n     output on April 1st for fear that the price might drop \n     suddenly--by at least $7, he thinks.\n       Such talk is common from OPEC ministers. Usually it is \n     self-serving nonsense, intended to deflect criticism of the \n     cartel. This time there may be more to it. One reason to \n     believe it comes from energy traders. The big trading firms \n     typically deal with both ``commercial'' transactions--hedging \n     ploys by firms such as airlines--and ``non-commercial'' ones \n     by financial speculators such as hedge funds. Richard \n     Schaeffer of ABN Amro, a Dutch bank with a big presence on \n     the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), reports that the \n     amount of speculation in oil is ``more than I`ve seen in a \n     very long time.''\n       What is more, despite some sell-offs early this week, there \n     have clearly been some big bets on high oil prices. Non-\n     commercial net long positions in futures markets are at an \n     unprecedented level (see chart). There is, says one trader, a \n     lot of ``paper froth'' supporting oil prices. In its latest \n     oil report, the International Energy Agency said that ``the \n     funds are having a field day''.\n       But why exactly have speculators piled into the oil market \n     now? One reason may be uncertainty or disappointment with \n     returns on financial assets. John Shapiro of Morgan Stanley \n     believes that hedge funds, endowments and other investors \n     have been drawn to the oil market by the lack of \n     alternatives. He points to low interest rates and, until \n     recently, the relatively poor performance of the stockmarket.\n       Another factor attracting punters and propping up oil \n     prices may be what Eric Bolling, an independent trader on the \n     NYMEX, calls ``supply-disruption risk.'' Political troubles \n     in Venezuela, Nigeria and Iraq have long worried those who \n     fear an interruption of exports. A bigger and newer aspect of \n     this risk, however, is the fear of terrorism that might be \n     targeted at oil infrastucture.\n       These worries have, in part, been fuelled by a most \n     unexpected source: the American government. Despite the high \n     prices, American officials continue to buy oil on the open \n     market to fill their country's strategic petroleum reserves \n     (SPRs). Why buy, you might ask, when prices are high, and \n     thereby keep them up? The Senate has asked that question as \n     well. It passed a non-binding resolution this month calling \n     on the Bush administration to stop SPR purchases; but Spencer \n     Abraham, the energy secretary, has refused.\n       The administration's persistence, coupled with increased \n     strategic purchases by other governments, has fuelled \n     suspicions that officials might have some intelligence about \n     terrorist threats to oil infrastructure. The upshot is that \n     concerns about disruptions to supply, by OPEC or by \n     terrorists, now add up to what Mr. Schaeffer calls an \n     ``unprecedented premium'' on the price of oil. He observes \n     that in the past, prices have spiked on worries that supply \n     might be interrupted, but have then fallen back quickly. This \n     time the premium seems to be lingering.\n       Some experts worry that the longer prices stay high because \n     of this speculative frenzy, the harder they will fall. \n     Perhaps all that can be said is that reading the oil market \n     is as difficult today as it has been for a long time: strong \n     demand, political unrest and OPEC discipline could drive the \n     price higher, and encourage still more speculative buying; a \n     slowdown in America or indiscipline in the cartel could \n     remove a lot of froth in a hurry. Even if the price does \n     drop, however, it need not collapse, because thanks to OPEC \n     the oil market is like no other.\n       If speculators head for the door, Saudi Arabia, which has \n     been called the central bank of the oil world, has one card \n     to play that even the Fed does not. Ali Naimi, the Saudi oil \n     minister, can announce that he will slash his country's \n     output at once. Speculators will surely take notice, for he \n     has a proven record of propping up prices. That is the sort \n     of influence over markets that even Alan Greenspan must envy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Oil Daily, Mar. 26, 2004]\n\n               Price Slide May Help Opec Reach Consensus\n\n         (By Karen Matusic, Manimoli Dinesh, and Paul Merolli)\n\n       Washington.--The first signs that oil market bears may be \n     emerging from a long hibernation might be a blessing in \n     disguise for Opec ministers meeting Wednesday in Vienna.\n        After fretting for weeks about their inability to do \n     anything to stem a runaway oil market and disagreeing \n     publicly about whether to implement a lower production \n     ceiling on Apr. 1, Opec ministers may find it a bit easier to \n     reach consensus, ironically because of a sharp decline in \n     prices. Prompt futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange \n     (Nymex) fell from a high of $38.50 per barrel on Mar. 19 to a \n     low of $34.75/bbl on Mar. 26 in reaction to the fifth crude \n     stock build in the US during the past six weeks.\n        The confusion is evident in public statements from Opec \n     ministers--not to mention oil analysts, who have repeatedly \n     raised their price forecasts. Some ministers insist that Opec \n     will cut the production ceiling to 23.5 million barrels per \n     day on Apr. 1 as planned, even though insiders admit the \n     group has yet to make good on earlier promises to mop up \n     excess supply; others say they may consider a delay.\n        ``The price fall will strengthen the hand of those [Opec] \n     members who want to see a [23.5 million b/d] ceiling come \n     into play,'' an Opec delegate tells Oil Daily. ``Before that, \n     there was some pressure from consumers for us to do \n     something, but we really have been doing all we could. Those \n     prices were really too high. Now it seems as they are falling \n     and will soon be at reasonable levels.''\n        Together, the 11 Opec members are now producing about 28 \n     million b/d. That would leave the 10 quota-bound members, who \n     exclude Iraq, having to remove more than 2 million b/d from \n     markets in the next few days to comply with the new ceiling. \n     Come Mar. 31, one possibility might be to announce that the \n     23.5 million b/d ceiling is coming into effect while knowing \n     that no member is likely to adhere to the new limits. Already \n     there are signs that Saudi Arabia is increasing supplies to \n     the US based on higher than usual tanker fixtures for April \n     and early May.\n        ``Confusion means they will do nothing,'' says PFC Energy \n     analyst Roger Diwan. ``Prices are coming down, and it makes \n     it easier for them to reinforce quota discipline. Now it is a \n     matter of how long it takes them to trim down.''\n        Oil traders are hedging their bets ahead of the Vienna \n     talks, mainly because they have\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\n     been caught off-guard twice since September, by surprise \n     announcements that Opec was cutting its production ceiling \n     just minutes after ministers entered their meeting room \n     insisting that a rollover was a done deal.\n        Though some observers question Opec's credibility after \n     failing to implement promised production cuts, the Saudi-led \n     initiative to convince big market speculators that Opec would \n     do all it could to maximize oil prices was successful in that \n     it seems to have thwarted an expected second quarter price \n     plunge. While prices may continue to fall, they will do so \n     from a much higher base.\n       ``Stocks are tight, and it will take time to build,'' PFC's \n     Diwan says. ``It looks like OPEC will bridge the second \n     quarter. I do not think they mind looking as if they lack \n     credibility at $35 [per barrel].''\n       The political heat on OPEC to open the taps has been \n     rising, especially in the U.S. where motorists are paying \n     record-high prices for gasoline, well ahead of peak summer \n     driving season. Slammed by Democrats for record high prices \n     and ``failed'' energy policies, the Bush administration is \n     prodding OPEC to increase production.\n       President Bush, who in the 2000 election campaign mocked \n     the Clinton administration for what Republicans called ``tin-\n     cup diplomacy'' in its dealings with oil producers, now seems \n     happy to admit he is prodding OPEC to increase production. \n     Bush's Chief of Staff Andrew Card said in a television \n     interview on Thursday that the administration wants OPEC to \n     open the taps while Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham \n     confesses he is in regular contact with OPEC, something he \n     had downplayed in the past.\n       ``There's been on going discussions with OPEC, but we \n     prefer to keep them private,'' said a Department of Energy \n     spokeswoman, declining to offer further details,\n       OPEC insiders retort privately that the sizzling prices are \n     not being caused by shortages of OPEC oil--but by tight U.S. \n     gasoline supplies, geopolitical concerns and big overbought \n     positions built up by speculators. Nonetheless, more moderate \n     OPEC members are doubly keen to reassure major consumers that \n     they are happy to meet any shortfall after the Senate voted \n     to divert some 53 million bbl of crude, originally destined \n     for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), to the spot \n     market.\n       That set alarm bells ringing among some OPEC members, aware \n     that the release of emergency reserves is the only real \n     leverage that consumers have over producers. Bill Greehey, \n     the outspoken chairman and chief executive of U.S. refiner \n     Valero, said the U.S. government should use the SPR to \n     counterbalance OPEC, releasing or buying crude to offset \n     OPEC's moves.\n       ``There is no need to release the SPR because there is no \n     shortage of crude--and we will make sure of that,'' an OPEC \n     official tells Oil Daily.\n       The measure requires support from the House of \n     Representatives to become law, and the Bush administration \n     has made it clear that America's emergency stockpile should \n     only be used in emergencies--not to cool off prices. It \n     underlined that point last week when it awarded new contracts \n     to fill the SPR. In a dig at Abraham, Democrats also released \n     congressional records from 2000 revealing that Abraham, then \n     a senator, urged a release of SPR oil to moderate prices.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2004.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge that you suspend \n     shipments of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and \n     allow more oil to remain on the market and available to \n     consumers when supplies are tight. We hear from our \n     constituencies daily about the financial strain of increasing \n     gasoline prices.\n       We are urging you to call upon the Department of Energy \n     (DOE) to review and revert back to its previous policy of \n     filling the SPR when crude oil prices are relatively low and \n     deferring oil deliveries when prices are relatively high. \n     Filling the SPR, without regard to crude oil prices and the \n     availability of supplies, drives oil prices higher and \n     ultimately hurts consumers.\n       In addition, we are concerned about missed opportunities \n     for saving taxpayers' money. Filling the SPR regardless of \n     oil prices increases taxpayer costs. Prior to 2002, DOE \n     granted oil company requests to defer scheduled oil \n     deliveries to the SPR when oil prices were high, in return \n     for deposits of extra oil at a later date. These deferrals \n     save taxpayers money and add extra barrels of oil to the SPR.\n       We urge the DOE to study the development of procedures to \n     assure that the SPR is filled consistent with the objective \n     of minimizing acquisition costs--or revenue foregone when the \n     oil is acquired under the royalty-in-kind (RIK) program--and \n     consistent with maximizing domestic supply. We urge the \n     Administration to reevaluate the practice of diversion of RIK \n     and other oil to the SPR so that it will be opportunely timed \n     so as to not exacerbate crude oil price increases.\n       We recommend you restore market-based criteria for granting \n     deferrals by urging the DOE to restore its SPR business \n     procedures allowing deferrals of oil deliveries to the SPR \n     when crude oil prices are high or commercial crude oil \n     supplies are tight.\n       Again, we urge you to take these recommendations under \n     consideration and to suspend shipments to the SPR until crude \n     oil supplies increase and prices decrease.\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert W.

The administration \nshould listen to common sense and to what the market says, that when \nsupply in the private sector goes down, prices go up, and the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve fills have made a major contribution to high oil and \ngasoline prices in this country. It adds little to our energy or \neconomic security for the administration to pursue the course it is on. \nI hope it will reconsider the SPR deposits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I certainly agree with my colleague, the \nSenator from Michigan, about the need to deal with our present \nsituation which affects my State, as well as everyone else.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that the ultimate solution \nto our oil dependency needs is not going to come from more oil, more \ntax breaks for oil, more searching for oil, or extracting oil from \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. It is going to be in developing viable \nalternatives to oil, one of which is right in front of us, available to \nus now, and is barely being tapped by this Nation. And that is ethanol.\n  I have a Ford Explorer I drive all over Minnesota on a fuel called E-\n85--85-percent ethanol, 15-percent regular gasoline. The engine is \nproduced by the manufacturer with a very slight modification. Last \nsummer in southern Minnesota, E-85 fuel was 22 cents a gallon less than \nregular unleaded. I have not checked in the last couple of weeks, but \ngiven the price of gasoline, I suspect it is even less expensive now.\n  Just imagine if we were to take half or more of the $115 billion that \nwe spend every year to import foreign oil--over half of all the oil we \nconsume--and instead of spending it overseas, we were to put it in the \npockets of American farmers, who then would spend their dollars in \ntheir local communities. Those dollars would multiply, and we would \nfuel an economic resurgence of rural America far greater than any \nGovernment program could possibly devise. It is a cleaner burning fuel, \nso we would improve the quality of our environment. We would reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil. We would raise the price of commodities such \nas corn and soybeans for soy diesel and some of the other agricultural \nproducts, so farmers could make a profit in the marketplace at those \nhigher prices rather than have to be subsidized by the American \ntaxpayer. It is basically a policy grand slam, and yet in this country \nright now less than 2 percent of the gasoline supply consumed is \nethanol.\n\n  In Minnesota, my State, 7 or 8 years ago the legislature passed, with \nmuch controversy, a mandate that required that every gallon of gasoline \nsold in our State contain 10-percent ethanol. Prices have been slightly \nlower than those States nearby which do not have that requirement. The \nfuel supplies have been consistent.\n  As I said earlier, that only touches the surface of what is possible \nfor ethanol as a substitute fuel for gasoline. Yet, Minnesota, despite \nall those gains and no difficulties, is still the only State in the \nNation that has a 10-percent ethanol mandate.\n  We can fill up reserves, and we can try to bring in more. We can \njawbone the Saudis, and we will keep paying\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\nthrough the nose regardless until--and only until--we shift our use of \nfuels from what we are depending on now to what we can use or must use \nfor the future.\n  Here for the first time in my public career--and I was commissioner \nof energy and economic development for Minnesota 20 years ago and \nserved in the Governor's office in Minnesota almost a decade before \nthen and worked on energy policy. In the span of those 30 years, this \nis the first time I have seen a real opportunity that every American \ncan in their vehicle be consuming a fraction of the gasoline they are \nusing now, and we do not have any interest in pursuing it.\n  Senator Daschle and Senator Grassley, through their efforts, have put \nand kept some energy measures in the Energy bill which is now stymied. \nSenator Grassley has done a terrific service to the ethanol-production \nStates wherein the current transportation bill passed by the Senate \ntakes away that penalty for using ethanol that is in the formula for \nthe highway trust fund.\n  Even with those measures, we are looking at barely doubling the \nincrease of ethanol in consumption nationwide, so it would be less than \n4 percent in a decade. Again, Minnesota has been at 10 percent for the \nlast 8 years.\n  When those prices keep going up and staying up, I want my colleagues \nto keep in mind we have an alternative. We have an opportunity to make \na significant and immediate transition. It will take a few years, but \nit is right there. But we have to get beyond where we are today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3288-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3288-S3289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I also wish to comment on what happened \nlast week to the so-called JOBS Act which disappeared from the Senate \nfloor. One minute last week we were voting on the JOBS bill, and the \nnext minute it was gone--outsourced, I guess. It was replaced by other \nlegislation which we acted upon last week. Today we are on to yet \nanother measure before the Senate.\n  We have not been told when this JOBS Act might reappear or even if it \nis coming back at all, which means, I guess, the JOBS Act has suffered \nthe same fate as some 2.25 million jobs during President Bush's term \nbecause they, too, have disappeared. No one knows when or even if they \nare coming back.\n  It is clear now that the President's previous proposals enacted by \nCongress--tax cuts for the rich and the super rich and for large, \nmultilarge corporations--have not stopped the loss of American jobs, \nand they have not brought them back. One out of every six manufacturing \njobs in the United States has disappeared in the last 3 years, and the \nnumber of manufacturing jobs in this country is now the lowest it has \nbeen in 53 years. Over 8 million Americans are unemployed. The average \nlength of unemployment is the longest it has been in 20 years in this \ncountry.\n  So the administration must have a plan, a policy, to stimulate job \ncreation in this urgent situation; right? Wrong. The Secretary of the \nTreasury Snow testified before Congress just 2 weeks ago that the lack \nof job recovery is ``a mystery'' to him. The President has stated that \nhis No. 1 priority is to make his tax changes permanent when they \nexpire in the year 2011.\n  In the debate over the budget resolution on the Senate floor 2 weeks \nago, our colleagues across the aisle said their No. 1 priority was to \naccelerate the date for eliminating the estate tax from 2010 to 2009. \nSo the No. 1 economic problem facing the Nation today is the loss of \njobs and the lack of their recovery, and Republican priorities are more \ntax treats for the rich and the super rich in the years 2009 and 2010. \nI guess the rich and the super rich do not really need more money \nanyway, so they can afford to wait 5 years or more to get it. But the 8 \nmillion Americans out of work cannot wait that long.\n  So there is this cloud of complete unreality surrounding Republican \neconomic policies these days. It is as though all the country is on \nreality TV and they are still on Fantasy Island. Meanwhile, our \nDemocratic caucus is being blocked from even voting on measures that \nwould provide help and jobs to Americans who need them right now.\n  No. 1, we need to extend unemployment benefits because 786,000 \nAmericans exhausted their unemployment benefits during January and \nFebruary alone. In just those 2 months, over three-quarters of a \nmillion Americans exhausted their unemployment benefits, meaning they \nand their families have no source of income right now.\n  In the name of humanity, how can we do nothing to relieve that kind \nof human pain and suffering?\n  Secondly, the House of Representatives must pass the transportation \nfunding bill, and the President must either sign it or veto it so that \nwe can override that veto now. The Senate bill we passed almost a month \nago would mean significantly more construction projects, and therefore \nthousands more jobs all over America, starting now, in this \nconstruction season, which does not last very long in northern States \nsuch as Minnesota, are just about to get underway.\n  The President and the House have been tossing that bill back and \nforth like it is a Sunday Frisbee game. Here is an immediate job-\ncreating opportunity, and they are dawdling and dickering because I \nguess it is not their jobs, at least not yet.\n  The third measure we must undertake is to protect the jobs and \nincomes of those who are now working, especially the 8 million workers \nthe Secretary of Labor has decided all by herself no longer have to be \npaid overtime. That number includes police officers, nurses, \nfirefighters, and laborers. What do we tell them and their families? \nSorry, you did not contribute enough to the necessary reelection \ncommittees, but the people who employ you do?\n  The Congress has already cut their personal taxes, their dividends \ntax, their capital gains tax, and now they are going to be eliminating \ntheir estate tax even earlier than before.\n  They are a greedy bunch and they want more. This is an election year \nand campaigns are expensive so, sorry, now in America you will not even \nbe able to earn extra money by working harder. You cannot get ahead \nbecause those special friends want to get farther ahead without having \nto work at all.\n  Fourth, we need to bring back the JOBS Act, which reportedly was \npulled from the Senate floor last week because it would have involved a \nvote of the Senate on this very protection of overtime measure. The \ntruth is, as that evidences, the sponsors of the so-called JOBS Act do \nnot want votes on that and other amendments because, in fact, the \nsecret is that bill is not about jobs at all.\n  Only in Washington would something named the JOBS Act have nothing to \ndo with creating jobs, and I mean absolutely nothing. The people who \nwrote that bill only want the American people to think this is a JOBS \nAct. They want the 8 million Americans who do not have jobs right now \nto think this is a JOBS Act so they will think: Oh, what a Congress. \nOur country needs jobs, so Congress passes a JOBS Act.\n  Well, as Abraham Lincoln said, you can fool all of the people some of \nthe time, and what better time to try than right around election time.\n\n  The truth is, this bill is a tax cut for already profitable \nbusinesses, and the largest tax reductions take place, once again, in \nthose years 2009 to 2012. So, obviously, it has nothing to do with \nproviding jobs now.\n  That is the bill's best part. Other parts increase the tax avoidance \nschemes for foreign business operations. There are $36 billion in tax \nbreaks for profits made producing goods and providing services in other \ncountries, employing foreigners not Americans. Now that sure makes \nsense. We are losing American jobs in record numbers to foreign \noperations so the Senate is going to give more tax advantages to those \nforeign operations so they can take away more American jobs? Is the \nJOBS Act intended to add American jobs or eliminate them?\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at some of the foreign business \nfavors in this bill before we vote on them. It increases the kind of \ncommodities hedging that is exempt from U.S. taxation. It eliminates \nrules that are meant to restrict the deferral of foreign income by \nforeign investment companies and foreign personal holding companies \nfrom U.S. taxation. It eliminates withholding taxes on dividends paid \nby certain foreign corporations.\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\nThere are many more of those foreign favors in the bill. As I said, $36 \nbillion worth of tax avoidance or tax elimination schemes which benefit \nwealthy Americans who invest in them, or American companies who own and \noperate them, which reward foreign business production and sales, not \nAmerican production; increase jobs outside of our country and decrease \njobs or job opportunities for American workers.\n  The JOBS Act, as it is presently written, is a fraud. It is not an \nAmerican JOBS Act. It is not even an American business act. It is a \nspecial-favors-for-special-friends act.\n  In the 3 years I have been in the Senate, Congress has tried fooling \nthe American people with some mighty foolish legislation, such as No \nChild Left Behind, pretending to improve the quality of education for \nall schoolchildren. Additional testing was to be accompanied by \nadditional Federal funding, especially for those students most in need. \nWell, Minnesotans will not be fooled anymore, not now that we have \nlearned just this last few weeks that title I funds in Minnesota will \nbe cut by as much as 40 percent in school districts that have an \nincreased number of eligible students.\n  The prescription drug bill that was passed last year pretended to \noffer comprehensive coverage and substantial financial assistance to \nseniors and others on Medicare. That prescription drug bill will not \nfool the seniors, not in Minnesota for sure, and I do not think in \nAmerica, when in a few more months the prescription drug discount cards \ncome out and when the shamefully inadequate coverage finally begins in \nJanuary of 2006. But do not try to fool unemployed Americans that the \nJOBS Act is a jobs creation bill, and do not try to fool working \nAmericans that it is a jobs protection bill. As President Lincoln said: \nYou cannot fool all the people all the time.\n  Congress is badly out of touch with the American people. So let's \nreturn to reality. Let's return to the reality that Americans need more \njobs. Let's pass a JOBS Act that really is a JOBS Act, where every \nprovision is designed to reward American companies for adding American \njobs now--not in the year 2009, not in 2012, but now.\n\n  I strongly urge the majority leader to bring back the JOBS Act for \nSenate action now. I urge my colleagues to remove every section that \ndoes not add jobs in America right now and replace them with ones that \ndo. We need jobs in America for Americans now. Let us stop trying to \nfool people and let us help put them back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I could not help but think, as \nmy colleague from Minnesota was delivering a wonderful and inspiring \nset of remarks, that is it not interesting, I would say to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, that the old labels of liberal and conservative do not \nmean anything anymore. The American people are catching on because what \nthey want is performance. They do not want people just pegged into \nthese neat little categories, these labels, because as the Senator has \nso eloquently stated, the old labels do not perform because it is not \nbusiness as usual. Whether it be the White House or the Congress or the \nState legislatures or the Governors, those labels do not mean \nanything. In fact, those labels are being turned absolutely upside down \nin this particular year, for we find ourselves voting on things that \nsome critics would want to claim are liberal, but is it liberal to want \nto lower the annual deficit so the national debt does not increase by \nhalf a trillion dollars a year? To the contrary, that is conservative \nfiscal policy.\n\n  As the Senator has said so eloquently, is it liberal or conservative \nto want to provide jobs for Americans? It is neither. It is good, \ncommon sense--performance for our people.\n  Is it liberal or conservative to want to stop the flight of jobs to \nother countries, that overworked word of ``outsourcing''? I say to the \nSenator from Minnesota, there is going to be another twist on the \nquestion of outsourcing when they start outsourcing the jobs to the \npoint at which they are handling personally identifiable medical and \npersonally identifiable financial information of which our laws in this \ncountry protect its privacy, but in India or in China there are no laws \nthat protect that privacy. When our people suddenly find that their \nvery sensitive personal medical records are suddenly made available on \nthe worldwide Web because there is no protection of privacy because \nthose jobs have been outsourced to India or to China, they are going to \nhave another think coming, as we would say in the South.\n  So the old labels don't mean anything anymore. Is it liberal to \nsupport the environment? I would say that is conservative. I would say \nwhen you become a good steward of what the good Lord has endowed us \nwith, which is this beautiful planet suspended in the middle of nothing \nwith a thin little film enveloping the planet called an atmosphere, and \nwhen you despoil that air, when you despoil the water, and when you \nrape the land, it is conservative to want to protect that environment, \nbut that is not the label, liberal or conservative.\n  I am glad the Senator has given his speech about jobs. I am going to \ncontinue to give my speeches about what it is not to be liberal or \nconservative, not to be partisan, but to try to perform for the \nAmerican people and perform for the States we are privileged to \nrepresent.\n  Mr. DAYTON. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for his \nencouraging words. I also point out he is, I believe, the only Senator, \nmaybe the only Member of Congress, who has been an astronaut. The \nSenator's perspective on those resources and the need to conserve is \ncertainly unsurpassed. I thank the Senator for his remarks.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is very kind. I must admit I \nbecame more of an environmentalist when I went into space because I got \nto see the entire ecosystem at once. I got to see how beautiful it is, \nyet how fragile it is. From that perspective, when I looked at the rim \nof the Earth and saw that thin little film which is the atmosphere, I \ncame home from that space flight absolutely committed that I wanted to \ndo my part to be a better steward of what the good Lord has given us. \nHe has given us this beautiful planet in the middle of nothing. Space \nis nothing. Space is an airless vacuum that goes on and on for billions \nand billions of light-years, and there in the midst of it is our home, \nour planet.\n  One of the reasons I want to go to Mars--of course I myself won't \nhave that opportunity. That ought to be over the course of the next 30 \nyears. I would like to think that at my age, at that time, I would \nstill be physically fit to go to Mars, but that is for the next \ngeneration. But one of the reasons I am so intrigued about going to \nMars is what the two Rovers up there right now have been discovering in \nthe last few days, that in fact there was water there. If there were \nwater, then there was likely life. If there were life, how developed \nwas it? And if it were developed, was it civilized? And if it were \ncivilized, what happened? What can we learn from what happened there so \nthat we can become better stewards of our planet?\n\n  Is that liberal or conservative? It is neither. It is good common \nsense. In fact, it is. It is conservative, coming from the word \n``conserve,'' the environment. Yet all these groups that come out here \nand rate you on how you vote and say because you are voting for clean \nwater and clean air, that is somehow a liberal vote?\n  That is my point. The old labels don't mean anything anymore. I think \nthat is beginning to penetrate in the American public. What they want \nis performance by their elected officials, all the way from the White \nHouse to the courthouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3289-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3289-S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came here to talk about the \nfuture of Iraq. I am just going to make a few comments because we are \nin Iraq. We better be successful there. The stability of that country, \npolitically and economically, is extremely important to the interests \nof the United States. If it is destabilized, or if we cut and run, a \nvacuum is going to be created. That vacuum is going to be filled. It is \ngoing to be filled by terrorists, somewhat akin to what happened after \nthe Soviets got whipped in 1989 in Afghanistan. They left and we left \nalso. We were in there clandestinely. Of course, that\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\ncreated a vacuum and that vacuum was eventually filled by the Taliban. \nAnd then, of course, the Taliban provided protection for al-Qaida, the \nbeginning of that network. We see the result, the painful, painful \nresult, not only with the beginning of the 1993 attempted destruction \nof the World Trade Center but the completion of that plan to destroy it \nin 2001 and then the many other bombings that have occurred around the \nworld.\n  So we better be successful. We have young men and women--we have old \nmen and women over there, too--doing a fantastic job for us. Not just \nservice men and women wearing the uniform of this country; these are \nmen and women who are not wearing the uniform of this country but are \nin equally as important positions such as the CIA, the State \nDepartment, AID, all of the American companies that are over there in \nthe reconstruction effort--the nongovernment groups that are over there \ntrying to help out the Iraqi people.\n  As we approach this 1-year anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein, \nit is appropriate to consider what lies ahead for the Iraqi people and \nwhat lies ahead for the American people who made some progress now in \nthe reconstruction of Iraq. There is now an Iraqi transitional \nadministrative law which outlines the basic principles upon which a \nfree and Democratic Iraq will be governed. But trying to get democracy \nacross to a community, to a society that has lived under repression for \nso long--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent I have an additional 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The responsiveness we have had thus far, I \nmust say, is nothing short of remarkable. But there are still many \nconcerns that I have about the reconstruction of that country.\n  The first is that we have an administrative law that hands control \nover to the Iraqis, but it hasn't been spelled out. It seems as though \nthe decisions and the actions in Iraq are being driven by an artificial \ndeadline--June 30.\n  Why June 30? Are we ready to hand over to these institutions that \nhave no experience in democracy in another 3 months? I don't think so. \nAn expeditious transfer of power to Iraqis certainly may be desirable, \nbut we shouldn't put the cart before the horse and give sovereignty to \na governing body that may be less than fully able to handle the \npolitical, military, economic, religious, and ethnic strife that may \narise from such a premature handover. That would put American lives \nfurther at risk and would jeopardize the entirety of our reconstruction \nefforts today.\n  I am also concerned about the nature of the United States presence in \nIraq after the turnover. Will a government, a new Iraqi government \nwithin this short period of time 3 months from now, have sufficient \nlegitimacy among the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurds--all of them--to maintain \nthe presence of our troops who are so desperately needed to maintain \nthe security and stability of that country?\n  The disagreements over the presence of the troops, not even to think \nof the disagreements over the number of our troops and other political \nissues involving a successor government which could give rise to civil, \nreligious and/or ethnic strife--guess who would be right in the middle. \nIt would be our U.S. troops.\n  The transitional administrative law does not include an agreement for \nthe stationing of U.S. forces. That gives rise to the prospect of U.S. \nforces fighting well-armed militia groups in addition to the security \nthreats they face every day. What are they facing every day? Improvised \ndevices that are designed to lure our troops to them and then kill or \nmaim our U.S. service men and women.\n  In addition, the Coalition Provisional Authority now has been working \nhard to stand up an indigenous Iraq security and defense force.\n  I went to one of those police training academies outside of Amman, \nJordan. It was impressive. But within an 8- or 16-week course, they \nwere only going to be able to train about 1,500 policemen.\n  I am concerned about whether this force is going to be adequately \nstaffed, resourced, and ready for the tremendous task of law and order \nin Iraq after the turnover on June 30.\n  Moreover, if these indigenous security efforts fall short and \nsignificant disagreements lead to an unraveling of a unified and \nsovereign Iraq, guess who is going to be on the ground as Iraq \ndissolves into many religious and ethnic community conflicts. You got \nit. The United States service men and women are going to be in the \nmiddle of it.\n  The political dissolution of Iraq is something the United States must \ntake every precaution to avoid. That is another reason not to let the \nartificial deadlines drive the Iraqi reconstruction.\n  I am concerned also about the role of religion in the future of Iraq. \nThe transitional administrative law stipulates Islam will be considered \na source of legislation. I don't have any problem with Islam. That is \ntheir faith. But it seems this provision has satisfied neither those \nwho wish for a secular government nor those who wish for an Islamic \nstate.\n  The United States must more clearly and urgently demand freedom for \nall religions and protect against the persecution of any particular \nreligion. We cannot allow religious extremism to permeate Iraqi society \nin spirit and practice, deed, or law.\n  I am concerned about the economy of Iraq.\n  Think about it. We appropriated $18 billion for the reconstruction \neffort that is starting to enter Iraqi society. For the next 6 to 8 \nmonths, $18 billion will be infused to building roads and bridges and \nrestoring wetlands, water systems, and electrical systems. This is \ngoing to be a country flush with U.S. dollars.\n  My worry is the Iraqi economy is going to become heavily dependent on \nU.S. dollars. This puts an enormous burden on the U.S. taxpayer. What \nhappens after this appropriation dries up?\n  I urge the administration not only to call on the international \ncommunity, as we did during the Afghan war and following the fall of \nthe Taliban in Afghanistan, but that we call on other countries and \nmake them follow through on their pledges for financial assistance.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the distinctly American nature of \nreconstruction efforts. The President promised Congress he would work \nclosely to build international support for our efforts to disarm Saddam \nHussein. While we are grateful for the few nations providing personnel, \nOperation Iraqi Freedom is predominantly an American program. Some may \nargue that it may not matter whether other nations participate or how \nother nations view our efforts in Iraq and the global war on terrorism. \nBut this Senator, and I think a lot of Senators, would beg to differ. \nThis is an important part. This is a very important part of keeping \nmore allies involved. It would so much improve our chances of obtaining \ncritical assistance from other Arab countries, especially the Arab \ncountries in that region, as well as other nations of the world that \nnow are reluctant to participate.\n  I wanted to get these thoughts off my chest about this looming \ndeadline of June 30. I wanted to, as we say in some corners, look over \nthe horizon at what may be coming and how America needs to prepare for \nwhat may be coming in that strife-torn country of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3290-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3290-S3291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF JACK DANIEL'S\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, the Haitian people find themselves \nembroiled in yet another political crisis. Following Jean Bertrand \nAristide's departure on February 29, 2004, the Haitian people once \nagain are forced to pick up the pieces of their broken political \nsystem. Again, they must renew their search for democracy, a search \nthat has lasted for two hundred years with little progress. Thirty \ncoups after Haiti established its independence in 1804, Haitians \ncontinue to live in severe poverty, battling HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, \npoor sanitation, and a political culture of thuggery and violence.\n  The United States has played an important role in Haiti's history. \nFrom U.S. military intervention in 1915 and the 19-year occupation that \nfollowed to the restoration of President Aristide in 1994 by U.S. \nforces, politics in Haiti have been deeply influenced by its larger and \nmore powerful neighbor. Now, the United States has an obligation to \nassist in rebuilding Haiti in collaboration with our international \npartners. However, our assistance must be shaped and implemented with \nan eye to our previous mistakes. For too long, our approach has been \nad-hoc and short-term, and the Haitian people have suffered. It is no \nwonder that some are suspicious of democracy and the role of the United \nStates today.\n  This is not to say that the United States must take most of the blame \nfor the political turmoil in Haiti. Haiti's leaders, and especially \nPresident Aristide, must also acknowledge their responsibility in \nHaiti's current political crisis. However, our flawed nation-building \nattempt in the 1990s, allegations of international support for Haiti's \nrebels, and the departure of President Aristide suggest a need for \nintrospection by U.S. policymakers, humanitarian and development \norganizations and others.\n  Policymakers knew that Haiti's democracy was in trouble for years. \nWhy did the administration fail to take meaningful action until Haiti \nwas on the verge of collapse? As the rebels gained control of Haitian \nterritory from early to mid-February, the U.S. administration largely \nchanneled its diplomatic efforts through the Organization of American \nStates and the Caribbean Community, CARICOM. On February 21st, the \nUnited States backed a CARICOM proposal, which called for a power-\nsharing compromise between Aristide and the opposition. However, as \nsoon as Haiti's political opposition rejected the proposal, rather than \ndefending Haiti's democratic process and institutions, the \nadministration quickly backed down. With rebel forces moving toward the \ncapital of Port-au-Prince on February 28, 2004, the administration \nincreased pressure on Aristide to resign, stating that ``His failure to \nadhere to democratic principles has contributed to the deep \npolarization and violent unrest that we are witnessing in Haiti \ntoday.'' Aristide resigned the next day and flew into exile on a U.S. \naircraft.\n  President Aristide was no paragon of democratic virtue. He encouraged \nhis supporters in their violent campaign against the opposition, and \nhis regime was a corrupt one. But a world in which legitimately elected \nofficials, found wanting, can be run out of office by gangs of armed \nthugs is a world in which the thugs, in fact, are in charge. The people \nof Haiti, like people all over the world, deserve better. U.S. \ncomplicity in President Aristide's ouster sent the wrong message to \nviolent rebel leaders, who have committed their own atrocities in \nHaiti's past. A transition guided by the rule of law, rather than the \nthreat of violence, would surely have been preferable.\n  In the past weeks, a number of my constituents have raised important \nquestions. What ties exist between rebel leaders and the government of \nthe United States? Did the U.S. government impede efforts by the \ninternational community, particularly the Caribbean Community, CARICOM, \nto prevent President Aristide's resignation? I believe that the \nAmerican and Haitian people deserve the answers, and a full accounting \nof the events surrounding Aristide's departure.\n  Equally important, we must help Haiti move forward and break out of \nthis pattern of instability and underdevelopment. We should continue to \nassist in establishing security and disarming all parties to the \nconflict, and I commend the American troops who answered the call to \nservice and are now on the ground in Haiti. However, I believe that the \nadministration's decision to commit troops will require a full vetting \nby Congress. As long as American troops are in harm's way in Haiti, the \nCongress has a direct role and responsibility to either ratify or \nrepudiate the use of U.S. military troops.\n  We must also ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance to \ncommunities in need. Haitian Supreme Court Chief Justice Boniface \nAlexandre should have the full support of the United States in working \nto make Haiti's constitution the guide for the transition and \nsuccession process from this point on. And in the longer term, the \nUnited States should work with the rest of the international community \nto help bolster the institutions that are essential to consolidating \nHaiti's democracy and stability, and assist the Haitian people in \nholding people accountable for their flagrant violations of human \nrights.\n  The United States cannot ignore Haiti. Not only do we have a moral \nobligation to help the Haitian people, who are starving in our own \nbackyard, but there are other national security interests at stake for \nthe United States. A country in crisis so close to our borders creates \na political vacuum in the region, where international crime and \nterrorism can flourish. As we saw in Afghanistan, a country in chaos \nallows for the emergence of dangerous forces, that directly threaten \nour security. In addition, the refugee flow created by instability and \noppression will wash up on our shores, causing hardship for the Haitian \npeople and overwhelming U.S. communities.\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n  I urge Congress to look closely at recent events in Haiti, to ensure \nthat lingering questions are answered forthrightly, and to lend the \nsupport that Haiti desperately needs as it moves forward in \nestablishing peace and security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3292-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On March 1, 2004 Christopher James Barnhart and John Matthew Aravanis \nleft a Morgantown, WV, bar around 3:30 a.m. when they heard, ``Get out \nof the way, faggots.'' A fist subsequently landed on Barnhart's head \nand he was knocked to the ground. Barnhart, who sustained two facial \nfractures in the scuffle, said the men also struck Aravanis in the head \nas he came to Barnhart's aid. The men left the scene, but returned and \nkicked and punched them and continued to call them ``faggots.'' City \npolice have obtained arrest warrants for the three men charged with \nbeating Barnhart, Aravanis, and their friend who was with them during \nthe incident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3292-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE ARMY FISHER HOUSES\n\n   Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher \nestablished the Fisher House Foundation, Inc., a unique public-private \npartnership that supports America's military in their time of need. The \nprogram recognizes the special sacrifices of our men and women in \nuniform and the hardships of military service by meeting a humanitarian \nneed beyond that provided by the Department of Defense. The Fisher \nHouses enable family members to be close to loved ones at the most \nstressful time--during hospitalization for an unexpected illness, \ndisease, or injury.\n  The homes are built by the Fisher House Foundation, Inc., and given \nto the military services and the Veterans Administration. The Army is \nthe recipient of 14 of the 32 Fisher Houses located at every major \nmilitary medical center and at several VA medical centers. The homes \nare located within walking distance of the medical facility.\n   I recently had the pleasure of visiting with Fisher family members, \nfriends, and staff of the Fisher House on board the USS Missouri to \ncelebrate the opening of the second Fisher House at Tripler Army \nMedical Center, the largest military medical treatment facility in the \nPacific located in Honolulu, HI. The first Tripler Fisher House opened \nin June 1994. Due to its location, families stay an average of 55 days, \ncompared to an average of 15 days in other locations. Tripler Fisher \nHouses service families and patients not only from Hawaii but also the \nPacific area of Korea, Guam, Japan, and Okinawa.\n   The Fisher Houses provide temporary lodging in a warm, \ncompassionate, and caring home away from home environment to members of \nour armed services, veterans, and their families during a medical \ncrisis. They enable families to stay together, cook meals, do laundry, \nrelax, unwind, and provide emotional support to each other during a \ntime of need, and to escape from the tensions of the hospital \nenvironment.\n   Today, when we ask so much of our military in support of freedom, it \nis important to recognize the generosity of foundations such as The \nFisher House, that give back to those who have given so much in \ndefending this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3292-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DANIELLE MILLER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of my \nfellow Hoosier, State Senator Charles ``Bud'' Meeks, who passed away on \nMarch 22. Senator Meeks dedicated his life to serving his country and \nour home State of Indiana, setting an example of personal conviction \nand political vigor throughout his 6 years as State senator.\n   Bud Meeks grew up in Fort Wayne, IN. He graduated from Central High \nSchool in 1954 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. After serving 4 years in \nthe Navy, Senator Meeks returned home to Fort Wayne where he began his \ncareer in public service as a deputy at the Allen County jail. Meeks \nretired from the Sheriff's Department after 28 years of dedicated \nservice, including two terms as Allen County Sheriff. He then moved to \nWashington, DC, where he was the executive director of the National \nSheriff's Association for 8 years. Upon his final return to Indiana, \nMeeks ran a successful campaign, demonstrating a work ethic on the \ncampaign trail that is remembered by Hoosiers still today. In 1998, \nSenator Meeks was elected to the Indiana State Senate to represent \nIndiana's 14th Senate District.\n   While serving as Senator, Meeks most recently played a crucial role \nin championing the current proposal to consolidate Allen County \ngovernment. But among his colleagues, Meeks was known above all else \nfor his love of children. While in the Senate, Meeks would frequently \ndevote a significant amount of time to young students, answering \nquestions and discussing government. His focus on Indiana's youth is a \ntestament to Meeks' kindness of heart and clear understanding of the \nimportance of prioritizing the children who will one day be running our \ngreat Nation.\n   In everything he did, Senator Meeks brought with him an inspiring \nenergy and passion, setting a positive example for his friends, \ncolleagues, and constituents to follow. He was always ready to work \ndiligently for the causes he cared for so deeply, and it was his \nsteadfast belief in community involvement that earned him the \nunwavering admiration of Hoosiers across Indiana.\n   Meeks was a committed father and public servant. The sense of loss \nto all those who knew Senator Meeks is tremendous. He is survived by \nhis wife, Marjorie; son, Brian, brothers Bob and Fred; and three \ngrandchildren. He was preceded in death by his daughter, Brenda Sue and \nanother son, David.\n   It is my honor to enter the name of Senator Charles ``Bud'' Meeks \ninto the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/29/senate-section/article/S3292-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3292-S3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WHITTON MONTGOMERY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A bill to amend the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance \nAct to provide for emergency food and shelter; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Department of Homeland Security's Emergency Food and \nShelter Program. This vital program enables communities nationwide to \nprovide services to help individuals who are at risk of becoming \nhomeless or going hungry due to an emergency or economic disaster. As a \n1999 General Accounting Office report concluded, ``in most areas of the \nUnited States, the Emergency Food and Shelter Program is the only \nsource of funding for the prevention of homelessness.''\n  I am pleased to have the support of Senator Lieberman, the ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees this \nimportant program as well as the Department of Homeland Security \ngenerally. I commend Senator Lieberman for his work on this important \nissue, including his efforts in the 107th Congress to pass legislation \nvery similar to the bill that we are introducing together today.\n  Since its creation 21 years ago, the Emergency Food and Shelter \nProgram has provided a helping hand to local social service \norganizations that assist thousands of people in need of food and \nshelter. This program is effective because of the way it is structured. \nA national board, chaired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \ngoverns the program. The board itself is composed of representatives \nfrom organizations who work every day to look out for those who are \nless fortunate--representatives of the American Red Cross, Catholic \nCharities, United Jewish Communities, the National Council of the \nChurches, the Salvation Army, and the United Way.\n  This program is a model for an effective public-private partnership. \nThe volunteer participation by these charitable organizations has kept \nadministrative costs to less than 3 percent of the total program, \nmaking even more funds directly available for communities.\n  Funds are distributed by the national board to local boards according \nto a formula that takes into account unemployment and poverty \nstatistics in each community. Once local boards in counties and \nmunicipalities across America receive the funding, they decide how to \nbest address the needs of their residents. These local boards are key \nto this process. That is because they are composed of individuals and \norganizations who live and work in the communities they serve. \nTherefore, they can best decide how to meet the needs of those who are \nat risk of becoming homeless.\n  In recent years, communities in Maine have put the funding to good \nuse. Communities in Cumberland and Franklin Counties, for example, have \nused most of these funds to supplement the efforts of local soup \nkitchens, Meals-on Wheels programs, and food pantries. The Wayside Soup \nKitchen in Portland, ME, uses this funding to enhance their efforts to \nprovide three separate food assistance programs to those in need.\n  Demonstrating the flexibility of this program, communities in \nnorthern Maine's Aroostook County used more than 30 percent of their \n2003 funding to address emergency shelter and housing needs. This \ndiversity in how communities spent these funds highlights the \nimportance of letting local organizations decide how best to spend \nthese resources, tailored to local needs.\n\n  The Emergency Food and Shelter Program helps individuals maintain \ntheir dignity during difficult times. It also prevents dependency by \nproviding emergency services to individuals and families on a limited \nbasis so they can remain self-sufficient.\n  Although Congress has continued to provide funding, the program's \nauthorization expired in 1994. My bill, the Emergency Food and Shelter \nAct of 2004, seeks to again authorize this program and provide modest \nincreases to reflect an increasing need.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation to \nhelp families across America who are at risk of losing their homes or \ngoing hungry because of circumstances beyond their control.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Collins, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Edwards, Mr. McCain, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Sununu, and Mr. Enzi):\n   S. 2252. A bill to increase the number of aliens who may receive \ncertain non-immigrant status during fiscal year 2004 and to require \nsubmissions of information by the Secretary of Homeland Security; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n   Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join my colleagues in introducing \nthe Save Summer Act of 2004 to provide an immediate stop-gap solution \nto the H-2B visa cap problem in our immigration laws. Our colleagues, \nRepresentatives Delahunt and Young, are introducing an identical bill \nin the House.\n  The H-2B program was established by Congress in 1990 to deal with \nlabor shortages in non-agricultural seasonal employment. H-2B workers \nare employed by hotels, restaurants, resorts, the fishing and timber \nindustries, amusement parks, and other sectors.\n   U.S. employers seeking to bring in foreign nationals on these visas \nmust demonstrate that they have been unable to find enough U.S. workers \nto fill\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nthe jobs. Before visa applications are approved by the Department of \nLabor, the U.S. employers must certify that the temporary workers will \nnot displace U.S. workers or adversely affect their wages or working \nconditions.\n   The annual statutory cap for H-2B visas is 66,000. Two weeks ago, \nthe Department of Homeland Security suddenly announced that the cap for \nthe current fiscal year had been reached and began rejecting new \napplications for the visas. The abrupt announcement left many summer \nemployers stranded. This is the first time the Government has announced \nthat the cap has been reached, and the Department of Homeland Security \ngave no one advance warning.\n\n  The H-2B program is vital for seasonal industries that need temporary \nworkers. The lack of H-2B workers may well be devastating to these \nemployers, many of which are small, family-run businesses. Without \nprompt passage of this bill, many summer employers in Massachusetts and \naround the country will have no choice but to shut their doors.\n  The Save the Summer Act offers a straightforward solution to this \npressing problem. It will increase the H-2B visa cap by 40,000 for the \ncurrent fiscal year. It requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nprovide quarterly reports to Congress on the number of H-2B visas \nissued, and an annual report with a detailed analysis of the program.\n  Our immigration system is broken and many other reforms are obviously \nneeded. Above all, it is essential to have immigration policies that \nreflect current economic realities, respect family unity and \nfundamental fairness, and uphold our proud tradition as a Nation of \nimmigrants.\n  Enacting these other reforms will take time--time we don't have if we \nwant to save the summer for countless seasonal employers around the \ncountry. This legislation will provide immediate and much-needed relief \nto employers counting on H-2B workers to keep their doors open this \nsummer, and I urge my colleagues to pass it as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Dayton):\n  S. 2253. A bill to permit young adults to perform projects to prevent \nfire and suppress fires, and provide disaster relief, on public land \nthrough a Healthy Forest Youth Conservation Corps; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenators Domenici, Boxer, and Dayton to allow youth service and \nconservation corps to partner with public land management agencies to \nrestore and protect public lands threatened by severe fire. I have \ndubbed this public-private partnership the Healthy Forests Youth \nConservation Corps.\n  Last year, I authored a similar provision that was included in the \nSenate version of the Healthy Forest legislation. Unfortunately, this \nprovision was stripped out of the bill before it was signed into law.\n  First, this bill aims to help Federal, State, and local governments \nimplement priority projects using the cost-saving resources of youth \ncorps.\n  It is estimated that youth corps generate $1.60 in immediate benefits \nfor every dollar in costs. This figure is important given the great \nneed and cost associated with fighting fires.\n  Every year, land management agencies are charged with conserving, \nprotecting, and maintaining millions of acres of public land. This is a \ndaunting task that requires an incredible amount of human and material \nresources.\n  For instance, the Federal Government, alone, is responsible for \noverseeing 689 million acres of this land. Last year, five Federal \nagencies reported spending $1.6 billion in 2002 on fire fighting \nsuppression efforts--a whopping $300 million more than the previous \nrecord. To fight those fires, 28,000 fire and support personnel were \nactivated--the maximum civilian resources available in the Forest \nService on top of the 600 Army troops, and 950 foreign firefighters who \njoined in the effort.\n  As an example of what can happen in one State, consider last year's \ncatastrophic wildfires in southern California. Before they were \ncontained, the deadly fires of last fall scorched a total of 738,158 \nacres, killed 23 people, and destroyed approximately 3,626 homes and \nthousands of other structures--amounting to the most costly and \ndevastating fire ever to hit California. The insurance payouts alone \nwill cost more than $3 billion, with public expenditures to fight the \nfires and recover from them running into the hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  And those statistics make no mention of the resources expended to \nfight fires in other States.\n  I want to prevent this type of catastrophe in the future. That is why \nI was an ardent supporter of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act that \nwas signed into law last year.\n  I also believe that we must use every resource at our disposal to \nmeet this challenge. In my opinion, youth service and conversation \ncorps can play a significant role in reducing the physical and \nfinancial strain that public land management agencies bear and help \nprotect our Nation's public lands from wildfires.\n  Secondly, this bill allows young people, particularly those youth who \nare people of color, low income, or are at high risk of dropping out of \nschool, to integrate themselves into their communities and to learn \nskills that could lead to jobs or a greater interest in higher \neducation in the future.\n  I have seen firsthand the benefits that youth corps bring to their \ncommunities and the difference that the work can make in the lives of \nat-risk youth.\n  In 1983, I founded the first urban youth corps as mayor of San \nFrancisco, and during that time I saw a great improvement in the \nquality of life of the corps members and of the city itself.\n  When we first began the program, we ran it on a million-dollar budget \nemploying 36 disadvantaged young people ranging in age between 18 and \n23 years old who needed some direction, wanted a challenge, and wanted \nto make themselves socially useful.\n  That first year, we paid corps members $3.35 an hour to repair \nbathrooms in affordable housing for senior citizens and ex-offenders, \nbuild a park in Hunter's Point, clear scotch broom from the Twin Peaks \nhillside, and fix up Alcatraz Island. And in the 21 years since the \nprogram began, it has grown into a multisite, multifaceted agency that \nengages more than 500 young adults annually who have completed over 3.5 \nmillion hours of community service.\n  It has given thousands of corps members a sense of personal pride, \nhelped to connect them with their community and see for themselves that \nhard work pays off.\n  I started the San Francisco Conservation Corps to help young people \nbreak out of the cycle of poverty and crime and improve their job \nskills by giving them guidance and support through labor-intensive \nactivities.\n  For this same reason, I am introducing this bill with the hope that \nthe success of the San Francisco Conservation Corps can be duplicated \nnationwide.\n  Specifically, this bill does the following: It authorizes the \nAgriculture and Interior Secretaries to enter into contracts or \ncooperative agreements with existing State, local, and nonprofit youth \nconservation corps to carry out land management initiatives on public \nlands.\n  It directs the Secretaries to give priority for projects that will \nreduce hazardous fuels on public land, restore land located in near \nmunicipal watersheds and municipal waters supplies, rehabilitate land \naffected or altered by fire, assess lands afflicted or imminently \nthreatened by disease or insect infestation, work to address windthrown \nland or at high risk of reburn, provide emergency assistance and \ndisaster relief to communities.\n  It allows the Secretaries to grant, at their discretion, \nnoncompetitive hiring status for corps alumni for future Federal \nhiring.\n  It authorizes $25 million for the alliance for fiscal year 2005-\nfiscal year 2009.\n  I know this program will not take all of the burden off public land \nmanagement agencies as they work to protect and restore public lands, \nand I know this program will not reach every disadvantaged young person \nin need of guidance and support. But it is a start and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in my efforts.\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Dodd (for himself and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 2254.

Res. 325\n\n       Whereas Jews and other ethnic groups have lived mostly as \n     minorities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian \n     Gulf region for more than 2,500 years, more than 1,000 years \n     before the advent of Islam;\n       Whereas the United States has long voiced its concern about \n     the mistreatment of minorities and the violation of human \n     rights in the Middle East and elsewhere;\n       Whereas the United States continues to play a pivotal role \n     in seeking an end to conflict in the Middle East and to \n     promoting a peace that will benefit all the people of the \n     region;\n       Whereas a comprehensive peace in the region will require \n     the resolution of all outstanding issues through bilateral \n     and multilateral negotiations involving all concerned \n     parties;\n       Whereas the discussion of refugees in the Middle East \n     generally centers on Palestinian refugees, even though \n     estimates indicate that, as a result of the 1948 war in which \n     numerous Arab armies attacked the newly-founded State of \n     Israel, more Jews (approximately 850,000) were displaced from \n     Arab countries than were Palestinians (approximately \n     726,000);\n       Whereas the United States has demonstrated interest and \n     concern about the mistreatment, violation of rights, forced \n     expulsion, and expropriation of assets of minority \n     populations in general, and in particular, former Jewish \n     refugees displaced from Arab countries, as evidenced, inter \n     alia, by the following actions:\n       (1) A Memorandum of Understanding signed by President Jimmy \n     Carter and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan on October 4, \n     1977, states that ``[a] solution of the problem of Arab \n     refugees and Jewish refugees will be discussed in accordance \n     with rules which should be agreed''.\n       (2) After negotiating the Camp David Accords, the Framework \n     for Peace in the Middle East, President Jimmy Carter stated \n     in a press conference on October 27, 1977 that ``Palestinians \n     have rights . . . obviously there are Jewish refugees . . . \n     they have the same rights as others do''.\n       (3) In an interview with Israeli television immediately \n     after the issue of the rights of Jews displaced from Arab \n     lands was discussed at Camp David II in July 2000, President \n     Clinton stated clearly that ``[t]here will have to be some \n     sort of international fund set up for the refugees. There is, \n     I think, some interest, interestingly enough, on both sides, \n     in also having a fund which compensates the Israelis who were \n     made refugees by the war, which occurred after the birth of \n     the State of Israel. Israel is full of people, Jewish people, \n     who lived in predominantly Arab countries who came to Israel \n     because they were made refugees in their own land.''.\n       (4) In Senate Resolution 76, 85th Congress, agreed to \n     January 29, 1957, the Senate--\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\n       (A) notes that individuals in Egypt who are tied by race, \n     religion, or national origin with Israel, France, or the \n     United Kingdom have been subjected to arrest, forced exile, \n     confiscation of property, and other punishments although not \n     charged with any crime; and\n       (B) requests the President to instruct the chief delegate \n     to the United Nations to urge the prompt dispatch of a United \n     Nations observer team to Egypt with a view to obtain a full \n     factual report concerning this violation of rights.\n       (5) In House Concurrent Resolution 158, 85th Congress, \n     Congress notes that the Government of Egypt had initiated a \n     series of measures against the Jewish community, that many \n     Jews were arrested as a result of such measures, that, \n     beginning in November 1956, many Jews were expelled from \n     Egypt, and that the Jews of Egypt faced sequestration of \n     their goods and assets and denial or revocation of Egyptian \n     citizenship, and resolves that the treatment of Jews in Egypt \n     constituted ``persecution on account of race, religious \n     beliefs, or political opinions'', further resolving that \n     these issues should be raised by the United States either in \n     the United Nations or by other appropriate means.\n       (6) Section 620 of H.R. 3100, 100th Congress, states that \n     Congress finds that ``with the notable exceptions of Morocco \n     and Tunisia, those Jews remaining in Arab countries continue \n     to suffer deprivations, degradations, and hardships, and \n     continue to live in peril'' and that Congress calls upon the \n     governments of those Arab countries where Jews still maintain \n     a presence to guarantee their Jewish citizens full civil and \n     human rights, including the right to lead full Jewish lives \n     free of fear and to emigrate if they so choose;\n       Whereas, the seminal United Nations resolution on the Arab-\n     Israeli conflict and other international initiatives refer \n     generally to the plight of ``refugees'' and do not make any \n     distinction between Palestinian and Jewish refugees, \n     including the following:\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 of \n     November 22, 1967, calls for a ``just settlement of the \n     refugee problem'' without distinction between Palestinian and \n     Jewish refugees. Justice Arthur Goldberg, the United States \n     delegate to the United Nations at that time, has pointed out \n     that ``a notable omission in 242 is any reference to \n     Palestinians, a Palestinian state on the West Bank or the \n     PLO. The resolution addresses the objective of `achieving a \n     just settlement of the refugee problem.' This language \n     presumably refers both to Arab and Jewish refugees, for about \n     an equal number of each abandoned their homes as a result of \n     the several wars''.\n       (2) The Madrid Conference, which was first convened in \n     October 1991 and was co-chaired by United States President \n     George H.W. Bush and President of the U.S.S.R. Mikhail \n     Gorbachev, included delegations from Spain, the European \n     Community, the Netherlands, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, as \n     well as a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. In his \n     opening remarks before the January 28, 1992, organizational \n     meeting for multilateral negotiations on the Middle East in \n     Moscow, United States Secretary of State James Baker made no \n     distinction between Palestinian refugees and Jewish refugees \n     in articulating the mission of the Refugee Working Group, \n     stating that ``[t]he refugee group will consider practical \n     ways of improving the lot of people throughout the region who \n     have been displaced from their homes''.\n       (3) The Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the \n     Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, in referring to an ``agreed, \n     just fair, and realistic solution to the refugee issue,'' \n     uses language that is equally applicable to all persons \n     displaced as a result of the conflict in the Middle East;\n       Whereas Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians have affirmed \n     that a comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict \n     will require a just solution to the plight of all \n     ``refugees'' as evidenced by the following:\n       (1) The 1978 Camp David Accords, the Framework for Peace in \n     the Middle East, includes a commitment by Egypt and Israel to \n     ``work with each other and with other interested parties to \n     establish agreed procedures for a prompt, just and permanent \n     resolution of the implementation of the refugee problem.'' \n     The Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt, signed at \n     Washington, D.C. March 26, 1979, in addition to general \n     references to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 \n     as the basis for comprehensive peace in the region, provides \n     in Article 8 that the ``Parties agree to establish a claims \n     commission for the mutual settlement of all financial \n     claims,'' including those of former Christian and Jewish \n     refugees displaced from Egypt.\n       (2) Article 8 of the Treaty of Peace Between the State of \n     Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, done at Arava/\n     Araba Crossing Point October 26, 1994, entitled ``Refugees \n     and Displaced Persons'' recognizes ``the massive human \n     problems caused to both Parties by the conflict in the Middle \n     East.'' The reference to massive human problems in a broad \n     manner suggests that the plight of all refugees of ``the \n     conflict in the Middle East'' includes Jewish refugees from \n     Arab countries;\n       Whereas the United States is encouraged by recent \n     statements by Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi that he is ready \n     to compensate Libyan Jews whose properties were confiscated \n     and that he is prepared to allow Libyans to travel to Israel;\n       Whereas the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for \n     the Transitional Period, signed at Baghdad March 8, 2004, is \n     a landmark document that enshrines the ``right to freedom of \n     thought, conscience, and religious belief and practice'' that \n     had long been denied to Iraqis and states that ``the \n     Transitional Government shall take steps to end the vestiges \n     of the oppressive acts arising from,'' among other things, \n     ``forced displacement, deprivation of citizenship, [and] \n     expropriation of financial assets and property''; and\n       Whereas, while progress is being made, continued emphasis \n     needs to be placed on the rights and redress for Jewish \n     refugees: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND REFUGEES.\n\n     It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States deplores the past and continuing \n     violation of the human rights and religious freedoms of \n     minority populations in Arab countries;\n       (2) with respect to Jews and Christians displaced from Arab \n     countries, for any comprehensive Middle East peace agreement \n     to be credible, durable, and enduring, constitute an end to \n     conflict in the Middle East, and provide for finality of all \n     claims, the agreement must address and resolve all \n     outstanding issues, including the legitimate rights of all \n     peoples displaced from Arab countries; and\n       (3) the United States will work to ensure that the \n     provisions of both the Law of Administration for the State of \n     Iraq for the Transitional Period, signed at Baghdad March 8, \n     2004, and the permanent constitution to be presented to the \n     people of Iraq for approval in a general referendum no later \n     than October 15, 2005--\n       (A) are universally applied to all groups forced to leave \n     Iraq; and\n       (B) will rectify the historical injustices and \n     discriminatory measures perpetrated by previous Iraqi \n     regimes.\n\n     SEC. 2.
