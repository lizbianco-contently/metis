BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise this morning to mark the 50th \nAnniversary of the Supreme Court's historic decision in the case of \nBrown vs. Board of Education of Topeka.\n  As I stand at my desk on the Senate floor, my eyes are often drawn to \nthe inscription etched in marble directly above the rostrum.\n  The inscription reads, ``E Pluribus Unum.'' Translated into English, \nthis means, ``out of many, one.'' The founding fathers selected ``E \nPluribus Unum'' to signify the union of our thirteen original colonies \ninto a single cohesive nation--the United States of America. They \nunderstood that America's future success, and indeed our strength, \nwould be enhanced through this union.\n  As our Nation grew in size, population, and diversity, our national \nmotto took on greater meaning.\n  Today, ``E Pluribus Unum'' reminds us that America is home to a \ncollection of individuals of all races, creeds, and backgrounds. These \nindividuals together make up America's strength and majesty.\n  I do not believe the architects of this hallowed chamber etched these \nwords into such a prominent place by accident. As you know, Senate \nrules require every Senator to engage in debate--no matter how heated \nor contentious--through the presiding officer. These three words, ``E \nPluribus Unum,'' inscribed directly above the presiding officer serve \nto remind us\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nthat regardless of the differences that may divide this body on a given \nday, we will emerge united as a Senate and united as a Nation.\n  As columnist George Will noted, we are ``a nation defined by our \nunum, not our pluribus.''\n  Yet, tragically, for much of our Nation's history, millions of \nAfrican-Americans were excluded from fully participating in our \ndemocracy--first by slavery, and later through a system of State-\nsponsored segregation.\n  This system of legalized segregation was sanctioned by the Supreme \nCourt case Plessy vs. Ferguson and its doctrine allowing for \n``separate, but equal'' public accommodations, including schools.\n  It is with some pride that I note that a Kentuckian, Associate \nJustice John Marshall Harlan, was the lone dissenting voice on the \nCourt in the Plessy case. In his stinging dissent, Justice Harlan \nargued:\n\n       Our Constitution is color blind and neither knows nor \n     tolerates classes among citizens . . . the destinies of the \n     two races are indissolubly linked together, and the interests \n     of both require the common government of all shall not permit \n     the seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of \n     the law.\n\n  Justice Harlan also noted, ``the judgment this day rendered will, in \ntime, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this \ntribunal in the Dred Scott case''--referring to the case right before \nthe Civil War.\n  Justice Harlan's words proved prophetic as more and more Americans \ngrew to understand that a nation forcibly separated by law could never \nfully realize its destiny as a beacon of freedom, nor truly live up to \nits motto, ``E Pluribus Unum.''\n  By denying African-American children the equal opportunity to attend \nthe same schools as their fellow citizens, States denied these children \nthe opportunity to fully participate economically, socially, or \npolitically in our society as adults.\n  Fifty years ago this morning, the Supreme Court agreed when it ruled \nin favor of the plaintiffs in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka. \nSimply, yet eloquently, a unanimous Supreme Court found, ``We conclude \nthat in the field of public education the doctrine 'separate but equal' \nhas no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.'' \nThe Court later directed the States to move forward with desegregation \n``with all deliberate speed.''\n  In 1954, Kentucky had already begun taking the first small steps \ntowards integrating the State's schools. While the State's elementary \nand secondary schools remained segregated in 1954, Kentucky had begun \nchipping away at our state's infamous 1904 ``Day Law,'' which mandated \nracial segregation in public education.\n  On the day following the decision, the Louisville Courier-Journal \nnoted, ``The Supreme Court, in a decision marked by reason and \nrestraint, has enunciated a doctrine of morality.''\n  Madam President, it is fitting and appropriate that we mark the 50th \nAnniversary of the Brown decision. However, we must also understand \nthat while Brown opened the schoolhouse doors to all children, it could \nnot guarantee that every child, regardless of race, receives a high \nquality education.\n  That task has been left to the generations that have followed.\n  In the years since, educators have documented an unsettling and \npersistent achievement gap between minority and non-minority students. \nA similar gap exists between poor and non-poor students.\n  For example, in my home state of Kentucky minority students are much \nless likely to read proficiently at grade level than their non-minority \ncounterparts. Similar results have been documented nationally.\n  For decades, the Federal Government spent countless billions with the \ngoal of eliminating the achievement gap but without demanding any real \naccountability for improving results. Since no results were demanded, \nnone were forthcoming.\n  From 1965 to 2001, the Federal Government spent more than $150 \nbillion to address the achievement gap. Total education spending \ndoubled during that period from 1965 to 2001, even after accounting for \ninflation. Yet during most of this period, reading and math scores \nremained flat. If funding were the problem, we would have solved the \nachievement gap years ago.\n  During this period too many Americans came to accept the achievement \ngap as the inevitable result of a student's environment or believe the \nerroneous claim that a certain percentage of students will not ever be \nable to meet even basic standards in reading and math. All too often, \nschools just passed these students along from grade to grade through \nsocial promotion policies. While the schools may not have failed \nstudents on their report cards, they failed to prepare them for life's \nchallenges.\n  In his 2000 Presidential campaign, then-Governor Bush described this \nmistaken attitude as ``the soft bigotry of low expectations.'' \nFollowing his election, the President moved quickly with leaders in \nboth parties to attack the achievement gap and enact the No Child Left \nBehind law.\n  This historic legislation is grounded in the simple principle that \nevery child can learn and that no child should be left behind. It \nrecognizes the fundamental importance of reading for all children. As \nthe President has explained, ``Literacy is liberation. . . . The \nability to read is what turns a child into a student. First we learn to \nread, and then we read to learn.''\n  The law sets high standards for all groups of students, and then \nholds schools accountable for improving academic achievement across the \nboard. For the first time, the No Child Left Behind Act requires States \nto examine not only an entire school's progress but also the progress \nof subgroups of students within a school to make sure we do not give up \non any child, regardless of their color, language, or economic \ncircumstance.\n  If any of these subgroups is not meeting the school's goal of \nadequate yearly progress, then the whole school has failed to meet its \ngoals. The days of spending and education without accountability are \nover. Setting high standards for all our students is critical to \nensuring that every single child receives an equal opportunity for a \nquality education.\n  In writing for the unanimous court in the Brown decision, Chief \nJustice Warren noted:\n\n       In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably \n     be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \n     opportunity of an education.\n\n  Those words were never more accurate than they are today. While we \nmark the 50th anniversary of the historic Brown decision to opening \nAmerica's schools to all children, we must also remember that ensuring \nevery child receives a quality education is the ongoing responsibility \nfor each generation of leaders that follows.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I certainly agree \nwith my friend from Kentucky that there is nothing more important than \nfor us to ensure that our education system is accountable, is working \nwell, and is fair to all students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5504-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5504-S5505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFERENCING THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to talk about \nanother topic that I think affects us all. I just came back from my \nhome in Wyoming. I heard a great deal of conversation about highways \nand the highway bill and the fact that we have not yet been able to \npass a highway bill, both in the House and the Senate, and get \ntogether. The highway bill, of course, under which we have lived for \nthe last 6 years, has expired, and we are doing a month or two \nextension of time. The fact is, that does not work very well. With some \nissues I suppose we could continue to do extensions. Building highways \nand upgrading highways is all done by contracts. The people responsible \nfor highways need to know what their resources are going to be into the \nfuture so they can make those long-term decisions for highway \nconstruction contracts. We are unable to do that now.\n  The highway bill is one of the issues before us that is time \nimperative. The Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am a \nmember, has the primary responsibility for putting out a highway bill. \nWe worked on it for a long time. We brought a bill to the floor, and it \nwas passed by this body. It is a very good bill. It is a larger bill\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nthan the one that passed out of the House, and it expends more money \nthan the bill from the White House. The fact is, it is based on the \nmoney that is available, that is paid in taxes for highways.\n  We find ourselves in a strange situation. One of the issues about \nwhich all of us continue to be concerned, with a good deal of success, \nI might add, is working on creating jobs. There is no short-term \npassage of any bill that would provide more jobs than the highway bill, \nand these are contracting jobs, of course, in the private sector. It \nwould be helpful for us in terms of getting those jobs in place.\n  The other is infrastructure. Again, there is nothing more important \nto the overall economy. Think about what it means in each of our lives, \nwhether it is simply driving home, whether it is the business you are \nin, whether it is moving products all around the country. All we do is \nimpacted by transportation and by highways.\n  It seems that this issue of highways is more imperative than most \nanything before us, and yet we have not been able to move it and get it \nout where it belongs--out to the States.\n  I am becoming more and more concerned about the fact that the Federal \nGovernment is getting itself involved in a lot of issues that should \nnot be the focus or the role of the Federal Government. I am going to \nstart pressing to see if we cannot develop a criteria as to what the \nrole of the Federal Government ought to be. That is sort of what the \nConstitution does, but we stretched it out. In fact, I am gathering up \na list to talk about one of these days of all the various funding \nprograms in the Federal Government. All of us will be amazed when we \nsee the numbers and the size of the book involved in listing all those \nprograms.\n  Nothing could be more a function of the Federal Government, since the \nFederal Government charges a tax on every gallon of gas that we buy, \nthan building an infrastructure system across the country, much of it \nFederal interstate highways. It is clearly a role for the Federal \nGovernment and one for which we are responsible.\n  As we do that, we need to allow the priorities to be set by the \nStates. I do not agree with the House procedure of assigning all the \ndifferent specialities before it goes out of here, but rather we ought \nto decide the formula for the allocation among the States and let the \nStates then set their priorities, along with the Federal Government on \nFederal highways.\n  Obviously, highway systems perhaps in some ways are more important in \nrural States, such as Wyoming where we have one of the lower \npopulations but have more road miles than any other State. So highways \nbecome very important. In other words, when those of us who work in \nWashington, DC, have to face the traffic, that becomes very important \nas well. In different ways, all of these needs are out there. We have \nan opportunity to do a great deal. We have the bill ready to go, but we \ncannot get the bill to conference so that we can begin to work out our \ndifferences.\n  As I mentioned, there are differences among the Senate, the House, \nand the White House, but that is not the first time that has ever \nhappened. There is a system for putting that together. The system is a \nconference committee.\n  We cannot seem to get the contractors. The State workers and local \ngovernments deserve to be able to move forward and deserve to have a \nfinal bill out so those decisions and that movement can be made and so \nthose jobs can be created and our system can be strengthened.\n  The conferees need to be appointed so we can get on the bill. That is \nall that is necessary now. I know some of us would like to have things \ndifferently. Naturally, there are disagreements on bills of this kind, \nparticularly when getting into formulas for the distribution of \ndollars, but that is true with almost everything and that is what \nconference committees are for.\n  So we can move forward with that. The benefits that could come from \nit are second to none.\n  Pretty clearly, we have to continue to have improvements in the \nsystem. We find ourselves with more congestion. As time goes on, we \nwill find ourselves with more safety problems. We need to do these \nthings, as well as stimulate the economy.\n  So we need this bill. We need it for safety. We need it for the \ncountry. We need it for the energy. We need it to be able to conserve \nenergy by having more efficient highways. We need to move forward on a \nnumber of the things that are there.\n  Unfortunately, we have some obstruction going on on the floor. Much \nof it has to do with seeking to make a point about the election that is \ncoming up. Obviously, caring about elections and politics is not a \nbrandnew thing, but we ought not to have obstruction to moving forward \nwith a system that has been in place for years, a system that does \nwork, a system that does reconcile differences which we always have.\n  We are held up on the energy policy, one that is very important to \nus. We are held up on class action reform. We are held up on asbestos \nlegislation. We are held up on the approval of qualified judges. We are \nheld up on medical liability protection. All of these issues are so \nvery important. So it really hits home to us when we find ourselves in \nthis situation.\n  As we go about talking to people at home, health care insurance, \nmedical liability being part of that, is one of the issues we hear \nabout, as well as the idea of improving education and highways. Those \nare the issues in which people are interested.\n  So I urge that we move forward with the system. We have done the work \nwe have to do. In order to get it completed, we have to move on to a \nconference. We have to move on to reconciliation with the House and \nwith the White House. It is just the system. There is just no reason to \nhold it up. We need to move forward, and we need to move forward \nquickly. So I hope we can do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today--at \nleast a few moments are justified--in offering some words to help the \nNation celebrate the Brown v. Board of Education decision that occurred \n50 years ago. It is a good thing we remember and honor that decision. \nThat case was the culmination of a strategy by the NAACP and others \nthat attacked racial segregation at its heart and, by the way, also a \ndecision that redeemed the Supreme Court's record in cases of this kind \nbecause we should not forget the Court had earlier placed its \nimprimatur on slavery in 1856 in the Dred Scott decision and had \nsubsequently placed its imprimatur on the Jim Crow decision in Plessy \nv. Ferguson in 1896. It was, indeed, time in 1954 for the Supreme Court \nto stand up for the Constitution and live up to the promises of the \nDeclaration of Independence, specifically the promise that all of us \nare created equal, at least in this sense: that we are equal in our \nright to enjoy the inalienable rights that Almighty God gives us simply \nby virtue of the fact that we are people and have human dignity.\n  The history of the United States is, in one sense, a history of a \nprogressive realization of that promise that in fact had been made in \ntheory in the Declaration and also an understanding by the American \npeople that unless that promise is realized and enjoyed by everybody, \nit is secure for nobody. Brown v. Board of Education was a milestone in \nthat realization.\n  I do want to make the point that the Supreme Court's decision in \nBrown was not an isolated act of courage by nine Justices, although it \nwas certainly a\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\ncourageous decision. It was, as I said before, the culmination of a \nstrategy by the NAACP, but also years of advocacy by that group and \nother groups around the country and thousands of Americans on their own \nwho refused to accept the assumptions underlying racial segregation \nand, indeed, refused to let the American people go on year after year \nquietly and in an unthinking way accepting those assumptions.\n\n  That activity by thousands and thousands of people in protests, in \nop-ed pieces, in books they wrote, in appearances on mass media, and \njust the way they conducted their day-to-day lives changed public \nopinion, by no means entirely in 1954 but enough so that the Brown v. \nBoard of Education decision became possible, in a way that it would not \nhave been possible--clearly was not possible in 1934 or even 1944.\n  The same Supreme Court, staffed by the same nine Justices, would not \nand did not issue a decision such as Brown v. Board of Education 20 \nyears earlier or 10 years earlier because those people had not yet done \nenough of their work to move enough of the American people toward the \nright conclusion that that decision became possible.\n  In that sense, I suggest that people such as Jackie Robinson and \nothers around the country probably did more to desegregate the schools \nthan the Supreme Court did in Brown v. Board of Education, and \ncertainly people such as Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King did more \nto ensure the implementation in practice of the Brown v. Board of \nEducation than the Federal courts did.\n  I want to dedicate this day on which we justly celebrate the decision \nto the thousands of people, some who are recorded in history and some \nwho have remained anonymous, who made that decision possible and helped \ncorrect a tremendous injustice and redeem America's honor before the \nbar of history.\n  The Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, changed laws, and \nthat is hard, as we know in the Senate.\n  Those other folks, in standing up for the rights of their fellow \ncitizens, changed hearts, and that is even more difficult.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the 50th \nAnniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Today, we celebrate the \nhistoric and unanimous Supreme Court decision that called for an end to \nracial segregation in schools throughout the nation. And as we honor \nthose individuals who risked so much to challenge discrimination and \nestablish a constitutional right to an equal education, I am filled \nwith both hope and promise. Hope that the legacy of Brown will endure. \nHope that equality and opportunity will soon be the reality for \nmillions of school children who today still face segregation and \ninequality in their schools. And the promise that today we will renew \nour commitment to achieving the goal of equality that began 50 years \nago with the Brown decision.\n  I am so proud to honor today the important role that the great state \nof Maryland played in this history of Brown. Maryland is the birthplace \nof Thurgood Marshall, the architect of the blueprint to end racial \nsegregation in education. Thurgood Marshall grew up and attended \nracially segregated schools in Baltimore, he knew the impact of \nsegregation first hand, and he took the fight for racial justice all \nthe way to the Supreme Court. His thoughtful and strategic legal \narguments were instrumental in knocking down racial segregation in our \ncountry. Maryland is also the home of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People. Founded in 1909, the NAACP successfully \nfought to integrate the University of Maryland in 1935 and its leaders \npainstakingly planned and organized the challenge to racial segregation \nin public schools.\n  Brown marks a momentous beginning in American history. For the first \ntime, the Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to an equal \npublic education for all students. And for the first time, the Supreme \nCourt recognized that separate can never be equal. Brown is the \nfoundation on the road to dismantling segregation in our society. The \nfight for equality started with the schools and progressed through the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968--all critical steps to rid the nation of \nsegregation and disparities it fostered. Yet 50 years later we're still \na long way from the promise of Brown v. Board of Education--equality in \npublic education and opportunity for all students.\n  Why was the Brown decision so important? Because the Supreme Court \nsaid that regardless of race, color, creed or ethnicity education ``is \na right which must be made available to all students.'' The Brown Court \ntook the unprecedented step of examining how African-American children \nwere being educated and the environments that they were learning in. \nAnd for the first time the Court used social science research to show \nthat learning is compromised by segregation--and as a result Black \nstudents were receiving inferior educations. It was clear that poor \nschools, which invariably lacked resources, resulted in a lower quality \nof education for Black students than their white counterparts. Most \nimportantly, the Brown decision, with a mighty hand, challenged \nAmericans to confront the discrimination, segregation and inequality \nthat existed in schools and in their communities.\n  Today, I urge Americans to renew that challenge. We must address the \ngrowing disparities in our schools and the re-segregation of students \nof color in our classrooms. Even a quick glance at our Nation's \nschools, including schools in Maryland, shows that the promise of Brown \nhas not been realized. We know that students are still segregated--and \nthat schools still are not equal. Students of color and poor students \nare more likely to be in overcrowded schools, without enough books and \ncomputers, in buildings that are often literally falling apart. They \nare often sidelined into special education classes--when what they \nreally need is special attention.\n  I don't want the quality of education to depend on a family's income \nor the location they live in. As the Brown Court understood, having \nadequate resources and decent facilities matters. We need to make sure \nwe have a public school system that works. That means smaller classes, \na good teacher in every classroom, and making sure schools have \nresources to meet special needs--like bilingual education and special \neducation. We need to keep fighting against the soft bigotry of low \nexpectation.\n  Today, as we commemorate the Brown decision and the progress that has \nbeen made in the past 50 years, we renew our commitment to increase \ndiversity and provide educational opportunities for all children \nregardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status. We must stand up \nfor what America stands for: opportunity, equality, and empowerment. We \nmust make sure there is no discrimination of any kind, anywhere in the \nUnited States of America--whether it is the old fashioned kind or the \nnew fashioned kind. That means saying no to continued racial \ndiscrimination in education, and saying no to racial sidelining: \npushing children of color into special education. Brown established \neducation as a right to all students. We must continue to fight to \nprotect that right, to make sure that the promise of an equal education \nis, in fact, a reality for all school children.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, 50 years ago, a third grade girl named \nLinda walked a full mile each way to school, crossing through a \ndangerous railroad switchyard to do it. Only five blocks from her home \nwas a very nice local school, but when her father petitioned for her \nadmission, he was denied.\n  Why?\n  Because she was not white.\n  Fortunately, her father would not give up, and because of his \ntenacity, 50 years later, we can celebrate the landmark decision of \nBrown v. the Topeka Board of Education.\n  Since Thurgood Marshall argued his most important case involving over \n200 plaintiffs in front of the same bench that he would later sit on, \nwe have made great strides.\n  We have done away with the ridiculous idea that separate could ever \nbe equal. We have legalized desegregation. Colleges and universities \nare becoming increasingly more diverse as parents who did not attend \ncollege are now able to send their children to institutions of higher \neducation.\n  But there is so much more still to do. Until children of all \nbackgrounds receive the same quality of teaching, have access to the \nsame quality of\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\nlearning resources, and graduate from high school and secondary \neducation at the same rate, our work is not finished.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's declaration in that landmark decision \nthat education ``is a right which must be made available to all on \nequal terms,'' our country still remains far from providing an equal \neducation to all.\n  Fortunately, I know we have the ability to change this and to ensure \nall children a first-rate education. We are the greatest and richest \ncountry in the world. We have the ability to make sure that our \nelementary and secondary schools are the best in the world.\n  We also need to make sure the doors to higher education remain open \nfor all. We have the best universities and colleges in the world, and \nstudents from all over the globe dream about attending college in the \nU.S.\n  The result of the University of Michigan case went a long way towards \nkeeping the hope of higher education open to all Americans. While the \nBrown case defined our parents' era, the current generation's battle is \nto move beyond the legalization of desegregation and make sure it \nactually happens, with the help of affirmative action.\n  I am pleased the Supreme Court upheld the efforts of the University \nof Michigan to promote diversity in university admissions. Education is \nthe most effective tool and the critical first step to empowerment. \nEducation is the tool that allows students to comprehend the world \naround them, and provides them the know-how to provide themselves with \na superior quality of life.\n  We need to keep it going. Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the \nChildren's Defense Fund and the first woman admitted to the Mississippi \nbar, once remarked, ``A lot of people are waiting for Martin Luther \nKing or Mahatma Gandhi to come back--but they are gone. We are it. It \nis up to us. It is up to you.''\n  She is right. It is up to us to continue Dr. King's, Mr. Brown's, and \neveryone's journey for full equality.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today marks the anniversary of one of the \nmost important milestones in American history. Fifty years ago today, \non May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously in \nBrown v. Board of Education that separate was not equal in our schools.\n  This landmark ruling established the principle of equality in our \nlaws and launched a national wave of racial integration and progress \ntoward racial equality. We are all familiar with the laws that have \nbeen erased from the books, mandating separate and inferior facilities, \nservices and treatment for African Americans. Americans can be proud \nthat we have made progress against the evils of segregation. Today \nAfrican Americans can live in any neighborhood they want, send their \nchildren to integrated schools, eat, drink, read, sleep, travel and \nenjoy recreation and entertainment in all the places every other \nAmerican can.\n  These changes mark major progress, but the road to equality has never \nbeen quick or easy. James McClinton, the new African American mayor of \nTopeka, KS where the Brown case originated, was quoted recently in the \nWashington Post noting that the legacy of the decision is both fragile \nand incomplete. Just a year after the Brown decision, the Supreme Court \nissued another case known as Brown II, which led many school districts \nto drag their feet for years before integrating. We all remember when \nPresident Eisenhower had to send the military to Central High School to \nprotect its first African American students, and the sacrifices African \nAmerican students made to attend formerly all-white colleges and \nuniversities. The truth is, we still have a long way to go. Today is a \nday to celebrate the progress we have made, and the breakthrough Brown \nv. Board represented for racial and educational equality in America. \nBut we cannot afford to just rest on our accomplishments since 1954. We \nmust also look forward to 2054, and ask ourselves what opportunities we \nwant our children and grandchildren to have then, and what they need us \nto do now to achieve those goals.\n  In 2004, African American students--as well as their counterparts in \nthe Hispanic and Native American communities--are not performing as \nwell as white students in our schools. I want to cite some statistics \nto paint a clear picture of what is going on in our schools. We first \nmust wake up to the established, continuing and disturbing trend of \nresegregation. Studies have found that our schools have reached their \npeak of integration and now may be moving back to becoming \nresegregated. As we commemorate the Brown decision, we cannot afford to \nignore this continued segregation. The National Assessment of \nEducational Progress found that while 74 percent of white fourth-grade \nstudents were good readers, barely half that many--39 percent of black \nfourth-graders earned the same designation. We have school buildings in \ndisrepair and overcrowded classrooms, which not only makes teaching \ndifficult, but sends minority and low-income students a powerful \nmessage that we do not value them or their education. Minority students \nare also much more likely to be in special or remedial education. In \n1994, 31 percent of African American, 24 percent of Hispanic and 35 \npercent of Native American high school graduates took remedial classes, \nwhile only 15 percent of white and Asian American high school graduates \ndid. Minority students make up 40 percent of our school-age population \nbut just 14 percent of their teachers are minorities. According to the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, white students are significantly \nmore likely to have access to advanced academic programs than minority \nchildren and children with disabilities in the same school district, \nregardless of how wealthy or poor the district is. Our national high \nschool graduation rate is an inadequate 69 percent, but when you dig \ndeeper you learn that we are graduating barely half our minority \nstudents in this country--just 53 percent of Hispanic students, 51 \npercent of Native American students, and 50 percent of African American \nstudents.\n  It should surprise no one that if minority students don't perform \nwell in high school, they will perform less well in college. As of \n1999, white students were literally twice as likely as Hispanic and \nAfrican American students to earn a Bachelor's degree. Both minority \ngroups are underrepresented on America's college campuses. Not only is \nthere a racial achievement gap, but that gap has actually widened in \nthe last generation. In the 28 years from 1971 to 1999, the proportion \nof white high school students who earned at least a Bachelor's degree \nincreased 13 points, to 36 percent. The proportion for African American \nstudents increased 5 points to 17 percent, and the share of Hispanic \nstudents rose 4 points to 14 percent. Imagine the larger social and \neconomic consequences of these populations not going to or graduating \nfrom college, especially when our racial diversity is growing rapidly. \nWe all know that you will earn a lot more money if you have a \nBachelor's degree, and that American economic competitiveness in a \nglobalizing economy depends on high-skill, high-wage jobs. We need to \nkeep up our efforts to make sure that the color of someone's skin does \nnot determine their opportunity to succeed.\n  If we are to ensure that children of color have an equal opportunity \nto go to college, get their degree and achieve the American dream, we \nmust address the academic deficiencies in our high schools. Roughly \nhalf our minority students are graduating from high school, which means \nthat nearly half are also dropping out. The No Child Left Behind Act, \nwhich I supported, requires for the first time that much of the \nacademic achievement data we collect on our schools be separated, \ndisaggregated, by race, students with disabilities, limited English \nproficiency, and students from low-income families. This step forward \nis critical to track achievement gaps and their trends over time. \nDisaggregated data is an important tool we need to target assistance \nand resources to reduce and eliminate racial achievement gaps. Yet \ncurrently the Department of Education is not requiring disaggregation \nof data on dropouts. This information is critical if we really want to \nreduce dropout rates and improve graduation rates for all students. I \nstrongly urge Secretary Paige and the Department of Education to report \ndisaggregation of dropout data.\n  We also know from numerous studies that the gaps between test scores \nof\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nlow-income and middle-income students could be eliminated if all \nstudents had highly qualified teachers. If fully funded, the No Child \nLeft Behind Act would put highly qualified teachers in all our \nclassrooms, but, unfortunately, an amendment I offered on the budget \nresolution earlier this year to fully fund the Act, failed on a party-\nline vote. But even when No Child Left Behind is fully funded, as I \nhope it is next year, our work will still not be done with regards to \nour high schools.\n  That is why last summer I introduced S.1554, the Pathways for All \nStudents to Succeed--PASS, Act. The PASS Act seeks to eliminate \ndropout, achievement and graduation gaps among our high school \nstudents. The PASS Act does three things. First, it will help students \nlearn to read and write by providing $1 billion to help schools hire \nliteracy coaches. Second, my bill ensures students are taking the \nclasses and getting the support they need to finish school. It provides \n$2 billion for academic and career counselors to ensure students have a \npersonalized plan for completing high school and going on to college. \nFinally, my bill provides extra help to schools that need it most. It \nprovides $500 million in grants to help improve low-performing schools \nimprove. I hope that the Senate will pass this bill this year.\n  The Brown v. Board decision was a momentous achievement for our \nNation, and I am honored to mark its 50th anniversary today. At the \nsame time, we must take the momentum of this celebration to fulfill the \npromise of Brown by ensuring that all our children have access to the \nhighest quality education worthy of our great Nation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of \nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision of Brown v. \nBoard of Education which declared separate but equal unconstitutional. \nI believe that ensuring that our public schools are open to everyone is \na great equalizer in America.\n  I will soon be turning 49, and I know that having an integrated \nschool system has enriched my generation by allowing all of us in South \nCarolina to learn, socialize, and compete together in a public school \nsetting.\n  The brave men and women who fought to end the segregation of public \nschools have done a great service to South Carolina and our nation. It \nis appropriate they be honored accordingly and all of us should commit \nourselves to build upon their legacy.\n  I join you and my colleagues in the U.S. Senate in commemorating this \nhistoric decision.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of Brown \nvs. Board of Education, a U.S. Supreme Court landmark decision that \nsent shockwaves through the educational establishment. For the first \ntime, the highest court in the country decided that ``separate \neducational facilities are inherently unequal'' and a violation of the \n14th Amendment.\n  Before Brown vs. Board of Education, Indianapolis Public Schools had \nbeen forced by State law to scrap separate black and white schools. \nThat change, however, did not necessarily result in integrated \nclassrooms. Segregated communities left most of our schools racially \nhomogeneous.\n  It was in this environment that I was elected to the Indianapolis \nPublic School Board in 1964. Like much of the country, Indianapolis was \nexperiencing the civil rights movement, and the Indianapolis Public \nSchools were in the middle of it all.\n  Our meetings were picketed and protested, and citizens staged ``sit-\nins'' at the downtown headquarters. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled on \nMay 17, 1954, that separate but equal could not stand; yet in the 10 \nyears that followed, IPS had not done much to integrate its schools.\n  To further the discussion, and to seek input on what would later \nbecome known as the Shortridge Plan; I held neighborhood meetings in \nschool buildings around Indianapolis to discuss ideas for peacefully \nintegrating the city schools. At one such meeting on the near Westside, \nparticipants literally picked up the furniture and threw it at each \nother. The police had to be called to restore order.\n  Later, the Shortridge Plan was adopted by the board, but not \nenthusiastically. Under the Shortridge Plan, IPS was to establish a \ncollege preparatory high school that would voluntarily draw the best \nand the brightest from all over Indianapolis, regardless of race. Some \nboard members, and the community at large, saw this step as far too \ndisruptive. Those individuals felt that the school board should not be \ninvolved in matters of race and sociology.\n  The plan worked because young Hoosiers responded. Before the plan was \nimplemented, Shortridge was 90 percent African American, 10 percent \nCaucasian. The racial makeup of the applicants to the first entering \nclass under the new plan was astounding: 53 percent Caucasian, 47 \npercent African American. In a year, the school became a national \nexample of how young African American and Caucasian students could \nthrough their own individual choices come together to learn and study.\n  Unfortunately, in my second year of service on the board, \npolarization set in. A majority of the Board no longer felt that we \nshould be involved in questions of race. In an election for president \nof the board, I lost 4-3. The issue of race, however, could not be \navoided. Years later, the Federal courts implemented an involuntary \nbusing system that forced our schools to seek some racial balance.\n  Brown vs. Board of Education set us, and the rest of the Nation, on \nan important path. While the Court opinion outlawed the notion of \n``separate but equal,'' it persuaded us to address the larger issue of \nliving together as one society. Brown v. Board of Education helped us \nto become a better Nation. But we still have much work to do.\n  Today, we face a different type of segregation; namely, the gap \nbetween those who receive a quality education and those who do not. The \ngap in reading achievement between blacks and whites is staggering \nnationally. It is 28 percentage points at the 4th-grade level. The gap \nin reading achievement between Hispanics and whites is also alarming \nnationally, 29 percentage points at the 4th-grade level. We are \nexperiencing two education systems--separate and unequal. This is \nunacceptable.\n  The Federal Government's first major entry into public education was \nin 1965 when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed to \nprovide Federal aid to school districts with large percentages of \nchildren in poverty. The intent was to help level the playing field--to \ngive extra aid to those children most in need. Despite a discretionary \nfunding amount of $55.6 billion in fiscal year 2004, increased from \n$35.6 billion in 2000, achievement gaps have remained wide.\n  To help close these gaps and to help ensure that all children have an \nequal opportunity to learn, Congress and the Administration worked \ntogether to pass the No Child Left Behind education reform act in 2002.\n  Under No Child Left Behind, States must describe how they will close \nthe achievement gap and make sure that all students, including those \nwho are physically disadvantaged, achieve academic proficiency. In \naddition, they must produce annual State and school district report \ncards that inform parents and communities about State and school \nprogress. Schools that do not make progress must provide supplemental \nservices, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance. If \ncorrective actions do not yield adequate progress after 5 years, \nschools must make dramatic changes in the management.\n  The idea is not to establish Federal control over the schools, but \nsimply to push States and local school districts to take a hard look at \neach school's strong and weak points.\n  In many schools, an overall high performance has often hidden a weak \nperformance by some student sub-groups. Because of this dynamic, the \nact requires that each sub-group be reported separately. Overlooking \nthe fact that only one in six African Americans graduate with \nproficient reading skills is simply not acceptable.\n  Some have complained about the increased focus on school testing. But \nif we want each child to earn a meaningful high school degree, testing \nin lower grades is an important tool to reveal the strengths and \nweaknesses of each school. Testing allows schools to learn which \nstudents need help and what subjects must be taught better.\n  We all have the same goal--to improve our schools. All students must \nhave the opportunity to get ahead, regardless of race or residence. On \nMay\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously declared that separate but \nequal could not stand as the law of the land. It is our job--50 years \nlater--to make sure that we are faithful to this principle of equal \nopportunity. The success of all of our children and the economic future \nof our country depend on our determination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I speak today on the 50th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision, Brown v. Board of \nEducation. I join with all Americans in celebrating this decision, \nwhich, in many ways, inspired the modern civil rights movement.\n  In Brown, the Supreme Court upheld the right of all children to an \nequal education in our public schools. In its unanimous opinion, the \nCourt stated ``[w]e conclude that in the field of public education the \ndoctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational \nfacilities are inherently unequal.'' With these historic words, the \ndoors of public schools were required to be opened to all children, \nregardless of their race, and efforts to end segregation in other \naspects of American society gained momentum.\n  The slow integration of our public schools has been a difficult and \nsometimes painful process, with some clinging to any mechanism by which \nthis process could be slowed or circumvented. The promise of children \nof all races and backgrounds coming together to study and to prepare \nfor their futures has too often been clouded by the prejudices of \nadults. And while great strides have been made in the last 50 years, \nmuch work remains to be done to ensure that the phrase ``separate but \nequal'' is at long last relegated to the history books.\n  One of the most serious challenges facing public schools today is the \nNo Child Left Behind, NCLB, Act, which includes a Federal testing \nmandate that has become an added burden for students and school \ndistricts.\n  Wisconsinites are concerned about this additional layer of testing \nfor many reasons, including the cost of developing and implementing \nthese tests, the loss of teaching time every year to prepare for and \ntake the tests, and the extra pressure that the tests will place on \nstudents, teachers, schools, and school districts.\n  Instead of piling more tests on public school students, concerned \nparents, teachers and school administrators want to know when the \nFederal Government is going to provide the funding it promised for \neducation programs. While I have worked with many of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to provide more of this funding, Congress still falls far \nshort of providing the resources that students need. And schools are \nleft to face mandate after mandate without the funding that they need \nto carry those mandates out.\n  No Child Left Behind not only adds to that list of Federal mandates, \nit also can impose harsh sanctions on schools that do not meet yearly \ngoals, even though the programs that would help students and schools to \nmeet those goals are not fully funded. Lagging test scores at a given \nschool may mean that the school is labeled as ``failing,'' which can \nhave serious, negative consequences for a school that may already be \nstruggling.\n  I support a bill introduced by my colleague Senator Durbin, which \ntakes a different approach to the issue. This legislation seeks to \nensure that schools get the funding they need to implement the mounting \nFederal mandates they face. The bill sets a minimum amount of funding \nthat the Federal Government must provide for the Title I program, which \nsupports programs for low-income and disadvantaged students. If a \nschool doesn't get the minimum funding, it shouldn't be subject to the \npenalties that schools can receive under the NCLB law, and the Durbin \nbill would exempt schools from sanctions in any year that Title I is \nnot funded at this minimum level.\n  As we saw when nationwide test results came in last fall, the legacy \nof Brown will not be fulfilled until we can close the gap on the racial \ndisparities that persist in test results and also in graduation rates. \nNor will education truly be equal for all students as long as we \nunderfund special education programs and other programs critical to \nsupporting students who are struggling to succeed in the classroom.\n  If lagging test scores prove that too many children are being left \nbehind, the answer isn't to label them as failures. We must give those \nstudents the resources they need to succeed in school. Congress and the \nadministration must do more to ensure that schools have the resources \nto help these students catch up with their peers before students are \nrequired to take additional annual tests required under the No Child \nLeft Behind Act--tests that will have serious consequences for their \nschools. The legacy of the Brown decision is an education for all \nchildren on ``equal terms.'' Either we ensure that great legacy, or we \nfail the children who need our support the most.\n  The decision in Brown was one step in the continuing journey to \nAmerica that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., dreamed would be ``a nation \nwhere [his children] will not be judged by the color of their skin but \nby the content of their character.'' A few years after the Brown \ndecision, Congress began to do its part to combat inequality. It passed \ncivil rights laws ensuring the right to vote to all Americans, banning \ndiscrimination in employment based on race, ethnicity, religion, \nnational origin or gender, and prohibiting discrimination in public and \nprivate housing.\n  Our Nation has come a long way since 1954, but we still have work to \ndo. Congress and the administration have a particular responsibility to \nadvance the cause of freedom, justice, and equality for all Americans. \nCongress and the President can demonstrate their support for freedom \nand justice by supporting civil rights initiatives that have been \nignored for far too long.\n\n  Perhaps no issue on this agenda is more urgent than racial profiling. \nRacial profiling is the insidious practice by which some law \nenforcement agents stop African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, \nArab Americans and others simply because of their race, ethnicity, or \nnational origin. Reports in states from New Jersey to Florida, and \nMaryland to Texas all show that African Americans, Hispanics, and \nmembers of other minority groups are being stopped by some police at \nrates far in excess of their share of the population and the rate at \nwhich they engage in criminal conduct.\n  I might add that the urgency for banning racial profiling is \ncompounded by concerns post-September 11 that racial profiling--instead \nof good police work and following up on legitimate leads--is being used \nmore frequently against Arabs, Muslims, or Americans perceived to be \nArab or Muslim.\n  President Bush pledged to end racial profiling over 3 years ago \nduring his first address to a joint session of Congress. Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft also has acknowledged the damage caused by racial \nprofiling and called for an end to the practice. It is time for the \nadministration to move this effort forward.\n  Representative John Conyers, the distinguished ranking member of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, and I have reintroduced our bill, the End \nRacial Profiling Act. Our bill bans racial profiling and requires \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to take steps to \nprevent the practice. This bill should be one of the top agenda items \nthis Congress and the Administration should follow through on its \npromise to address this issue.\n  The vast majority of law enforcement agents fulfill their duties \nprofessionally and without bias and we are all indebted to them for \ntheir courage and dedication. Racial profiling is ineffective and \nundermines their efforts to serve and protect all Americans.\n  In addition to passing the End Racial Profiling Act, Congress and the \nPresident should also address a range of civil rights-related issues in \nthis Congress--from education, to welfare, to a fair wage for an honest \nday's work, to improving our criminal justice system.\n  Congress should do more to ensure that federally funded programs \ncomply with civil rights and other laws. In particular, we must improve \nthe Federal welfare law to require that each State's program treats all \napplicants and clients fairly. While Congress rightly encouraged state-\nlevel innovation with the 1996 welfare law, we should use the pending \nreauthorization of that law as an opportunity to ensure that all State \nplans conform to uniform Federal fair treatment and due process \nprotections for all applicants and clients.\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\n  Congress should ensure that all Americans get a fair wage for an \nhonest day's work. Too often, parents work double shifts or more than \none job for low wages in order to make ends meet and to provide the \nbasic necessities for their families. We must at last increase the \nFederal minimum wage. We must work to close the wage gap between women \nand men.\n  Congress should also take action to ensure fairness and justice in \nthe administration of the death penalty. We know that the \nadministration of the death penalty at the Federal and State levels is \nflawed. With over 100 innocent people on death row later exonerated in \nthe modern death penalty era, any reasonable person can see that the \ncurrent system risks executing the innocent. That is why Congress \nshould pass the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act. Congress and the \nPresident should support a moratorium on executions while a national, \nblue ribbon commission reviews the fairness of the administration of \nthe death penalty.\n  Congress can also do more to protect hardworking Americans from \ndiscrimination in the workplace. We should pass the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act. I have been pleased to join my colleague Senator \nKennedy in sponsoring this important bill that will ensure that \nAmericans are not discriminated against by employers based on their \nsexual orientation. It is time that we take this step on behalf of \nequal opportunity and equal rights.\n  Congress should also take another step to ensure that all Americans \nhave the right to vote and to be represented in their Congress. We meet \ntoday in a jurisdiction where over a half a million people are denied \nthe right to fully participate in their Government. The majority of the \npeople in this jurisdiction, the District of Columbia, are African \nAmerican. Shutting them out of our Government is a continuing moral \nstain on our nation that must be addressed. We should take action on \nlegislation sponsored by Senator Lieberman and myself, under DC \nDelegate Eleanor Holmes Norton's leadership, to grant full \ncongressional representation for the District of Columbia.\n  Congress and the administration must take concrete steps to protect \nAmericans' civil rights.\n  As Dr. King said, ``This is no time to engage in the luxury of \ncooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the \ntime to make real the promises of democracy.''\n  Mr. President, let us make real the promises of democracy and of \nBrown--a nation with liberty, justice, and equality for all. Let's \nbegin that work in this Congress, in this body, and let's begin now.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5510-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5510-S5515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PELL GRANTS FOR KIDS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, a half century after Brown v. Board of \nEducation, education on equal terms still eludes too many African-\nAmerican schoolchildren. Secretary of Education Rod Paige has called \nAmerica's persistent racial achievement gap ``the civil rights issue of \nour time.''\n  By the 12th grade, only one in six Black students and one in five \nHispanic students are reading at their grade level. Math scores are \nequally as disturbing. Only 3 percent of Blacks and 4 percent of \nHispanics test at proficient levels by their senior year. By another \nstandard, about 60 percent of African-American children read at or \nbelow basic level at the end of the fourth grade while 75 percent of \nWhite students read at basic or above at the end of the fourth grade.\n  There is still a huge achievement gap among African-American children \nand White children. The No Child Left Behind Act's system of standards \nand accountability is creating a foundation for closing the gap. But \nfunding disparities between rich and poor--too often minority children \nattend poorer schools--school districts remain a stubborn contributor \nto inequality. Between 1996 and 2000, poor students fell further behind \ntheir wealthier peers in seven out of nine key indicators, including \nreading, math, and science.\n  These outcomes cry out for a different model, one that helps address \nfunding and equality without raising property taxes; that introduces \nentrepreneurship and choice into a system of monopolies; and that \noffers school districts more Federal dollars to implement the \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind with fewer strings--in other \nwords, more Federal dollars, fewer Federal strings, and more parental \nsay over how the Federal dollars are spent.\n  Does this sound too good to be true? I would suggest it is not. Look \nno further than our Nation's best-in-the-world higher educational \nsystem. There we find the Pell Grant Program, which has diversified and \nstrengthened America's colleges and universities by applying the \nprinciples of autonomy and competition. This year, $13 billion in Pell \ngrants and work study and $42 billion in student loans will follow \nAmerica's students to the colleges of their choice. This is in sharp \ncontrast to the local monopolies we have created in kindergarten \nthrough the 12th grade education, where dollars flow directly to \nschools with little or no say from parents.\n  That is why I have proposed Pell Grants for Kids, an annual $500 \nscholarship that would follow every middle- and low-income child to the \nschool or other accredited academic program of his or her parent's \nchoosing. These are new Federal dollars, so no district would see a cut \nin its share of Washington's $35 billion annual appropriations for K \nthrough 12, and increases in funding for students with disabilities \nwould continue. Armed with new purchasing power, parents could directly \nsupport their school's priorities, or they could pay for tutoring, for \nlessons and other services on the private market. Parents in affluent \nschool districts do this all the time. Pell Grants for Kids would give \nless wealthy families the same opportunities--an example of such a \nfamily are the Holidays in Nashville, TN.\n  Raymon Holiday is a sixth grader who recently won the American Lung \nAssociation of Tennessee's clean air poster contest. I was there when \nhe won the 10-speed bicycle you get for winning this poster \ncompetition. I met his father, an art major, and his grandfather, a \nretired art teacher. They told me his great-grandfather was a musician. \nSo you can see where Raymon Holiday gets his instincts. His \ngrandfather, the retired art teacher, lamented to me that art classes \nare usually the first to go when school budgets are cut. With Pell \nGrants for Kids, a typical middle school of 600 students where \nRaymon might be 1 of 500 middle- or low-income students who qualify to \nreceive a $500 Pell Grant. His middle school would see a $250,000 \nincrease in funding. Raymon would be assured of art lessons.\n\n  The Pell grant model also encourages great American entrepreneurship. \nEnterprising principals, like Raymon's principal, might design programs \nto attract parental investment: advanced math classes, writing \nworkshops, afterschool programs, English lessons--whatever is lacking \ndue to funding constraints.\n  Surveys continue to show that while Americans are concerned with the \nstate of public education, most support their own child's public \nschool.\n  Herman Smith, superintendent of schools in Bryan, TX, would welcome \nthe $6 million that would accompany 13,500 eligible Bryan students--90 \npercent of his district. Bryan is right next door to College Station, \nhome of Texas A where, according to Smith, their budget cuts are \nlarger than Bryan dreams of spending for new programs and personnel. \nProperty values there are double those in Bryan, as is the per-pupil \nexpenditure. Not surprisingly, Bryan's population is almost half \nAfrican American or Latino, while College Station is three-quarters \nwhite.\n  With 30 million American schoolchildren eligible for Pell Grants for \nKids, my fellow fiscal conservatives are probably raising an eyebrow. \nBut please listen. Every year, Congress appropriates increases in \nfunding for kindergarten through the 12th grade. What I am offering \nhere is a plan to earmark most of these new dollars--aside from \nincreases for spending for children with disabilities--for parents to \nspend on educational programs of their choice. Otherwise, we will \ncontinue to invest in the same bureaucracies that have disappointed \npoor and minority families for too long.\n  Pell Grants for Kids could be implemented gradually, starting with \nkindergarten and first grade at an initial\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\ncost of $2.5 billion. If the program had been in place during President \nBush's first 2 years in office, the extra $4.5 billion spent on K-\nthrough-12 education--again, not counting another $3 billion for \nchildren with disabilities--would have created $500 scholarships for \nall 9 million middle- and low-income students through the third grade.\n  We have had 50 years to deliver an American education on equal terms \nto all students. But a baffling commitment to the status quo has \nprevented us from living up to Brown's noble legacy. This anniversary \npresents the perfect opportunity to inaugurate a new era, one that uses \nthe strategy that helped to create the best colleges to help create the \nbest schools. Let us start with Pell Grants for Kids and move on from \nthere ``with all deliberate speed.''\n  I would like to make two or three additional remarks about Pell \nGrants for Kids.\n  As I mentioned, the idea is a pretty simple one--significantly new \nFederal dollars, fewer Federal strings, and more say by parents about \nhow the money is spent.\n  To give you an idea of how much money that would be, I have taken a \nquick look in my home State of Tennessee. Tennessee has 938,000 \nstudents in kindergarten through the 12th grade. Pell Grants for Kids \nwould be eligible to all those students who are from families below the \nstate median income. The state median income for a family of four in \nTennessee is about $56,000. So for families who have an income of \n$56,000 or below, each of their children would have a $500 scholarship \nthat would follow that child to the school or other approved academic \nprogram of their parents' choice. We estimate about 60 percent of all \nof Tennessee students would be eligible for a $500 Pell grant. In some \nof the rural counties where there are a great many poor children, it \nmight be 90 percent of the students. In other counties--Davidson, \nMaryville, Oak Ridge--it might be a smaller percentage.\n\n  But all in all, there should be about 562,000 students in Tennessee \nwho would be eligible. This would bring an additional $281 million to \nTennessee for K-12 education, and parents would have a say over how \nthat money is spent.\n  Often when this issue comes up and we talk about spending more \nFederal dollars for local schools, the Senators on my side of the aisle \nget a little hot under the collar. We do not want to spend any more \nFederal money for local schools. On the other hand, when we say let's \ngive the parents more say on how the money is spent, the collars get a \nlittle hot on the other side of the aisle because they are reluctant to \ngive parents more choice.\n  This is a conflict of principles. It is the principle of equal \nopportunity--giving parents more choices. But there is another valid \nprinciple on the other side. It is called E pluris unum. We have public \nschools, common schools, to teach our common culture, and we do not \nwant to harm them. It is a proper debate in this body to say let's ask \nquestions if we are giving parents more say, more choices. Will that \nharm our common schools? And there is a proper way to ask in this \nSenate: Can we wisely spend that much more money? This is quite a bit \nmore money. Fully funded Pell grants for kids programs would cost 15 \nbillion in new Federal dollars a year. It would add about $500 to the \n$600 we now spend on each of the children in America today from the \nFederal Government. Only about 7 or 8 percent of the dollars we spend \non children comes from the Federal Government. So it would be about a \n70-percent increase in Federal funding for every middle- or low-income \nchild fully funded.\n  We are proposing to do this over a long period of time. Basically, to \nadd to the new money that we would appropriate every year for K-12, and \ngive most of that to Pell grants for kids. This would create more \nequality in funding for poor districts. It would especially help \nAfrican-American and minority kids. It would provide extra dollars to \nimplement the standards of No Child Left Behind, and it would introduce \nfor the first time into our K-12 system the principle that has created \nthe best colleges in the world, the idea of letting money follow \nstudents to the institution of their choice.\n  Over the next several weeks, I will be discussing this with \nindividual Senators. I have not prepared a piece of legislation yet \nbecause I don't want to stand up and say: Here it is, take it or leave \nit. Let's say one team says no choice and one team says no money, then \nwe are back where we were. I am looking for ways to advance the debate. \nI don't believe we are going to be spending much more money through the \nFederal Government in the same way we are doing it today. A lot of \nSenators, and I am one of them, do not want to spend more Federal \ndollars through programs that have lots of Federal controls. We have \nseen the limit of command and control from Washington, DC, with No \nChild Left Behind. That program will work. But I don't believe we can \nexpect to give many more orders from Washington to make schools in \nSchenectady, Nashville, and Anniston, AL, and Sacramento, better. That \nhas to happen in local communities.\n  The right strategy is significantly new Federal dollars with fewer \nFederal strings and more parental say about how those dollars are \nspent. This does not have to be a Republican versus Democrat idea. I am \nnot the author of this idea.\n  In 1947, the GI bill for veterans was enacted. Since that time, \nFederal dollars have followed students to the colleges of their choice. \nToday, 60 percent of America's college students have a Federal grant or \nloan that follows them to the college of their choice.\n  When I was president of the University of Tennessee, it never \noccurred to me to say to the Congress: I hope you do not appropriate \nany money for children to go to Howard University or Notre Dame or \nBrigham Young or Vanderbilt or Morehouse or the University of Alabama. \nWe give people choices. Or put it another way, in my neck of the woods \nwe told everyone where they had to go to college. We said, Senator \nSessions, you have to go to the University of Tennessee. We said to \nyoung Lamar Alexander: You have to go to University of Alabama. Civil \nwars have been fought over such things.\n\n  That is exactly what we do in K-12. We give people choice and have \ncreated the best colleges in the world. We give them no choices and we \nhave schools that we wish were better. So the idea would be to try what \nworked for colleges here in K-12.\n  I said I was not the only one to think of this. There was the GI bill \nfor veterans--that was bipartisan--after World War II, maybe the best \npiece of social legislation we ever passed in the history of our \ncountry.\n  In 1968, Ted Sizer, perhaps the most renowned educator in America \ntoday, proposed a poor children's bill of rights, $5,000 for every poor \nchild to go to any school of their choice, an LBJ power-of-the-people, \nliberal, Democratic idea at the time. In 1970, President Nixon \nproposed, basically, giving grants to poor children to choose among all \nschools. The man who wrote that speech for President Nixon was a man \nnamed Pat Moynihan. He was a U.S. Senator. In 1979, he and Senator \nRibicoff, two Democrats, introduced essentially exactly the idea I am \nproposing today. In fact, in 1979 Senator Ribicoff and Senator Moynihan \nproposed amending the Federal Pell Grant Act and simply applying it to \nelementary and secondary students.\n  At that time, when the Pell grant was $200 to $1,800, a third grader \ncould get a Pell grant, or if you were a high school student and you \nwere poor, you could get a Pell grant.\n  Senator Moynihan said to this body in 1979:\n\n       Precisely the same reason ought to apply to elementary and \n     secondary schooling--if, that is, we are serious about \n     education and pluralism and providing educational choice to \n     low- and middle-income families similar to those routinely \n     available to upper income families.\n       This was the impulse behind the basic educational \n     opportunity grants program as enacted by Congress in 1972.\n\n  He was talking about Pell grants.\n\n       It was the impulse by the Presidential message to Congress \n     which I drafted in 1970 which proposed such a program. It is \n     the impulse to provide equality of educational opportunity to \n     every American, and it is as legitimate and important an \n     impulse at the primary and secondary school level as it is at \n     the college level.\n\n  I am going to strongly urge my colleagues not to make a reflexive \nreaction to this idea because, on the one hand, it has too much money, \nor on the other hand, it has some choice. Think back over our history \nand think of our\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nfuture and realize we have the best colleges and we do not have the \nbest schools. Why don't we use the formula that created the best \ncolleges to help create the best schools?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks Senator Moynihan's statement in the Senate in \n1980, and following Senator Moynihan's remarks, an article which I \nwrote for the publication Education Next, which is being published this \nweek, entitled ``Putting Parents in Charge.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. This article goes into some detail about the Pell \ngrants for kids proposal.\n  I look forward over the next several weeks to working with my \ncolleagues, accepting their ideas and suggestions about how we improve \nour schools.\n  In June sometime I hope to introduce a piece of legislation, \nhopefully with a bipartisan group of Senators. In July, Senator Gregg \nand I have already discussed a hearing which we will have in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. And then perhaps next \nyear, the President of the United States might want to make this a part \nof his budget.\n  I believe it is time in this country to recognize we need to give \npoor and middle-income parents more of the same choices of educational \nopportunities wealthier families have, that we may be able to do this \nwithout harming our public schools. We have had, since World War II, \nscholarships that have followed students to the educational \ninstitutions of their choice, and they have done nothing but help to \ncreate opportunity and create the best system of colleges and \nuniversities in the world. I think we ought to use the same idea to try \nto create the best schools in the world.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill \n     to make basic educational opportunity grants available to \n     needy elementary and secondary school students. This \n     complements the tuition tax credit bill that we recently \n     introduced and in no way substitutes for it. Just as I \n     believe that both need-based grant aid and tuition tax \n     credits should be available to assist with the costs of \n     college education, so also should the two alternatives be \n     available for needy students with tuition costs at the \n     elementary and secondary level.\n       As amended by the Middle Income Student Assistance Act of \n     1978, the basic grants program covers students from families \n     with income up to $25,000; the grants range from $200, for \n     students near the upper end of that scale, to $1,800 for \n     students from very low-income families. Many students are not \n     eligible for grant aid, and for them we have proposed tax \n     credits. Some students would be eligible for grant aid, and \n     they will presumably choose the one that suits them best. \n     This will not necessarily be the form that produces the most \n     assistance; for some, the simplicity of the tax credit may \n     make it more attractive than the complex forms required to \n     apply for a basic grant, particularly where the respective \n     amounts of aid are not much different. Others, particularly \n     the neediest, will plainly fare better under the grant \n     program. But there is no redundancy or overlap between the \n     two forms of aid: The tax credit would be available only for \n     tuition which the student or his family actually pays; \n     insofar as a basic grant (or other aid) covers tuition \n     expenses, those expenses would not be eligible for a tax \n     credit.\n       Precisely the same reasoning ought apply to elementary and \n     secondary schooling--if, that is, we are serious about \n     educational pluralism and about providing educational choices \n     to low- and middle-income families that are similar to those \n     routinely available to upper income families.\n       This was the impulse behind the basic educational \n     opportunity grants program as enacted by Congress in 1972. It \n     was the impulse behind the Presidential message to Congress \n     that I drafted in 1970 which proposed such a program. It is \n     the impulse to provide equality of educational opportunity to \n     every American, and it is as legitimate and important an \n     impulse at the primary and secondary school level as it is at \n     the college level.\n       The basic grants program, and the other major student aid \n     programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education \n     Act, will expire during the 96th Congress, and one of our \n     important responsibilities in the next 18 months is to reform \n     and extend them. I shall have more to say on that subject on \n     other occasions. But it is none too early to introduce the \n     idea that one reform that must be seriously considered is the \n     inclusion of needy elementary and secondary school students.\n       It will doubtless be argued by some that this legislation \n     is unconstitutional, inasmuch as many students with tuition \n     costs at the elementary and secondary level are enrolled in \n     church-related schools. I see no distinction of \n     constitutional significance between the aid we already \n     provide to students in church-related colleges and that which \n     I propose to provide at the primary and secondary level, but \n     I do not assert that the Supreme Court will necessarily agree \n     with me. As with tuition tax credits, however, this question \n     can only be resolved by the Supreme Court, and that can only \n     happen if the authorizing legislation is passed by the \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Education Next, Summer, 2004]\n\n                       Putting Parents in Charge\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       In 1990, as the new president of the University of \n     Tennessee, I was trying to understand what had made American \n     colleges and universities the best in the world. I asked \n     David Gardner, then the president of the University of \n     California, why his university has such a tradition of \n     excellence. ``First, '' he said, ``autonomy.'' The California \n     constitution created four branches of government, with the \n     university being the fourth. The legislature basically turns \n     over money to us without many rules about how to spend it.\n       ``The second is excellence. We were fortunate, at our \n     beginning, to have a corps of faculty dedicated to high \n     standards. That tradition has continued. And third, generous \n     amounts of federal--and state--money have followed students \n     to the schools of their choice. That has increased \n     opportunity for those who couldn't afford college, created \n     choices that made good fits between the student and the \n     school, and stimulated competition that encouraged excellent \n     programs.''\n       Autonomy. High standards. Government dollars following \n     students to the schools of their choice. That was the formula \n     for the GI Bill, passed by Congress in 1944. The program gave \n     World War II veterans scholarships redeemable at any \n     accredited institution, public or private. Those veterans who \n     didn't hold a diploma could even use the scholarships at \n     Catholic high schools. With these scholarships came few \n     federal rules, thus preserving the universities' autonomy. \n     And by allowing students to choose their college, the GI Bill \n     encouraged excellence and discouraged weak programs.\n       Not all university leaders welcomed the program. ``It will \n     crate a hobo's jungle,'' warned legendary University of \n     Chicago president Robert Hutchins. Instead, the GI Bill \n     became the most successful piece of social legislation \n     Congress ever enacted. It became the model for the federal \n     grants and loans that today follow 58 percent of America's \n     college students to the schools of their choice. In 1972, \n     when Congress debated whether future federal funding for \n     higher education should go directly to institutions or be \n     channeled through students, the model of the GI Bill helped \n     carry the day for the latter approach, which was surely the \n     right one. Pell Grants (named for Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-\n     R.I.), Stafford Loans, and other forms of financial \n     assistance to students followed. This year the federal \n     government will spend nearly $17 billion on grants and work-\n     study programs and will provide an additional $52 billion in \n     student loans.\n       Rarely has the federal taxpayer gotten so much bang for the \n     buck. These federal vouchers trained the ``greatest \n     generation'' and made it possible for a greater percentage of \n     Americans to continue into higher education than in any other \n     country. At the time of the GI Bill's passage in 1944, only \n     about 6 percent of Americans held a four-year college degree. \n     Today that figure stands at 26 percent.\n       Moreover, these scholarships have strengthened public \n     institutions. At the end of World War II, 50 percent of \n     American college students were attending public institutions. \n     Today 76 percent choose to attend public colleges and \n     universities. So many foreign students want to attend \n     American university that some institutions impose caps in \n     order to make room for lower-achieving homegrown students. \n     British prime minister Tony Blair is overhauling his nation's \n     system of higher education because he sees a growing gap \n     between the quality of American and British universities. \n     Likewise, former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique \n     Cardoso recently told a small group of U.S. senators that \n     the most important thing he would remember about his \n     residency at the Library of Congress is ``the uniqueness, \n     strength, and autonomy of the American university.''\n       Meanwhile, federal support for elementary and secondary \n     education has taken just the opposite approach--with opposite \n     results. Instead of allowing tax dollars to follow students \n     to the schools of their parents' choice, the federal \n     government gives $35 billion directly to the schools \n     themselves (or to the states, which then give it to schools). \n     In addition, thousands of pages of federal and state \n     regulations govern how these funds are spent, thereby \n     diminishing each school's autonomy. Measured by student \n     learning, rarely has the taxpayer gotten so little bang for \n     so many bucks. In 1999, 8th-grade students in this country \n     were ranked 19th in math and 18th in science compared with 38 \n     other industrialized nations. The National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress, known as the nation's report card, \n     shows other alarming trends. For example, between 1996 and \n     2000, the gap between affluent and poorer U.S. students \n     actually widened in seven out of nine key indicators--like \n     reading, math, and science. Two out of every three African-\n     American and Hispanic 4th graders could barely read. Seventy \n     percent of children in\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\n     high-poverty schools scored below even the most basic level \n     of reading.\n\n\n                        enhancing local control\n\n       It is time to try a different funding approach, and Pell \n     Grants, the college scholarships offered to low-income \n     students, provide a useful model. Congress should enact \n     ``Pell Grants for Kids,'' which would provide a $500 \n     scholarship to each middle- and low-income child in America. \n     Children could use these scholarships at any public or \n     private school or for any educational program, such as \n     private tutoring. Homeschooled children would also be \n     eligible for the scholarship, as long as the money was spent \n     on an accredited educational program. Overall, the grant \n     would be available to about 60 percent of America's 50 \n     million primary and secondary school students, those whose \n     families earn $53,000 or less. It would put the parents of \n     approximately 30 million children directly into the education \n     marketplace, each of them armed with a $500 grant, thereby \n     encouraging choice and competition.\n       This idea has a distinguished lineage. In the late 1960s, \n     Theodore Sizer, then at the Harvard Graduate School of \n     Education, proposed a ``Poor Children's Bill of Rights'' that \n     would have supplied scholarships of $5,000 per child to the \n     poorest half of children in the United States, for use at any \n     accredited school, public or private. In 1992, while I was \n     serving as secretary of education under President George H.W. \n     Bush, the president asked Congress to appropriate a half \n     billion dollars to create a pilot ``GI Bill for Kids.'' The \n     program would have awarded $1,000 scholarships to 500,000 \n     children in states and cities that wanted to try the idea, \n     but the Democrat-controlled Congress refused to enact it.\n       The most important point to make here is that most of this \n     new scholarship money is likely to be used at the public \n     schools that nine out of ten students now attend. I believe \n     parents are likely either to give the money to their school \n     to meet its general needs or to seek the school's advice on \n     how best to spend the money to help their child. Surveys show \n     that while many Americans are discouraged about the state of \n     education generally, most parents support their own child's \n     public school. Parents in affluent school districts regularly \n     augment their schools' budgets with contributions for extra \n     programs, particularly in the arts. Pell Grants for Kids \n     would give children of low- and middle-income parents the \n     same opportunity.\n       Pell Grants for Kids would provide more federal dollars for \n     schools while also encouraging more local control--I mean \n     more control by parents and teachers--over how that money is \n     spent. Once parents make the decision about where the $500 \n     will be spent, the principal and teachers in that school or \n     program decide how it will be spent. For example, in a public \n     middle school with 600 students, if two-thirds of the \n     children are eligible for the grant, that's $200,000 in new \n     federal dollars each year following those children to that \n     school. This would be manna from heaven for schools, many of \n     which engage in time-consuming charity sales to net $500 or \n     $1,000 for needed programs and projects. Enterprising \n     principals surely would design programs to attract parents' \n     investment--perhaps an after-school program, an extra math \n     teacher, or an intensive language course. And if they didn't, \n     parents would have the option to spend the money on another \n     accredited educational program that suited their child's \n     needs, such as tutoring.\n       Aside from stimulating competition, these new federal funds \n     would help to narrow the gaps in spending between wealthy and \n     poor districts and make more real the promise that no child \n     will be left behind. For example, in Bryan, Texas, property \n     values average about $128,000 per student. Next door is \n     College Station, home of Texas A University, where property \n     values are $305,000 per student. As a result, College Station \n     is able to collect far more in property taxes and its schools \n     thus spend twice as much per student as those in Bryan. Last \n     year Herman Smith, superintendent of schools in Bryan, told \n     me, ``College Station is talking about cuts in programs and \n     personnel that we could only dream of.''\n       About 90 percent of Bryan's 13,500 students would be \n     eligible for the $500 Pell Grants for Kids, putting more than \n     $6 million in new federal dollars into the hands of Bryan \n     parents. They could then provide more funds to Bryan's public \n     schools, as is likely, or use the scholarship to help pay for \n     enrichment programs or private school tuition. Bryan would \n     still have fewer dollars to spend than College Station, but \n     the gap would narrow.\n\n\n                         overcoming objections\n\n       Let's consider some questions and criticisms that might \n     accompany the Pell Grant for Kids proposal:\n       In a time of tight budgets, can the nation afford to offer \n     $500 scholarships to 30 million schoolchildren? If it were \n     enacted today, Pell Grants for Kids would cost $15 billion a \n     year. A number of measures could be taken to ease the burden. \n     First, implement the program gradually, providing $500 \n     scholarships only to kindergarten and 1st graders in the \n     initial year. This would cost just $2 billion. Second, over \n     the next several years, devote most of the new appropriations \n     for K-12 education (not related to children with \n     disabilities) to Pell Grants for Kids. Done this way, it \n     would not take many years to fully fund the scholarships \n     while staying within a reasonable budget. For instance, if \n     Congress had allocated two-thirds of all new federal spending \n     (non-disability related) on K-12 education since 1992 to this \n     program, $10 billion would have been available for \n     scholarships this year--enough to provide full $500 \n     scholarships to all middle- and low-income children in \n     kindergarten through the 8th grade.\n       Or consider this: In just the first two years of the \n     current administration, Congress appropriated $4.5 billion in \n     new dollars for K-12 education (not counting another $3 \n     billion more for children with disabilities). That $4.5 \n     billion would have been enough to fully fund $500 \n     scholarships for all nine million low- and middle-income \n     children in kindergarten through 3rd grade.\n       Aren't K-12 schools and colleges so different that the Pell \n     Grant analogy is invalid? It is true that schools and \n     colleges sometimes emphasize different public purposes. For \n     example, schools are asked to teach children what it means to \n     be an American, to inculcate moral values, and to make up for \n     poor parenting. Universities have research and public service \n     missions that schools don't share. But the core mission of \n     both schools and colleges is the same: teaching and learning. \n     Most high schools teach some college courses. Most community \n     colleges teach some high-school students. That is why it is \n     so odd that the way the federal government funds K-12 \n     education is so different from the way it funds colleges.\n       Aren't you overlooking some real problems that colleges \n     have? No doubt universities have significant problems. Some \n     college students don't pay back their loans. Some for-profit \n     institutions are shams. Some courses are weird. Some tenured \n     faculty members are worthless. In the context of rising \n     tuition costs, there is too little interest in creating a \n     less leisurely university calendar, in proposals such as \n     requiring professors to work over the summer. Such abuses are \n     the price of institutional autonomy and choice. Overall, \n     however, American colleges and universities are by far the \n     best in the world--and therefore useful models for how to \n     improve our other educational institutions.\n       Can we trust middle- and low-income parents to spend $500 \n     wisely on their child's education? I would remind those who \n     make this condescending argument that Congress currently \n     appropriates $8 billion each year to provide childcare \n     vouchers to 2.3 million low-income parents. These parents may \n     use the voucher at any licensed center, public, private, or \n     religious. Likewise, 9.5 million low-income students may \n     spend their federal student aid dollars at any accredited \n     college. If Congress trusts low-income citizens to choose \n     childcare and higher education providers for themselves, why \n     not trust them to spend $500 on K-12 education programming \n     for their children? In addition, because of our experience \n     using established accrediting agencies to monitor Pell Grants \n     for colleges, it should be relatively easy to create a \n     similar system to make sure that Pell Grants for Kids are not \n     spent on fly-by-night operations.\n       Will more federal funding mean more federal control over \n     education? Pell Grants for Kids would actually reduce federal \n     control over education. The current funding process \n     dictates how federal dollars are to be spent and imposes \n     heavy regulations on local schools. Letting federal \n     dollars follow children to the school of their parents' \n     choice would put control back into the hands of parents \n     and teachers.\n       Would Pell Grants for Kids violate the principle of \n     separation of church and state? Federal grants have followed \n     students to parochial colleges since World War II and to \n     parochial daycare centers since 1990.\n       Will giving individual schools so much autonomy leave some \n     mired in mediocrity? Autonomy need not mean a lack of \n     accountability. The No Child Left Behind Act requires states \n     to establish tough academic standards and to measure \n     students' and schools' performance on an annual basis. With \n     these accountability systems in place, the argument for \n     choice is that much stronger. Parents will have the knowledge \n     of school performance to make informed choices about where to \n     spend their new federal dollars. For this reason, students \n     who decide to use their $500 scholarships at private schools \n     would still be required to participate in their state's \n     testing program.\n       Why not let all Title I money follow children to the \n     schools of their choice? For now, I believe a gradual \n     approach is warranted. The nation should begin by letting \n     parents control how most, not all, of newly appropriated \n     federal dollars for K-12 education are spent. Let's monitor \n     parents' spending patterns and school performance for a while \n     and then evaluate whether to expand the program.\n       But private school tuition costs far more than $500. \n     Correct. So those who worry that vouchers will hurt public \n     schools should relax. But six hundred parents armed with $500 \n     each can exercise $300,000 in consumer power at a public \n     middle school. Five hundred dollars can also help pay for \n     language lessons or remedial help. At Puente Learning Center \n     in South Los Angeles, Sister Jennie Lechtenberg teaches \n     students of all ages English and clerical skills at an \n     average cost to the center of $500 per year.\n\n\n                         toward better schools\n\n       Of course by themselves Pell Grants for Kids would not \n     create the best schools in the world. As David Gardner said, \n     it took autonomy and high standards in addition to generous \n     funding following students to schools of their choice to help \n     create the finest university system in the world. To increase \n     schools' autonomy, Congress should provide generous support \n     to the charter school movement, offer waivers from federal \n     rules to successful school districts, and use its \n     oversight power to simplify federal laws and regulations. \n     To help schools aspire to the excellence most colleges \n     enjoy, Congress needs to give schools more flexibility in \n     administering the mandates of No Child Left Behind. To \n     make it easier for schools to pay teachers more for \n     teaching well, just as colleges do, Congress should \n     encourage the National Board for Professional Teaching \n     Standards and other efforts to reward outstanding \n     teachers. These organizations, in turn, must make the \n     measure of students' progress a key ingredient in a \n     teacher's evaluation.\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\n       It is a mistake to expect that merely switching to the \n     higher education model for funding is all Congress needs to \n     do to help transform public schools. To help children arrive \n     at school ready to learn, Congress should heed President \n     Bush's challenge to strengthen Head Start by improving \n     coordination, emphasizing cognitive skills, increasing \n     accountability, and involving governors. So that state and \n     local governments can remain financially sound enough to \n     support good schools, Congress should keep its promise to end \n     unfunded federal mandates. So that children can learn what it \n     means to be an American, Congress should help states put the \n     teaching of American history and civics back in its rightful \n     place in school curricula.\n       Finally, no plan for better schools is complete without \n     better parenting. In his research James Coleman found that, \n     until a child is 14, parents are twice as important as school \n     for the child's learning. Yet the United States has gone from \n     a society that values the job of being a parent to one that \n     has been waging a war on parents. Liberal divorce laws and \n     the diminished importance of marriage, higher taxes, poor \n     schools, trash on television, unsafe streets, uncontrolled \n     illegal drugs, and inflexible work arrangements have all made \n     it harder for parents raising children. No part of American \n     society has paid a higher price for this than our schools. \n     Giving every middle- and low-income child a $500 scholarship \n     to help encourage choice within education is a start, but \n     only a start, toward putting government and society squarely \n     on the side of parents raising children.\n       Nonetheless, enacting Pell Grants for Kids should be the \n     next central thrust of federal efforts to improve the \n     nation's schools. For the past half century, the United \n     States has actively supported the expansion and improvement \n     of higher education through a generous funding system that \n     encourages autonomy, choice, and competition. Our \n     institutions of higher education have helped produce the \n     research that has been responsible for creating half our new \n     jobs since World War II. They have sculpted an educated \n     leadership and citizenry that have made our democracy work \n     and made it possible to defend our freedoms. It is past time \n     to take the formula that has worked so well to help create \n     the best colleges in the world and use it to help create the \n     best schools for our children.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nAlexander of Tennessee for his wise remarks. Listening to the Senator, \nit reminded me of that advertisement: When E.F. Hutton speaks, you \nshould listen. When Senator Alexander talks on education, we ought to \nlisten, and, indeed, when he speaks on a lot of subjects. He has served \nas Secretary of Education for the United States. He has been the \npresident of the University of Tennessee. He has also been the Governor \nof Tennessee who had to run their school systems. He brings tremendous \nwisdom and experience and insight to this issue.\n  It must be our goal to improve the quality of education for children \nin America today. We have to work on that issue. We are not where we \nought to be. There is too much inequality today.\n  I also think about Brown v. Board of Education, as we celebrate that \nhistoric decision today, and that Senator Alexander clerked for Judge \nJohn Minor Wisdom, one of the judges who is famous in the old Fifth \nCircuit for enforcing Brown v. Board of Education.\n  Brown v. Board of Education had more impact than most decisions have \never had from the Supreme Court. As a young student in school, I rode a \nbus every day 15 miles to school. As we went north on the road to my \nschool, we would pass a bus with African American children heading \nsouth. So the white kids went to the school up in the northern end of \ntown, and we would pass one another. I went further than I should have \ntraveled to get to school, and they went further than they should have \ntraveled to get to their school.\n  In addition, the schools of the African-American community were not \nas good, and their schoolbuses were not as good, for the most part, \neither. It was not an equal system.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States considered the issue in 1954, \nand they evaluated what was happening. They said the laws of the United \nStates should treat people equally, and that it is not equal treatment \nto say to a person: You cannot go to this school, although you may live \nquite close to it, simply because of the color of your skin. We had \ngrown up with that situation. People did not give it much thought. They \naccepted it as the way things were. The Supreme Court ruled \ndifferently, and people complained about it. Some even said it was \nactivism and the Supreme Court was overreaching. But if you read the \nConstitution and the law, it seems to me the Supreme Court at that \npoint was not an activist court, it was not an overreaching court; it \nwas a court founded on law, and they went back and read the plain \nlanguage of the Constitution, and they said this process of denying one \nperson the right to attend a school simply because of the color of \ntheir skin violated our Constitution. I think that was a plain ruling, \na fair ruling, and a good ruling.\n  I know we are about to take up the defense bill in a few minutes, but \nI would say this: Things have changed in many different ways. My two \ndaughters grew up in Mobile, AL, not too far from Murphy High School. \nMurphy is one of the oldest, largest schools in Mobile. The Mobile \nCounty school system is a very large system. I believe they have 60,000 \nstudents. It is a great historic school. Fifty years ago, it was an \nall-white school. There were all-African-American schools in the \ncommunity. They have, as a result of Brown, integrated the school \nsystem. My daughters went to that school, and the racial mix was almost \nexactly 50-50. They enjoyed their time at Murphy High School. It is an \nexcellent high school. In fact, I remember Secretary Bill Bennett, when \nhe was Secretary of Education, came down and gave them a blue-ribbon, \ntopflight national school award for the excellence in education there. \nThey loved that school. They had friends who were White, friends \nwho were African American, friends who were Asian, and friends who were \nfrom India. They were all in that school system. They benefited from \nthat experience and did well as a result of it.\n\n  I believe the decision was beneficial legally. I believe the decision \nwas beneficial for the children. It made a statement, with crystal \nclarity, that people could not be denied the right to public activities \nsimply because of the color of their skin.\n  That is an important principle in this country. We were very slow to \nrecognize it. The South was openly segregated in so many different \nways, and this decision broke it down. It took many years before the \ndecision would be fully implemented, but it has been implemented, and \nmuch good has come from it.\n  President Bush has said in his philosophy of education that we must \nnot let children fall behind. He has used the phrase ``the soft bigotry \nof low expectations.'' What he means is, if our children are going to a \npublic school that is doing pretty well, and they are doing fine, and \nminority students are going to a school that is not doing so well, we \nshould not have the attitude, well, we are not too concerned about \nthat.\n  In fact, more dangerous than that is a philosophy that we have low \nexpectations, and we are not going to demand the same quality in all \nschool systems in America. That is not acceptable. Our children can \nlearn. All children of all races can learn. We need to challenge all \nstudents to be their very best. We cannot allow children to fall \nbehind. We need to identify children who are falling behind early.\n  If you love children, if you care about the poor, if you care about \nminority students, and you want them to succeed, you will find out how \nthey are doing. That is why the President said we want to test. The \nGovernment plan of No Child Left Behind is not to test to punish or to \nput down a child; it is to find out how they are doing in school. If \nthey are falling behind, we need to intervene promptly and quickly to \nlift them up so they can reach their fullest potential.\n  Secretary Rod Paige, our Secretary of Education today, is an \nexperienced educator who was the dean of a school and was the \nsuperintendent of the huge school system in Houston, TX--he has said by \nthe time children get to the ninth grade, if they are not up to speed, \nif they are substantially behind in reading and math and cannot \ncompete, that is when they drop out.\n  So the President's legislation--what we worked on--is designed to \nfind out much earlier if children are falling behind, to give them that \nintensive support and extra resources necessary to have them catch up \nso they will no longer be behind, so when they get to the 8th grade, \nthe 9th grade, or the 10th grade, they will be able to function and do \nhigh school work and go on and\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\ncomplete their degree and be successful in the world rather than \nbecoming frustrated or becoming a discipline problem, and maybe even \ndropping out of school because they know they are so far behind they \ncannot keep up.\n  That is what we focused on when we crafted the No Child Left Behind \nAct. That is ultimately one of the keys to American movement in this \nnew century; and that is, are our children reaching their highest \npossible level of achievement. The more children who achieve their \nhighest and greatest potential, the greater the benefit will be for our \ncountry.\n  I see my time is up. We are about ready to go to the defense bill. I \nagain express my appreciation to Senator Alexander for his insights and \ncommitment to education. There is much we can do to make our system \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Wilson.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my privilege to again address the \nSenate on this bill, which I commend the Committee on the Armed \nServices for marking up in a record period of time. I first wish to \nthank my distinguished colleague, these now 26 years working together, \nthe senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and his staff who worked \nvery diligently, such that the two of us together, with the tremendous \nsupport of each and every member of the Armed Services Committee, were \nable to proceed through the year with our series of hearings and to do \na very thorough and expeditious markup.\n  So we bring to the floor the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2005 for the Senate's consideration. This bill was \nunanimously reported out of committee on May 6. I believe it is a \ntestament to the strong support of our men and women in uniform by the \nSenate if adopted.\n  As we begin debate on this bill today, over 300,000 soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines, Active and Reserve, and countless \ncivilians are serving bravely around the world, including the Persian \nGulf region, Iraq, and Afghanistan, in the cause of freedom. All \nAmericans are proud of what the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition \npartners have accomplished thus far in Iraq and in the global war on \nterrorism. We are ever mindful that the defense of our homeland begins \non the distant battlefields of the world.\n  As we begin this debate, we must pause to remember that military \nsuccess is not achieved without significant sacrifice. We, the members \nof the committee--indeed, all Members of the Senate--extend our \nsympathies to the families and the loved ones of those who sacrificed \ntheir lives or were injured in operations to make America and the world \nsafer. We will forever honor their service.\n  The military successes in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \nIraqi Freedom are a testament to the dedication and professionalism of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces and to the support and sacrifice of their \nfamilies. It is also a tribute to American technology and ingenuity. \nThe U.S. military is the most capable military force in the world \ntoday, a model of excellence, and the standard by which others are to \nbe measured.\n  As I have said repeatedly over the past few weeks, the horrific \nevidence of abuse of Iraqi prisoners perpetrated by a small number--and \nI repeat, thus far to the comparison of the totality of our Armed \nForces, a very small number of our Armed Forces--together with a number \nof civilian contractors, is an aberration, a total departure from the \nhigh standards and the professionalism that we have in our U.S. \nmilitary. That series of incidents must never be permitted to happen \nagain.\n  I am very proud of what the Committee on the Armed Services has done \nthus far by way of its oversight responsibilities of this tragic \nsituation, and we will continue, in consultation with my distinguished \nranking member and all the members of the committee, to pursue the \nfacts.\n  These incidents are counter to every human value that every American \nhas been taught. It is counter to what this country stands for, and it \nis counter to what the U.S. Armed Forces are fighting to protect. These \nacts of a few in some respect diminish us all. Nonetheless, we must not \npermit these acts to tarnish the honor of the many dedicated men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, the 99.99 percent who are vigilantly \nupholding the values for which this country stands, and who are doing a \ngreat mission, wherever it is in the world, often at high personal \nrisk.\n\n  With Senate passage of the bill before us, we have the opportunity to \nsend a strong message of support to our men and women in uniform. The \nbill contains much deserved pay raises and benefits for our military \npersonnel and their families, much needed increases in family housing, \nand quality-of-life projects on military installations, as well as \nprudent investments in the equipment and technology our military needs \nto address future threats. I urge my colleagues to debate this bill in \na constructive spirit and to support its rapid adoption.\n  The President's budget for defense for fiscal year 2005 continues a \nmomentum of recent years in providing real increases in defense \nspending to combat terrorism and secure the homeland, to enhance the \nquality of life of our military personnel and their families, and to \nmodernize and transform the U.S. Armed Forces to meet current and \nfuture threats.\n  The bill before us provides $422.2 billion for the Department of \nDefense and the defense programs of the Department of Energy, an \nincrease of $20.9 billion, or 3.4 percent in real terms, over the \namount authorized in fiscal year 2004.\n  This bill reflects six priorities we established to guide our work on \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005.\n  First, our committee wanted to provide our men and women in uniform \nwith the resources, training, and technology and equipment they need.\n  Second, enhance stability of the Department of Defense to fulfill its \nhomeland defense responsibilities.\n  Third, continue to improve the quality of life for the men and women \nof the Armed Forces--Active, Reserve, Guard, and Retired--and their \nfamilies.\n  May I say at this point, having had many an association with the \nArmed Forces--and I use that term collectively to include the Guard and \nReserve--they have performed magnificently, the Guard and Reserve, and\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\nhave earned the respect of the regular forces who look upon them now as \ncoequal partners.\n  Fourth, sustain the readiness of our Armed Forces to conduct a full \nspectrum of military operations against current and anticipated \nthreats.\n  Fifth, support efforts to develop the innovative capabilities \nnecessary to modernize and transform the Armed Forces.\n  And sixth, continue active oversight of Department programs and \noperations, particularly in the areas of acquisition reform and \ncontract management, to ensure proper stewardship of the taxpayers' \nhard-earned dollars.\n  The committee's first priority was to provide the Department of \nDefense with the resources it needs to combat terrorism and win the war \non global terrorism. This bill authorizes a temporary increase in the \nactive-duty end strength of the Army of up to 30,000 soldiers from the \n2005 through 2009 fiscal years. This authorization is consistent with \nthe manpower plans of the Army.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes an increase of almost $1.2 billion \nover the budget request for programs to help our troops in the field. \nFunding highlights include, for the Army: $1.2 billion for helicopters \nto support Army aviation and modernization, in order to get needed \nairlift and attack helicopters to troops in the field; $272.2 million \nfor aircraft survivability equipment to ensure all aircraft used in \ncombat operations have the best possible protection; $905 million to \ncontinue procuring the Stryker armored vehicles that are already \nproving valuable in military operations in Iraq; and almost $1.1 \nbillion for up-armored HMMWVs, including an increase of $925 million to \naccelerate procurement of up-armored HMMWVs, as well as add-on \nballistic armor for medium and heavy trucks, to protect our troops on \npatrol in hostile environments.\n  To improve the ability of special operations forces, a major \ncomponent of the war on terror, the bill authorizes an increase of \n$65.4 million above the President's budget request to accelerate the \navailability of important new capabilities.\n  For naval forces, the bill authorizes an increase of $150 million to \naccelerate fielding of an amphibious assault ship that will greatly \nimprove the mobility and lethality of the U.S. Marine Corps operations, \nincreases the amount requested for amphibious assault vehicles by $23.2 \nmillion, and it adds almost $50 million for personal protection \nequipment for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines.\n  Overall, the bill adds over $600 million for force protection gear \nand combat clothing, such as improved body armor, to meet urgent \nrequirements of the Armed Forces. The committee fully supports the \nbudget request of $2.9 billion for C-17 new aircraft, to add to the \nexisting fleet which is performing magnificently all over the world. \nThis will improve the global mobility of our U.S. forces.\n  To enhance the Department's homeland defense capabilities, the bill \nfully supports the President's budget request of $8 billion and \nauthorizes an additional $46.9 million for seven additional weapons of \nmass destruction civil support teams. With this increase, the committee \nhas reached the goal of funding 55 teams which will support local and \nregional first responders in every State and territory of the United \nStates. May I add, our committee has had a long history of strong \nsupport for this program and increases the budget amounts each of the \nfiscal years to make certain that all 50 States are given this \ncapability.\n  In addition, the committee has added an additional $33.9 million for \ninnovative technologies to combat terrorism and defeat emerging \nasymmetric threats, and $26.5 million for the development of chemical \nand biological agent detection and protection technologies. To protect \nAmerica from ballistic missile threats, the bill authorizes $10.2 \nbillion for missile defense.\n  This bill continues our commitment to improve the quality of life of \nour men and women in uniform, and their families, by authorizing a 3.5-\npercent across-the-board pay raise for all uniformed service personnel, \nas well as increases in housing allowances that will eliminate average \nout-of-pocket expenses for off-base housing for service members. The \nbill authorizes a permanent increase in the monthly family separation \nallowance from $100 per month to $250 per month, and a permanent \nincrease, from $150 a month to $225 a month, for special pay for duty \nsubject to hostile fires or imminent danger. The bill also supports the \ninitiatives taken by the Department to increase the pay of troops whose \ntours of duty have been extended for more than 12 months in the Iraq \ntheater.\n\n  In a significant health care initiative for members of the Reserves \nand National Guard, this bill authorizes permanent increases in \ncoverage before and after mobilization, and a new health care option \nwhich would make TRICARE coverage available to all members of the \nSelect Reserve and their families, in an affordable way. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this innovative approach to enhancing health care \nbenefits for members of the Reserve and National Guard and their \nfamilies.\n  The administration requested $9.4 billion for military construction \nand family housing. The bill before the Senate includes an overall \nincrease of $342.4 million in military construction, including \nincreases of more than $100 million in critical unfunded projects \nidentified by the military services, and an additional $172 million to \nfund improvements to the facilities supporting our National Guard and \nReserve Forces.\n  Over the past several years, the Armed Services Committee has worked \nwith the Department of Defense to ensure that necessary modernization, \ntransformation, and long-range research are maintained, even in times \nof high operational tempo.\n  This bill continues support for these transformational activities, \nfor example, by authorizing $131.1 million for tactical UAVs that have \nproven so valuable in recent military operations, an increase to $30.6 \nmillion above the budget request; and more than $11 billion for \ncutting-edge science and technology programs, an increase of $445 \nmillion above the budget request. These increases are in the critical \nareas of force protection equipment and devices, counterterrorism \ntechnologies, information assurance unmanned systems, and training \ninnovations for the future defense force.\n  With our Armed Forces deployed on distant battlefields and countless \nothers standing watch at home, we are committed to providing the \nresources needed for the men and women of the Armed Forces, and their \nfamilies. The Congress's past support for increased defense spending \nhas proven to be a wise investment. There is no greater evidence than \nthe successes witnessed on the battlefields, where the courage of our \nmen and women are displayed in Afghanistan and Iraq, and elsewhere in \nthe world.\n  This National Defense Authorization Act for the year 2005 builds on \nthe advances made in recent years. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nsend a strong message of bipartisan support for our troops at home and \nabroad. We honor your service. We stand with you now and we will stand \nwith you always in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join with our chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Mr. Warner, in bringing S. 2400, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 to the Senate floor. \nThis bill is the product of 45 hearings, 3 days of markup, and \ncountless hours of hard work by the members and the staff of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Throughout this process, Senator Warner has led the committee with \nhis usual fairness and graciousness. There was a unanimous vote of our \nmembers in support of this bill, which is a tribute to the able \nleadership of my dear friend and the balanced approach which Senator \nWarner takes always in matters under consideration by our committee. He \nchairs this committee in the finest tradition of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and I commend him for it. I wish every Senator \ncould see him in action as he chairs our committee.\n  Senator Warner has balanced the committee's legislative and oversight \nresponsibilities over the last several weeks so there has been an \nadditional challenge that Senator Warner has had to face as we have \nworked to report out this bill while at the same\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\ntime beginning vital oversight over the abuses of Iraqi detainees at \nAbu Ghraib prison. Without delaying the markup schedule, Senator Warner \npromptly scheduled a series of briefings and hearings on the prison \nabuse issue, with more to come. That means more work for all of us, for \nour staff, but it was the right and the necessary thing to do.\n  Senator Warner has an equal determination, which I join, to have a \ncomprehensive and prompt, hopefully, series of hearings into all \naspects of this issue.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee will promote \nthe national defense, improve the quality of life of our men and women \nin uniform, and make the investments we need to meet the challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation and quality of life that our service men and women and \ntheir families deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world. For instance, the bill authorizes \na 3.5-percent increase across the board for military personnel in terms \nof their pay, and it authorizes a permanent increase in the rate of \nspecial pay for duties subject to hostile fire and imminent danger. We \nauthorize a permanent increase in the rate of family separation \nallowance.\n  The bill authorizes a new benefit option under TRICARE which makes \navailable for the first time an opportunity for all members of the \nselected Reserve and their families to participate in TRICARE. The bill \nauthorizes an increase of $400 million over the President's budget \nrequest for enhanced health benefits for reservists.\n  Second, the bill would make key investments that are needed to help \naddress the challenges our military faces today and will continue to \nface in the future. I am particularly pleased that the bill would add \n$900 million to the President's budget to fund additional up-armored \nHumvees and add-on ballistic protection to provide force protection for \nour soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill adds $600 million to the \nPresident's budget for additional force protection gear and combat \nclothing for service members. Our bill adds $450 million to the \nPresident's budget for advanced research that will help enhance force \nprotection, combat terrorism, and counter the threat of proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. The bill adds $47 million to the \nPresident's budget to field an additional seven weapons of mass \ndestruction civil support teams, which fulfills a requirement \nestablished in last year's bill.\n  Third, our bill contains a number of important provisions designed to \nimprove the efficiency and the transparency of the operation of the \nDepartment of Defense. For instance, the bill would direct the \nSecretary of Defense to develop comprehensive DOD policy and procedures \nfor the prevention of and response to incidents of sexual assault \ninvolving military members. The bill requires the Secretary to take \nspecific steps to improve the management and oversight of contractors \nperforming security, intelligence, law enforcement, and criminal \njustice functions in Iraq and other areas where U.S. forces are engaged \nin military operations. The bill establishes a commission on the \nNational Guard and Reserve which will study the roles and missions of \nthe Reserve components, and the bill strengthens the framework for \noversight for addressing the Department's continuing financial \nmanagement problems.\n  Finally, the bill before us appropriately does not include two \nparticularly troublesome legislative proposals. It does not include a \nprovision that would delay or water down the base closure process. The \ncommittee continues to support the senior military and civilian \nleadership of the Department of Defense in concluding that another \nround of base closures is critical to meeting our future national \nsecurity needs, and the bill does not include proposals advanced by the \nadministration that would exempt certain military activities from key \nenvironmental requirements, including the Clean Air Act, the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund law.\n  There are, of course, provisions in this bill on which there are \ndisagreements, as we would expect. I would like to mention a few areas \nin which I have serious concerns. I am disappointed that the bill, like \nthe President's initial budget submission, fails to provide the money \nthat we all know will be needed to support our day-to-day military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. From the beginning of this year, \nthe administration insisted that because we do not yet know the exact \ncost of our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan next year, that it would \nbe premature to include any cost for those operations in the budget. \nThe exact costs of a military operation, or even the normal operations \nof the Department of Defense, for that matter, are never known. That is \nnot an adequate reason for not submitting a budget, and it is an \ninadequate reason for failing to include in that budget costs that we \nbelieve can be reasonably estimated and that we believe will be \nincurred in the next fiscal year.\n\n  If Congress does not act to provide substantial funding for ongoing \nmilitary operations this year, there is a significant risk that the \nmilitary services will find themselves in serious financial difficulty \nearlier next year. The Pentagon has some flexibility to move funds to \npay for ongoing operations, but shifting funds away from other \npriorities can only take the military so far. That is why the Senate \nBudget Committee included $30 billion for ongoing military operations \nin the Senate budget resolution earlier this year, and that is why the \nadministration finally has acknowledged the problem, a week and a half \nago, and agreed to submit a proposal for a $25 billion budget \namendment. This money is needed to support our troops in the field, and \nthey deserve more than just an IOU.\n  I commend our chairman for holding a hearing in this matter. I think \nit was a very useful hearing. There was almost a consensus in our \ncommittee, or close to it, that there should be an amendment which \nwould be offered, hopefully on this bill, which would provide the funds \nthat are necessary for our troops for the operations we know will be \ntaking place next year but to do it in a responsible manner where the \nCongress carries out its role of being a check and a balance on the \nexecutive branch and not just issuing a blank check. The chairman's \ninitiative in holding this hearing and having the witnesses there who \nwere called I believe will lead to the proper resolution of this \nmatter--hopefully in an amendment that everybody can support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank him for his full cooperation. We are now studying \na draft by which the two of us would put forward to the committee a \nsuggested amendment on this full amount of $25 billion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman. We are indeed doing that.\n  Another thing the bill does that it should not do, in my judgment, is \nto provide more than $10 billion for missile defense, including more \nthan a half billion dollars for additional interceptors, without \nimposing basic ``fly before you buy'' requirements on the program.\n  In the course of the markup, an amendment was offered that would have \nrequired the missile defense program to comply with the same \noperational testing requirements that are applicable to other \nacquisition programs of the Department of Defense. It was defeated. \nAnother amendment was offered that would have cut the funding for the \nproduction of additional interceptors or to fence that funding, \nrestrict that funding until operational testing and evaluation of these \ninterceptors is completed. That amendment was also defeated, as was the \nfirst, on a closely divided vote.\n\n  It is unfortunate that the administration is so insistent on \ndeploying a missile defense system as soon as possible that it is \nunwilling to comply with even the most basic operational test and \nevaluation requirements. If we want a missile defense that works rather \nthan one that sits on the ground and soaks up money, we should not shy \naway from realistic testing requirements. The law and common sense \nrequire realistic testing requirements. Right now, they are not going \nto be followed.\n  Another problem: The bill contains full funding of $27 million for \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator and the\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\nadvanced nuclear weapons concept initiative, an increase of over $7.5 \nmillion authorized for these programs last year. The administration's \nbudget for the outyear reflects a commitment to developing an earth \npenetrator, which is likely to cost on the order of $1 billion to \nproduce and deploy. The bill also includes $9 million--a 50-percent \nincrease over fiscal year 2004--for the advanced nuclear weapons \nconcepts initiative to look at new options for nuclear weapons.\n  By pursuing this earth penetrator and the new nuclear weapons \nconcepts, the administration continues to send the wrong message about \nweapons proliferation. At a time when the United States is trying to \ndissuade other countries from going forward with nuclear weapons \ndevelopment--we oppose North Korea's pulling out of the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty, and we are spending over $1 billion to prevent \nthe spread of nuclear weapons material and technology--these actions \nthat are proposed by the administration send a terrible message.\n  We are telling others not to go down the road to more and more \nnuclear weapons. But instead of being a leader in the effort to prevent \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are recklessly driving down \nthat same road. In short, the United States is following a policy we \nwould not tolerate and do not accept in others.\n  I hope the Senate will reverse the administration's proposals as \nleaving us and the world less secure and more likely to face the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, and the proliferation of those \nweapons is the greatest threat we face.\n  Finally, the bill contains two troubling provisions that would erode \nmore than 30 years of congressional policy relative to high-level \nradioactive waste. These provisions were adopted on closely divided \nvotes. One provision provides that the Department of Energy will have \nvirtually unchecked discretion to reclassify or decree that high-level \nradioactive waste in South Carolina is not high-level radioactive \nwaste. This ability to reclassify the waste opens the door to the \nDepartment of Energy to leave high-level radioactive waste in the \nground in South Carolina and could lead to the same result in other \nStates. That is because the second provision I referred to would \nrequire the States of Idaho and Washington to acquiesce in the \nDepartment of Energy's desire to reclassify high-level radioactive \nwaste as they want to do in South Carolina before Idaho and Washington \ncould continue to receive money to pump liquid high-level radioactive \nwaste out of the tanks that are present in those States.\n  Taken together, these two provisions begin to undo years of effort to \nmake sure high-level radioactive waste will be disposed of safely to \nprotect the public and the environment. It is disingenuous to pretend \nthat high-level radioactive waste is anything other than high-level \nradioactive waste. The cavalier treatment of high-level radioactive \nwaste could pose a very real risk environment to the health of our \ncitizens down the line.\n  As we begin consideration of this bill, the men and women of our \nArmed Forces--both Active and Reserve--remain deployed in harm's way in \nmany areas of the globe and are being subjected to almost daily arms \nattacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. We join together--every Member of this \nbody--in standing behind our troops and expressing pride in their \nextraordinary accomplishments on the battlefield. This bill will help \nprovide them with the equipment they need and the compensation and \nbenefits they deserve.\n  Let me again conclude by thanking Senator Warner for the leadership \nhe has shown in bringing this bill to the floor, and I know we look \nforward to receiving amendments and considering amendments on this bill \nas the week progresses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we welcome other Senators coming to the \nfloor and discussing this bill. The bill is now open for amendment. We \nanticipate the senior Senator from Texas will come forward shortly with \na very important amendment which is subject to leadership concurrence \nand which could be the subject of the vote that is now, according to \nleadership, scheduled for around 5:30. Senator Hutchison will probably \nbe on the floor shortly after 4 o'clock to discuss that.\n  As we commence the floor debate this afternoon, I think we are \nobligated to bring to the attention of the American public who haven't \nalready heard it the disturbing news about a threat posed to our forces \nin the Iraqi region. Indeed, it could be elsewhere in the world but for \nthe moment in this particular region; that is, the use of a weapon \nwhich would fall within the definition of a weapon of mass destruction \nand used in Iraq on Saturday.\n  News reports from Baghdad, confirmed by the Iraqi Survey Group--as \nyou know, that is a group which was specifically tasked by the \nSecretary of Defense and specifically budgeted by the Congress of the \nUnited States to work on weapons of mass destruction issues. The report \ntoday, confirmed by the Iraqi Survey Group, indicated that on Saturday \na roadside bomb was implanted on the road by terrorists who obviously \nattempted to use an artillery shell filled with deadly Sarin gas as an \nimprovised explosive device. They are referred to as IEDs. This shell \nhad no distinctive marks. Fortunately, the device only partially \noperated. There was an explosion, but fortunately only a small amount \nof the deadly nerve gas agent was produced by the explosion.\n  Two U.S. demolition experts were treated for exposure to Sarin, and \nthe reports are they are, fortunately, recovering.\n  It is important to note, however, that this was an Iraqi military \nround. In other words, it was apparently identified clearly as one made \nsome years before or sometime before our invasion. Its origin is \nunclear. What is clear is it was part of the Iraqi military arsenal \nthat was not declared as required by the United Nations inspectors and \nthat regime when they were operating in that region.\n  We all know Saddam Hussein's regime had chemical weapons in the early \n1990s. We also know his regime continued the aggressive development \nactivities on chemical and biological weapons. David Kay confirmed that \nas he reported to the Congress. Under the terms of the 1991 gulf war \ncease-fire, some chemical weapons were destroyed but tons of chemical \nand biological agents remain unaccounted for as to whether they were \ndestroyed or are still in existence. Apparently, Iraq did have \nundeclared weapons as well.\n  The discovery of this weapon is troubling and begs the question: How \nmany more chemical weapons--weapons of potential mass destruction--are \nin Iraq and could fall into the hands of terrorists and other \nantagonists to the coalition forces named to bring freedom to the \npeople of Iraq? Where are these various caches of weapons hidden? The \nquestion must be answered. It is the reason the important work of the \nIraq Survey Group must go on.\n  It has certainly been my opinion throughout that weapons of mass \ndestruction materials and technology is the greatest threat to our \nNation, and indeed all nations in the free world today. But materials \nor technology in the hands of terrorists could bring unimaginable \ndestruction.\n  Winning the global war on terrorism depends on stopping this \nproliferation. We have taken an important step forward in Afghanistan \nand an important step forward in Iraq.\n  I hope that rapid passage of this bill will send a strong message \nbecause it reinforces our efforts worldwide to interdict weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say that the remarks of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the senior \nSenator from Virginia, are indeed disturbing because it would be the \nfirst evidence in this conflict that the chemical weapons Saddam \nHussein once had and which we had no evidence of destruction might now \nbe surfacing and might be used against our troops. It is, as he said, \nimportant that we continue to pursue this. We hope it is a single event \nrather than something that will repeat itself. But in any event, it \nbrings home the seriousness of the proposition.\n  I commend him for not only bringing it to our attention today but \nalso for the work he and the committee have put into bringing this \nDefense authorization bill to the floor.\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n  It is a difficult time. We are not only focusing on the multiyear \ntransition of our force structure but also the bringing of new \ntechnology to our military in an evolutionary way at the same time we \nare trying to provide the resources necessary to fight the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and other resources for the war on terror and building \nup our intelligence capabilities through the Defense Intelligence \nOrganization and others.\n\n  This is a very complicated and difficult time in defense planning. \nThe bill the committee has put together is a very well-structured and a \nvery forward-leaning bill, as well as a bill that takes care of the \ntroops who are being put in harm's way today. I commend the chairman \nand members of the committee for the fine product they have put before \nus.\n  I will speak today primarily about one aspect. It is not the war on \nterror but rather the way in which at least an element of high \ntechnology is being integrated into our forces to meet a different kind \nof challenge. It illustrates the fact that at the same time we are \nfighting this war on terror and the action in Iraq, we also have to \nthink about the other challenges we are going to be facing in the \nfuture and be prepared to deal with them at that time.\n  It is unfortunate but true that the sophisticated weapon systems that \nare available to our troops today were on the drawing boards maybe 20 \nyears ago and did not go into production until a few years ago because \nof all of the work that has to go into their development and their \ntesting and their ultimate deployment. We do not have the ability to \nsimply snap our fingers when we need a new weapons system and bring it \nonline immediately. It takes years of work to get it to that point.\n  A good example is, and a system we had to rely on to some extent in \nthe first gulf war, in the area of missile defense. Missile defense has \nbeen with us ever since the pronouncement of President Reagan in his \ngreat announcement in the early 1980s that with the advent of ballistic \nmissiles, a genie that would never be put back into the bottle, we were \ngoing to have to develop effective defenses against them or they would \nbe the weapon of choice in the future for the delivery of high \nexplosive but potentially nuclear weaponry, as well as chemical or \nbiological weaponry. As a result, President Reagan embarked upon a \nscientific venture to find a way to intercept missiles. There was a \ngreat deal of research that went into this. Frankly, we came close \nduring the end of the Reagan administration and first part of the first \nBush administration of actually being able to deploy missile defenses.\n  But one of the arguments opponents always made was more testing was \nnecessary and we should not actually go to the deployment of the system \nuntil we could better prove it could defeat any conceivable threat. At \nthe time, the potential enemy was the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union \ndid, indeed, have a sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile \nsystem, one that required us not only to defeat a rudimentary kind of \nmissile but one that might have decoys, that might have other kinds of \npenetration aids, ways defensively to throw our interceptor missiles \noff course.\n  So there was always a game being played between perfection being the \nenemy of the good versus actually getting something deployed that would \ntake care of most of the threat. At the end of the day, there was not \nsufficient support in the Congress to actually deploy a system, as a \nresult of which a great deal of time and money was spent on ballistic \nmissiles but nothing was ever produced.\n  Along came the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration \nalso understood that especially with the rise of the threat from North \nKorea, Iran, and China, as well as the leftover threat from the Soviet \nUnion, but in a much more benign setting now that Russia was emerging \nas the power out of the ashes of the Soviet Union, there was still \ngoing to be a need to deploy some kind of system. As a result, the \nClinton administration decided upon a ground-based system of 100 \ninterceptors primarily potentially at a site partially, at least, in \nAlaska that would be our basic way of beginning to deal with ballistic \nmissile threat.\n\n  Even the Clinton administration understood this was not the be-all \nand end-all. This would not necessarily be the end of the development \nof ballistic missile interceptors because as the offense became more \nsophisticated, so, too, the defense would have to become more \nsophisticated. But it was a way to begin the deployment and deal with \nthe threat from a rogue nation, a nation like North Korea or Iran, for \nexample, which would not have the sophisticated penetration aids of a \nnation like the Soviet Union.\n  The question then came when the second Bush administration came to \npower, would it be possible for us to move away from the constraints of \nthe ballistic missile treaty, the ABM treaty, to actually think about \ndeploying more sophisticated and capable systems that were not \npermitted under the ABM treaty. It was agreed with the Russians that a \nnew treaty would replace the ABM treaty, a treaty which would permit \nboth countries to get rid of most of their offensive weapons, their \nnuclear weaponry, and much of this was to be delivered on top of \nballistic missiles, as a result of which the means for delivery of \nthose nuclear weapons would be eliminated as well as the nuclear \nweaponry itself.\n  That decision was made and an agreement was entered into between the \nUnited States and Russia, and as a result, the United States began to \nthink about a more creative way to actually deploy a rudimentary \nmissile defense system. By then, the threat from Russia had eroded and \nwe saw primarily the threat from the so-called axis-of-evil countries \nas the one we were going to have to deal with.\n  The decision was made, since we wanted to put something into place \nquickly, that what we would do is combine the initial deployment of the \nsystem with continued testing so we would actually have a test bed \navailable to us to provide the real conditions for a real test; have a \nreal missile defense system in place to actually do the testing that \nwould be the most sophisticated and end part of the testing program.\n  We went through a series of tests that were highly scripted, that \ntold us what we needed to know about the component parts of the system, \nand it was time to put it in operational mode to test it in that mode.\n  GEN Ron Kadish, the general in charge of the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization, put it very interestingly:\n\n       The criticism we get is that we are not operationally \n     testing the system before we put it in place. My response to \n     that, which people don't seem to want to accept, is you can't \n     operational test the system until you put it in place.\n\n  Of course, General Kadish is exactly right. You can only do so much \nhypothetical testing. There is a point at which you need to put it in \nplace so you can go forward with the operational testing. This was the \nconcept the Bush administration decided to pursue.\n\n  It is strange that very concept now is being criticized and \npresumably will be the subject of amendments that will be offered in \nthe Senate to take away from funding for the ballistic missile defense \nsystem. It will generally contend that more testing is required; that \nin effect we need to test this until we are absolutely certain it can \ndo everything it needs against every potential adversary without \nquestion, by which time many years will have passed, much more money \nwill have been spent, and we still will not have anything to show.\n  It might be interesting to note that during the first gulf war we \nwere actually exposed to the rationale for proceeding as we are \nproceeding with the missile defense system. At that time, Saddam \nHussein launched Scud missiles at Saudi Arabia, at Kuwait, at the U.S. \nforces there, at the country of Israel, and there was no missile \ndefense system in place at that time. The Israelis did not have the \nArrow missile which they now have and which we hope will provide an \neffective missile defense system against something like the Scud \nmissile for the state of Israel. What we had was an anti-aircraft \nmissile called the Patriot. It was a very capable system. But we needed \nsomething to defend against the Scuds.\n  Very hurriedly we sent to the theater batteries of Patriot missiles. \nLiterally, on the way, as they were being prepared for transit and in \ntransit and as\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nthey were being set up, we were adjusting the computer components, the \nradar connections and tracking systems and the like, to try to make \nthese Patriot systems more robust, more capable, faster acting, more \ndiscerning, so they might actually hit a ballistic missile rather than \nan airplane, which is what they were designed to be against in the \nfirst instance.\n  Lo and behold, it turned out through the ingenuity of people \nliterally on the ground, the Patriot missile system was made to be \nsomewhat effective against some of these Scud missiles. Certainly not \nas effective as a finely developed missile defense system would have \nbeen, but the point was we made do with what we had because we did not \nhave a choice. We were in the middle of a conflict and we had to come \nup with some way to defend our troops and defend our friends.\n  Lest my colleagues forget, remember, the single largest number of \ncasualties in the first gulf war against Americans, 28 were killed when \na Scud missile hit an Air Force base with American airmen and others \npresent. It demonstrates you cannot wait until you have the perfect\n  system. When you are in a conflict with people and they are working \nas fast as they can, it helps to have something ready to go even if it \nis not perfect.\n  That was the reasoning behind the Bush administration's decision to \nmove forward with the development of the system and not wait until \nevery conceivable aspect of testing could be done, but to actually get \nit up to the point where it could be deployed for operational testing, \nand at that point we would be able to literally kill two birds with one \nstone.\n  We would not only have an operational test bed capable of continuing \nto perform the tests necessary, but we would also have an operational \ncapability of some robustness, probably not enough to defeat a Russian \nmissile, should one be launched by accident, for example, but certainly \none that might be sufficient to take out a North Korean missile.\n  The thinking was that not only would you serve these two purposes, \nbut you would also serve another very important purpose; and that was \nto discourage the countries that were beginning to proliferate weapons \nof mass destruction, and the missiles to deliver them, from developing \nthese missile systems because of the notion that whatever they did, \nhowever much effort and time and money they put into it, we would have \na way of defeating it, so it would not be worth their while--in effect, \na deterrent, to say: The United States will not permit you to have an \neffective missile against us, so do not bother to try to develop and \ndeploy it.\n  We believe that could be important because of some things I will say \nin a moment relating to the exchange of information between countries \nsuch as China and Pakistan and North Korea and Iran and other countries \nthat began to proliferate components and technology for the trading of \nthese missiles. So the threat would not be just from one country but \nwould be from several countries. We have to nip this in the bud, and \ndeveloping a good missile defense would be one way to do that.\n  So from the original notion, which, as I said, was to have 20 \nmissiles in combination between a site in California and a site in \nAlaska, to the development of another 10, which would be put in Alaska, \nand then another 10, following that, at a site to be determined--and \nthis is the so-called missiles numbered 31 through 40. These are not \nyet funded. They are part of a long leadtime funding that is the \nsubject of this bill and which might be the subject of an amendment.\n  Let me go back and put all this into perspective. The Defense bill \nitself is just a little over $10 billion for ballistic missile defense \nresearch and development. It is key to the development and deployment \nof this capability about which I have been speaking. The threat from \nballistic missiles is not waning; it is growing.\n  Today there are nearly three dozen countries, according to our \nintelligence, that have or are developing ballistic missiles of \nincreasing range and sophistication. It includes the two remaining \n``access of evil'' members, Iran and North Korea, as well as their \nfellow terrorist regime Syria.\n  Some of the latest developments, which unless indicated otherwise, \nare all taken from the DCI's most recent semiannual ``Report to \nCongress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass \nDestruction and Conventional Munitions,'' are as follows:\n  First, North Korea: It continues its development of long-range \nmissiles. Its Taepo Dong 2 missile, which is capable of reaching the \nUnited States with a nuclear weapon-sized payload, may now be ready for \nflight testing. So this is not a hypothetical threat.\n  The Channel NewsAsia reported earlier this month that Pyongyang is \nnearing formal deployment of the Taepo Dong 2 and is now gearing up to \ntest engines for the missile.\n  Recent press accounts have also raised the possibility that North \nKorea is working on new intermediate-range ballistic missiles. \nAccording to a May 6 Los Angeles Times article, the South Korean press \nhas reported that two new missile bases are under construction in North \nKorea. These bases would reportedly be used for a new missile capable \nof reaching U.S. bases in Guam and possibly Hawaii.\n\n  North Korea not only presents a problem because of its own \ncapabilities but also because of its proliferation of ballistic \nmissiles and related technologies to potential adversaries of the \nUnited States.\n  According to the DCI report:\n\n       Throughout the first half of 2003, North Korea continued to \n     export significant ballistic missile-related equipment, \n     components, materials and technical expertise to the Middle \n     East, South Asia, and North Africa.\n\n  Recent press reports indicate that Kim Jong Il has been negotiating \nwith the Iranian regime on the sale of the long-range Taepo Dong 2.\n  Iran: The DCI report says:\n\n       Ballistic missile-related cooperation from entities in the \n     former Soviet Union, North Korea, and China over the years \n     has helped Iran move toward its goal of becoming self-\n     sufficient in the production of ballistic missiles.\n\n  Iran's ballistic missile inventory is among the largest in the Middle \nEast.\n  Last June, Iran made some significant advances in its program, \nconducting a successful test of the 800-mile-range Shahab-3 missile. If \noperational, this weapon could alter the strategic balance in the \nMiddle East, placing Israel and U.S. bases in Turkey within Iran's \nreach. Iran is also seeking to produce a 1,200-mile Shahab-4 missile.\n  According to CIA Director George Tenet's recent testimony to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, Iran, as North Korea, has been willing \nto supply missile-related technology to countries of concern.\n  The PRC, the People's Republic of China: In addition to the threat \nposed by the development of ballistic missiles by terrorist-sponsored \nregimes that I have noted, we should not forget about the improving \ncapabilities, as well as the WMD and ballistic missile proliferation, \nof the People's Republic of China.\n  The intelligence community's most recent report on foreign ballistic \nmissile development assessed that China could begin deploying its \n5,000-mile-range DF-31 missile during the first half of this decade. \nChina's even longer range ballistic missile, the DF-41, could be \ndeployed in the latter half of the decade. I remind my colleagues this \nis now 2004.\n  China also has approximately 500 shorter range missiles aimed at \nTaiwan.\n  According to an article in today's Washington Post, the Chinese \nGovernment warned Taiwan's President to pull back from ``a dangerous \nlurch toward independence''--their words--``or face''--and I am again \nquoting their word--``destruction.''\n  Given that warning, as well as numerous others like it, the United \nStates should take very seriously not only the missile threat posed to \nTaiwan but also that posed to the United States.\n  Finally, despite relatively new missile-related export regulations, \nChinese entities continued, during the first half of 2003, to work with \nPakistan and Iran on ballistic missile projects. Additionally, during \nthat same time, Chinese firms continued to provide materials or \nassistance to the ballistic missile programs in Iran and North Korea.\n\n  So you see a combination of countries willing to work with each other\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\ntoward the development of these missiles, all of which could be \nthreatening to the United States and our interests.\n  So what will missile defense deployment accomplish? Well, as I said, \nboth defense and deterrence.\n  Deployment of the layered missile defense system will permit the \nUnited States freedom of action by eliminating the possibility that we \nwould be susceptible to nuclear blackmail by a country such as North \nKorea.\n  Missile defense will also reduce the incentives for proliferation by \ndevaluing offensive missiles. If a rogue actor views missiles as less \nlikely to be effective because of our defenses, he will also be less \ninclined to spend as much time or money trying to acquire them.\n  Finally, missile defenses, in a worst case scenario, will save \nAmericans lives.\n  This is worth doing. I would like to quote again General Kadish, who \nmade this point earlier this year. He said:\n\n       We should not choose to be vulnerable. We have proven that \n     from a technological standpoint and a practical standpoint we \n     can intercept ballistic warheads in flight. And to say now \n     that we can technologically defend ourselves and then choose \n     not to is, in my view, a recipe for failure.\n\n  The first obligation we have as legislators, as opinion leaders, as \nleaders in this country, is to ensure the defense of the United States \nof America and American citizens. We have to do that with the \ndevelopment of ballistic missile defenses because it is the one threat \nthat exists against us which we do not yet have a capability of \ndefeating. But we are on the verge of deploying that capability. We \nhave to proceed with it and not retrench under the rubric of ``more \ntesting is necessary.''\n  There are challenges. The ideological opposition to missile defense, \nunfortunately, still exists. Last year was the first year that the \nPresident's overall request for missile defense was met. In the \nprevious years it had not been. In fiscal year 2003, ballistic missile \ndefense research and development had been reduced by $80 million, and \nthe year before that by $530 million.\n  In addition to that, restrictive language has been adopted by this \nbody, creating a false choice between two alternatives, which I will \nspeak to in a moment.\n  Last year's authorization for the fiscal year 2003 Defense \nauthorization bill required the administration to decide whether $814 \nmillion would be spent on missile defense or terrorism. This was money \nthat the administration had requested for its missile defense \norganization, and it was spent on that. But the President, in effect, \nwas faced with a false choice. Which one, in effect, critics were \nasking, was more important? Of course, the bottom line is, they are \nboth important. In the United States, we have the capability of doing \nboth. Indeed, we have no choice but to do both. In fact, we have no \nchoice but to do several things in this defense budget. You cannot \ndecide that one is more important than the other and, therefore, you \nhave to forego spending on one for the benefit of the other, if you \nhave the capability of funding them all. So missile defense versus the \nwar on terror would, indeed, be a false choice.\n  It is clear that we have needs in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on \nterror, but we don't have the luxury of confronting those needs while \nat the same time overlooking or ignoring the ballistic missile threat \nfrom a country such as North Korea or Iran. I ask my friends, who were \nso shocked that something like 9/11 could happen, what their response \nwould be if one of those missiles were launched against the United \nStates, if we had no defense against them landing on one of our cities. \nI would hope those who have been opposing the deployment of missile \ndefenses would acknowledge responsibility in that environment.\n  Let me respond to one potential amendment that might come up and then \nconclude my remarks. I have talked about the fact that there may be an \neffort to cut money from the Missile Defense Program to fund some other \nprogram such as armor for Humvees or vests for our soldiers or \nsomething of that sort. All of these things are being fielded as \nquickly as we can field them, as my colleagues well appreciate. In \nother words, diverting money now from missile defense to more body \narmor or armor for Humvees won't speed up 1 minute the deployment of \nthat particular defensive equipment in Iraq.\n  For whatever reasons, there will be an effort to take money from the \nballistic missile program and apply to it those kinds of programs, I \nsuppose, because they would presumably have a great deal of public \nsupport. I reiterate, those programs are totally funded today and are \nbeing provided, and we do not need to take money from the ballistic \nmissile defense program as part of this Defense authorization bill.\n  The funding that is provided in the bill will allow the construction \nand implementation of the ballistic missile defense test bed that will \nbe used to conduct more realistic system-wide tests at the same time \nthat it provides a near-concurrent initial operational capability in \ncase of an attack. As I said, it is consistent with President Clinton's \nproposal for national missile defense that planned to deploy 100 \nground-based interceptors. This will provide for the addition to the \ninitial 20 interceptors at Fort Greely and Vandenberg Air Force Base, \nof 20 additional ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, at sea, and \nperhaps even at some overseas location to be determined.\n  The budget request specifically in the chairman's bill makes a \ndownpayment on the ground-based interceptors Nos. 21 through 40. It is \nthe long lead funding to provide: No. 1, additional test articles \nnecessary to conduct planned future integrated flight tests--and I \npause here to say, for those critics who say we need more testing, this \nis the money for the testing; so if you vote to cut this money, you are \nactually cutting the money for more testing; No. 2, an expanded \ninterceptor inventory to address estimated growth in foreign ballistic \nmissile threats; No. 3, maintain steady industrial base production \nlines for the interceptors and kill vehicles in the event an expanded \ninventory is deemed necessary; and, No. 4, ground-site preparation \nactivities for interceptors Nos. 21 through 30.\n  Any cuts to the ground-based missile defense deployment that is \ncontemplated will cripple effective deployment of the initial test bed \nsystem that itself will allow for more realistic testing.\n  So if you accept the notion of and assumption inherent in \ncapabilities-based acquisition and spiral development, then criticisms \nabout insufficient testing before initial deployment of this ballistic \nmissile system are simply invalid.\n\n  I commend the chairman and the committee for their great work in \nbringing this bill to the floor and finally funding our missile defense \nsystem so that we can not only continue the testing that is so \nimportant, but also at the same time provide some initial capability \nshould we need that capability.\n  I hope my colleagues will join together, support the chairman, \nsupport the committee, support the President in what he is trying to \ndo, and not engage in a thousand cuts that could end up crippling this \nprogram yet once again, getting us to the point of deployment but no \nfurther than that point.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the chairman and the committee and \ndefeat such amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nArizona. He has been in the very forefront of these issues regarding \nmissile defense for many years. He has spent much of his time, and he \nspeaks of his knowledge. I assure him that our committee, in the course \nof its markup, stood steadfast on these issues. I am hopeful we can \ncontinue to do so in the event such amendments as the Senator from \nArizona contemplated would be brought to the floor. We would hope that \nhe would find time to engage with us in support of the mark as it now \nstands.\n  Earlier today the distinguished Senator from New Jersey advised the \nmanagers of the bill that he has an amendment. I also see the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine. I would think as a matter of comity, \nwe would hear from our distinguished colleague from New Jersey. It is \nmy understanding that the managers of the bill will make a request that \nthis matter be laid aside, after, in fact, he offers the amendment. The \nbill is open for amendment. The\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\nparliamentary situation affords the Senator from New Jersey this \nopportunity, and we welcome amendments being brought up. We anticipate \na second amendment to be brought forward this afternoon. So at some \npoint, there will be a vote, but that is subject to the leadership. I \nalso have just seen the amendment. We will need time on both sides to \nstudy it. I anticipate we will ask the Senator to lay it aside at the \nconclusion of his remarks. Then the distinguished Senator from Maine \nwould be recognized next.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3151\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill for \nhis courtesy and understand that when my remarks are finished, a \nrequest will be made to lay the amendment aside. For now, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg} proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3151.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 184, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n          Subtitle F--Provisions Relating To Certain Sanctions\n\n     SEC. 856. CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Clarification of certain actions under IEEPA.--In any \n     case in which the President takes action under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     et seq.) with respect to a foreign country, or persons \n     dealing with or associated with that foreign government, as a \n     result of a determination by the Secretary of State that the \n     government has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism, such action shall apply to a United \n     States person or other person as defined in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (A) Person.--The term ``person'' means an individual, \n     partnership, corporation, or other form of association, \n     including any government or agency thereof.\n       (B) United States person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means--\n       (i) any resident or national (other than an individual \n     resident outside the United States and employed by other than \n     a United States person); and\n       (ii) any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic \n     establishment of any foreign concern) or any foreign \n     subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign \n     establishment) of any domestic concern, which is controlled \n     in fact by such domestic concern.\n       (C) Controlled.--The term ``is controlled'' means--\n       (i) in the case of a corporation, holds at least 50 percent \n     (by vote or value) of the capital structure of the \n     corporation; and\n       (ii) in the case of any other kind of legal entity, holds \n     interests representing at least 50 percent of the capital \n     structure of the entity.\n       (b) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--In any case in which the President has \n     taken action under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and such action is in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     not apply to a United States person (or other person) if such \n     person divests or terminates its business with the government \n     or person identified by such action within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Actions after date of enactment.--In any case in which \n     the President takes action under the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to a \n     United States person (or other person) if such person divests \n     or terminates its business with the government or person \n     identified by such action within 90 days after the date of \n     such action.\n\n     SEC. 857.

Notification of Congress of termination of investigation by \n              Office of Foreign Assets Control.''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nthat is vital to the purpose of this Defense authorization bill. This \nbill supports our men and women who are on the front lines of the war \non terrorism throughout the world. They are paying a terrific price. \nThey are doing it bravely and courageously. We want to make sure there \nare no opportunities to circumvent rules that would permit any business \nto go on with terrorist countries.\n  My amendment focuses on a key component of the war on terror; that \nis, to deny terrorists funding and support. My amendment will close a \nloophole that allows U.S. companies to do business with terror-\nsponsoring nations such as Iran. Senators Feinstein, Clinton, Corzine, \nand Feingold are cosponsors of the amendment.\n  As my colleagues know--and we just heard from the Senator from \nArizona about his concern with the behavior of some of the rogue \nnations, including Iran, who are planning terrible things in their \npublic statements for the United States--American companies are \nsupposed to be prohibited from doing business with Iran. But by \ncreating shell companies as foreign subsidiaries, these companies are \nmaking a mockery of our sanctions laws and providing revenue for the \nfinancing of terrorist acts. It is wrong. It has to stop, and this \namendment would do just that.\n  Immediately after the attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush \ntold the world, ``You are either with us or against us.'' Pretty clear. \nThat same message should apply to people in our own country, including \nthose in our corporate world.\n  We know many companies find tax loopholes or regulatory loopholes \nthey exploit from time to time. But in this case, we found U.S. \ncompanies exploiting loopholes so they could do business with \nterrorists.\n  President Bush also said, ``Money is the lifeblood of terrorist \noperations.'' He is right.\n  If U.S. companies do business with rogue states like Iran, they are \ngenerating revenue for those who supply money and other resources to \nterrorists. They are also sending a message to these countries that \nthey are not really isolated, as they should be, and that the United \nStates, in some form, finds their behavior acceptable.\n  We have passed laws, such as the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, which make it clear U.S. companies must not do business \nwith terrorist states. The vast majority of American companies abide by \nthat law. However, a few companies have exploited a loophole that \nallows them to do business with Iran and other rogue nations.\n  If we look at this chart, we see the structure or format that permits \nthis to happen. Once they form a subsidiary company that doesn't have \nthe same restrictions on doing business with Iran we have, that money \ncan be earned, revenues can be generated that help these countries, \nhelp Hezbollah and Hamas, and they brag about it constantly.\n  This placard demonstrates how companies utilize this loophole.\n  U.S. companies often have several subsidiaries. Most American \ncompanies and their subsidiaries do not cross the lines that prevent \nbusiness with terrorist states. But some do, and here is how they do \nit.\n  Some U.S. companies set up a foreign subsidiary for the specific \npurpose of gaining revenues from terrorist states. The reason is the \nsanctions laws prohibit the parent company and its foreign branches \nfrom doing business with terrorist states. Foreign subsidiaries, \nhowever, are not mentioned in the law. This omission has not gone \nunnoticed by corporate lawyers. It has been identified as a major \nloophole that allows companies to do business with rogue states.\n  We know a few American companies are using this loophole to do \nbusiness with the Iranian Government. This is the same Iranian \nGovernment President Bush said is part of the axis of evil. This is the \nsame Iranian Government that directly funds organizations\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nlike Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad--all terrorist organizations, \naccording to the State Department.\n  Now, for a moment, I ask my colleagues to look at the young faces in \nthis photograph. One of these young women is Sara Duker, a young woman \nwho lived in New Jersey until her death. The other is Abigail Litle. \nSara was a constituent of mine. She was a 22-year-old from the town of \nTeaneck, NJ; a summa cum laude graduate of Barnard College. Sara was \nkilled with her fiance when the bus she was riding in Jerusalem was \nblown up in 1996 by Hamas. Hamas receives funding and support from the \nIranian Government. Iranian terrorists caused the deaths of many \nAmerican citizens abroad, including the 240 Marines who were brutally \nmurdered in their sleep in 1983 in Beirut. They also took the lives of \nthese two young American women, Sara Duker and 14-year-old Abigail \nLitle.\n\n  Iran sponsors terrorism. The terror they help fund has killed \nhundreds of Americans. Yet American companies--it is hard to believe \nthis--are flaunting the law in order to do business with the Iranian \nGovernment. It is wrong, but it is not technically illegal yet. This \namendment would change that.\n  I say to my colleagues this is a loophole we must close. We have to \ntell both our friends and those who continue to sponsor terrorism we \nare serious in our efforts to battle this evil.\n  It is inexcusable for American companies to engage in any business \npractice that provides revenues or profits to terrorism. We have to \nstop them. We have a chance to do that today with this amendment.\n  The bottom line is big businesses, even those with financial ties to \ntop members of our Government, do not get a free pass in this war on \nterrorism. No one in America wants to give these countries any \nadvantage they could restrict them from.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, close the terror-\nfunding loophole, pass this legislation, and send out the message we \nare against any help for terrorist nations that might occur.\n  I understand the request I agreed to earlier is to permit another \namendment to be considered. I will honor that commitment, and I want to \nmake sure we have an understanding that at an appropriate time we will \nhave a discussion and further review of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished colleague from \nNew Jersey. I want to confer with the distinguished ranking member, who \nwill soon be back. In the meantime, if it is agreeable with the \nSenator, we will lay his amendment aside. I so request that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be laid aside.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal \nyear 2005 National Defense Authorization Act. As a member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I especially commend the able leadership of \nour chairman, Senator John Warner. Under his leadership and that of the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Levin, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has delivered to the full Senate a vital piece of legislation \nfor our security now and in the years to come.\n  This legislation provides vital resources for the men and women in \nour military, resources they require in defending our Nation and in \ncarrying out the operations overseas.\n  I am proud that the legislation before us builds on the efforts we \nhave made in previous years to ensure that our troops are the best \npaid, the best trained, and best equipped in the world. It includes, \nfor example, a 3.5-percent across-the-board pay raise for military \npersonnel. It authorizes the permanent increase in the rate of family \nseparation allowances from $100 per month to $250 per month. It also \nauthorizes a permanent increase in the rate of special pay for duties \nsubject to hostile fire or imminent danger from $150 per month to $225 \nper month. These provisions, in a small way, help to recognize the \nsacrifices of those who are deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  One of the greatest obligations we have is to provide the best \nprotection possible to our troops who are being sent into harm's way. \nTherefore, the committee added $425 million for additional force \nprotection equipment, such as up-armored Humvees, ballistic equipment \nkits to fortify Humvees, and combat clothing for service members, such \nas body armor.\n  With 60 percent of its National Guard personnel deployed, Maine has \nthe second highest deployed ratio in the Nation. There is only one \nother State that has deployed more of its National Guard than the State \nof Maine. I am very grateful for the service of our Guard and Reserve \nmembers, but I am also very concerned about the heavy burden we are \nimposing on our Guard members and reservists, their families, and their \nemployers.\n\n  Many of my colleagues know of the experience, for example, of one of \nthe military police companies from Maine which was on its way home on \nEaster weekend when it received orders to extend its deployment and \nreturn to Kuwait and Iraq. This news was demoralizing for some of the \nsoldiers in this unit who had already been in Iraq for more than a \nyear, and it was devastating to the family members who were ready to \nwelcome them home on Easter Sunday.\n  Thankfully, this bill begins to address the many significant \ncontributions and sacrifices being made by our guardsmen and reservists \nin the global war on terrorism. It authorizes a new benefit option \nunder the military health care program known as TRICARE.\n  TRICARE Reserve Select would be offered for the first time to members \nof the selected Reserve and Guard and their families who could \nparticipate in TRICARE for a premium. It authorizes more than $400 \nmillion above the President's budget request for enhanced health \nbenefits for reservists, which will improve mobilization readiness and \nensure the continuity of health care services.\n  The legislation focuses on other areas in need of reform as well. \nEarlier this year, the committee held a hearing on sexual assaults in \nthe military. We heard very disturbing testimony about sexual assaults \nand the inadequate response to victims. This legislation directs the \nSecretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive policy and procedures \nfor the prevention of and response to incidents of sexual assault \ninvolving military members.\n  As a member of the Seapower Subcommittee under the able chairmanship \nof Senator Jim Talent, I am particularly pleased that this \nauthorization bill provides significant funding for our naval forces. \nWe continue to marvel at the capabilities and the commitment of our \nNavy. At the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, for example, 70 percent \nof our surface fleet and 50 percent of our submarine fleet were \ndeployed in Iraq, the highest deployment rate since World War II.\n  This Defense authorization includes $6.7 billion for the procurement \nof seven ships. These include three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class \ndestroyers, two of which will be constructed at the famous Bath Iron \nWorks in Maine. While this shipbuilding budget represents considerable \nprogress, I want to note for my colleagues that we need to be vigilant \nabout the number of ships we are building to ensure that our fleet can \nmeet our national security requirements.\n  Our Navy now has fewer than 300 ships, and the current rate of \nproduction, unfortunately, will not allow that number to increase. This \ncould place our shipbuilding industrial base at risk. To avoid that \nunacceptable outcome, the Senate Armed Services Committee added report \nlanguage at my request that directs the Navy to take all actions \nnecessary to ensure the viability of the second shipyard--that is Bath \nIron Works--in order to maintain a healthy and competitive industrial \nbase.\n  We have a responsibility to ensure that our Navy is well prepared to \nfight today and tomorrow. Part of that involves designing and \ndeveloping the next generation of ships. The last three destroyers of \nthe Arleigh Burke class are funded in this fiscal year 2005 Defense \nauthorization. They will be followed by a new class of destroyers, a \ndestroyer designed to meet the challenges of the 21st century, the DDX. \nOne of the two builders of the DDX, I am proud to say, is Bath Iron \nWorks in the State of Maine.\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\n  I am pleased to state to the distinguished Presiding Officer, my \ncolleagues, the citizens of Maine, and the fine employees of Bath Iron \nWorks that this bill represents important progress in securing the \nfuture of our Navy and the future of Bath Iron Works. It will help to \npreserve America's proud maritime tradition and our shipbuilding \nindustrial base.\n  I have been extremely concerned about the fiscal year 2006 gap in the \nproduction of surface combatants in the administration's proposed \nbudget. If permitted, this would be the first time in 20 years that no \nsurface combatant would be built.\n  Moreover, the Navy's analysis of the impact on the industrial base \nindicates that if the DDX schedule were to slip, the shipyard that is \nscheduled to build the follow ship--in this case Bath Iron Works--could \nexperience significant workload issues.\n  Fortunately, there is good news in this bill. I have worked very hard \nwith my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in an effort to \nmaintain some stability in the shipbuilding industrial base. At my \nrequest, the committee added $99.4 million to begin the construction of \na second DDX to be built in Bath in fiscal year 2006, thus accelerating \nthe start of construction by 1 year and helping to partially fill that \nvery dangerous gap in our shipbuilding budget. This funding will help \nto ensure a more stable workload for Bath Iron Works and, thus, to \npreserve the skilled workers essential to our national security.\n  We only have two shipyards left that now build surface combatant \nships. We need to make sure that we sustain the highly skilled \nworkforce in both of those yards so that we have a competitive \nenvironment for the Navy.\n  This bill has a number of other very important provisions for new \nweapon platforms and systems. It also recognizes that our Nation cannot \nmaintain its technological superiority over potential adversaries \nwithout investing in emerging capabilities.\n  The legislation authorizes $11 billion for the Defense Science and \nTechnology Program, including an additional $450 million for \ntransformational basic and applied research activities, bringing the \nDepartment closer to its goal of investing 3 percent of its budget in \nsuch programs.\n  Finally, I am also very pleased that this legislation includes \nprovisions that I authored allocating $3 million to establish a U.S. \nArmy Center of Excellence at the University of Maine. I know from my \nconversations with Army officials and generals that they are very \nexcited about the possibility of a Center on Advanced Structures and \nComposites in construction. The center will focus on addressing the \nArmy's needs in fundamental and applied research related to the use of \nadvanced composite materials and structures.\n  These are a few of the reasons why this Senate should strongly \nsupport the fiscal year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I again want to commend the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee for their hard work, working with all of us on the committee, \nas well as with the administration and one another, in bringing forward \nthis vital legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished \ncolleague from Maine for all of her hard work on the Armed Services \nCommittee. I very much enjoyed her strong remarks in support of this \nbill.\n  I believe the distinguished Senator from Texas is now ready to \npresent an amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield while I add my \nthanks to the Senator from Maine for the contribution she makes to the \ncommittee. She highlighted a number of initiatives she has undertaken \non the committee. In addition to those very strong efforts on the part \nof the Senator from Maine, she has been such a major contributor in the \nstrength of the committee over the years that I wanted to acknowledge \nthat along with our chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3152\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment, but \nI first want to commend the committee for producing a very good bill. I \ncannot think of anything more important while our troops are in harm's \nway. We see on television and read in the newspapers every day about \nwhat our troops are doing for our country. Now they know they are going \nto be fully funded. The priorities in this bill are the right \npriorities.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman, the Senator from Virginia, and \nthe distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, for \nproducing this bill. Sometimes producing this bill has been very \ndifficult, but it looks as though the committee came together knowing \nhow important this was for our military to see that it would not be \nminor skirmishes that would submarine this very important legislation. \nSo I commend the committee.\n  I say on a couple of points with which I am particularly involved \nthat I think the committee has done a terrific job. First, I am \nchairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, which is part of \nthe Appropriations Committee. The administration requested \napproximately $9.5 billion for military construction and family \nhousing, and the committee went up to $9.82 billion, increasing the \nadministration's request, because family housing is so very important \nright now.\n  We are beginning to give a better quality of life to all of our \nmilitary personnel. Whether they are single and live in barracks or \nwhether they have family housing requirements, they are getting better \nquality. I am very pleased about that, and particularly that the \ncommittee also fully funded all of the requirements of the very \ncritical military construction of the Department of Defense for \noverseas locations.\n  As we look at our military construction budget, we are making sure \nthe military construction we do overseas, not counting in our combat \nzones, but in places where we have facilities, that we are focusing now \non only putting money in facilities we know are going to endure. Part \nof the overseas basing commission Senator Feinstein and I passed, along \nwith the help of the authorization committee, to assure that we look at \nall of those bases, that we not put one military construction dollar \nwhere we do not know absolutely that is going to be an enduring \nfacility so our taxpayers know we are not going to be building some big \ncafeteria, fitness center, or headquarters in a place we are going to \nabandon in the next 2 to 3 years. So we are trying to spend wisely and \nthe authorization committee did an excellent job of funding the \nmilitary construction authorization, working with our subcommittee that \nwill be appropriating funds.\n  The second area they should be commended for addressing is our \nmilitary compensation. Certainly increasing our military pay by 3.5 \npercent, which the President requested, it will be fully funded and \nassure everyone in the military. Then adding to the combat pay and \nadding to the separation allowance, these are very important items to \nincrease the quality of life for those serving our country today, and \ntheir families.\n\n  It was mentioned earlier by the Senator from Maine that there should \nbe an addressing of the issue of sexual assault in our military. It is \nimportant that there will be a comprehensive policy and procedure for \nprevention and response to incidents of sexual assault involving \nmilitary members. It is required that that be done in the next year. I \nam very pleased the committee chose to do this because we have been \nreading disturbing reports about this subject. All of us are concerned \nthat our young women who agree to serve in our military and who are \nperforming so well be able to serve knowing they will be protected from \nany kind of physical assault.\n  Last, I want to mention the Joint Strike Fighter, which is a very \nimportant future fighter airplane I am very excited about and have been \ninvolved in as it has evolved from the drawing board. It will be made \nin Texas, so I am more familiar with it. I am very pleased the \ncommittee chose to fully fund the research, development, and testing of \nfuture fighter planes that will give us the total dominance of the air \nin future years. I think the committee did an outstanding job.\n  Before I go to my amendment, there is one area I also want to bring \nup with\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nthe chairman. I would like to try to come up with an appropriate \namendment, working with the committee, that deals with reaching the cap \non privatized housing for our military personnel. We have been able to \ndo so much more by having an association with private housing builders \nand contractors. We could never, ever have put the housing we have on \nthe ground if we had had to fully fund this from our Department of \nDefense funds.\n  We have been able to have partnerships with private companies where \nthey would do the building and we would lease back those facilities \nthrough the years. We have been able to increase the quality of housing \nin that respect. We are soon going to reach the $850 million cap. We \nwere very concerned we would be bumping against that, and stopped some \nof the projects that are on the drawing boards today, projects our \nmilitary personnel have looked forward to coming to fruition, places \nlike Fort Hood where we have severe housing shortages.\n  The military personnel have been relying on the family housing \nprojects that have been built by private companies and now we are \nlooking at hitting that cap and not being able to go forward with those \nprojects. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee if he would work with me and see if we could come up with \nsome appropriate language that would raise that cap maybe by $300 \nmillion, $400 million, or $500 million, so we would not have any danger \nof bumping against the cap before we have the opportunity to address it \nin the next authorization appropriations bill.\n  I ask the distinguished chairman if this is also a concern of his and \nif he would try to work with me, if there is an amendment we could \noffer together or somehow assure that we will not stop the planning \nthat is going on now for some very important military housing projects.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator for her inquiry. I will \ngive her assurance that we will take it into consideration. For the \nmoment, though, we are on this amendment. To my understanding it is now \npending at the desk?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was going to send my amendment to the desk, and I \nam now prepared to do that.\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3152.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To authorize medical and dental care for cadets and \n    midshipmen, and to authorize disability benefits for cadets and \n                  midshipmen of the service academies)\n\n       On page 147, after line 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 717. ELIGIBILITY OF CADETS AND MIDSHIPMEN FOR MEDICAL \n                   AND DENTAL CARE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Medical and Dental Care.--(1) Chapter 55 of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting after section \n     1074a the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1074b.

Mr. President, this amendment attempts to solve a \nproblem facing not this generation of military leadership but our \nfuture generation of military leadership.\n  Current law established in the Career Compensation Act of 1949 denies \ncadets and midshipmen the disability benefits that would be provided to \nany other member of the Armed Forces, especially when they are injured \nin the line of duty. With respect to health benefits, cadets and \nmidshipmen who are separated for medical disability after being injured \nduring military training now face unnecessary and unfair burdens in \nmaintaining the continuity of their health care.\n  In addition, Reserve Officer Training Corps, ROTC cadets are in many \ncases required to pay for their own medical care after being injured \nduring military training. Even though ROTC cadets are covered under the \nOffice of Workers Compensation within the Department of Labor, medical \ncare providers, many of whom have not been compensated for their prior \nwork, decline to treat ROTC patients unless they use private medical \ninsurance.\n  This is not something that we should allow to remain a problem. In \n2001, when I became aware of the plight of some seriously disabled \ncadets and midshipmen from the service academies, I asked for a study. \nThese cadets were discharged from the Armed Forces without any \nentitlement to future medical care or disability benefits. In each of \nthese cases, the cadets and midshipmen had been injured in the line of \nduty.\n  I asked for a report, and the Department of Defense did find that the \nROTC also had examples of how the health care system, which currently \noperates under the Department of Labor, does not adequately serve these \nformer cadets whose care was under their charge.\n  In one case, a ROTC cadet received dental injuries during training at \nthe Fort Lewis advanced camp for the U.S. Army. As a result of his \ninjuries, he received emergency medical treatment at Fort Lewis but \nrequired followup treatment at a civilian treatment facility. The only \ndentist who would see the cadet treated him and received $13 on the \n$1,200 bill that was submitted. The dentist attempted to work in \nconjunction with the cadet and the ROTC unit for nearly a year to \nreceive full payment for his work, and he never did.\n  So the amendment I offer today would include academy cadets and \nmidshipmen in the military disability discharge and retirement system \nso that they can also receive necessary health and dental benefits, and \nfor ROTC cadets it would transfer responsibility for medical claims \nfrom the Department of Labor to the Department of Defense, authorizing \nthe use of supplemental health care programs in the TRICARE management \nagency. While no additional benefits would be provided to ROTC \nparticipants, the change would ensure a better quality of health care.\n  This amendment is fair to academy cadets, midshipmen, and ROTC cadets\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\nwho are injured while in the performance of military training. It would \nprovide health and disability benefits to those who currently receive \nnone if they are midshipmen and academy cadets. It also ensures a \ncredible health care system widely accepted by health care providers \nfor those currently covered under the less effective OWC program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and Department of Defense estimate \nthese changes will cost approximately $460,000 a year. So this is a \nvery small amount of money required to provide care for those who are \nin training to serve our country.\n  The bottom line is these ROTC cadets who are injured in military \ntraining would be able to receive health care if they need it as a \nfollowup, after the emergency treatment from that training accident. \nThis provides that they can go from the Department of Labor to the \nDepartment of Defense to receive better quality and more experienced \nhealth care coverage.\n  Regarding those midshipmen and cadets in our military academies, it \nwould allow those who have to be severed from the academies because of \ntheir injuries, because they are no longer physically able to \nbecome members of the armed services, if they are injured in military \ntraining, that they would be able to receive the health care and the \ndisability payments to which they would be entitled. It would go to the \nVeterans Affairs Department for them to determine what kind of \ndisability and how much of a disability, just as those in the armed \nservices do today. I think it is the fair thing.\n\n  It is the result of a study that I requested. So I believe it is my \nresponsibility to try to correct the problems that were found in the \nstudy and treat these young ROTC cadets and those wonderful young \npeople who are in our military academies and in the Naval Academy and \nCoast Guard--that they would also be able to receive health care if \nthey are injured and would be able to receive a disability payment if \nthey are severed from the academy.\n  I ask at the appropriate time I have a vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Shall we ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, so I understand it, I would like to hear \nagain from the distinguished proponent of the amendment. Clearly, the \nmidshipmen at the Naval Academy, cadets at West Point and the Air Force \nAcademy, get very clear treatment. I want to clarify exactly what the \ncollege ROTC, NROTC, Air Force ROTC--what is it they get? Is it less \nthan the midshipmen?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. First, let me say with regard to the academy----\n  Mr. WARNER. This bill goes a long way to improve it, as I read it. I \nwant to make it clear. I don't want to raise expectations too high.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me say, as regards the academy members first----\n  Mr. WARNER. The three service academies.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Of course they get health care--treatment for their \ninjury. But assume their injury then keeps them from being able to stay \nat the academy; they have to be let go because they no longer can \nperform the physical functions. Then they go into the private sector \nand their health care continuity would be assured under this amendment \nas they would get a small disability as well because they were in \ntraining.\n  ROTC, today, does give health care benefits if they are injured in \ntraining, but it is under the Department of Labor, and it is under \nworkers' compensation. There has been a dissatisfaction with the kind \nof treatment they have been able to receive, and the Department of \nLabor and workers' compensation doesn't have the same understanding of \na military injury. All we are doing--and this costs absolutely \nnothing--we are just transferring the benefit from the Department of \nLabor to the Department of Defense so these young people would be able \nto get continued health care for whatever their injury was when it was \nin the line of duty.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that is exceedingly helpful. I \ncommend the distinguished Senator. My notes show she started back in \n2001 on this issue, and at that time we reached a consensus that we \nwould let the Department of Defense issue a report. That comprehensive \nreport was issued the 1st of May in 2003.\n\n  Again, I thank the Senator for bringing it to the Senate's attention. \nI urge all Senators to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman. I appreciate that very much. I \nappreciate very much the ability to work with his staff and with the \nminority staff as well to assure that we were doing exactly what we \nwanted to do in the narrow area to which this corresponds. I thank the \nchairman and look forward to having a favorable vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague.\n  I would like to say a few additional words, but I will defer to our \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan if he would like to speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas for her \nleadership. She has been very patient and has allowed us to be very \nthorough. As a result, I think the amendment which she sponsors is very \nvalid, and not only will pass overwhelmingly, hopefully for the good it \ndoes, but also will make it through conference. I commend her for her \ntenacity on this issue. I hope it is successful. It fills some gaps \nwhich need to be filled.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan. I also commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan as well as the distinguished \nchairman of the committee for producing an excellent bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have gone through the report in support \nof this amendment issued by the Department of Defense. I find the \nhistory very interesting. There are four academies because the Coast \nGuard is very much included.\n  Until the enactment of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, \ndisability retirement was a prerequisite of commissioned officer \nservices. The most significant reform of the provisions of this \nlegislation was the inclusion of enlisted personnel within the group \neligible for benefits. Prior to 1949, cadets and midshipmen, as well as \nthe enlisted personnel in the Armed Forces, were denied disability \nbenefits. It is amazing to think back about how that could have been \npossible.\n  There is no record of cadet disability being seriously considered \nuntil the review of pay and benefits that led to the Career \nCompensation Act of 1949. At that time, however, it is clear that \nCongress established a policy that exists today. During the hearings on \nH.R. 5007, which became the act of 1949, the following colloquy \noccurred before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Senator Baldwin asked:\n\n       On page 63, in the provisions of the law as written here, \n     with reference to retirement for disability, does service at \n     the Coast Guard Academy, Annapolis, and West Point--is that \n     included in the period of service?\n       Admiral Fechteler. Now----\n       The Chairman. Suppose a man is disabled while he is at the \n     Naval Academy or the Coast Guard Academy or at West Point; \n     suppose he breaks his leg in such a fashion that he cannot \n     walk well any more, and you gentlemen decide that he is \n     unfit? What happens to him if he is in one of the three \n     academices?\n       Admiral Fechteler. He is just discharged.\n       The Chairman. Does he get any severance pay?\n       Admiral Fechteler. No, Sir.\n       The Chairman. He is just out of luck?\n       Admiral Fechteler. That is right.\n       The Chairman. Through no fault of his own, while actively \n     engaged in the curriculum prescribed for these men?\n       Admiral Fechteler. He still gets nothing.\n       Senator Baldwin. I would hat to see a good back for the \n     Navy going around an Army end for a touchdown, break his leg \n     and come to such an end.\n       Senator Chapman. That is the present law?\n       Admiral Fechteler. That would continue under this.\n       The Chairman. That is an interesting observation, \n     nevertheless.\n\n  For some reason, they went ahead and exempted these young men, the \nmidshipmen in the ROTC. And now, many years later, the Senator from \nTexas very wisely has corrected our predecessors, I say to Senator \nLevin, who allowed this to slip these many years. I think it is an \ninteresting chapter in history.\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I ask unanimous consent \nthat at 5:30 today the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nHutchison amendment with no amendments in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; I further ask unanimous consent that the time until 5:30 \nbe equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Topeka Board \nof Education.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to honor two outstanding Virginians \nwho played key roles in this historic decision. Those two men are \nSpottswood W. Robinson III and Oliver W. Hill.\n  It is hard to imagine that only fifty years ago separate but equal \nunder the 1896 Supreme Court decision, Plessy v. Ferguson, was allowed \nto be the law of the land in the United States. It is hard to imagine \nthat not so long ago, in many States, Black children and White children \nwere forbidden from learning in the same classroom or even the same \nschool. It is regretful to think that only fifty years ago there were \nstill those who believed people should be judged by the color of their \nskin rather than the content of their character.\n  In the historic Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the highest court in the United States ruled unanimously \nthat ``separate but equal'' education facilities for African-American \nchildren were a violation of the United States Constitution. This \nsingle decision opened the door for equal treatment of all Americans, \nregardless of race; an idea enshrined in the spirit of our \nConstitution, but, at the time, not properly reflected in our laws.\n  Eight year-old Linda Brown surely did not know how historic her \nactions would be--she simply wanted to attend the nearby school with \nher friends. But instead, she was forced to attend a ``separate'' \nfacility with Topeka's other African-American children.\n  Chief Justice Earl Warren's decision for the Court was eloquent:\n\n       Today, education is perhaps the most important function of \n     State and local governments. . . . It is the very foundation \n     of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in \n     awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for \n     later professional training, and in helping him to adjust \n     normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful \n     that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life \n     if he is denied the opportunity of an education. The Court \n     concluded that ``in the field of public education, the \n     doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place; separate \n     educational facilities are inherently unequal.\n\n  So here we are on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Court's \ndecision and I would like to honor these two great Virginians, Judge \nSpottswood Robinson III and Mr. Oliver W. Hill. Both of these valiant \ngentlemen devoted their lives, energy, and resources to ensure that all \nAmericans are afforded an equal opportunity in every aspect of American \nlife.\n  My predecessor, as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the \nHonorable L. Douglas Wilder, rightfully described Judge Spottswood \nRobinson as ``one of those unsung and little noticed giants'' of the \ncivil rights movement. Born in Richmond, VA, on July 26, 1918, to a \nmiddle-class African-American family known for its presence in the \nbusiness community, Spottswood Robinson learned from his father and his \ngrandfather that honesty and hard work lead to success.\n  Spottswood Robinson was an academic leader at segregated Armstrong \nHigh School, excelled as an undergraduate at Virginia Union University, \na historically Black college and Howard University, another \nhistorically Black college. He graduated from the Howard School of Law \nin 1937.\n\n  One might ask, ``why did he go to Howard University? Howard \nUniversity is in Washington, DC.'' The sad fact was, he could not get a \nlegal education in his home Commonwealth of Virginia. There were no \nlegal or law opportunities for Blacks in Virginia. At Howard, though, \nhe excelled and scored the highest scholastic average ever achieved at \nthe school. He later stated that ``one of the things drilled into my \nhead was . . . this legal education that you are getting is not just \nfor you, it was for everybody. So when you leave here, you want to put \nit to good use.''\n  Spottswood Robinson certainly did put his knowledge to good use. \nSpottswood Robinson was considered the architect of the legal plans to \novercome the closing of public schools in Prince Edward County, VA. He \nalso used his knowledge to lay the groundwork for the monumental case \nof Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia. In this case involving \nsegregation on the Greyhound buslines, Robinson advocated a unique \nlegal proposition that segregation imposed by the Greyhound Bus Company \nviolated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution which was a departure \nfrom the legal theory that the 14th amendment due process clause would \nbe invoked. His deft use of the Commerce Clause gave the Civil Rights \ncause a historic success.\n  After Judge Spottswood Robinson gave up his law practice in 1960, he \nwas asked to be the Dean of the Howard University School of Law. In \n1964, President John F. Kennedy selected Judge Robinson to be the first \nAfrican American to be appointed to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia. In 1966, Judge Robinson became the first African \nAmerican to be appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit when he was appointed by then-President Johnson. On \nMay 7, 1981, Judge Robinson became the first African American to serve \nas chief judge of the Circuit Court of District of Columbia. He retired \nin 1992 and he died in 1998 at the age of 82 in his Richmond, Virginia \nhome.\n  Another key Virginian in the civil rights movement was Oliver W. \nHill. His life story is one of endless pursuit of justice and fairness. \nMr. Hill was also born in Richmond, VA, in 1907. From the start, Mr. \nOliver Hill epitomized excellence in all endeavors. He also attended \nHoward University where he received his undergraduate and law degrees, \ngraduating second only to the future Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood \nMarshall. In 1948, Mr. Hill was elected the first African-American \nmember of the Richmond City Council since reconstruction.\n  As part of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, these two gentlemen, \nSpottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill, played instrumental roles in \nlitigating cases that resulted in the Supreme Court's decision in Brown \nv. Board of Education. They were the two key litigators for the \nVirginia portion of this case which was styled Davis v. County School \nBoard of Prince Edward County. They joined other civil rights attorneys \nJustice Thurgood Marshall and Mr. Jack Greenberg in representing those \nwho firmly believed that ``Separate but Equal'' was not the American \nway.\n  The historic efforts of these men positively changed our nation. In \n1999, the United States Congress recognized Oliver Hill's efforts by \nawarding him the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom. Mr. Hill's medal reads:\n\n       A courageous civil rights advocate, Oliver Hill has devoted \n     his life to building a more just and inclusive America. As a \n     trial lawyer, he won landmark cases that secured equal rights \n     for African-Americans in education, employment, housing, \n     voting and jury selection. Successfully litigating one of the \n     school desegregation cases later decided by the Supreme Court \n     in Brown v. Board of Education, he played a key role in \n     overturning the ``separate but equal'' doctrine.\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\n  In addition to being awarded the prestigious Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, Mr. Hill's efforts have been recognized by organizations and \ninstitutions in Virginia and across the nation. In 1983, students at my \nalma mater, the University of Virginia, founded the Oliver W. Hill \nBlack Pre-Law Association. In 1992, Mr. Hill was honored with Dominion \nPower's ``Strong Men and Women'' award. Each year the Virginia State \nConference of the NAACP awards the ``Oliver W. Hill Freedom Fighter \nAward'' to an outstanding civil rights advocate. In 2001, the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers presented Mr. Hill with the ``Award for \nCourageous Advocacy.'' Each year the Old Dominion Bar Association \nawards the Oliver W. Hill Scholarship to outstanding Virginians \nentering Virginia law schools. A bronze bust of Mr. Hill is proudly \ndisplayed at the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia.\n  As with Spottswood Robinson, these honors and eminent awards were \nrightly bestowed on a man who exemplified character and perseverance in \nthe face of adversity and injustice.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has progressed in large part due to brave, \ntenacious and brilliant individuals like Spottswood Robinson and Oliver \nHill. I believe that I speak for the entire nation in saying to Oliver \nHill and the family of Judge Spottswood Robinson, how grateful we are \nfor their commitment to the American ideals of equality, fairness and \njustice.\n  As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of this historic decision, we \nmust always remember that our Nation was founded upon the idea and \nproposition that ``all men are created equal,'' and we must ensure that \nour Nation's policies properly reflect this commitment to equality of \nopportunity ``regardless of one's race, ethnicity, gender or religious \nbeliefs.''\n  ``For his unyielding efforts to improve the lives of his fellow \nAmericans and his unwavering dedication to justice for all, our Nation \nhonors Oliver Hill.''\n  In addition to being awarded the prestigious Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, Mr. Hill's efforts have been recognized by organizations and \ninstitutions in Virginia and across our Nation.\n  In 1983, students at my alma mater, the University of Virginia, \nfounded the Oliver W.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business and the time be charged to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Compensation for Negro League Baseball Players\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on the occasion of the 50th \nanniversary of Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, I am happy to \nannounce to the Senate I have come from Tampa, FL, where I made an \nannouncement of some significance today. Seated with two Negro League \nballplayers--a pitcher from the Kansas City Monarchs, Bob Mitchell, and \na pitcher from the Indianapolis Clowns, Mr. Maddox--we were happy to \nannounce, with a representative of Commissioner Bud Selig present, the \nfirst compensation for the Negro League players who were kept out of \nthe Major Leagues, because segregation did not end with Jackie Robinson \nbreaking the color barrier in 1947. Indeed, Major League Baseball was \nnot integrated until the late 1950s.\n  When Commissioner Selig, in 1997, decided to do something about the \ninequity of the Negro League players never having been compensated--but \nthe criteria was based on the principle they would be compensated if \nthey had played in the Negro Leagues before 1947 and in the Majors \nafter--today the principle was established by Major League Baseball \nthat, in fact, the Majors were not integrated until the late 1950s. The \ncompensation plan we announced will be for the Negro Leaguers who still \nplayed the same amount of time--4 years--but played 4 years in the \nMajors before the end of the 1958 season. Therefore, they, too, will be \ncompensated.\n  Why is this important? It is important because of the sad fact of our \nNation's history of segregation. There was tremendous talent in the \nNegro Leagues. We know of those such as Hank Aaron who came out of the \nNegro Leagues, and Jackie Robinson, the first to come out of the Negro \nLeagues into the Majors. We know of the home-run king, Hank Aaron, and \nwhat all he has meant to the game. But there were many other players \nwho had fantastic talent but who were never able to break into the \nMajor Leagues after Jackie Robinson because of the color barrier.\n  So with this announcement today, it is giving new life to those \nplayers who are now quite elderly. Also, Major League Baseball has been \nkind enough to recognize there will be a survivor benefit since many of \nthese players are now getting on to the age of the twilight of their \nlives. For the period of time in which this compensation is available, \nit will also be available to their surviving spouse.\n  It has been such a privilege, and it is interesting, one of the great \njoys of public service is sometimes you are in the right place at the \nright time. I found myself in that position, having been elected to the \nSenate in the 2000 election. In 2001, I got a letter from Mr. Mitchell. \nHe was asking for help, so we went to work on it. I met with him and a \ngroup of a half dozen of the old Negro League players. I told them I \nwas going to go to work on this issue. And I say that with a great \nsense of personal satisfaction of knowing sometimes you are in the \nright place at the right time, to kind of move the ball along toward \nprogress.\n  I have given several speeches on the floor of this Senate. I have \nbrought it up in several committee hearings, more recent of which was \nabout 2 months ago, with Commissioner Selig sitting there, of where we \ncould discuss Major League Baseball's intent to provide for this \ncompensation.\n  So one thing after another, with a lot of people working together, \nthis is a happy day. I say it is coincidental, but it is a significant \ncoincidence that it happens on the day of the 50th anniversary of the \nBrown v. Board of Education landmark Supreme Court decision.\n  As I have met with these baseball players who played in the old Negro \nLeagues, I have asked them: How good were you? And I would talk to the \nshortstops, but it was most revealing when I would talk to the \npitchers, just like Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Maddox, who stood up with me \ntoday in making this announcement in Tampa. I asked: How good were you? \nThey would look at me, and that big smile would break out on their \nface, and they would say: Senator, listen, we would smoke 'em. They \ncouldn't hold a candle to us.\n  And I would say: Give me an example. And they would say: Today, they \npitch four, five, maybe six innings. We would pitch nine straight \ninnings, and we would still have the reserve to keep going.\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\n  Finally, what a happy day this is for a lot of them who are now \neligible to receive this compensation. What a happy day it is for me \nand my staff, who have worked so hard people over the past 3 years. \nWhat a happy day it is for Commissioner Bud Selig, who has wanted to do \nthe right thing because he knew it was the right thing.\n  I am glad to bring a little bit of good news to this august body of \nwhich I am very privileged to be a Member.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I see no one on either side \nof the aisle seeking recognition. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3152, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 10, 2003, Bart Browne approached several men congregating \noutside an Albany, NY, gay bar. It is alleged that Browne hated gays \nand thus felt justified in sucker-punching one of the gay men in the \nface. The force of the single strike broke the 28-year-old victim's \njaw, caused a permanent loss of feeling in his left cheek and \neradicated the sense of smell in that nostril, prosecutors said. \nFearing further assaults for being gay, according to prosecutors, the \nvictim moved away from the area. Browne faces a hate crimes sentence of \nup to 4 years in state prison.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5529-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5529-S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HARKIN-HAGEL IDEA MANDATORY FULL FUNDING AMENDENT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support and as a cosponsor \nof the Harkin-Hagel amendment to provide mandatory full funding for the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA.\n  This amendment will provide mandatory increases in funding of $2.2 \nbillion per year for the next 6 years and help us meet the needs of the \napproximately 6.5 million children served under IDEA.\n  Without full funding, we cannot realize the true promise of this \nlaw--a free, appropriate public education for all children with \ndisabilities.\n  Living up to this commitment is not just an important goal; it is a \nnecessity if we are to ensure that all children have an opportunity to \nsucceed. Likewise, we must provide schools with the resources they need \nto make this happen.\n  When IDEA was first adopted in 1975, Congress committed to paying 40 \npercent of the cost of providing special education services. Sadly, \nafter 28 years, we are only at 19 percent.\n  The President's fiscal year 2005 budget fails to fully fund IDEA, \nproposing to increase IDEA by only $1 billion--an amount that falls far \nshort of our commitment. Across this country, there is growing \nfrustration over the lack of education resources. The No Child Left \nBehind Act has only exacerbated such frustrations.\n  Our school districts are striving to provide a high quality education \nfor all children but don't have the adequate resources to do the job.\n  As a result, parents of children with disabilities, who only want to \nensure their child gets the education they deserve and need, are forced \nto fight for the very programs and services to make that possible.\n  For too long, we have forced school districts and schools to pit \nchildren against children.\n  For too long, we have forced parents of children with disabilities to \nbattle principals, schools districts, and other parents for limited \neducational resources.\n  Schools urgently need the resources to fulfill the promise of IDEA, \nand they deserve better than this.\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\n  Our schools--and the students with disabilities that they teach--also \ndeserve highly qualified and skilled educators.\n  For special educators, regular educators, principals, and others who \nprovide education and related services to students with disabilities \nthe need for action is clear:\n  47 percent of students with disabilities, ages 6-21, spend 79 percent \nor more of their time in regular classes.\n  98 percent of school districts report meeting the growing demand for \nspecial education teachers as a top priority.\n  An estimated 600,000 special education students are taught by \nunqualified or underqualified teachers nationwide.\n  Each year about one-third of special education program faculty \nopenings are unfilled.\n  The Personnel Excellence for Students with Disabilities Act, which I \nintroduced last year, seeks to address this critical area of need--\nensuring that all students with disabilities are served by highly \nqualified and skilled teachers, education personnel and related service \nproviders.\n\n  I am pleased that many of the provisions of my bill have been \nincorporated into S. 1248.\n  Together, we can ensure that children with disabilities have access \nto a high-quality, free, appropriate public education, and that the law \ntruly reflects the needs of parents, teachers, principals, and related \npersonnel.\n  Governors, State legislators, superintendents, principals, teachers, \nand parents are all unified in support of mandatory full funding of \nIDEA.\n  Now, instead of the empty votes and broken promises of the past, \nanother opportunity to meet our commitment is upon us. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for the Harkin-Hagel amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5530-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5530-S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONFLICT IN DARFUR, SUDAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \ndevastating conflict in the Darfur region of Western Sudan. Over the \npast 14 months more than 1 million people have been displaced by the \nscorched earth campaign waged by the Sudanese armed forces and \n`janjaweed' militia. The number of refugees grows daily. The situation \nis hardly improving, despite recent attention.\n  I am pleased that earlier this month the Senate was able to agree to \nS. Con. Res. 99, which condemns the Government of the Republic of Sudan \nfor its participation and complicity in the attacks against innocent \ncivilians in the Darfur region. But I must caution my colleagues that \nwe cannot consider this matter over and dealt with. We must keep \nabreast of ongoing developments in Darfur and continue to look for ways \nto bring an end to the conflict.\n  With that goal in mind, I would like to draw to the attention of my \ncolleagues an enlightening article by Laurie Garrett, published in the \nMay 10 edition of the Los Angeles Times. The op-ed focuses on possible \nconsequences of the Darfur conflict which have largely been overlooked. \nMs. Garrett explains that along with the horrid campaign of rape and \nmurder perpetrated by the militia, those rapists and murderers are \nlikely spreading disease among their victims and themselves.\n  When Ms. Garrett speaks of disease, she does not mean the common \ncold. She is talking about the most vicious and deadly infections known \nto man. Darfur is located in a region of Africa believed to be the \norigin of diseases like HIV, ebola, and West Nile virus, to name only a \nfew. The reason we know the names of these diseases is not because they \nstayed confined to remote villages and tribes of Africa. These are \ndiseases which grew rampant and spread across deserts and oceans to \nreach the farthest outposts of our Nation and the rest of the world.\n  While some may have difficulty imagining the horrors of a conflict \nfar away in a remote part of Sudan, it is much easier to imagine \nconsequences on our home soil. The possibility is very real that the \nrape campaign in Darfur could take a disease, previously confined to a \nsingle remote village, and spread it throughout the militia, their \nvictims, and the rest of the world. This is a possibility which should \nnot be ignored.\n  Along with many of my colleagues, I have worked very hard to combat \nthe global epidemic of AIDS and will continue to do so until we have \nconquered that horrible disease. Laurie Garrett's warning is that our \nAIDS effort is not enough. We must do everything we can to prevent \nanother AIDS or another West Nile from ravaging people around the \nworld. Bringing a swift end to the conflict in Sudan will reduce the \nchance of a new and devastating infection being introduced into the \ninternational population.\n  I praise Ms. Garrett for bringing attention to the role of disease in \nthe Darfur conflict and I hope that her article serves as yet another \nreminder that we must continue to push for peace in Sudan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Laurie Garrett's op-ed in the May 10 \nedition of the Los Angeles Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objectin, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 10, 2004]\n\n                         The Microbes of Mayhem\n\n                          (By Laurie Garrett)\n\n       As the horrors of Sudan's ethnic conflict mount, \n     opportunities for pathogenic microbes--germs that could \n     threaten people all over the world--rise in tandem. War and \n     disease are often a matched set in Africa, with terrifying \n     results: If the fighting doesn't kill you, disease very well \n     could. And without outside help to stop the cycle, the \n     devastating results will only spread.\n       In the Darfur region of western Sudan, an estimated 1 \n     million ethnic-African Sudanese are refugees, the targets of \n     government troops and horseback janjaweed militia--ethnic \n     Arabs--who are torching and raping their way across hundreds \n     of miles of poor farmland.\n       It is almost impossible to overstate how remote this region \n     is. Permission to legally visit the area is rarely granted by \n     the Sudanese government. So scientists know very little about \n     the area's plants and animals, much less its microbes. But \n     what they can surmise is frightening.\n       Darfur is just 500 miles north of N'zara, where scientists \n     believe the often lethal West Nile virus (which has now \n     spread to nearly every state in the United States) resides. \n     In 1976, N'zara also was the site of a major outbreak of the \n     deadly Ebola virus. And across Sudan's southern border, \n     Uganda is believed to be ground zero for the global AIDS \n     epidemic. The circumstances of West Nile's spread remain a \n     mystery, but the Ebola outbreak and the AIDS epidemic owe a \n     great deal to the treacherous mixing of war, refugees and \n     microbes.\n       In 1976, an international team of scientists was in \n     Yambuku, Zaire, doing battle with the world's first known \n     epidemic of Ebola, a virus that causes uncontrollable \n     bleeding. Ebola was rare, to say the least, so the scientists \n     were stunned to hear rumors of another outbreak in N'zara.\n       American disease detective Dr. Joe McCormick drove a Land \n     Rover across more than 400 miles of unmarked terrain to \n     confirm the outbreak. To this day, however, scientists have \n     no idea exactly how Ebola emerged in N'zara, or whether the \n     virus normally inhabits the area. But they do know that \n     ethnic warfare was underway in the region.\n       Most likely, infected animals--bats, perhaps--had taken up \n     residence inside buildings in the area, probably as a result \n     of human encroachment into the animals' normal habitat and \n     changes in local weather patterns. It is believed that \n     starving local residents hunted and ate infected animals, and \n     once humans were infected, Ebola spread swiftly, thanks to \n     the dire conditions in the region's war-torn hospitals and \n     clinics, where needles were reused and sterile techniques \n     were virtually unheard of.\n       As for HIV, it also can be traced to the 1970s and another \n     ethnic-cleansing campaign in the same region of Africa. \n     Ugandan strongman Idi Amin set his soldiers against tribes in \n     the Rakai district, with rape as a primary weapon. When the \n     conflict spilled over into Tanzania, so did the rape, and \n     when Tanzania's army repulsed Amin's forces, it carried out \n     its own campaign of rape in turn. As it happened, however, \n     another form of revenge spread along with the rape: HIV.\n       The genetic history of HIV shows that the virus made its \n     first leap to our species from a primate--probably a \n     chimpanzee--some seven decades ago. But in traditional \n     village settings across Africa, the virus did not readily \n     spread, and less than 1% of any society is thought to have \n     been infected before the mid-1970s. It took a catastrophic \n     event, like Amin's brutal campaign, to amplify the rare virus \n     into a pandemic.\n       Today, as then, a chief horror of the Darfur campaign is \n     the militias' raping of women and girls. They brand their \n     victims' foreheads so that all will know that the women and \n     their potential offspring are tainted. Nobody knows how \n     prevalent HIV is in the Darfur region (Khartoum has never \n     allowed surveys of the area). In the Muslim north, surveys of \n     pregnant women four years ago revealed that 3% of them were \n     HIV-positive; a N'zara-area survey found infection rates \n     twice as high. It isn't unreasonable to suspect that the \n     current Darfur ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign is spreading the \n     disease, not only among the people of Darfur and their\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\n     janjaweed rapists but also among refugees in camps in \n     neighboring Chad. It is equally reasonable to posit that some \n     other previously obscure sexually transmitted disease could \n     be amplified to epidemic proportions via the bodies of the \n     women of Darfur.\n       And there is yet another chapter in the region's disease \n     history that has a bearing on what's happening in Darfur. Ten \n     years ago, the world stood by as hundreds of thousands were \n     murdered in Rwanda and thousands more died in the refugee \n     camps. Initially, overwhelmed local medical workers believed \n     that the disease causing many of the deaths was cholera. But \n     it wasn't chiefly cholera that ravaged the refugee camps; it \n     was shigella, bacteria that cause dysentery. Amid the ongoing \n     violence and the chaos of the camps, black market antibiotics \n     were taken indiscriminately. Instead of curing the bacteria, \n     the uncontrolled use of antibiotics created a brand new fully \n     drug-resistant strain that still plagues Africa.\n       Surely it is in our collective interest, in light of this \n     sorry history, to pay heed to those who implore us to save \n     Darfur, to stop the rape, to resettle the refugees, to end \n     the chaos that breeds disease. Even if we cannot find Sudan \n     on a map or have no room left in our hearts to bear witness \n     to another war, we surely understand that deadly microbes are \n     our problem, as well as theirs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5531-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN SUPPORT OF S. 2420\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following letters in relation to the May 13, 2004 introduction of \nthe SCHIP Expansion Act, S. 2420, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2004.\n     The Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Senate Hart Office Building 524, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Children's Defense Fund shares \n     your goal of strengthening the State Children's Health \n     Insurance program (SCHIP). The SCHIP program provided \n     coverage to 5.8 million children in 2003, but the latest data \n     indicate that there are still approximately 8-9 million \n     uninsured children, the majority of whom are currently \n     eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP.\n       To cover these eligible, uninsured children states will \n     need to further simplify their Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment \n     and especially retention processes. They will also need \n     additional federal resources. The SCHIP Expansion Act of 2004 \n     would provide $18 billion in additional federal SCHIP funds \n     and would also encourage states to adopt important Medicaid \n     and SCHIP improvements such as continuous eligibility and \n     passive renewal. In addition, your bill would, appropriately, \n     prevent states with unspent federal SCHIP funds from capping \n     or freezing program enrollment.\n       We look forward to working with you to enact legislation \n     that will provide strong incentives for states to elect \n     currently available options to streamline Medicaid and SCHIP \n     enrollment and retention, and will discourage states from \n     restricting enrollment in the SCHIP program.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Emil Parker,\n     Director of Health, Children's Defense Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Catholic Charities USA,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 13, 2004.\n       Dear Senator Graham: As a strong supporter of Medicaid and \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), \n     Catholic Charities USA would like to express our support for \n     the SCHIP Expansion Act of 2004. We thank you for sponsoring \n     this vital piece of legislation that we believe represents a \n     critical step in providing coverage to all uninsured \n     children.\n       We are especially pleased that the SCHIP Expansion Act of \n     2004 directly addresses the problem of health care access \n     that millions of uninsured children face by providing new \n     state options to expand SCHIP to all uninsured children \n     regardless of income. This legislation will help ensure \n     children's access to primary and preventive health care, \n     enabling them to grow up healthy and participate in their \n     communities.\n       We also support the provisions in the SCHIP Expansion Act \n     of 2004 that would provide a higher federal SCHIP match to \n     those states who streamline the enrollment process by \n     implementing presumptive eligibility, twelve-month continuous \n     enrollment, elimination of the asset test, and passive \n     renewal. These simplification measures will allow families to \n     gain quicker access to the health care they need.\n       In addition, we are pleased that this legislation restores \n     federal funding allotments to pre-2002 SCHIP funding levels, \n     which will enable states to continue to enroll and cover even \n     more uninsured children.\n       Catholic Charities agencies work nationally and at the \n     state level to ensure as many eligible children as possible \n     are enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP. We believe that it is \n     critically important to ensure that poor and low-income \n     children and families have access to the health care they so \n     vitally need.\n       We thank you for introducing this legislation as we believe \n     it represents an important step towards reducing the number \n     of uninsured children in country and reducing the barriers to \n     health care that many families face.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                      Sharon Daly,\n     Vice President, Social Policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5531-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COASTAL WETLANDS EROSION IN LOUISIANA\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the children of the \nTerrebonne Parish School System in Houma, LA, for writing to me about \nthe dire effects of coastal erosion on their State. As part of the \nHouma-Terrebonne Chamber of Commerce's Save Our Soil Campaign, students \nfrom the Terrebonne Parish are writing letters to important State and \nFederal officials regarding the coastal land loss crisis in Louisiana. \nI truly appreciate their efforts and will do my part to support \nrestoration in all of our Nation's coastal States.\n  Coastal erosion is an urgent problem in the United States, costing \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year, including damage caused by \nstorms and flooding, costs of erosion prevention, and expenses to \ndredge channels and harbors. In Louisiana alone, wetland loss could \ncost the Nation $36.6 billion. The Atlantic and Gulf coasts account for \n45 percent of the U.S. coastline and they are home to 63 percent of the \nstructures within 500 feet of the shoreline. According to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, the Nation's highest average erosion \nrates--up to 6 feet or more per year--occur along the Gulf of Mexico \ncoastline, while the average erosion rate on the Atlantic coast is \nabout 2 to 3 feet per year. A hurricane or other major storm can cause \nthe coast to erode 100 feet or more in a single day.\n  This rate of erosion is unacceptable. As the Terrebonne students \nknow, wetlands and barrier islands provide natural protection from \nstrong winds and hurricanes. Coastal zones are ecologically \nsignificant, providing safe and healthy habitat for an abundance of \nmigratory birds and other wildlife. Our Nation's commercial and \nrecreational fisheries are dependent on the many species of fish and \nother aquatic organisms that spawn and nest in this delicate web of \nmarshes, wetlands, and estuaries.\n  It is my sincere hope that through the Water Resources Development \nAct we will be able to conserve our remaining wetlands and restore many \nacres of precious coastline in Louisiana. I am grateful to the citizens \nof Terrebonne Parish for educating their children and fighting for the \ncoastal restoration of Louisiana. We cannot stand to lose more of this \nprevious natural resource.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5531-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mesages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5531-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5531-5", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5531-S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n                        RESPECT TO BURMA--PM 77\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Maine \n     relative to the Farm-to-Cafeteria Projects Act; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, in the past 30 years childhood obesity rates in \n     the United States have doubled in our children and tripled in \n     our adolescents due to poor eating habits, and obesity can \n     contribute to increased likelihood of developing diabetes, \n     high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and clogging of \n     the arteries; and\n       Whereas, school cafeterias serve millions of children \n     breakfast, snacks and lunch every day and struggle to \n     maintain services in light of diminished budgets at the \n     local, state and federal levels; and\n       Whereas, in May of 2003, the Economic Research Service of \n     the United States Department of Agriculture released an \n     evaluation of the Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program, which, \n     according to the report, worked to change immediately \n     children's fruit and vegetable consumption, improve \n     children's health, create a healthier school environment and \n     supply a positive model for children's diets; and\n       Whereas, agriculture sustains rural communities, protects \n     open space, creates scenic vistas and protects water recharge \n     areas; and\n       Whereas, the northeastern states have a traditional system \n     of small and midsized producers of agricultural products \n     located close to the towns, villages and urban centers where \n     the majority of the 58 million consumers reside;\n       Whereas, programs that link local farms to school \n     cafeterias are reconnecting urban American with local \n     agriculture in every state where they operate and providing a \n     unique opportunity to make local agriculture relevant to the \n     majority of the American population that now resides in urban \n     and suburban\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge \n     passage of the Farm-to-Cafeteria Projects Act and any other \n     legislation that will accomplish these goals: to assist \n     schools in purchasing locally grown food, to provide more \n     healthy and fresh foods for schoolchildren, to educate \n     children and their families about the foods that are grown in \n     their own communities and to expand market opportunities for \n     local farms, ensuring that regional agriculture continue to \n     be viable and available to provide a safe, secure food supply \n     to all consumers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticate by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture and the Northeast \n     States Association for Agricultural Stewardship and to each \n     Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-434. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky relative to First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                         Concurrent Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner was a native of \n     Clinton County, Kentucky, who served with distinction and \n     valor in the United States Army during World War II; and\n       Whereas, Kentucky Congressman Ed Whitfield introduced H.R. \n     327 to the 108th Congress to bestow this highly deserved \n     honor on Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner; and\n       Whereas, Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner is Kentucky's most \n     decorated war hero, who served on the front lines for over \n     eight hundred days in eight major campaigns; he was wounded \n     seven times but returned to combat and continued to fight on \n     the front lines after each wound; and\n       Whereas, during World War II, over forty 3rd Division \n     soldiers received Medals of Honor, more than any other \n     Division; however, Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner was not \n     awarded the medal of Honor due to an oversight and failure to \n     process the paperwork;\n       Whereas, Lieutenant Conner served in the 3rd infantry \n     Division with Audie L. Murphy, America's most decorated hero \n     of all wars; as compared to Audie L. Murphy, Lieutenant \n     Conner was awarded more Silver Stars for acts of valor, \n     fought in more campaigns, served on the front lines longer, \n     and was wounded more times; he was awarded many honors \n     including the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star \n     with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Bronze Star, the Purple \n     Heart with six Oak Leaf Clusters, and other medals; and\n       Whereas, on June 20, 1945, Lieutenant Conner was awarded \n     the Croix de Guerre, the French Medal of Honor, that was also \n     awarded to Sergeant Alvin C. York, America's most decorated \n     World War I soldier, who was a friend of Lieutenant Conner \n     and lived a few miles from Lieutenant Conner's home on the \n     Kentucky-Tennessee border; and\n       Whereas, Major General Lloyd B. Ramsey (Ret.), who was \n     Lieutenant Conner's battalion commander during combat in \n     World War II, is still living and has signed the necessary \n     documents for awarding the Medal of Honor to Lieutenant \n     Conner; in 1945, Major General Ramsey wrote that Lieutenant \n     Conner was ``one of the outstanding soldiers of this war, if \n     not the outstanding. . . . I've never seen a man with as much \n     courage and ability as he has''; and\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\n       Whereas, Stephen Ambrose, America's foremost World War II \n     historian, founder of the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, \n     Louisiana, and author of many books, wrote on November 11, \n     2000, ``I am in complete support of the effort to make \n     Lieutenant Garlin M. Conner a Medal of Honor recipient. What \n     Lieutenant Conner did in stopping the German assault near \n     Houssen, France in January 1945 was far above the call of \n     duty. I've met and talked at length with many Medal of Honor \n     recipients and am sure they would all agree that Lieutenant \n     Conner more than deserves the honor of joining them''; and\n       Whereas, on April 3, 2001, 3rd Infantry Division leaders \n     named the new EAGLE BASE in Bosnia-Herzegovina after \n     Lieutenant Conner because of his gallantry in World War II \n     and because ``It's a company-grade forward operating base \n     named after a soldier with a company-grade rank''; and\n       Whereas, Richard Chilton, a former Green Beret from Genoa \n     City, Wisconsin, has been on a mission since 1996 to have the \n     Medal of Honor awarded to Lieutenant Conner; his research has \n     documented the Lieutenant Conner is one of the great combat \n     heroes of World War II, equal in every way to Audie L. \n     Murphy; Chilton has made presentations to dozens of schools \n     about Lieutenant Conner's war record and has copies of over \n     2,500 letters written by students to President George W. Bush \n     requesting the Medal of Honor be awarded; after reviewing \n     Chilton's information, a host of former war veterans have \n     written Congress requesting passage of H.R. 327 to award the \n     Medal of Honor to one of America's greatest citizen soldiers, \n     Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Senate \n     concurring therein:\n       Section 1. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of \n     Kentucky urges the House Armed Services Committee as well as \n     the entire United States Congress to adopt H.R. 327 awarding \n     a Medal of Honor posthumously to First Lieutenant Garlin Murl \n     Conner.\n       Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall \n     send a copy of this Resolution to: Congressman Duncan Hunter, \n     Chairman of the Armed Services Committee; the Clerk of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States; the Clerk of \n     the Senate of the United States; each member of the Kentucky \n     Congressional Delegation; and to the widow of 1st Lieutenant \n     Garlin Murl Conner, Mrs. Pauline W. Conner, Route 1, Box 208, \n     Albany, Kentucky 42602.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-435. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to military bases in Maine; to \n     the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, within the year, Secretary of Defense Donald \n     Rumsfeld, through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) \n     Commission, will make recommendations about which military \n     installations are to be considered for closure in cost-\n     cutting measures for the military and has indicated that \n     reductions may total 25% or an estimated 100 bases; and\n       Whereas, the State of Maine has 3 distinct and important \n     military installations that are potentially at risk for \n     closure: the naval shipyard in Kittery, the Naval Air Station \n     Brunswick and the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area \n     Master Station, Atlantic Cutler Detachment; and\n       Whereas, the naval shipyard in Kittery is one of only 4 \n     public shipyards in the Nation, is vital to our maritime \n     strength and is of major importance to 2 states' local \n     economies; and\n       Whereas, Naval Air Station Brunswick is the only fully \n     capable air base in the northeastern United States, does not \n     encroach on the civilian community and has plenty of space \n     for expansion, even for housing other branches of the \n     military. Naval Air Station Brunswick is on the coast, and \n     aircraft can take off and land without flying over major \n     centers of population; and\n       Whereas, the Cutler detachment's primary mission is Very \n     Low Frequency communications with submarines in the Atlantic \n     Ocean and Mediterranean Sea; the installation has the most \n     powerful radio transmitter in the world and is staffed with \n     84 civilian service workers, who ensure the signal stays in \n     the wind to the submarine fleet; and\n       Whereas, the people of the State of Maine have long been at \n     the forefront of our Nation's defense, are first to join and \n     send troops in any conflict and have a strong tradition of \n     support and appreciation for the bases within our borders; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, take this opportunity \n     to convey our appreciation for the advocacy and support for \n     our 3 basses that the Congress of the United States and the \n     Maine Congressional Delegation have provided over the years, \n     and we strongly urge the Congress of the United States to \n     consider the importance of these installations in this time \n     of war on terrorism and the vital need to protect our Nation; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each Member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-436. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Maine relative to emergency responders; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, after September 11, 2001, the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, under the Department of Homeland Security, \n     administered grants to assist local fire departments and \n     emergency responders across the Nation with necessary funds \n     to upgrade and prepare; and\n       Whereas, last year, Maine emergency responders received \n     $10.3 million in grants and hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     have been provided to 23 Maine communities for their fire \n     departments, which have purchased new protective fire-\n     fighting clothing, training programs and materials, air \n     compressors, vehicles and computers; and\n       Whereas, the current proposed federal budget calls for a \n     reduction in funding of the grants from $750 million to $500 \n     million, which will adversely affect communities throughout \n     the State at a time when fire departments are still greatly \n     in need of support; and\n       Whereas, these proposed cuts come at a time when safety and \n     security concerns in Maine and in the Nation are still at a \n     very high level, and the proposed cuts come at a time when we \n     should be remaining vigilant in preparing for emergencies; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, urge the President of \n     the United States and the Congress to work together on this \n     budget and to not cut the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency's funding source; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, urge the President of \n     the United States and the Congress to work together to help \n     ensure that the emergency responders in the State of Maine \n     and throughout the Nation are fully equipped, trained and \n     funded and ready to face all emergencies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     the President of the United States Senate and the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each Member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-437. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to DNA identification information; \n     to the Commission on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 585\n\n       Whereas, DNA technology is increasingly vital to ensuring \n     accuracy and fairness in the criminal justice system; and\n       Whereas, In the late 1980s the Federal Government laid the \n     groundwork for a system of national, state and local DNA \n     databases for the storage and exchange of DNA profiles, known \n     as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS); and\n       Whereas, CODIS maintains DNA profiles in a three-tiered \n     distributed database which is available to law enforcement \n     agencies across the country for law enforce purposes; and\n       Whereas, In order to take advantage of the investigative \n     potential of CODIS, in the late 1980s and early 1990s states \n     began passing laws requiring offenders convicted of certain \n     offenses to provide DNA samples; and\n       Whereas, Currently all 50 states and the Federal Government \n     have laws requiring DNA samples to be collected from \n     specified categories of offenders; and\n       Whereas, The statute governing the national DNA index \n     currently authorizes the inclusion in the index of profiles \n     of ``persons convicted of crimes,'' which is narrower than \n     the scope of DNA collection under existing legal authorities \n     in most jurisdictions within the United States, including the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, As a result of the narrow Federal statutory \n     language, states cannot enter into the national DNA index all \n     the information they collect from their investigations, \n     including DNA information from specified categories of \n     adjudicated juvenile delinquents; and\n       Whereas, As a further result of the narrow Federal \n     statutory language, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot \n     enter certain DNA information that may lead to capture or \n     exoneration for crimes such as murder and rape; therefore be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the \n     United States to amend 42 U.S.C. Sec. 14132(a)(1) to allow \n     the inclusion in CODIS of DNA profiles of ``other persons, \n     whose DNA samples are collected under applicable legal \n     authorities''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-438.

The Senate hereby acknowledge the historical \n     importance of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and \n     encourages each and every member of the respective chambers \n     of the Congress of the United States to cosponsor H.R. 2327 \n     and S. 2018 of the 108th Congress of the United States to \n     extend the length of the trail.\n       Section 2. The Senate encourages the subsequent passage of \n     H.R. 2327 and S. 2018 of the 108th Congress of the United \n     States.\n       Section 3.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the State Waste \n     Empowerment and Enforcement Provision Act of 2003; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 79\n\n       Whereas, recent reports issued by the Department of \n     Environmental Quality reveal that Virginia is currently the \n     second largest importer of municipal solid waste from other \n     states, second only to Pennsylvania, and is currently \n     importing approximately 5.5 million tons annually of \n     municipal solid waste from other states; and\n       Whereas, the amount of municipal solid waste being imported \n     into Virginia is expected to increase in the coming years due \n     to the closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill in New York and \n     increased volumes from other states; and\n       Whereas, the importation of significant amounts of \n     municipal solid waste from other states is prematurely \n     exhausting Virginia's limited landfill capacity; and\n       Whereas, the negative impact of truck, rail, and barge \n     traffic and litter, odors, and noise associated with waste \n     imports occurs at the location of final disposal and along \n     waste transportation routes, and current landfill technology \n     has the potential to fail, leading to long-term cleanup and \n     other associated costs; and\n       Whereas, under current federal law, Virginia cannot \n     regulate the amount of solid waste brought into the \n     Commonwealth each year; and\n       Whereas, the importation of significant amounts of \n     municipal solid waste from other states is inconsistent with \n     Virginia's efforts to promote the Commonwealth as a national \n     and international destination for tourism and high-tech \n     economic development; and\n       Whereas, the Commerce Clause of the United States \n     Constitution and its interpretation and application by the \n     United States Supreme Court and other federal courts \n     regarding interstate solid waste transportation has left \n     Virginia and other states with limited alternatives to \n     regulate, limit, or prohibit the importation of municipal \n     solid waste; and\n       Whereas, the General Assembly of Virginia believes that \n     state and local governments should be given more authority to \n     control the importation of municipal solid waste into their \n     jurisdictions; and\n       Whereas, although state laws governing the importation of \n     municipal solid waste have been ruled to violate the Commerce \n     Clause of the United States Constitution, the enactment of \n     the State Waste Empowerment and Enforcement Provision Act of \n     2003 would protect states from constitutional challenges to \n     common sense regulation of trash haulers, and empower states \n     to require inspectors at landfills, incinerators, and \n     transfer stations that accept out-of-state municipal solid \n     waste; and\n       Whereas, it is the consensus of the General Assembly of \n     Virginia that state and local governments should be given \n     more authority to limit, reduce, and control the importation \n     of solid waste into their jurisdictions through several \n     provisions, including percentage caps, calendar year freezes, \n     the regulation and restriction of certain modes of \n     transportation, the requirement of state inspectors at \n     facilities handling out-of-state waste, and the assessment of \n     fees for the receipt or disposal of out-of-state municipal \n     solid waste that are different than fees assessed for the \n     receipt or disposal of municipal solid waste generated within \n     the Commonwealth; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to enact the \n     State Waste Empowerment and Enforcement Provision Act of 2003 \n     (HR 1123). The Congress is urged to authorize local and state \n     governments to regulate the importation of municipal solid \n     waste into their respective jurisdictions; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, and the members of the Virginia Congressional \n     Delegation so that they may be apprised of the sense of the \n     General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-441. A resolution adopted by the Board of the Town of \n     New Castle of the State of New York relative to the Indian \n     Point Nuclear Plants; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n       POM-442. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii to prices of prescription \n     drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, the Medicare Drug Benefit law recently enacted by \n     Congress and signed into law by the President prohibits the \n     government from negotiating prescription drug prices with the \n     manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, the pharmaceutical companies have been negotiating \n     with other governments such as Canada and Mexico, offering \n     citizens of those countries substantial discounts on \n     prescription drugs, while still generating profits from the \n     discounted prices; and\n       Whereas, news articles have documented that many Americans \n     travel to Canada to purchase their prescription drugs; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing momentum to allow individuals, \n     as well as state and local governments, to lower health care \n     costs by purchasing prescription drugs from Canada; and\n       Whereas, allowing the American government to negotiate \n     prescription drug prices would reduce their costs, as since \n     our purchasing power covers approximately 270 million \n     Americans, which is the largest economy in the world, our \n     government can negotiate lower prices than Canada and other \n     countries and pass on the savings to our citizens; and\n       Whereas, all Americans will be the beneficiaries of \n     discounted prescription drugs, especially those who need \n     prescription drugs for serious health conditions, all group \n     prescription drug programs provided by employers and union \n     agreements, and the state and federal programs that provide \n     prescription drugs to veterans, Medicaid recipients, and \n     others who qualify for government supported programs; and\n       Whereas, substantial savings can be used for other \n     healthcare needs or expenses and reducing co-payments; and\n       Whereas, every other developed country has the power to \n     negotiate the costs of prescription drugs: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-Second Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2004, That the \n     President and Congress\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n     are urged to repeal the restriction on government to \n     negotiate reductions in prescription drug prices with \n     manufacturers; and be it\n       Further resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution \n     be transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States, \n     the President of the Senate of the United States, and the \n     members of Hawaii's Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-443. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Florida \n     relative to the distribution of Medicaid funds; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                         House Memorial No. 25\n\n       Whereas, Florida is the fourth most populous state, with \n     16.4 million residents, and\n       Whereas, more than 2 million Floridians live in poverty and \n     approximately 2.8 million Floridians have no health insurance \n     whatsoever, and\n       Whereas, it is a moral incumbency that every Floridian have \n     access to quality, affordable health care, and\n       Whereas, impoverished Floridians have more difficulty \n     securing quality, affordable health care, especially if they \n     are uninsured, and\n       Whereas, Florida participates in the Federal Government's \n     Medicaid program to support those impoverished citizens and \n     ensure their access to health care, and\n       Whereas, when Medicaid was created in 1965, one of its \n     purposes was to reduce the differences among the states \n     regarding their respective abilities to fund medical services \n     for the impoverished, and\n       Whereas, federal funds for Medicaid are distributed to the \n     states based on a funding formula that uses per capita income \n     as a key indicator of a state's ability to support its \n     impoverished population, and\n       Whereas, numerous reports from the United States General \n     Accounting Office dating back to the early 1980s demonstrate \n     that per capita income is a poor indicator of a state's \n     funding ability, and\n       Whereas, the use of per capita income assumes that states \n     with lower per capita incomes have higher rates of poverty, \n     which is a false assumption based on data from the United \n     States Census of 2000, and\n       Whereas, the funding formula does not account for states' \n     respective populations in poverty, the wealth distribution of \n     larger states, or the costs to serve Medicaid populations in \n     respective states, and\n       Whereas, the use of per capita income in the funding \n     formula fails to accurately reflect the needs of the more \n     populous states, and\n       Whereas, the use of a state's total taxable resources in \n     the formula, as recommended by the General Accounting Office, \n     would result in Florida receiving hundreds of millions of \n     dollars more of federal funds in distribution, which amounts \n     to its fair share, and\n       Whereas, according to the 2002 financial data of the Agency \n     for Health Care Administration, uncompensated care in \n     Florida's hospitals is growing at the rate of 12 to 13 \n     percent per year, Medicaid caseloads grew almost 7 percent in \n     the last fiscal year, and the costs of the Medicaid program \n     continue to grow at an alarming rate, and\n       Whereas, because of the poor reimbursement rates offered to \n     Florida's physicians due to the disparity created by the \n     funding formula, many doctors have limited their provision of \n     services for Medicaid patients and some have stopped treating \n     Medicaid patients altogether, and\n       Whereas, this decline in the number of physicians who will \n     treat Medicaid patients threatens the quality and \n     availability of health care to impoverished Floridians: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Congress of the United States is requested to pass \n     legislation to change the existing formula for the \n     distribution of Medicaid funds from a formula based on per \n     capita income to one based on total taxable resources and the \n     poverty rate, thereby providing a more equitable distribution \n     of Medicaid funds to the states and bringing the Medicaid \n     program closer to compliance with its stated legislative \n     goal; and be it\n       Further resolved, That copies of this memorial be \n     dispatched to the President of the United States, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     the Florida delegation to the United States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5535-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Ms. \n             Collins):\n       S. 2426.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the treatment of payment under the medicare program for \nclinical laboratory tests furnished by critical access hospitals; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nthat will overturn a new regulation that is putting critical access \nhospitals (CAH) at risk by arbitrarily lowering the Medicare \nreimbursement for laboratory services. Sixty rural hospitals in \nNebraska will be negatively impacted unless this legislation is \nreversed.\n  This legislation would repeal a Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices' (CMS) regulation that would prohibit critical access \nhospitals from being reimbursed at-cost for laboratory services, unless \npatients are ``physically present in a critical access hospital'' when \nlaboratory specimens are collected. Many CAHs provide laboratory \nservices in rural health clinics (RHCs) and nursing homes in smaller, \nneighboring communities, as well as in home-health settings; however, \nthe elimination of cost-based reimbursements may make it prohibitive \nfor them to continue offering off-site laboratory testing. In short, \nunder the new regulation, lab services would not be reimbursed by CMS \nunless the patient is at the facility where testing will occur.\n  This change jeopardizes rural Americans' access to care by imposing \nan additional burden on the frail elderly by requiring them to visit \nthe hospital to get simple lab tests done. The additional time and \nexpense incurred by the patient is unnecessary if the CAH is willing \nand able to conduct tests at the point of patient care and transport it \nback to the hospital for analysis.\n  Congress created the CAH program in 1997 to ensure that those in \nisolated, rural communities have access to health care. To protect the \nviability of these hospitals, often a community's only source of vital \nhealth care services, Congress established cost-based reimbursement for \nMedicare inpatient and outpatient services--regardless of where the \nservices are provided. The new regulation would fundamentally alter \nthis well-established practice.\n  We have tried to work with CMS to change the rule. In November of \n2003, I was joined by 28 Senators in a bipartisan letter to the \nAdministrator of CMS asking for his assistance in constructing a rule \nthat does not penalize CAHs for offering off-site laboratory services. \nUnfortunately, CMS responded that the rule would stay intact.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Susan Collins. \nSenator Collins has been a strong advocate for rural health care, and I \nlook forward to working together on this legislation.\n  The Nebraska critical access hospitals affected by the regulation \nare:\n\n       Harlan County Health System in Alma, Fillmore County \n     Hospital in Geneva, Pawnee County Memorial Hospital in Pawnee \n     City, Niobrara Valley Hospital Corporation in Lynch, Thayer \n     County Health Services in Hebron, Kimball County Hospital \n     in Kimball, Kearney County Health Services/Hospital in \n     Minden, Saunders County Health Services in Wahoo, \n     Henderson Health Care Services in\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\n     Henderson, Community Memorial Hospital in Syracuse, Garden \n     County Hospital & Nursing Home in Oshkosh, Franklin County \n     Memorial Hospital in Franklin, Genoa Community Hospital in \n     Genoa.\n       Gothenburg Memorial Hospital in Gothenburg, Annie Jeffrey \n     Memorial County Health Center in Osceola, Brodstone Memorial \n     Nuckolls County Hospital in Superior, Webster County \n     Community Hospital in Red Cloud, Tilden Community Hospital in \n     Tilden, Morrill County Community Hospital in Bridgeport, \n     Jefferson Community Health Center in Fairbury, Memorial \n     Hospital in Aurora, Oakland Memorial Hospital in Oakland, St. \n     Francis Memorial Hospital in West Point.\n       Alegent Health Memorial Hospital in Schuyler, Nemaha County \n     Hospital in Auburn, Brown County Hospital in Ainsworth, \n     Antelope Memorial Hospital in Neligh, Cozad Community \n     Hospital in Cozad, Litzenberg Memorial County Hospital in \n     Central City, Avera St. Anthony's Hospital in O'Neill, Warren \n     Memorial Hospital in Friend, Creighton Area Health Services \n     in Creighton, Butler County Health Care Center in David City, \n     Rock County Hospital in Bassett, Boone County Health Center \n     in Albion, Callaway District Hospital in Callaway, York \n     General Hospital in York.\n       Howard County Community Hospital in St. Paul, Memorial \n     Hospital CAH in Seward, Dundy County Hospital in Benkelman, \n     Chadron Community Hospital Health Services in Chadron, St. \n     Mary's Hospital in Nebraska City, West Holt Memorial Hospital \n     in Atkinson, Cherry County Hospital in Valentine, Providence \n     Medical Center in Wayne, Plainview Public Hospital in \n     Plainview, Osmond General Hospital in Osmond, Tri Valley \n     Health System in Cambridge, Pender Community Hospital in \n     Pender.\n       Johnson County Hospital in Tecumseh, Chase County Community \n     Hospital in Imperial, Community Medical Center in Falls City, \n     Valley County Hospital in Ord, Crete Area Medical Center in \n     Crete, Ogallala Community Hospital in Ogallala, Perkins \n     County Health Services in Grant, Memorial Health Center in \n     Sidney, Gordon Memorial Hospital District in Gordon, Memorial \n     Community Hospital in Blair, Box Butte General Hospital in \n     Alliance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2427. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve \ntransition assistance provided for members of the armed forces being \ndischarged, release from active duty, or retired, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill enhance and strengthen transition services that are provided to \nour military personnel.\n  This past weekend, people around our country honored our military \npersonnel by marking Armed Forces Day. That day was even more poignant \nthis year as we recognize the service and sacrifice of the thousands of \nbrave men and women who are currently in harm's way in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere around the globe. These men and women serve \nwith distinction and honor, and we owe them our heartfelt gratitude.\n  We also owe them our best effort to ensure that they receive the \nbenefits to which their service in our Armed Forces has entitled them. \nI have heard time and again from military personnel and veterans who \nare frustrated with the system by which they apply for benefits or \nappeal claims for benefits. I have long been concerned that tens of \nthousands of our veterans are unaware of Federal health care and other \nbenefits for which they may be eligible, and I have undertaken numerous \nlegislative and oversight efforts to ensure that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs makes outreach to our veterans and their families a \npriority. Our brave veterans have earned these benefits, and VA \noutreach regarding health care and other benefits is especially \nimportant as we welcome home a new generation of veterans who are \nserving in Iraq and in the fight against terrorism. Our veterans and \ntheir families have made great personal sacrifices to protect our \nfreedoms. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. Making sure that our \nveterans know about the benefits that they have earned is an important \nfirst step in starting to repay this debt.\n  While we should do more to support our veterans, we must also ensure \nthat the men and women who are currently serving in our Armed Forces \nreceive adequate pay and benefits, as well as services that help them \nto make the transition from active duty to civilian life. I am \nconcerned that we are not doing enough to support our men and women in \nuniform as they prepare to retire or otherwise separate from the \nservice or, in the case of members of our National Guard and Reserve, \nto demobilize from active duty assignments and return to their civilian \nlives while staying in the military or preparing to separate from the \nmilitary. We must ensure that their service and sacrifice, which is \nmuch lauded during times of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles \nhave ended and our troops have come home.\n  My bill, the Veterans Enhanced Transition Services Act (VETS Act), \nwill help to ensure that all military personnel have access to the same \ntransition services as they prepare to leave the military to reenter \ncivilian life, or, in the case of members of the National Guard and \nReserve, as they prepare to demobilize from active duty assignments and \nreturn to their civilian lives and jobs or education while remaining in \nthe military.\n\n  I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites and military and veterans \nservice organizations that our men and women in uniform do not all have \naccess to the same transition counseling and medical services as they \nare demobilizing from service in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. I \nhave long been concerned about reports of uneven provision of services \nfrom base to base and from service to service. All of our men and women \nin uniform have pledged to serve our country, and all of them, at the \nvery least, deserve to have access to the same services in return.\n  My bill will help to ensure that all military personnel receive the \nsame services by making a number of improvements to the existing \nTransition Assistance Program/Disabled Transition Assistance Program \n(TAP/DTAP) and to the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program, by \nimproving the process by which military personnel who are being \ndemobilized or discharged receive medical examinations and mental \nhealth assessments, and by ensuring that military and veterans service \norganizations and state departments of veterans affairs are able to \nplay an active role in assisting military personnel with the difficult \ndecisions that are often involved in the process of discharging or \ndemobilizing.\n  Under current law, the Department of Defense, together with the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Labor, provide pre-separation \ncounseling for military personnel who are preparing to leave the \nservice. This counseling provides service members with valuable \ninformation about benefits that they have earned through their service \nto our country such as education benefits through the GI Bill and \nhealth care and other benefits through the VA. Personnel also learn \nabout programs such as Troops to Teachers and have access to employment \nassistance for themselves and, where appropriate, their spouses.\n  My bill would ensure that members of demobilizing National Guard and \nReserve personnel are able to participate in this important counseling \nprior to being demobilized. In addition, my bill would require state-\nbased follow-up within 180 of demobilization to give demobilized \npersonnel the opportunity to follow up on any questions or concerns \nthat they may have during a regular unit training period. Currently, \nmost of the responsibility for getting information about benefits and \nprograms falls on the military personnel. The Department of Defense \nshould make every effort to ensure that all members participate in this \nimportant program, and that is what my bill would do.\n  My bill would help to improve the uniformity of services provided to \npersonnel by directing the Secretary of Defense to ensure that \nconsistent Transition Assistance Program/Disabled Transition Assistance \nProgram briefings occur across the services and at all demobilization/\ndischarge locations and to ensure that there are programs that are \ndirected to the specific needs of active duty and National Guard and \nReserve personnel as appropriate. It also includes a provision to \nensure that personnel who are on the temporary disability retired list \nand who are being retired or discharged\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nfrom alternate locations will have access to transition services at a \nlocation that is reasonably convenient to them.\n  In addition, my bill would enhance the information that is presented \nto members by requiring that pre-separation counseling include the \nprovision of information regarding certification and licensing \nrequirements in civilian occupations and information on identifying \nmilitary occupations that have civilian counterparts.\n  In response to concerns I have heard from a number of my \nconstituents, the bill also directs the Secretaries of Defense and \nLabor to jointly explore ways in which DoD training and certification \nstandards could be coordinated with state laws relating to the training \nand certification standards for corresponding civilian occupations.\n  Participation in pre-separation counseling through a TAP/DTAP program \nis a valuable tool for personnel as they transition back to civilian \nlife. My bill is in no way intended to lengthen the time that military \npersonnel spend away from their families or to provide them with \ninformation that is not relevant to their civilian lives or that they \notherwise do not need. In order to ensure that this information remains \na valuable tool and does not become a burden to demobilizing members of \nthe National Guard and Reserve who experience multiple deployments for \nactive duty assignments, my bill clarifies that participation in the \nDepartment of Labor's transitional services employment will not be \nrequired if a member has previously participated in the program or if a \nmember will be returning to school or to a job that he or she held \nbefore being called to active duty.\n  My bill would make similar improvements to the joint DoD-VA Benefits \nDelivery at Discharge program, which assists personnel in applying for \nVA disability benefits before they are discharged from the military, to \ncover all discharging military installations and military hospitals to \nensure that all personnel with service-connected disabilities have the \nsame opportunity to receive this important service. This very \nsuccessful program has helped to cut the red tape and to speed the \nprocessing time for many veterans who are entitled to VA disability \nbenefits.\n  I have long been concerned about the immediate and long-term health \neffects that military deployments have on our men and women in uniform. \nI regret that, too often, the burden of responsibility for proving that \na condition is related to military service falls on the personnel \nthemselves. Our men and women in uniform deserve the benefit of the \ndoubt, and should not have to fight the Department of Defense or the VA \nfor benefits that they have earned through their service to our nation.\n  For example, since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have worked to \nfocus attention on the health effects that are being experienced by \nmilitary personnel who served in the Persian Gulf War. More than ten \nyears after the end of the Gulf War, we still don't know why so many \nveterans of that conflict are experiencing medical problems. Of the \nnearly 700,000 U.S. military personnel who served in the Persian Gulf \nWar in 1990 and 1991, more than 100,000 have suffered from an array of \nsymptoms that have become known as Gulf War Syndrome. Military \npersonnel who are currently deployed to the region face many of the \nsame conditions that existed in the early 1990s. I have repeatedly \npressed the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to work to \nunlock the mystery of this illness and to study the role that exposure \nto depleted uranium may play in this condition. We owe it to these \npersonnel to find these answers, and to ensure that those who are \ncurrently serving in the Persian Gulf region are adequately protected \nfrom the many possible causes of Gulf War Syndrome.\n  Part of this process is to ensure that the Department of Defense \ncarries out its responsibility to provide post-deployment physicals for \nmilitary personnel. I am deeply concerned about stories of personnel \nwho are experiencing long delays as they wait for their post-deployment \nphysicals and who end up choosing not to have these important physicals \nin order to get home to their families that much sooner. I am equally \nconcerned about reports that some personnel who did not receive such a \nphysical--either by their own choice or because such a physical was not \navailable--are now having trouble as they apply for benefits for a \nservice-connected condition.\n  For these reasons, my bill would require that the Department of \nDefense abide by current law and provide post-demobilization physicals \nto all military personnel, and would prohibit any waiver of these \nphysicals. I firmly believe, as do the military and veterans groups \nthat support my bill, that our men and women in uniform are entitled to \na prompt, high quality physical examination as part of the \ndemobilization process. These individuals have voluntarily put \nthemselves into harm's way for our benefit. We should ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense makes every effort to determine whether they have \nexperienced--or could experience--any health effects as a result of \ntheir service.\n  In light of concerns raised by many that each service and each \ninstallation uses a different process for demobilization physicals, my \nbill would require the Secretary of Defense to set minimum standards \nfor these important medical examinations and to ensure that these \nstandards are applied uniformly at all installations and by all \nbranches of the Armed Forces.\n  My bill also would strengthen current law by ensuring that these \nmedical examinations also include a mental health screening and \nassessment. Our men and women in uniform serve in difficult \ncircumstances far from home, and too many of them witness or experience \nviolence and horrific situations that most of us cannot even begin to \nimagine. These men and women, many of whom are just out of high school \nor college when they sign up, may suffer long-term mental and physical \nfallout from their experiences and may feel reluctant to seek \ncounseling or other assistance to deal with their experiences.\n  My bill would improve mental health services for demobilizing \nmilitary personnel by requiring that the content and standards for the \nmental health screening and assessment that are developed by the \nSecretary include content and standards for screening acute and delayed \nonset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and, specifically, \nquestions to identify all stressors experienced by military personnel \nthat have the potential to lead to PTSD. Some Wisconsinites have told \nme that they are concerned that the multiple deployments of our \nNational Guard and Reserve could lead to chronic PTSD, which could have \nits roots in an experience from a previous deployment and which could \ncome to the surface by a triggering event that is experienced on a \ncurrent deployment. The same is true for full-time military personnel \nwho have served in a variety of places over their careers.\n  We can and should do more to ensure that the mental health of our men \nand women in uniform is a top priority, and that the stigma that is too \noften attached to seeking assistance is ended. One step in this process \nis to ensure that personnel who have symptoms of PTSD and related \nillnesses have access to appropriate clinical services, either through \nDoD or through the VA, which is required in my bill.\n  My legislation also requires the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \nAffairs to report to Congress on planning for identification, \nintervention, and treatment of personnel with PTSD and related \nconditions and for appropriate training of DoD, military, and VA \npersonnel with respect to PTSD and related conditions.\n  My bill will also ensure that the DoD and the VA take appropriate \nactions to ensure that personnel receive appropriate follow-up care for \nany other physical or mental conditions that are found--or suspected to \nhave been found--as a result of a post-deployment medical examination, \nincluding care and treatment at a DoD or VA facility and any other \ncare, treatment, or services that are required.\n\n  In addition, in order to ensure that all military personnel who are \neligible for medical benefits for the VA learn about and receive them, \nmy bill requires that, as part of the demobilization process, \nassistance be provided to eligible members to enroll in the VA health \ncare system.\n  My bill also requires that the medical records of all separating \nservice members be transmitted to the VA and that DoD and the VA \nconduct a study\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\non how to improve coordination and cooperation between the two \nDepartments to support the provision of benefits to members and \nveterans, including: compatibility of health care filing systems, \nconsistency of claims forms, consistency of medical examination forms, \nand creating shared electronic database with appropriate privacy \nprotections.\n  My bill would also make improvements to the DoD demobilization and \ndischarge processes by ensuring that members of military and veterans \nservice organizations (MSOs and VSOs) are able to counsel personnel on \noptions for benefits and other important questions. The demobilization \nand discharge process presents our service members with a sometimes \nconfusing and often overwhelming amount of information and paperwork \nthat must be digested and sometimes signed in a very short period of \ntime. My bill would authorize a ``veteran to veteran'' counseling \nprogram that will give military personnel the opportunity to speak with \nfellow veterans who have been through this process and who may be able \nto offer important advice about benefits and other choices that \nmilitary personnel have to make.\n  Under current law, the Secretary of Defense may make use of the \nservices provided by MSOs and VSOs as part of the transition process. \nBut these groups tell me that they are not always allowed access to \ntransition briefings that are conducted for our personnel. In order to \nhelp facilitate the new veteran-to-veteran program, my bill would \nrequire the Secretary to ensure that representatives of MSOs, VSOs, and \nstate departments of veterans affairs are invited to participate in all \nTAP/DTAP and BDD programs. In addition, my bill requires that these \ndedicated veterans, who give so much of their time and of themselves to \nserving their fellow veterans and their families, are able to gain \naccess to military installations, military hospitals, and VA hospitals \nin order to provide this important service. By and large, Mr. \nPresident, these groups are able to speak with our military personnel \nat hospitals and other facilities. But I am disturbed by reports that \nsome of these groups were having a hard time gaining access to \nthese facilities in order to visit with our troops. For that reason, I \nhave included this access requirement in my bill.\n\n  I want to stress that my bill in no way requires military personnel \nto speak with members of MSOs or VSOs if they do not wish to do so. It \nmerely ensures that our men and women in uniform have this option.\n  Finally, my bill would authorize the Secretary of Defense to create a \nprogram to help military personnel get college credit for applicable \nmilitary training. The Wisconsin State Department of Veterans Affairs \nhas such a program, called the Academic Credit for Military Experience \n(ACME) program. The National Veterans Training Institute cites ACME as \na national model for helping veterans to obtain college credit for \ntraining that they received while in the military. Such a program would \nhelp our veterans to maximize their GI Bill benefits, to avoid taking \nclasses that repeat their military training, and to earn their degrees \nthat much faster.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by a wide range of \ngroups that are dedicated to serving our men and women in uniform and \nveterans and their families. These groups include: the American Legion, \nthe Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States; \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America; the Reserve Officers Association; \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the Wisconsin National Guard; the American Legion, Department \nof Wisconsin; Disabled American Veterans, Department of Wisconsin; the \nWisconsin Paralyzed Veterans of America; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nDepartment of Wisconsin; and the Wisconsin State Council, Vietnam \nVeterans of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for educational opportunities for all \nstudents in State public school systems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kennedy, Reed, \nBingaman, Clinton, Sarbanes, Reid, Akaka, Johnson, Stabenow, Corzine, \nLautenberg and Durbin to introduce the ``Student Bill of Rights.'' This \nbill is critical to ensuring that every child in America receives the \neducational opportunity that is the foundation of America's promise of \nequal opportunity for all.\n  The Student Bill of Rights attempts to ensure that every American \nchild has an equal opportunity to receive a good education--including, \nhighly qualified teachers, challenging curricula, small classes, \ncurrent textbooks, quality libraries, and up-to-date technology--to all \nstudents in all schools in a State. Current law requires that schools \nwithin the same district provide comparable educational services. This \nbill would extend that basic protection to the State level by requiring \ncomparability across school districts. And, this bill would help ensure \nthat States comply with State or Federal court orders concerning the \nfairness of their public school systems.\n  Fifty years ago, Brown vs. Board of Education struck down segregation \nin law. Fifty years later, we know that just because there is no \nsegregation in law does not mean that it does not persist in fact. \nFifty years after Brown v. Board of Education, our education system \nremains largely separate and unequal.\n  All too often, whether an American child is taught by a high quality \nteacher in a small class, has access to the best courses and \ninstructional materials, goes to school in a new, modern building, and \notherwise benefits from educational resources that have been shown to \nbe essential to a quality education, still depends on where the child's \nfamily can afford to live. In fact, the United States ranks last among \ndeveloped countries in the difference in the quality of schools \navailable to wealthy and low-income children. This is simply \nunacceptable, and it is why the Student Bill of Rights is so important \nto our children's ability to achieve academically, to gain the skills \nthey need to be responsible, participating citizens in our diverse \ndemocracy, and to compete and succeed in the global economy.\n  Of course, factors besides resources are also important to academic \nachievement--supportive parents, motivated peers, and positive role \nmodels in the community, just to name a few. But at the same time, we \nalso know that adequate resources are vital to providing students with \nthe opportunity to receive a solid education.\n  This bill does not represent a radical notion. Last Congress, 42 \nSenators and 183 Representatives voted for similar legislation that Mr. \nFattah offered in the other body and I offered here in the Senate. A \nradical notion is the idea that a country founded on the principle of \nequal opportunity for all can continue to accept an educational system \nthat provides real educational opportunity for just a select few.\n  When he signed the No Child Left Behind Act two years ago, President \nBush promised that the Federal Government would make sure schools have \nthe resources necessary to meet the new law's requirements. This year \nalone, the President's budget resolution underfunds the law by $9.4 \nbillion. The President's budget also fails to fully funding the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to special education--leaving families and \nlocal communities struggling to make up the difference. We will never \nclose the achievement gap as long as our nation's most disadvantaged \nstudents in the neediest schools are forced to make do with far less \nthan other students. The Federal Government needs to become a more \nequal partner in funding education.\n  States need to do more, too. At the federal level we have created \nprograms to help ensure that students from low-income communities start \nschool healthy and ready to learn and to succeed in school once they \nget there. Programs such as Head Start, the School Lunch Program, The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and Title I, all assist in meeting \nthe needs of low-income kids from their very first days.\n  In the end, this bill is about the simple fact that the quality of a \nchild's education should not be determined by their zip code. The \nStudent Bill of Rights will help ensure that each and every child's \nschool has the resources to provide them with a decent education, and \nin turn, an equal opportunity for a successful future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Student Bill of \nRights, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Construction.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A high-quality, highly competitive education for all \n     students is imperative for the economic growth and \n     productivity of the United States, for its effective national \n     defense, and to achieve the historical aspiration to be one \n     Nation of equal citizens. It is therefore necessary and \n     proper to overcome the nationwide phenomenon of State public \n     school systems that do not meet the requirements of section \n     101(a), in which high-quality public schools typically serve \n     high-income communities and poor-quality schools typically \n     serve low-income, urban, rural, and minority communities.\n       (2) There exists in the States a significant educational \n     opportunity gap for low-income, urban, rural, and minority \n     students characterized by the following:\n       (A) Continuing disparities within States in students' \n     access to the fundamentals of educational opportunity \n     described in section 102.\n       (B) Highly differential educational expenditures (adjusted \n     for cost and need) among school districts within States.\n       (C) Radically differential educational achievement among \n     students in school districts within States as measured by the \n     following:\n       (i) Achievement in mathematics, reading or language arts, \n     and science on State academic assessments required under \n     section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)) and on the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress.\n       (ii) Advanced placement courses taken.\n       (iii) SAT and ACT test scores.\n       (iv) Dropout rates and graduation rates.\n       (v) College-going and college-completion rates.\n       (vi) Job placement and retention rates and indices of job \n     quality.\n       (3) As a consequence of this educational opportunity gap, \n     the quality of a child's education depends largely upon where \n     the child's family can afford to live, and the detriments of \n     lower quality education are imposed particularly on--\n       (A) children from low-income families;\n       (B) children living in urban and rural areas; and\n       (C) minority children.\n       (4) Since 1785, Congress, exercising the power to admit new \n     States under section 3 of article IV of the Constitution (and \n     previously, the Congress of the Confederation of States under \n     the Articles of Confederation), has imposed upon every State, \n     as a fundamental condition of the State's admission, that the \n     State provide for the establishment and maintenance of \n     systems of public schools open to all children in such State.\n       (5) Over the years since the landmark ruling in Brown v. \n     Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954), when a \n     unanimous Supreme Court held that ``the opportunity of an \n     education . . . , where the State has undertaken to provide \n     it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal \n     terms'', courts in 44 States have heard challenges to the \n     establishment, maintenance, and operation of State public \n     school systems that are separate and not educationally \n     adequate.\n       (6) In 1970, the Presidential Commission on School Finance \n     found that significant disparities in the distribution of \n     educational resources existed among school districts within \n     States because the States relied too significantly on local \n     district financing for educational revenues, and that reforms \n     in systems of school financing would increase the Nation's \n     ability to serve the educational needs of all children.\n       (7) In 1999, the National Research Council of the National \n     Academy of Sciences published a report entitled ``Making \n     Money Matter, Financing America's Schools'', which found that \n     the concept of funding adequacy, which moves beyond the more \n     traditional concepts of finance equity to focus attention on \n     the sufficiency of funding for desired educational \n     outcomes, is an important step in developing a fair and \n     productive educational system.\n       (8) In 2001, the Executive Order establishing the \n     President's Commission on Educational Resource Equity \n     declared, ``A quality education is essential to the success \n     of every child in the 21st century and to the continued \n     strength and prosperity of our Nation. . . . [L]ong-standing \n     gaps in access to educational resources exist, including \n     disparities based on race and ethnicity.'' (Exec. Order No. \n     13190, 66 Fed. Reg. 5424 (2001))\n       (9) According to the Secretary of Education, as stated in a \n     letter (with enclosures) from the Secretary to States dated \n     January 19, 2001--\n       (A) racial and ethnic minorities continue to suffer from \n     lack of access to educational resources, including \n     ``experienced and qualified teachers, adequate facilities, \n     and instructional programs and support, including technology, \n     as well as . . . the funding necessary to secure these \n     resources''; and\n       (B) these inadequacies are ``particularly acute in high-\n     poverty schools, including urban schools, where many students \n     of color are isolated and where the effect of the resource \n     gaps may be cumulative. In other words, students who need the \n     most may often receive the least, and these students often \n     are students of color.''.\n       (10) In the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001, Congress--\n       (A)(i) required each State to establish standards and \n     assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science; and\n       (ii) required schools to ensure that all students are \n     proficient in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001-\n     2002 school year, and held schools accountable for the \n     students' progress; and\n       (B) required each State to describe how the State will help \n     local educational agencies and schools to develop the \n     capacity to improve student academic achievement.\n       (11) The standards and accountability movement will succeed \n     only if, in addition to standards and accountability, all \n     schools have access to the educational resources necessary to \n     enable students to achieve.\n       (12) Raising standards without ensuring access to \n     educational resources may in fact exacerbate achievement gaps \n     and set children up for failure.\n       (13) According to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report 2001-2002, the United States ranks \n     last among developed countries in the difference in the \n     quality of schools available to rich and poor children.\n       (14) The persistence of pervasive inadequacies in the \n     quality of education provided by State public school systems \n     effectively deprives millions of children throughout the \n     United States of the opportunity for an education adequate to \n     enable the children to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (15) Each State government has ultimate authority to \n     determine every important aspect and priority of the public \n     school system that provides elementary and secondary \n     education to children in the State, including whether \n     students throughout the State have access to the fundamentals \n     of educational opportunity described in section 102.\n       (16) Because a well educated populace is critical to the \n     Nation's political and economic well-being and national \n     security, the Federal Government has a substantial interest \n     in ensuring that States provide a high-quality education by \n     ensuring that all students have access to the fundamentals of \n     educational opportunity described in section 102 to enable \n     the students to succeed academically and in life.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To further the goals of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001), by holding States accountable for providing all \n     students with access to the fundamentals of educational \n     opportunity described in section 102.\n       (2) To ensure that all students in public elementary \n     schools and secondary schools receive educational \n     opportunities that enable such students to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (3) To end the pervasive pattern of States maintaining \n     public school systems that do not meet the requirements of \n     section 101(a).\n\n    TITLE I--EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN STATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS\n\n             Subtitle A--Access to Educational Opportunity\n\n     SEC. 101.

this resolution to the Institute.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution with my \ncolleagues, Senators Harkin and Warner, commending the United States \nInstitute of Peace on the occasion of its 20th anniversary and \nrecognizing the Institute for its contribution to our Nation's capacity \nto manage international conflict by peaceful means. Since its founding \nby Congress, the Institute has been a pioneer in promoting the study \nand application of non-military approaches to the prevention, \nmanagement, and resolution of conflict.\n  The Congress established the Institute as an independent, nonpartisan \nFederal institution dedicated to strengthening our national \ncapabilities for conflict management and resolution. The resolution we \nare submitting today recognizes the importance of the Institute as a \nnational and international resource for peaceful conflict management. \nIt stresses that Congress looks forward to continuing to gain from the \nInstitute's knowledge, teaching, and practical applications of conflict \nmanagement as a way to promote the security interests of the United \nStates and peace around the world. The resolution also expresses \nappreciation to the founding men and women of the Institute and support \nfor the Institute from the American people. Finally, the resolution \ncongratulates the Institute on its 20th anniversary and on its \nachievements in fulfilling its mandate from Congress.\n  Many in the Senate recall the personal dedication and efforts of our \npredecessors, led by Senators Spark Matsunaga and William Jennings \nRandolph who played essential roles in establishing the Institute. \nWhile Senator Matsunaga's bravery on the battlefield led to our \ncountry's awarding him a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts, he was also \na man who knew the importance of peace. In 1979 he set in motion many \nof the critical events that eventually led Congress to create the U.S. \nInstitute of Peace. Senator Matsunaga's unyielding commitment to peace \nbegan long before he arrived in this chamber. In 1938, as a student at \nthe University of Hawaii, he wrote an essay that included the sentence: \n``If we want peace we must educate people to want peace.''\n  The founders of the Institute and the countless Americans who \nsupported elevating the importance of peace education in our national \ndialogue would be proud of the way the Institute has grown and adapted \nto the ever-changing world. Today, the Institute is a national resource \nfor education, professional training, and applied programs in peaceful \nconflict management and the practical application of conflict \nmanagement strategies as a way to promote United States security and \npeace in the world.\n  Some of the vital work currently being undertaken by the Institute of \nPeace includes helping countries break out of cycles of violence and \npeacefully resolve their conflicts. At the same time, the Institute is \neducating new generations of Americans about novel approaches to \nconflict management, and enhancing curricular materials related to the \nchanging character of international conflict and nonviolent approaches \nto resolving international disputes. Over the past twenty years, the \nInstitute has used its knowledge and expertise to train American and \nforeign government officials, military and law enforcement personnel, \nhumanitarian aid workers, and civic activists in the skills of \nprofessional peacemaking. It has awarded numerous grants and \nfellowships to individuals, universities, and non-governmental \norganizations of many nations to deepen the field of conflict \nresolution education and ensure its application to conflict situations \nabroad.\n  In its twenty year history, the Institute has played key roles in \nfacilitating the management of critical conflict situations, such as \nassisting then President Nelson Mandela in the development of South \nAfrica's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and developing a detailed \nplan to handle accountability in the wake of the 1994 genocide in \nRwanda, which became the basis for Rwandan Genocide Law. More recently, \nthe Institute has taken an active role in facilitating peace processes \nin Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Afghanistan, and the Philippines. The \nInstitute is using its expertise in Iraq in specialized areas where \nconflict resolution programs play a key role in stabilizing peace and \nnation building, such as training new ministries about conflict \nresolution techniques, working with the emerging judicial system to \ndevelop a reconciliation tribunal for former war criminals and human \nrights violators, facilitating inter-religious and inter-ethnic \ndialogue, and working with Iraqi universities to promote peace and \nconflict education. The Institute is also anticipating new \nopportunities for peace and conflict resolution activities on the \nKorean peninsula and in Sudan. In the years to come, Congress will be \nlooking to the Institute to focus its skills and resources on \npeacemaking in the greater Middle East and throughout the Muslim world.\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\n  The Institute is a unique national treasure. We hope that our fellow \nSenators will join us in cosponsoring this resolution and stressing the \nUnited States commitment to peace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 110--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS IN \n   SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND \n   COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE) IN COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM, RACISM, \n     XENOPHOBIA, DISCRIMINATION, INTOLERANCE, AND RELATED VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 110\n\n       Whereas anti-Semitism is a unique evil and an affront to \n     human rights that must be unequivocally condemned, and a \n     phenomenon that, when left unchecked, has led to violence \n     against members of the Jewish community and Jewish \n     institutions;\n       Whereas racism, xenophobia, and discrimination are also \n     pernicious ills that erode the dignity of the individual and \n     such intolerance undermines the achievement and preservation \n     of stable democratic societies;\n       Whereas to be effective in combating these phenomena, \n     governments must respond to related violence while seeking to \n     address the underlying sources of anti-Semitism, racism, \n     xenophobia, discrimination, intolerance, and related violence \n     through public denouncements by elected leaders, vigorous law \n     enforcement, and education;\n       Whereas all Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) participating states must confront acts of \n     anti-Semitism and intolerance, and must deal effectively with \n     acts of violence against Jews and Jewish cultural sites, as \n     well as against ethnic and religious minority groups, in \n     keeping with their OSCE commitments;\n       Whereas education is critical in overcoming intolerance and \n     it is essential that those responsible for formulating \n     education policy recognize the importance of teaching about \n     the Holocaust and intolerance as a tool to fight anti-\n     Semitism, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination among young \n     people;\n       Whereas ensuring proper training of law enforcement \n     officers and military forces is vital in keeping alive the \n     memory of the Holocaust and to the importance of \n     understanding and responding to incidents of anti-Semitism \n     and intolerance;\n       Whereas OSCE participating states have repeatedly committed \n     to condemn anti-Semitism and intolerance, foremost in the \n     historic 1990 Copenhagen Concluding Document that, for the \n     first time, declared ``participating [s]tates clearly and \n     unequivocally condemn totalitarianism, racial and ethnic \n     hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and discrimination against \n     anyone,'' and stated their intent to ``take effective \n     measures . . . to provide protection against any acts that \n     constitute incitement to violence against persons or groups \n     based on national, racial, ethnic or religious \n     discrimination, hostility or hatred, including anti-\n     Semitism'';\n       Whereas the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has demonstrated \n     leadership by unanimously passing resolutions at its annual \n     sessions in 2002 and 2003 that condemn anti-Semitism, racial \n     and ethnic hatred, xenophobia, and discrimination and call \n     upon participating states to speak out against these acts and \n     to ensure aggressive law enforcement by local and national \n     authorities;\n       Whereas the 2002 Porto OSCE Ministerial Council Decision \n     committed participating states to ``take strong public \n     positions against . . . manifestations of aggressive \n     nationalism, racism, chauvinism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism \n     and violent extremism,'' specifically condemned the ``recent \n     increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the OSCE area, \n     recognizing the role that the existence of anti-Semitism has \n     played throughout history as a major threat to freedom,'' and \n     urged for the ``convening of separately designated human \n     dimension events on issues addressed in this decision, \n     including on the topics of anti-Semitism, discrimination and \n     racism and xenophobia'';\n       Whereas the 2003 OSCE Vienna conferences on anti-Semitism \n     and racism, xenophobia, and discrimination were \n     groundbreaking, as the OSCE and its participating states met \n     to discuss ways to combat these destructive forces;\n       Whereas the 2003 Maastricht Ministerial Council approved \n     follow-up OSCE conferences on anti-Semitism and on racism, \n     xenophobia and discrimination, and encouraged ``all \n     participating [s]tates to collect and keep records on \n     reliable information and statistics on hate crimes, including \n     on forms of violent manifestations of racism, xenophobia, \n     discrimination, and anti-Semitism,'' as well as to inform the \n     OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights \n     (ODIHR) ``about existing legislation regarding crimes fueled \n     by intolerance and discrimination'';\n       Whereas at the 2004 OSCE Conference on Anti-Semitism, \n     hosted in the German capital, the Bulgarian Chairman-in-\n     Office issued the ``Berlin Declaration'' which stated \n     unambiguously that ``international developments or political \n     issues, including those in Israel or elsewhere in the Middle \n     East, never justify anti-Semitism'';\n       Whereas the Berlin Declaration advances the process of \n     monitoring of anti-Semitic crimes and hate crimes, as all \n     OSCE participating states committed to ``collect and \n     maintain'' statistics about these incidents and to forward \n     that information to the ODIHR for compilation;\n       Whereas during the closing conference plenary, the German \n     Foreign Minister and others highlighted the need to ensure \n     all participating states follow through with their \n     commitments and initiate efforts to track anti-Semitic crimes \n     and hate crimes; and\n       Whereas the Government of Spain offered to hold a follow-up \n     meeting in Cordoba in 2005 to review whether OSCE \n     participating states are making every effort to fulfill their \n     OSCE commitments regarding data collection on anti-Semitic \n     crimes and hate crimes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government and Congress should \n     unequivocally condemn acts of anti-Semitism and intolerance \n     whenever and wherever they occur;\n       (2) officials and elected leaders of all Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) participating \n     states, including all OSCE Mediterranean Partner for \n     Cooperation countries, should also unequivocally condemn acts \n     of anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination \n     whenever and wherever they occur;\n       (3) the participating states of the OSCE should be \n     commended for supporting the Berlin Declaration and for \n     working to bring increased attention to incidents of anti-\n     Semitism and intolerance in the OSCE region;\n       (4) the United States Government, including Members of \n     Congress, recognizing that the fundamental job of combating \n     anti-Semitism and intolerance falls to governments, should \n     work with other OSCE participating states and their \n     parliaments to encourage the full compliance with OSCE \n     commitments and, if necessary, urge the creation of legal \n     mechanisms to combat and track acts of anti-Semitism and \n     intolerance;\n       (5) all participating states, including the United States, \n     should forward their respective laws and data on incidents of \n     anti-Semitism and other hate crimes to the OSCE Office for \n     Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) for \n     compilation and provide adequate resources for the completion \n     of its duties;\n       (6) the United States should encourage the Bulgarian \n     Chairman-in-Office, in consultation with the incoming \n     Slovenian Chairman-in-Office, to consider appointing a high \n     level ``personal envoy'' to ensure sustained attention with \n     respect to fulfilling OSCE commitments on the reporting of \n     anti-Semitic crimes;\n       (7) the United States should urge OSCE participating states \n     that have not already done so to join the Task Force for \n     International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, \n     Remembrance, and Research; and\n       (8) all OSCE participating states should renew and \n     revitalize efforts to implement their existing commitments to \n     fight anti-Semitism and intolerance, and keep sharp focus on \n     these issues as part of the usual work of the OSCE Permanent \n     Council, the Human Dimension Implementation Review Meeting, \n     the Ministerial Council and summits.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nsupporting the ongoing important work of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in combating anti-Semitism, racism, \nxenophobia, discrimination, intolerance and related violence. As Co-\nChairman of the Helsinki Commission, I remain concerned over \nmanifestations of anti-Semitism that prompted me to introduce S. Con. \nRes. 7, a bipartisan initiative that unanimously passed the Senate last \nMay. That measure provided impetus to efforts to confront and combat \nanti-Semitic violence in the OSCE region, the subject of a May 2002 \nHelsinki Commission hearing.\n  The resolution I submit today is aimed at building upon these \nefforts. The OSCE and its participating States have done much to \nconfront and combat the disease of anti-Semitism and intolerance, and I \nurge our government and all other OSCE countries to continue their \nefforts with vigor and determination. Much of what has been \naccomplished can be attributed to U.S. leadership, especially to the \nwork of U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE, Stephan M. Minikes, and his team \nin Vienna.\n  Last month the OSCE convened an historic conference in Berlin focused \non anti-Semitism and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions and \ntools to combat this age old problem. The U.S. delegation was \nrepresented at the highest level with the participation of Secretary of \nState Colin L. Powell. The conference brought together elected \nofficials and NGOs from around the globe in common support of efforts \nto fight anti-Semitism.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\n  The resolution I am submitting today follows up on several of the \ninitiatives from Berlin. The conference was punctuated with the \n``Berlin Declaration,'' a statement given by the Bulgarian Chairman-in-\nOffice, Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, during the closing plenary \nsession. In addition to declaring that ``international developments or \npolitical issues, including those in Israel or elsewhere in the Middle \nEast, never justify anti-Semitism,'' the Declaration advanced efforts \nto monitor anti-Semitic crimes and hate crimes, as all OSCE \nparticipating States committed to ``collect and maintain'' statistics \nabout these incidents and to forward that information to the OSCE's \nOffice for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) for \ncompilation. The resolution urges all participating States to ensure \nthese promises are fulfilled, and calls upon the Bulgarian Chairman-in-\nOffice to designate a ``personal envoy'' to monitor compliance with \nthese commitments.\n  The resolution also speaks to the importance of confronting instances \nof racism, discrimination and xenophobia wherever it occurs. It is \nimportant to note that in September, the OSCE will convene a meeting on \nthese matters, the Brussels Conference on Tolerance and the Fight \nagainst Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination. This meeting is very \nimportant, as no OSCE participating State is immune from these evils.\n  As Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have been impressed by \nthe efforts of the OSCE and its participating States to address issues \nof anti-Semitism and intolerance. However, the time for words has \npassed, and I urge all OSCE countries, including the United States, to \ntake real action. This resolution highlights several areas where steps \ncan and should be taken. I urge bipartisan support and speedy passage \nof this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 111--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \nTHAT A COMMEMORATIVE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED IN HONOR OF THE CENTENNIAL \n  ANNIVERSARY OF ROTARY INTERNATIONAL AND ITS WORK TO ERADICATE POLIO\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n       Whereas Rotary International, founded on February 23, 1905, \n     is a worldwide organization of business and professional \n     leaders that provides humanitarian service, encourages high \n     ethical standards in all vocations, and helps build goodwill \n     and peace in the world;\n       Whereas approximately 1,200,000 Rotarians belong to more \n     than 31,000 Rotary clubs located in 166 countries;\n       Whereas the Movement for Volunteer Community Service, \n     initiated by Rotary, has been described as one of the major \n     developments of the 20th century, and provides a formalized \n     spirit of community voluntarism in the United States;\n       Whereas Rotarians are committed to the position that their \n     efforts to provide educational opportunities and to meet \n     basic human needs are essential steps to greater world \n     understanding, goodwill, and peace;\n       Whereas Rotary's PolioPlus program to eradicate the dreaded \n     disease of polio throughout the world has helped to vaccinate \n     more than 2,000,000,000 children against the disease;\n       Whereas Rotary is the only nongovernmental organization \n     working in partnership with the World Health Organization, \n     UNICEF, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \n     achieve the goal of the total eradication of polio by 2005;\n       Whereas the work of Rotary International in the eradication \n     of polio is one of the finest humanitarian efforts by a \n     nonprofit organization;\n       Whereas there are more than 7,500 Rotary clubs in the \n     United States, with nearly 400,000 members, who voluntarily \n     support thousands of humanitarian and educational projects to \n     benefit our communities; and\n       Whereas Rotary International will celebrate its centennial \n     anniversary in 2005: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued in honor \n     of the centennial anniversary of Rotary International and its \n     effort to eradicate polio;\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee of the United \n     States Postal Service should recommend to the Postmaster \n     General that such a stamp be issued; and\n       (3) the Rotary Clubs of the United States are to be \n     commended for 100 years of volunteer service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/17/senate-section/article/S5548-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3151.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words in \nsupport of my good friend, Major General David Petraeus. On May 4, the \nPresident nominated General Petraeus for appointment to the grade of \nlieutenant general and assignment as chief of the Office of Security \nTransition--Iraq.\n  As head of the Office of Security Transition, General Petraeus will \nbe charged with demobilizing militias and organizing and training the \nIraqi military, civil defense force, police, and protective services. \nHis mission is a vital part of helping Iraqis come together as a \nnation.\n  General Petraeus embodies all the values of a true soldier serving \nhis country. Leadership, bravery, duty, honor. Indeed, he is one of our \nmost talented soldiers.\n  I first met General Petraeus in 1991, while I was serving as a heart \nsurgeon at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. I got \nan afternoon call from the emergency room that a person with a gunshot \nwound was being rushed to the hospital. I knew the person had been shot \nin the chest and at close range with an M-16.\n  When General Petraeus arrived, he was bleeding faster than the blood \ncould be replenished so I put in a chest tube and we headed to the \noperating room. On the way to the operating room, I remember explaining \nto him the risk of infection from the bullet. I didn't get more than \nhalfway through my explanation before he responded with, ``Doctor, \nlet's go get this over with; you need to tell me nothing more.''\n  Very few people would have been out of bed within 12 hours of \nsurgery. But General Petraeus is a strong and determined man.\n  Anyone who has ever seen him with his soldiers can see his dedication \nand commitment to those he leads.\n  The record of the 101st Airborne and the leadership of General \nPetraeus speaks for itself.\n  Over a year ago, General Petraeus and the 101st Airborne Assault \nDivision, along with the 160th SOAR and Fifth Special Operations Group, \ndeparted Fort Campbell for action in Iraq and to engage hostile forces \nin the War on Terror in Afghanistan. This past year the Screaming \nEagles lived up to the division's motto of ``rendezvous with destiny.'' \nThey endured untold hardships, confronted incredible obstacles, and \ncompleted their mission with astounding results.\n  They began with a grueling and dangerous trek north from Kuwait in \nwhich they liberated countless Iraqis. Arriving in Northern Iraq on \nApril 22, 2003, the division conducted the longest air assault in \nhistory, and quickly assumed responsibility for the ancient city of \nMosul and the security of its citizens. Within 2 weeks of arriving in \nMosul, the division rebuilt Khazir Bridge and facilitated the first \nfree election in Iraq since the rise of the oppressive Baathists, \nallowing local leaders to elect the city's new mayor and regional \ngovernor.\n  In late July, acting on the word of a number of Iraqi citizens, the \n101st was successful in locating Uday and Qusay Hussein. These two \nbrutal thugs, along with their father, were symbols of an oppressive, \nevil regime that millions of Iraqis were forced to endure for decades.\n  Having successfully contained much of the remaining threat, the \nScreaming Eagles wasted no time in distinguishing themselves not only \nas liberators, but as partners in Iraq's reinvention. General Petraeus \nacted as a civil administrator by overseeing projects restoring \nelectricity and water services, replenishing the area's supply of \ncooking oil, digging new wells, refurbishing over 500 schools, and \nbuilding new health clinics. All of these projects were major \nsuccesses.\n  I commend General Petraeus for his service and devotion to our \nNation. I greatly respect his leadership.

Res. 103\n\n       Whereas during World War II, 6,000,000 women stepped \n     forward to work in homefront industries to produce the ships, \n     planes, tanks, trucks, guns, and ammunition that were crucial \n     to achieving an Allied victory;\n       Whereas women worked in homefront industries as welders, \n     riveters, engineers, designers, and managers, and held other \n     positions that had traditionally been held by men;\n       Whereas these women demonstrated great skill and dedication \n     in the difficult and often dangerous jobs they held, which \n     enabled them to produce urgently needed military equipment at \n     recordbreaking speeds;\n       Whereas the need for labor in homefront industries during \n     World War II opened new employment opportunities for women \n     from all walks of life and dramatically increased gender and \n     racial integration in the workplace;\n       Whereas the service of women on the homefront during World \n     War II marked an unprecedented entry of women into jobs that \n     had traditionally been held by men and created a lasting \n     legacy of the ability of women to succeed in those jobs;\n       Whereas these women devoted their hearts and souls to their \n     work to assure safety and success for their husbands, sons, \n     and other loved ones on the battle front;\n       Whereas the needs of working mothers resulted in the \n     creation of child care programs, leading to the lasting \n     legacy of public acceptance of early child development and \n     care outside the home;\n       Whereas the needs of women on the homefront led to \n     employer-sponsored prepaid and preventative health care never \n     before seen in the United States; and\n       Whereas in 2000, Congress recognized the significance to \n     the Nation of the industrial achievements on the homefront \n     during World War II and the legacy of the women who worked in \n     those industries through the establishment of the Rosie the \n     Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park in \n     Richmond, California, as a unit of the National Park System: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the extraordinary contributions of the women \n     whose dedicated service on the homefront during World War II \n     was instrumental in achieving an Allied victory;\n       (2) recognizes the lasting legacy of equal employment \n     opportunity and support for child care and health care that \n     developed during the ``Rosie the Riveter'' era; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to take the \n     opportunity to study, reflect on, and celebrate the stories \n     and accomplishments of women who served the Nation as \n     ``Rosies'' during World War II.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
