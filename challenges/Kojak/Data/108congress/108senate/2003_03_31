Mr. President, a little later today or tomorrow, I want to \nshare with my colleagues at the appropriate time a visit I had with the \n101st Airborne families in Clarksville, TN, yesterday. I had the \nopportunity to go by and visit with those families, attend church, and \nto spend the early afternoon with them and have lunch with them. It was \na remarkable experience for me, Karen my wife, and our son Jonathan.\n  Over 17,000 women and men have been deployed from that particular \npost over the last several weeks. Those 17,000 are now in Iraq and \nKuwait as part of the 101st Airborne air assault team. The\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\npride we as a family felt in them, the stories that they told us, I \nwill be sharing with my colleagues over the next several days. But just \nthe lasting impression I had was this juxtaposition of feeling, as we \ntalked to the moms and dads and children, of concern for their husband \nor their spouse and, yes, an insecurity about their safety, which is \nnatural, as we would all feel, but at the same time an optimism, a \nfeeling of being able to contribute to the United States of America and \nour great democracy.\n  They were upbeat. They were optimistic. They were patriotic. And that \nsort of juxtaposition of feeling was something that was a real \nprivilege for me and my family to experience. The one thing they did \nall say, as we finished church and went to lunch, was: Make sure, when \nyou go back to Washington, that you let your colleagues know and let \nthe President of the United States know how much we appreciate their \nleadership, their support for our troops abroad. Let the President know \nthat we are keeping him and his family in our prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank our distinguished majority \nleader for visiting with the families of our troops from the 101st from \nhis State. All of us are personally visiting with families of people \nwho are there, and particularly in my case, I spent quite a bit of time \ntalking to the families whose loved ones are either missing in action \nor are verified prisoners of war.\n  There is nothing more rewarding than talking to these incredible \npeople who are afraid of what might be happening. They are, of course, \ngoing through something that all of us hope we will never have to go \nthrough, but they are very strong. They trust that we are doing \neverything possible to inform them, to find out the whereabouts of \nthese prisoners or missing persons. Most certainly, our military--this \nis something I personally ask in our briefing sessions--is trying to \nfind out exactly where these prisoners or missing people are located.\n  They are working through the Red Cross to try to have a Red Cross \nrepresentative see these prisoners just as the Red Cross \nrepresentatives are being able to see the Iraqi prisoners who are being \nheld by the allied forces. So it is a tough time for these wonderful \npeople of America who are supporting their loved ones in this very \ntrying time for them.\n\n  All of us want to be reminded that there are specific laws, \ninternational laws, called the Geneva Convention, about the treatment \nof prisoners. Article 17 explicitly prohibits inflicting physical or \nmental torture and any other forms of coercion on prisoners in order to \nobtain information of any kind, including publicizing photographs where \nthey can be recognized. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer questions \nmay not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant or \ndisadvantageous treatment of any kind.\n  Article 23 of the Geneva Convention prevents a prisoner from being \nsent to or detained in areas where they may be exposed to the fire of \nthe combat zone, and in no case can prisoners be used as human shields.\n  The Geneva Convention also requires access to the prisoners by \nofficials of the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n  We have informed the Iraqi Government that we intend to treat their \nprisoners with dignity and abide by the Geneva Convention. We most \ncertainly are appealing to the Iraqis to let in the Red Cross \npersonnel.\n  One of the benefits of the so-called embedded media is that they are \non the scene with our military and are able to provide some very candid \nphotos of our troops in action.\n  I want to show a few more of the photos. I started some of them last \nweek. I think these photos really speak more than a thousand words \nabout what it is to be at the front. We see the pictures on television, \nbut I wanted to display some of the still pictures showing how we are \ntreating prisoners of war and the people of Iraq as our allied soldiers \nare coming upon them.\n  This photo shows a U.S. marine helping an injured prisoner of war \nmoments after securing the port of Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. It was \ntaken on March 23 of this year.\n  U.S. Marine LCpl Marcco Ware of Los Angeles carries an Iraqi soldier \nwho was injured in an attack on Ware's outfit on Tuesday, March 26, \n2003. This unit has been attacking LCpl Ware's unit, but he found this \ninjured soldier and is carrying him to safety.\n  I am very proud of the character and courage of our forces and the \nway they are treating those who are in their care. At the same time, we \nhave seen our soldiers paraded on Iraqi television in clear violation \nof international law. We applaud our troops' bravery, courage, and \nprofessionalism. Our prayers are with them and their families in this \nmost difficult time.\n  President Bush has demanded that the Iraqis immediately comply with \nthe Geneva Convention. I urge all of those who might have information \nthat could be helpful to the Red Cross in getting in to see our \nprisoners of war to bring that forward. I encourage the Iraqi \nGovernment--if there is any shred of dignity--to make sure they abide \nby the Geneva Convention, just as our forces are abiding by it.\n  I know so many in the Senate are reaching out in their individual \nStates, trying to make sure that we touch the families who are \nsuffering so much. In churches throughout my hometown of Dallas, they \nhave prayer lists including every person who is connected to a member \nof that particular parish. Those young men and women are being named \nindividually in those prayers. I think all of us are touched. We have \nTexas embedded media.\n  I close with part of a piece in the San Antonio Express that was \nwritten by Sig Christenson, their military correspondent who is \nembedded with the 3rd Infantry Division:\n\n       March 25: It was a little after 3 p.m. today when the \n     little slice of Iraq that we occupy dimmed.\n       A vicious sandstorm, almost certainly the worst one yet for \n     the 3rd Infantry Division troops that have been here for \n     months, swept over the sandy plateau we took from 200 or so \n     Iraqi troops this past Sunday.\n       ``Wow, it's dark,'' Airman 1st Class Dan Housely said.\n       Not to mention surreal.\n       In less time than it takes to watch a rerun of ``The \n     Beverly Hillbillies,'' the once-overcast but relatively clear \n     desert was a swirling mass of sand. An orange hue descended \n     over the landscape, creating a scene resembling Viking probe \n     photos of Mars.\n       Sand gets into everything around here, and especially seems \n     drawn to your sinuses and ears. Take a ``Baby Wipe bath,'' as \n     soldiers call it, and you'll clear out clumps of dirt from \n     your ears--day after day.\n       Outside, gale-force winds kick up the sandy floor and turn \n     each fine grain into a weapon. . . . Within an hour, I had a \n     headache that pulsated at the back of my skull.\n       It could be worse.\n       We hold the high ground and have lots of firepower, but \n     that won't stop Iraqis loyal to Saddam Hussein. Already we've \n     lost a soldier within walking distance of my cot--he was shot \n     dead--and our troops have encountered Iraqis wearing American \n     military uniforms close to our camp.\n       If today's battle for a bridge outside An Najaf is any \n     example, we can expect a determined, fierce resistance all \n     the way to Baghdad. Iraqi regulars and elite militia driving \n     trucks took on 70-ton M1A1 tanks, coming at them again and \n     again.\n       That kind of fanaticism is cause for my imagination to go \n     wild as I prepare to sleep. A sandstorm gives perfect cover \n     to infiltrators and snipers out here, and as I worked today I \n     found myself frequently looking out my Humvee. It could \n     become a habit.\n\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much Senator Lincoln from Arkansas \nsharing this hour with me, and the rest of the hour on our side will be \nmanaged by Senator Thomas of Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Texas. \nShe and I have embarked on this opportunity to really highlight a \ntribute to our troops. I am honored to share the responsibility with \nher, and I am certainly appreciative of all the stories she brings to \nlight as we do highlight and pay tribute to our troops. It is really a \nforum for all of us to share in saluting the efforts of our men and \nwomen in uniform, and also to remind one another that as we lift up our \nprayers and thoughts for the families of our constituencies that have \nmen, women, and family members who are fighting in the Middle East in \nthis conflict, we can also lift up our thoughts and prayers for one \nanother's constituents. It is not just the people from Arkansas I can \nlift up my prayers for but all the service men and women, so that they \nknow in return it is not just their Senators but our whole body having \nthoughts and prayers for the men and women who are so gallantly \ndefending our freedoms in a land so far away.\n  When we kicked this off last week, we really hoped to have daily \ncontributions from our colleagues paying tribute to our Armed Forces \nand to those among our own constituents who are sacrificing in the \nliberation of Iraq and other operations. I speak for myself and, I am \nsure, Senator Hutchison when I say the response has been overwhelming. \nWe appreciate the contributions made by our colleagues and others who \nhave brought stories to the floor. We thank our colleagues for their \nparticipation and encourage all of them to continue to bring forth \nthose stories so that we all might share with one another the \nexperiences we are having in our own offices, particularly with our own \nconstituents.\n  Today I want to briefly speak about two of my constituents from \nArkansas, both of whom were called to serve in Iraq.\n  The first is Hospital Corpsman Michael Vann Johnson, Jr, a 25-year-\nold Navy medic and Little Rock native who was serving in the 3rd \nBattalion of the 5th Marine Expeditionary Force.\n  On Tuesday of last week, Michael was the first Arkansas serviceman \nreported to die in action, as well as the first Navy casualty, when he \nwas hit by shrapnel from an exploding grenade. At that time, Michael \nwas tending to another wounded soldier, placing himself in harm's way \nin order to minister to the needs of others.\n  His was a display of incredible courage and a testament to our \ntroops' dedication to their brothers and sisters in battle.\n  Oftentimes we do not really think about the camaraderie and the \ndedication these men and women in uniform have with one another, but it \nis a tremendous sacrifice they make on behalf of one another.\n  His was a display of courage and certainly dedication to his fellow \nman. I have with me today a story about Michael Johnson that was \npublished in yesterday's Washington Post, a story that gives us a \nglimpse of the kind of man he was. The story details a number of \nMichael's qualities as remembered by those who really knew him the \nbest--his energy, his intelligence, his compassion, and his generosity. \nThese were the qualities that spurred him to volunteer for an \nassignment in the Middle East because he wanted to be there to help his \nbrothers when they went into battle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Washington Post profile of Michael \nJohnson be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as his father, Michael Vann Johnson, Sr., said last \nweek:\n\n       He died for the freedom that we have, the freedom that each \n     of us loves.\n\n  A beautiful sentiment and a fitting tribute to a young man who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice to make this world a safer place for all of us.\n  I know my colleagues join me in sending out our deepest condolences \nto Michael's family, friends, and loved ones, particularly his parents \nand his wife Cherice, in this very difficult time.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it is so important for us collectively, as a \nbody, to lift up our prayers for each and every man and woman serving \nthis country in conflict right now. So I ask all of my colleagues to \nkeep his family in their prayers.\n  I would also like to recognize today LCpl James Smedley of the U.S. \nMarine Corps. Prior to being deployed to Iraq, Jason was assigned to \nthe 4th Civil Affairs Group here in Washington, DC. He was also \nenrolled as a student at Howard University. And if all of that is not \nenough to keep a young man busy at his age, he was also a valuable \nfull-time member of my personal staff here in my Washington office.\n  In January, Jason was deployed to Iraq. He was called up on a \nTuesday, and he left on that following Friday. Some of my colleagues \nmay recall that Jason accompanied me here one morning before his \ndeparture so that I could recognize his service on the Senate floor. He \nis a very handsome young man, full of energy, excitement, and \ndedication not only to his country but to his fellow man and to his \nCreator. He is the epitome of what we think of in the youth of America: \nyoung people who are excited about what they can contribute, who they \ncan become, and what they can do for others.\n  On Friday morning, we received news that Jason had been wounded in \ncombat and was being transported to a field hospital. For several hours \nthat morning, we were uncertain as to the extent of the injuries he had \nsuffered, but I am happy to report that although Jason had been \nwounded, he is safe and secure at a military hospital in Germany with \nrelatively minor wounds to his arm and his hand. He is expected to \nrecover fully from his injuries and may, in fact, return to the \nbattlefield upon his recovery. That is yet to be determined.\n\n  I have to share what I felt when I got an e-mail that said Jason had \nbeen wounded. We did not know how he was. All we knew is he was in a \nfield hospital probably about to undergo surgery. I knew that I was \ngoing to have to call his mother, Carolyn, whom I knew and who had come \nup with Jason to help him pack for his departure.\n  I thought about how she must feel. I thought to myself: Here I am \nwith twin boys almost 7 years old. Sometimes I even have a twinge of, I \ndo not know, guilt, or certainly just distance when my children go for \na sleepover, and here this woman had sent her son across the sea to a \nland unknown to him and to her. How she must feel to have gotten word \nthat he had been injured but she did not know how badly, she did not \nknow where he was, she did not know who was caring for him.\n  I called her, and she was remarkably steady. She, too, had gotten an \ne-mail from Jason just a couple of weeks ago where he had lifted up a \nprayer for her, just like the e-mail he had sent me: Dear Senator, I \nwant you to know how I am doing. I have wonderful men that I am \ntraveling with and who I will be fighting with, and I want to lift up a \nprayer for you. I want to lift up a prayer for you and for my friends \nin the office.\n  This was a young man not worried about himself but about others.\n  When I spoke with Carolyn, she was remarkably steady, and through the \ncourse of the day, we received another e-mail saying that he was doing \nOK, we knew where he was, and that he was going to be all right. I \nheard the sigh of a comforted mother who had gotten word that \neverything was OK for the time being. What small way I could identify \nwith that, I lifted up my sigh, too.\n  Along with Jason's families and friends, I wish to say I am deeply \nproud of his valiant service, and we all look forward to him returning \nhome in good health as soon as possible.\n  Jason Smedley, a young marine wounded in action, and Michael Johnson, \na Navy corpsman killed as he bravely sacrificed to help others--these, \nMr. President, are the human faces of the war to liberate Iraq. We will \nnot forget their courage and commitment, and it is in their honor that \nthe brave men and women of our Armed Forces, in conjunction with the \ntroops of our allies, will move forward with their mission to liberate \nIraq from the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein and destroy Saddam \nHussein's weapons of mass destruction. The sacrifices of these young \nmen and women will be well honored when this mission is complete.\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to touch on one other item. I mentioned the e-\nmails. Many of our offices are getting e-mails and letters. I have \nrecently received many e-mails from schoolchildren who want to send \npackages to our troops. They want to do letters and collages. They want \nto send care packages. Such patriotism among our young people always \ninspires me, and it is a wonderful tribute to the young people of this \ncountry. I know letters and pictures from schoolchildren across this \ncountry would light up the faces of our troops, many of which woke up \nthis morning and each morning in sand-filled dugouts.\n  At this point, the Department of Defense wants to make sure the \nletters and drawings from relatives make it to our troops first. So \nthey asked us to hold off sending care packages to the Middle East for \nthe time being.\n  The Defense Department is encouraging folks who want to show their \nsupport to do so in a variety of ways, and I thought I would take a \nmoment to share those with everybody.\n\n  To send a message to the troops, you can e-mail them through \nwww.operationdearabby.net. If you have already purchased goods to send \nin care packages, the Defense Department suggests that for the time \nbeing you send those to a local veterans home. A wonderful way to honor \nthe men and women in service to this country today is to certainly \nhonor those who have served our country in the past.\n  If you have perishables or items you have brought together with the \nintent of sending them abroad, perhaps you could take them to a local \nveterans home and share them with the veterans community of this \ncountry. Then perhaps at a later date, you can do something for the \ntroops abroad.\n  You could also call a local base to notify the families of deployed \nservicemen that you have goods, and they can collect them and send them \noff if it is at all possible. The real key has been that the Department \nof Defense, for security purposes, does not want to be inundated with \npackages for our service men and women and hope you will look at \ncreative ways to honor our troops, just as we are today and each and \nevery day coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate to honor these \nwonderful service men and women who are defending our country. We are \nlooking also for the multitude of ways we can honor them. We encourage \neach and every one of our constituents to be inventive and to look for \nother ways they can honor those service men and women who are serving \nour country. You could also support the troops by displaying a flag and \nteaching your children respect for the flag.\n  Our hope is that in the coming weeks we will all look for ways to \nhonor those men and women who are serving our country abroad, who are \ndefending our freedoms, and who are working to eliminate the tyranny of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who join us in this effort, and in the \ncoming days I look forward to the ways we can honor our troops. I do, \nagain, appreciate the support and the work of my colleague from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 30, 2003]\n\n                  Medic Who Died Torn by Duty, Doubts\n\n                           (By Amy Goldstein)\n\n       As a medic at a San Diego naval clinic, he had been \n     resolute in volunteering for duty in Iraq. But Michael V. \n     Johnson Jr. was a healer by training and temperament, and \n     once he arrived in the Middle East, he was uncertain of the \n     morality of having placed himself in war.\n       In letters to his wife, Cherice, sometime two letters a \n     day, he wrote out his worries about what he--and the Marine \n     division to which he was attached--might be called upon to \n     do. How would God view him if he helped take a life?\n       On the war's sixth day, last Tuesday, it was Johnson who \n     was killed, becoming the first naval casualty in Iraq. His \n     26th birthday would have been tomorrow, his wedding \n     anniversary in two weeks. At 4:30 a.m. Thursday, Cherice \n     Johnson was awakened by knocks on the door of their military \n     housing. Seeing the chaplain and the officer through the \n     peephole, she understood why they had come.\n       The information was sketchy--Johnson apparently had died \n     when shrapnel from a grenade struck his head, she was told. \n     The military emissaries did not say exactly where he had \n     been. Nor did they explain ``if it was an accident on our \n     behalf or in combat,'' said his wife, 24, who had fallen in \n     love with him when she was a high school senior and he a \n     college sophomore in Little Rock.\n       He was a young man of many facets: an extrovert with the \n     energy of a child, a passion for basketball, a gift for \n     drawing and singing, a knack for science and calculus.\n       In Little Rock, his mother, Jana Norfleet, said she is \n     trying to draw comfort from a certain symmetry: a son born in \n     the spring and lost in the spring.\n       She said she tried to instill a sense of striving in the \n     youngest of her three children, her only son. ``I pushed him \n     a lot,'' she said. ``We would spend many nights just sitting, \n     studying together. We didn't move until he was finished.'' \n     And even when he was young, she was explicit about her \n     reasons. ``I'm doing this to make you realize there are many \n     kids out there who are going to excel higher,'' she would \n     tell him ``and I want you to be in that group.''\n       Starting in second grade, he was in classes for gifted and \n     talented students. He graduated from Parkview Arts and \n     Science Magnet High School, which selects its students from \n     the entire county. His mother and stepfather still keep on a \n     living room shelf a plaque from his freshman year, when he \n     was listed in Who's Who Among American High School Students.\n       Six-foot-one, he excelled at basketball. ``I think he saw \n     himself as a basketball professional in his dreams,'' his \n     mother said, ``but we kind of swayed him in the other \n     direction. We told him, `That should be your second love. You \n     need to make a living, son'.''\n       Growing up, he had loved the cats, dogs, gerbils and fish \n     in his family's house, and he was fascinated in biology \n     classes by dissection. Compassion was part of his Christian \n     faith, forged by his stepfather's insistence on attending \n     church every Sunday.\n       He thought of a career that involved medicine. Together \n     with a girlfriend at the time, he enrolled at the University \n     of Central Arkansas, commuting the 45 minutes north to \n     Conway, Ark. He hoped to enter classes that would lead him \n     into physical therapy, but they were full, and he pursued \n     pre-engineering classes for two years before he left.\n       ``He went into the Navy to continue his education, to have \n     it paid for by Uncle Sam,'' said his mother, who was uneasy \n     about his choice but told him she would support him.\n       ``He had wanted to strive for bigger and better things and \n     travel, and he just came upon the Navy and decided that would \n     be the starting point for what he wanted to do,'' his wife, \n     Cherice, said.\n       After basic training, he trained as a hospital corpsman at \n     the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine \n     Palms, Calif., then was assigned to a clinic at the Marine \n     Corps Recruit Depot that is part of the Naval Medical Center, \n     San Diego. He had an affinity for the work. He gave physicals \n     to potential recruits, helped to treat the sick and, at \n     times, provided counseling.\n       He and Cherice formed a wide circle of friends, and he \n     developed an attachment to the men he thought of as brothers \n     in a surrogate, West Coast family. Last June, he extended his \n     five-year enlistment by a year.\n       Late in the year, as the prospect of war grew, he was among \n     fewer than half-dozen of the clinic co-workers he knew who \n     volunteered for the Middle East, Cherice Johnson said.\n       He did not ask his mother for her opinion before deciding. \n     If he had, she would have told him not to go, ``because \n     that's what mothers say,'' Norfleet said. ``I'm selfish. I'm \n     going to tell you that right here and now. That's my baby. \n     But he didn't ask me. He's a man.\n       She told him, once again, that she supported his choice, \n     but her feelings slipped out. ``Don't you think you could \n     find a tent like on the `M*A*S*H' series, a tent to treat the \n     wounded back behind? she asked.\n       He replied, she recalled, that ``they were his brothers, \n     and he wanted to be there with them and for them.''\n       His final conversation with his mother went on for two \n     hours, on a cell phone as he was about to be deployed from \n     California. He last called his wife on a refueling stop in \n     Spain.\n       The last letter to his mother arrived just over two weeks \n     ago from Kuwait. ``By the time you receive this letter, I \n     will have gone to war,'' he wrote. ``If I don't make it back \n     don't be sad for me. Be happy for me and praise God, because \n     I've gone to heaven to be with grandma.''\n       ``The reality of war draws you closer to God,'' the medic \n     wrote. ``It lets you know how valuable life really is.''\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will take some time this afternoon to \nrecognize what is being done for us and for this country. All of us \nhave strong feelings about those who are defending freedom. We have \ntalked about the risks they take, but I rise today to recognize the \nsacrifice of a particular Marine Corps Second Lieutenant, Therrel Shane \nChilders.\n  Certainly all of us recognize the necessity of defending freedom. We \nrecognize the willingness of brave men and women to do what is \nnecessary. We recognize the connection between the land of the free and \nthe home of the brave. However, when we have these losses,\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nthey are a great tragedy to all of us, particularly to the families and \nloved ones.\n  Known as Shane to his family and friends, he was assigned to the 1st \nBattalion, 5th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of Camp Pendleton. \nShane was the first combat casualty of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was \n30 years old.\n  2LT Childers was lost while leading his platoon in a fight to secure \na pumping station in southern Iraq. Shane's parents, Joseph and Judy \nChilders of Powell, WY, say that Shane always wanted to be a marine. \nHis family says he liked the rhythm of life in the Corps, the pride \nthat goes with wearing the Marine uniform.\n  After his high school graduation in 1990, he enlisted in the Marine \nCorps and served in the Persian Gulf war. After his duty in the gulf \nwar, Shane served as a Marine security guard at the American consulate \nin Geneva, Switzerland, and at the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.\n  Shane later left the Marines and attended college at the Citadel \nwhere he completed his studies in an untraditional 3 years and was \ncommissioned in 2001. Today, we mourn the loss of this young man and \ncertainly pray for his family.\n  I express my condolences to the Childers family and my gratitude to \nthe men and women who wear the uniform and walk the line so that our \nNation can continue to remain free.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, more than anything else, we all are \nthinking about the conflicts that are going on in Iraq and about our \nmen and women who are fighting there. Of course, we have to continue to \ndo what we have to do. Our lives go forward. We think about it a lot, \nand hear a great deal about it--I suppose more because of the embedded \nmedia--than we have ever heard before. We hear various kinds of \nreports. Certainly they are good for us to hear. We need to know what \nis happening. From time to time, we also hear some questionable \ncomments and questions about the commitment of our leadership. \nNevertheless, that is where we are.\n  I guess all of us think a lot about why we are there, what needs to \nbe done, and what will be the outcome. This morning I met with a group \nof 8th graders from Big Piney, WY, one of the smaller towns in western \nWyoming. The whole class from the high school came. I think there were \n30 of them. One of them asked: What do you think of the war?\n  Well, how would you react to 8th graders who ask that? I think it \nmakes you really wonder. So we talked a little bit about it. We talked \nabout the fact that it is a war that was brought about by terrorism, a \nwar that was brought about by what happened in the Persian Gulf 12 \nyears ago, a war that was brought about by the fact that Saddam \nHussein, who had to sign an agreement to finish that war because he was \ndefeated, has not done what he was required to do.\n  We have to talk a little bit about the fact that the whole reason we \nare there, the whole effort, is to disarm Saddam for the safety of the \nUnited States, for the safety of the world. No one wants to have a war, \ncertainly. It is not anything that we would like to do. He had great \nopportunities to do something different in these past 12 years. He \nrefused to do so.\n  These 8th grade kids seemed to understand that no one wants war but \nwe have to defend freedom. We have had to defend freedom numerous \ntimes, of course--quite different situations, quite different \ncircumstances, but we find ourselves in different circumstance now as a \nresult of 11 September, where instead of having to be afraid of \ndivisions landing on your shore with artillery, and so on, now we find \nthat one or two persons with mass destruction tools and weapons can \ndestroy 3,000 people very easily. So it is a different situation. It is \nhard for young people to understand that, but I was very pleased with \nthe fact that they do not like war--neither do we--but they understood \nthat you have to defend those things that threaten the basis of our \ncountry.\n  They were in Washington, DC, to see the foundation of the United \nStates, to see what freedom is about: The Government of the people, by \nthe people and for the people. They were here to see the Supreme Court. \nThey were here to see the Constitution, the thing that probably ensures \nour freedom more than any other document. They understood that we have \nto defend those things, and I was so pleased.\n  They were very skeptical. When they thought about it some and they \nthought about it in terms of the kinds of threats that are there and \nthen when they thought about it in terms of those people who are \nvoluntarily protecting our freedoms, who have gone into a war \nsituation--I am a little bit prejudiced, being a marine, as to the \nMarine aspect of it, but everyone who is there is sacrificing for our \nfreedom. Certainly we have a right to speak out and we have a right to \nhave different views, but I hope we all recognize our responsibility to \nsupport our troops, people who are giving more than they could possibly \nbe asked. We have the opportunity to do that.\n  It is a good exercise for us to be able to talk to young people about \nwhy it is we are involved and the importance of protecting the kind of \ncountry we have and want to maintain. Certainly there is nothing more \nimportant than that.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President and distinguished colleagues, America is \nthe greatest country the world has ever known. And, today, in places \nacross the world, the greatest fighting men and women the world has \never known continue America's legacy of liberating oppressed people.\n  My friends, America went to Bosnia to offer liberation and hope from \ndespair and suffering--we went to Haiti to offer hope to an oppressed \npeople--we went to Somalia to offer America's legacy of a better life \nfor people who had rarely seen a day free of suffering, persecution and \ntorture.\n  Freedom and liberty are two words that should stir great emotions in \nall Americans.\n  Freedom and liberty are the gift of America to oppressed people \neverywhere.\n  Freedom and liberty, speak often these words because America's sons \nand daughters are in Iraq today doing what Americans have done for \ngenerations: We offer hope for a better tomorrow.\n  Let's talk about America's sons and daughters. They come from an \nAmerica today that is no less interested in its own freedom and \nliberties than the freedom and liberties we wish for all people.\n  They are the sons and daughters of a great American revolution that \nnever ends. The cause of freedom and liberty never ends.\n  We have seen the pros and cons in the streets of American cities \nthese past several weeks. There are great passions on both sides. The \ngreat glory of America is that 28 protestors can occupy the office of a \nU.S. Senator and not fear being put to death for their views.\n  This is the fight that America's sons and daughters wage today.\n  If we may, for a moment, find peace in the haze of conflict between \nthose who support our efforts today, and those who do not, I ask that \nwe do it in the name of America's sons and daughters who have been \ncalled upon to duty and service. Perhaps our energies now can be better \nspent by focusing on the world that we create in America today when our \ntroops return.\n  Get off the couch; stop watching the news; forget the radio \nbroadcasts; turn off the playstation; unplug the TV; get outside, \nAmerica.\n  We've had our say. Now let's have our say for the tens of thousands \nof Americans fighting for freedom and liberty.\n  Let us dedicate our energy--our pro and our con--to building the best \npossible Nation for our troops to come home to.\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\n  Join hands and voices to help the moms, the dads, the husbands, the \nwives, the sons, the daughters, the brothers and the sisters to get \nthrough these difficult days. Offer more than words; offer hope indeed.\n  Walk with them together during these times, open your homes and open \nyour hearts. Our Nation is at war with an enemy across the world.\n  Let us not be a nation at war with each other within. We have a \ncommon goal: Offer comfort and hope and encouragement to those who \nfight for our freedom, and those who are left behind to pray for their \nsuccess and safe return home.\n  America, the greatness of our Nation is not that we can survive \nconflict and division. The greatness of America is that we can build \nupon our differences and multiply our blessings.\n  For the sake of the families of those who sacrifice, for the sake of \nthe soldiers who are in harm's way, let us build a better America for \ntheir return.\n  These are momentous days in the history of this country. They remind \nme of this remarkable statement by one of our early patriots, Patrick \nHenry, during our war of independence. He wrote:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink \n     from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like \n     Hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation \n     with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the \n     triumph. What we obtain too cheaply, we esteem too lightly; \n     tis dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven \n     knows how to put a proper price on its goods; and it would be \n     strange indeed if so celestial an article as Freedom should \n     not be highly rated.\n\n  You can talk about equality or you can make it happen.\n  You can sympathize with the poor or you can help create a job for \nthem.\n  Yes, these are challenging times; we are witnessing the birth of a \nnew century and a new moment of hope for mankind. Yes, these are \ndangerous, trying times, but it is a great time to be alive.\n  Allow me to share some of my favorite quotes from Abraham Lincoln to \nguide our thoughts about this momentous time.\n  In the second inaugural, Lincoln said:\n\n       The dogmas of the quite past are inadequate to the stormy \n     present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we \n     must rise to the occasion. As our case is new, so we must \n     think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and \n     then we shall save our country.\n\n  You don't undertake change for the sake of change. But when the \ncircumstances have changed, it is folly to stick with the old game \nplan.\n  The fall of the Soviet Union changed the world forever.\n  September 11 changed the world forever.\n  The problem with some at the United Nations and even some in our own \nCongress is that they are ``enthralled'' with the old way of doing \nthings. To them you don't deal with evil, you just contain it. But that \ndogma led to the deaths of millions in Rwanda and Cambodia because we \nwere too timid to act.\n  For decades we allowed terror networks to grow and infiltrate even \nfree societies. Because we thought there was nothing we could do about \nso pervasive an evil, we just hoped for the best.\n  Now we have historic opportunity to strike a decisive blow against \ntyranny and terrorism in one place and give birth to a new century of \nhope for freedom and security. We must accept the moral responsibility \nour power gives us.\n  Lincoln also said:\n\n       Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith \n     let us do our duty as we understand it.\n\n  Our Nation, more than any other, was born on eternal values--That God \nhad endowed all people with inalienable rights to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. But as much as we would like to believe it, the \npower of those ideals do not sweep the globe and enforce themselves. \nSomebody has to do it.\n  Right now the United States, Britain and a couple of dozen other \nnations are doing the dirty work of liberty. The lesson of history is: \nsomebody has to do it.\n  Lincoln was right; it takes faith to do it. Certain things can't be \nproven to people who are devoted to another path.\n  We have a duty to do, and to most of us it is clear. Just because \neverybody doesn't see it doesn't mean it isn't exactly the right thing \nto do.\n  Finally, a word about our great President. Here is a message for \n``43'' from ``16''. Lincoln said:\n\n       If I were to read, much less answer all the attacks made on \n     me, this shop might as well be closed for business. I do the \n     very best I know how--the very best I can; and I mean to keep \n     doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, \n     what's said against me won't amount to anything. If the end \n     brings me out wrong, then angels swearing I was right would \n     make no difference.\n\n  I am profoundly grateful that we have a President who does not run \nhis life by what the polls say. That is the opposite of leadership.\n  I believe in a free media. I believe in the power of public opinion. \nBut I see red when I see newspaper and Internet polls one week into the \nwar in Iraq, asking about whether we are bogged down or if the \nPresident is using the right strategy.\n  So much of the 24-7 commenting and opinionating out there is \nprecisely the substance that covers the floors of Minnesota feedlots.\n  In a long ago war it was said:\n\n       They also serve who only stand and wait.\n\n  The same is not true for those who just sit and wait.\n  Public opinion is, as it should be, strongly with this President; \nstrongly with our fighting men and women; strongly that we are doing \nthe right thing in the name of freedom, in the name of liberty; to be \nan end to terror, to be an end to oppression, to be an end to rape, to \nbe an end to torture, and to open up new worlds of possibilities. But I \ndo ardently wish people would shut off the TV and shut off the computer \nand get out there and build the best possible great Nation for our \ntroops to come home to. Shut it all off, say a prayer for our troops, \nsay a prayer for our leaders, and go to work building a great America.\n  Finally, one more word from Lincoln and I am done:\n\n       With malice toward none, with charity for all, with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive to finish the work we are in; to bind up the \n     Nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the \n     battle, and for his widow and orphan--to do all which may \n     achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves \n     and all Nations.\n\n  May God bless our fighting men and women on the front line. May God \nbless and support and hold and comfort the families of those who have \ngiven the ultimate sacrifice. May God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand it is appropriate to speak \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4546-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4546-S4551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I came to the floor to say a few words \nabout Senator Patrick Moynihan. Obviously, I didn't know him for all of \nhis very successful and rather stupendous life, but I knew him rather \nwell for that portion spent in the Senate. Even as to that portion, it \nwas not my privilege to spend a great deal of time on the same \ncommittees with the Senator. But it was obvious to me he was a very big \nman, not big only in stature--he was very tall--but clearly he spoke \neloquently and could grasp the situation with a demeanor and in a \nmanner that was not very common and ordinary here.\n  From my standpoint, we struck up a friendship principally based upon \nhis asking me a lot of questions about the budget and about my work as \nchairman or ranking member on the Senate floor.\n  Today it was my privilege to attend, with my wife Nancy, his funeral \nmass and some of the other ceremonial\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nevents that bid him goodbye. My wife Nancy and I got to share with his \nmarvelous wife Elizabeth; everybody calls her Liz. We had had on one \noccasion as couples an opportunity to travel with Senator Moynihan and \nhis wife and others on a very lengthy trip that included China and \nother parts of the world, Japan. It was rather marvelous to have him \nregale us with stories and tales and history as we would be traveling \nfrom one country to another. When he was around on those kinds of \nevents, you didn't have to have books to read. You would just get a \nseat close to him and ask questions, and he would tell you something \nsignificant, different, important, something you clearly never would \nread and never had heard.\n  We all miss him. There is no doubt about it.\n  One day I recall the close of a budget session, a long debate on the \nbudget. Final passage came up. It had been a very arduous and difficult \none, much like the last one we just experienced, but more so. I had \ncounted votes and thought I would win. I thought I would get 51 votes, \nwhich is what I needed. I noted that during the time of the debate and \nin particular the closing, Senator Moynihan had listened a little more \nthan I had expected. No reason for him to do that. Senators were in and \nout.\n\n  I had also noticed during the course of events that he would stop by \nand talk with me and say something to me about what was going on.\n  The vote occurred, and I was not paying attention to the vote. I knew \nI would get the votes necessary. But when the votes were counted, I had \none more than expected. So I asked, who was that; what happened? \nSomebody on the other side of the aisle, without saying much and \nperhaps without talking to his own leadership, had voted for the \nresolution. Sure enough, it was Patrick Moynihan. I didn't have a \nchance then to say anything to him, but later on, I purposely found him \nand thanked him, and I asked him what was that all about.\n  He said: Well, to tell you the truth, that Budget Act is too \nconfusing and confounds everybody. You worked too hard to try to get it \ndone, and you made an awful lot of sense. I just decided that \nregardless of the philosophy, that was enough for me to vote for the \nbudget resolution, in the sense that I was just voting for you.\n  Things like that don't happen very often. I am sure everybody has \nstories similar to that and more so. Today, as we attended the funeral \nmass, there were literally hundreds of people from all walks of life--\nkind of befitting what he had done and the life he had lived. On one \nside I noticed the Secretary of Defense had kind of eased his way into \nthe church and was kneeling on one side there in an inconspicuous way--\nmany ambassadors, a lot of Senators, a very large entourage of \nSenators. Perhaps as many as 10 former Senators from our day who now \nlive somewhere else doing other things had found their way into \nWashington to be there.\n  I choose today for these very few moments to say thank you to him for \nhis great service in the Senate, to his family, and particularly to his \nwife, who obviously sacrificed greatly while he was being a Senator. \nShe, too, has a profession of her own and was somewhat restrained and \nhad to live more of a life in Washington, tied sort of to his career, \nthan she had at other times in her life. But from what I have gathered, \nthey were both great citizens and very pleased and proud to be part of \nthis Senate.\n  I thank him and bid him adieu.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in \nmourning the passing of a giant of the 20th century--our former \ncolleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The list of his \ncontributions to this Nation is long and impressive: from White House \naide, to Ambassador to India and the United Nations, to Senator from \nthe State of New York for 24 years. Pat Moynihan left an indelible mark \non our Nation and the world.\n  Senator Moynihan has been described as the best thinker among \npoliticians since Woodrow Wilson and the best politician among thinkers \nsince Thomas Jefferson. Few Senators in the 241-year history of this \ninstitution have had the intellectual impact on public policy as did \nPatrick Moynihan. From tax policy to environmental protection, he was \nan always constructive and frequently dominant advocate. He frequently \nconverted a Senate committee hearing or floor debate into what was his \nfirst passion, a college classroom. Those of us who were fortunate to \nbe his students are forever in his debt.\n  Adele and I offer our condolences to Elizabeth and their family, and \nwe will recognize in our prayers the loss that the Nation and each of \nus individually have suffered.\n  Mr. President, I add that I consider it a terrible irony that on the \neve of Senator Moynihan's death, March 26, the White House announced \nthe signing of amended Executive Order 12,958. This Executive order \ndelays the release of millions of long-classified Government documents \nand grants to Government bureaucrats new authority to reclassify \ninformation. The vast majority of these documents are more than 25 \nyears old and were to have been automatically declassified on April 17 \nof this year.\n  I consider this ironic because Senator Moynihan was a champion of \nopen government. Among his many writings, including 18 books, was ``The \nTorment of Secrecy: The Background and Consequences of American \nSecurity Policy.'' Senator Moynihan concluded that book with these \nwords:\n\n       A case can be made that secrecy is for losers, for people \n     who don't know how important information really is. The \n     Soviet Union realized this too late. Openness is now a \n     singular and singularly American advantage. We put it in \n     peril by poking along in the mode of an age now past. It is \n     time to dismantle government secrecy, this most pervasive of \n     cold war era regulations. It is time to begin building the \n     supports for the era of openness, which is already upon us.\n\n  Mr. President, we in the Senate and those in the White House should \nheed Pat Moynihan's wise words. As a former chairman of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, I can tell you that this \nadministration is being excessively cautious in keeping information \nfrom the American people. Certainly, when we are at war and facing \nincreased threats from international terrorist networks, we need to \nkeep secret that information that could pose a threat to our security \nif it were to fall into the wrong hands. But that hardly seems to be \nthe case with most of the information that is covered by this overly \nbroad Executive order.\n  Again, I emphasize that the overwhelming bulk of this material is \nmore than 25 years old. Ultimately, excessive secrecy will undermine \nthe public's confidence in our Government and its essential \ninstitutions. Excessive secrecy denies to the American people their \nfull capability to participate, evaluate, and act as they determine to \nbe in the national interest.\n\n  By restricting access to crucial and often conflicting information, \nexcessive secrecy creates the environment for what is known as \nincestuous amplification. This is a military term and is defined by \nJane's Defense Weekly. Incestuous amplification is ``a condition in \nwarfare where one only listens to those who are already in lockstep \nagreement, reinforcing set beliefs and creating a situation ripe for \nmiscalculation.''\n  Excessive secrecy undermines the classification value of information \nwhich is genuinely critical to our national security. Last year, I had \nthe honor to cochair a joint House-Senate inquiry into the events of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Our purpose was to help the American people \nunderstand what our Government knew about potential threats from al-\nQaida prior to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, \nand how our intelligence and law enforcement agencies responded. But \neven more important, our responsibility was to develop an action plan \nof recommendations to mitigate a repeat of this tragedy.\n  Our staff reviewed more than 500,000 pages of documents. We conducted \n22 hearings, 13 of them closed, 9 open to the public. We filed our \nfinal report--the classified version--on December 20, 2002.\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\n  The joint inquiry has requested declassification of our final report, \nas well as key documents related to the Government's knowledge of al-\nQaida and potential terrorist threats. For 100 days, congressional \nstaffers have been working with the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and other relevant agencies to get the \nfinal report of the joint inquiry declassified. We have not yet been \nsuccessful. I am hopeful that we can present most of this material to \nthe public at the earliest date. We have already released, in \ndeclassified form, our findings and our recommendations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of those \nrecommendations at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I want to read one of the \nrecommendations from the joint inquiry committee. It is recommendation \nNo. 15:\n\n       The President should review and consider amendments to the \n     Executive Orders, policies and procedures that govern the \n     national security classification of intelligence information, \n     in an effort to expand access to relevant information for \n     Federal agencies outside the Intelligence Community, for \n     State and local authorities, which are critical to the fight \n     against terrorism, and to the American public.\n       In addition, the President and heads of Federal agencies \n     should ensure that the policies and procedures to protect \n     against the unauthorized disclosure of classified \n     intelligence information are well understood, fully \n     implemented, and vigorously enforced.\n       Congress should also review the statutes, policies, and \n     procedures that govern the national security classification \n     of intelligence information and its protection from \n     unauthorized disclosure.\n       Among other matters, Congress should consider the degree to \n     which excessive classification has been used in the past and \n     the extent to which the emerging threat environment has \n     greatly increased the need for real-time sharing of sensitive \n     information.\n       The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General, \n     should review and report to the House and Senate Intelligence \n     Committees on proposals for a new and more realistic approach \n     to the processes and structures that have governed the \n     designation of sensitive and classified information.\n       The report should include proposals to protect against the \n     use of the classification process as a shield to protect \n     agency self-interest.\n\n  The public has the right to know what its Government has done and is \ndoing to protect Americans and United States interests. Potential \nembarrassment is not a good enough reason to keep past or current \nGovernment materials secret.\n  One of the most fitting tributes we could pay to Pat Moynihan would \nbe a heightened recognition of the damage that excessive secrecy exacts \non our Government's credibility, and to recommit ourselves to a \nGovernment which trusts its people to know the truth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \neditorial from the New York Times of March 28, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Secrecy: The Bush Byword\n\n       Add one more item to the list of things the Bush \n     administration has been quietly doing on the home front while \n     the nation is preoccupied with Iraq. This week President Bush \n     signed an executive order that makes it easier for government \n     agencies, including the White House, to keep documents \n     classified and out of public view.\n       The order does a number of things at once. It delays by \n     three years the release of declassified government documents \n     dating from 1978 or earlier. It treats all material sent to \n     American officials from foreign governments--no matter how \n     routine--as subject to classification. It expands the ability \n     of the Central Intelligence Agency to shield documents from \n     declassification. And for the first time, it gives the vice \n     President the power to classify information. Offering that \n     power to Vice President Dick Cheney, who has shown \n     indifference to the public's right to know what is going on \n     inside the executive branch, seems a particularly worrying \n     development.\n       All of this amends an order by President Bill Clinton that \n     actually eased the process of declassification. The \n     administration says the three-year delay in declassifying \n     documents dating to the Carter administration and earlier is \n     necessary because of a huge backlog of documents that must be \n     reviewed before decisions are made on whether to declassify \n     them.\n       Taken individually, each of these actions might raise \n     eyebrows for anyone who values open government. Taken \n     together, they are reminders that this White House is \n     obsessed with secrecy. President Clinton's policy was that \n     ``when in doubt,'' a document was not automatically \n     classified. That ensured that government papers would not \n     easily be kept under wraps without a compelling reason. And \n     while President Bush keeps in place many of the mechanisms \n     for automatic declassification, he has raised a bar that can \n     only hurt the ability of historians, researchers and all \n     Americans to arrive at informed judgments about the actions \n     of the presidents and their administrations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       Since the National Security Act's establishment of the \n     Director of Central Intelligence and the Central Intelligence \n     Agency in 1947, numerous independent commissions, experts, \n     and legislative initiatives have examined the growth and \n     performance of the U.S. Intelligence Community. While those \n     efforts generated numerous proposals for reform over the \n     years, some of the most significant proposals have not been \n     implemented, particularly in the areas of organization and \n     structure. These Committees believe that the cataclysmic \n     events of September 11, 2001 provide a unique and compelling \n     mandate for strong leadership and constructive change \n     throughout the Intelligence Community. With that in mind, and \n     based on the work of this Joint Inquiry, the Committees \n     recommend the following:\n       1. Congress should amend the National Security Act of 1947 \n     to create and sufficiently staff a statutory Director of \n     National Intelligence who shall be the President's principal \n     advisor on intelligence and shall have the full range of \n     management, budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed \n     to make the entire U.S. Intelligence Community operate as a \n     coherent whole. These responsibilities should include:\n       Establishment and enforcement of consistent priorities for \n     the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence \n     throughout the Intelligence Community;\n       Setting of policy and the ability to move personnel between \n     elements of the Intelligence Community;\n       Review, approval, modification, and primary management and \n     oversight of the execution of Intelligence Community budgets;\n       Review, approval, modification, and primary management and \n     oversight of the execution of Intelligence Community \n     personnel and resource allocations;\n       Review, approval, modification, and primary management and \n     oversight of the execution of Intelligence Community research \n     and development efforts;\n       Review, approval, and coordination of relationships between \n     the Intelligence Community agencies and foreign intelligence \n     and law enforcement services; and\n       Exercise of statutory authority to insure that Intelligence \n     Community agencies and components fully comply with \n     Community-wide policy, management, spending, and \n     administrative guidance and priorities.\n       The Director of National Intelligence should be a Cabinet \n     level position, appointed by the President and subject to \n     Senate confirmation. Congress and the President should also \n     work to insure that the Director of National Intelligence \n     effectively exercises these authorities.\n       To insure focused and consistent Intelligence Community \n     leadership, Congress should require that no person may \n     simultaneously serve as both the Director of National \n     Intelligence and the Director of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency, or as the director of any other specific intelligence \n     agency.\n       2. Current efforts by the National Security council to \n     examine and revamp existing intelligence priorities should be \n     expedited, given the immediate need for clear guidance in \n     intelligence and counterterrorism efforts. The President \n     should take action to ensure that clear, consistent, and \n     current priorities are established and enforced throughout \n     the Intelligence Community. Once established, these \n     priorities should be reviewed and updated on at least an \n     annual basis to ensure that the allocation of Intelligence \n     Community resources reflects and effectively addresses the \n     continually evolving threat environment. Finally, the \n     establishment of Intelligence Community priorities, and the \n     justification for such priorities, should be reported to both \n     the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on an annual \n     basis.\n       3. The National Security Council, in conjunction with the \n     Director of National Intelligence, and in consultation with \n     the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the \n     Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, should prepare, \n     for the President's approval, a U.S. government-wide strategy \n     for combating terrorism, both at home and abroad, including \n     the growing terrorism threat posed by the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and associate technologies. This \n     strategy should identify and fully engage those foreign \n     policy, economic, military, intelligence, and law enforcement \n     elements that are critical to a comprehensive blueprint for \n     success in the war against terrorism.\n       As part of that effort, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall develop the Intelligence Community \n     component of the strategy, identifying specific programs and \n     budgets and including plans to address the\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\n     threats posed by Osama Bin Laden and al Qa'ida, Hezbollah, \n     Hamas, and other significant terrorist groups. Consistent \n     with applicable law, the strategy should effectively employ \n     and integrate all capabilities available to the Intelligence \n     Community against those threats and should encompass specific \n     efforts to:\n       Develop human sources to penetrate terrorist organization \n     and networks both overseas and within the United States;\n       Fully utilize existing and future technologies to better \n     exploit terrorist communications; to improve and expand the \n     use of data mining and other cutting edge analytical tools; \n     and to develop a multi-level security capability to \n     facilitate the timely and complete sharing of relevant \n     intelligence information both within the Intelligence \n     Community and with our appropriate federal, state, and local \n     authorities;\n       Enhance the depth and quality of domestic intelligence \n     collection and analysis by, for example, modernizing current \n     intelligence reporting formats through the use of existing \n     information technology to emphasize the existence and the \n     significance of links between new and previously acquired \n     information;\n       Maximize the effective use of covert action in \n     counterterrorist efforts;\n       Develop programs to deal with financial support for \n     international terrorism; and\n       Facilitate the ability of CIA paramilitary units and \n     military special operations forces to conduct joint \n     operations against terrorist targets.\n       4. The position of National Intelligence Officer for \n     Terrorism should be created on the National Intelligence and \n     a highly qualified individual appointed to prepare \n     intelligence estimates on terrorism for the use of Congress \n     and policymakers in the Executive Branch and to assist the \n     Intelligence Community in developing a program for strategic \n     analysis and assessments.\n       5. Congress and the Administration should ensure the full \n     development within the Department of Homeland Security of an \n     effective all-source terrorism information fusion center that \n     will dramatically improve the focus and quality of \n     counterterrorism analysis and facilitate the timely \n     dissemination of relevant intelligence information, both \n     within and beyond the boundaries of the Intelligence \n     Community. Congress and the Administration should ensure that \n     this fusion center has all the authority and the resources \n     needed to:\n       Have full and timely access to all counterterrorism-related \n     intelligence information, including ``raw'' supporting data \n     as needed;\n       Have the ability to participate fully in the existing \n     requirements process for tasking the Intelligence Community \n     to gather information on foreign individuals, entities and \n     threats;\n       Integrate such information in order to identify and assess \n     the nature and scope of terrorist threats to the United \n     States in light of actual and potential vulnerabilities;\n       Implement and fully utilize data mining and other advanced \n     analytical tools, consistent with applicable law;\n       Retain a permanent staff of experienced and highly skilled \n     analysts, supplemented on a regular basis by personnel on \n     ``joint tours'' from the various Intelligence Community \n     agencies;\n       Institute a reporting mechanism that enables analysts at \n     all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to post \n     lead information for use by analysts at other agencies \n     without waiting for dissemination of a formal report;\n       Maintain excellence and creativity in staff analytic skills \n     through regular use of analysis and language training \n     programs; and\n       Establish and sustain effective channels for the exchange \n     of counterterrorism-related information with federal agencies \n     outside the Intelligence Community as well as with state and \n     local authorities.\n       6. Given the FBI's history of repeated shortcomings within \n     its current responsibility for domestic intelligence, and in \n     the face of grave and immediate threats to our homeland, the \n     FBI should strengthen and improve its domestic capability as \n     fully and expeditiously as possible by immediately \n     instituting measures to:\n       Strengthen counterterrorism as a national FBI program by \n     clearly designating national counterterrorism priorities and \n     enforcing field office adherence to those priorities;\n       Establish and sustain independent career tracks within the \n     FBI that recognize and provide incentives for demonstrated \n     skills and performance of counterterrorism agents and \n     analysts;\n       Significantly improve strategic analytical capabilities by \n     assuring the qualification, training, and independence of \n     analysts, coupled with sufficient access to necessary \n     information and resources;\n       Establish a strong reports officer cadre at FBI \n     Headquarters and field offices to facilitate timely \n     dissemination of intelligence from agents and to analysts \n     within the FBI and other agencies within the Intelligence \n     Community;\n       Implement training for agents in the effective use of \n     analysts and analysis in their work;\n       Expand and sustain the recruitment of agents and analysts \n     with the linguistic skills needed in counterterrorism \n     efforts;\n       Increase substantially efforts to penetrate terrorist \n     organizations operating in the United States through all \n     available means of collection;\n       Improve the national security law training of FBI \n     personnel;\n       Implement mechanisms to maximize the exchange of \n     counterterrorism-related information between the FBI and \n     other federal, state and local agencies; and\n       Finally solve the FBI's persistent and incapacitating \n     information technology problems.\n       7. Congress and the Administration should carefully \n     consider how best to structure and manage U.S. domestic \n     intelligence responsibilities. Congress should review the \n     scope of domestic intelligence authorities to determine their \n     adequacy in pursuing counterterrorism at home and ensuring \n     the protection of privacy and other rights guaranteed under \n     the Constitution. This review should include, for example, \n     such questions as whether the range of persons subject to \n     searches and surveillances authorized under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) should be expanded.\n       Based on their oversight responsibilities, the Intelligence \n     and Judiciary Committees of the Congress, as appropriate, \n     should consider promptly, in consultation with the \n     Administration, whether the FBI should continue to perform \n     the domestic intelligence functions of the United States \n     Government or whether legislation is necessary to remedy this \n     problem, including the possibility of creating a new agency \n     to perform those functions.\n       Congress should require that the new Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the \n     Department of Homeland Security report to the President and \n     the Congress on a date certain concerning:\n       The FBI's progress since September 11, 2001 in implementing \n     the reforms required to conduct an effective domestic \n     intelligence program, including the measures recommended \n     above;\n       The experience of other democratic nations in organizing \n     the conduct of domestic intelligence;\n       The specific manner in which a new domestic intelligence \n     service could be established in the United States, \n     recognizing the need to enhance national security while fully \n     protecting civil liberties; and\n       Their recommendations on how to best fulfill the nation's \n     need for an effective domestic intelligence capability, \n     including necessary legislation.\n       8. The Attorney General and the Director of the FBI should \n     take action necessary to ensure that:\n       The Office of Intelligence Policy and Review and other \n     Department of Justice components provide in-depth training to \n     the FBI and other members of the Intelligence Community \n     regarding the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act (FISA) to address terrorist threats to the United States;\n       The FBI disseminates results of searches and surveillances \n     authorized under FISA to appropriate personnel with the FBI \n     and the intelligence Community on a timely basis so they may \n     be used for analysis and operations that address terrorist \n     threats to the United States.\n       The FBI develops and implements a plan to use authorities \n     provided by FISA to assess the threat of international \n     terrorist groups within the United States fully, including \n     the extent to which such groups are funded or otherwise \n     supported by foreign governments.\n       9. The House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary \n     Committees should continue to examine the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act and its implementation \n     thoroughly, particularly with respect to changes made as a \n     result of the USA PATRIOT Act and the subsequent decision of \n     the United States Foreign Intelligence Court of Review, to \n     determine whether its provisions adequately address present \n     and emerging terrorist threats to the United States. \n     Legislation should be proposed by those Committees to remedy \n     any deficiencies identified as a result of that review.\n       10. The Director of the National Security Agency should \n     present to the Director of National Intelligence and the \n     Secretary of Defense by June 30, 2003, and report to the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees, a detailed plan \n     that:\n       Describes solutions for the technological challenges for \n     signals intelligence;\n       Requires a review, on a quarterly basis, of the goals, \n     products to be delivered, Funding levels and schedules for \n     every technology development program;\n       Ensures strict accounting for program expenditures;\n       Within their jurisdiction as established by current law, \n     makes NSA a full collaborating partner with the Central \n     Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     in the war on terrorism, including fully integrating the \n     collection and analytic capabilities of NSA, CIA, and the \n     FBI; and\n       Makes recommendations for legislation needed to facilitate \n     their goals.\n       In evaluating the plan, the Committees should also consider \n     issues pertaining to whether civilians should be appointed to \n     the position of Director of the National Security Agency and \n     whether the term of service for the position should be longer \n     than it has been in the recent past.\n       11. Recognizing that the Intelligence Community's employees \n     remain its greatest resource, the Director of National \n     Intelligence should require that measures be implemented to \n     greatly enhance the recruitment and development of a \n     workforce with the intelligence skills and expertise needed \n     for success in counterterrorist efforts, including:\n       The agencies of the Intelligence Community should act \n     promptly to expand and improve counterterrorism training \n     programs within the Community, insuring coverage of\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\n     such critical areas as information sharing among law \n     enforcement and intelligence personnel; language \n     capabilities; the use of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act; and watchlisting;\n       The Intelligence Community should build on the provisions \n     of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 \n     regarding the development of language capabilities, including \n     the Act's requirement for a report on the feasibility of \n     establishing a Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps, and implement \n     expeditiously measures to identify and recruit linguists \n     outside the Community whose abilities are relevant to the \n     needs of counterterrorism;\n       The existing Intelligence Community Reserve Corps should be \n     expanded to ensure the use of relevant personnel and \n     expertise from outside the Community as special needs arise;\n       Congress should consider enacting legislation, modeled on \n     the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, to instill the concept of \n     ``jointness'' through the Intelligence Community. By \n     emphasizing such things as joint education, a joint career \n     specialty, increased authority for regional commanders, and \n     joint exercises, that Act greatly enhanced the joint \n     warfighting capabilities of the individual military services. \n     Legislation to instill similar concepts throughout the \n     Intelligence Community could help improve management of \n     Community resources and priorities and insure a far more \n     effective ``team'' effort by all the intelligence agencies. \n     The Director of National Intelligence should require more \n     extensive use of ``joint tours'' for intelligence and \n     appropriate law enforcement personnel to broaden their \n     experience and help bridge existing organizational and \n     cultural divides through service in other agencies. These \n     joint tours should include not only service at Intelligence \n     Community agencies, but also service in those agencies that \n     are users or consumers of intelligence products. Serious \n     incentives for joint service should be established throughout \n     the Intelligence Community and personnel should be rewarded \n     for joint service with career advancement credit at \n     individual agencies. The Director of National Intelligence \n     should also require Intelligence Community agencies to \n     participate in joint exercises;\n       Congress should expand and improve existing educational \n     grant programs focused on intelligence-related fields, \n     similar to military scholarship programs and others that \n     provide financial assistance in return for a committee to \n     serve in the Intelligence Community; and\n       The Intelligence Community should enhance recruitment of a \n     more ethnically and culturally diverse workforce and devised \n     a strategy to capitalize upon the unique cultural and \n     linguistic capabilities of first-generation Americans, a \n     strategy designed to utilize their skills to the greatest \n     practical effect while recognizing the potential \n     counterintelligence challenges such hiring decisions might \n     pose.\n       12. Steps should be taken to increase and ensure the \n     greatest return on this nation's substantial investment in \n     intelligence, including:\n       The President should submit budget recommendations, and \n     Congress should enact budget authority, for sustained, long-\n     term investment in counterterrorism capabilities that avoid \n     dependence on repeated stop-gap supplemental appropriations;\n       In making such budget recommendations, the President should \n     provide for the consideration of a separate classified \n     Intelligence Community budget;\n       Long-term counterterrorism investment should be accompanied \n     by sufficient flexibility, subject to congressional \n     oversight, to enable the Intelligence Community to rapidly \n     respond to altered or unanticipated needs;\n       The Director of National Intelligence should insure that \n     Intelligence Community budgeting practices and procedures are \n     revised to better identify the levels and nature of \n     counterterrorism funding within the Community;\n       Counterterrorism funding should be allocated in accordance \n     with the program requirements of the national \n     counterterrorism strategy; and\n       Due consideration should be given to directing an outside \n     agency or entity to conduct a thorough and rigorous cost-\n     benefit analysis of the resources spent on intelligence.\n       13. The State Department, in consultation with the \n     Department of Justice, should review and report to the \n     President and the Congress by June 30, 2003 on the extent to \n     which revisions in bilateral and multilateral agreements, \n     including extradition and mutual assistance treaties, would \n     strengthen U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The review should \n     address the degree to which current categories of \n     extraditable offenses should be expanded to cover offenses, \n     such as visa and immigration fraud, which may be particularly \n     useful against terrorists and those who support them.\n       14. Recognizing the importance of intelligence in this \n     nation's struggle against terrorism, Congress should maintain \n     vigorous, informed, and constructive oversight of the \n     Intelligence Community. To best achieve that goal, the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States should study and make recommendations, concerning how \n     Congress may improve its oversight of the Intelligence \n     Community, including consideration of such areas as:\n       Changes in the budgetary process;\n       Changes in the rules regarding membership on the oversight \n     committees;\n       Whether oversight responsibility should be vested in a \n     joint House-Senate Committee or, as currently exists, in \n     separate Committees in each house;\n       The extent to which classification decisions impair \n     congressional oversight; and\n       How Congressional oversight can best contribute to the \n     continuing need of the Intelligence Community to evolve and \n     adapt to changes in the subject matter of intelligence and \n     the needs of policy makers.\n       15. The President should review and consider amendments to \n     the Executive Orders, policies and procedures that govern the \n     national security classification of intelligence information, \n     in an effort to expand access to relevant information for \n     federal agencies outside the Intelligence Community, for \n     state and local authorities, which are critical to the fight \n     against terrorism, and for the American public. In addition, \n     the President and the heads of federal agencies should ensure \n     that the policies and procedures to protect against the \n     unauthorized disclosure of classified intelligence \n     information are well understood, fully implemented and \n     vigorously enforced.\n       Congress should also review the statues, policies and \n     procedures that govern the national security classification \n     of intelligence information and its protection from \n     unauthorized disclosure. Among other matters, Congress should \n     consider the degree to which excessive classification has \n     been used in the past and the extent to which the emerging \n     threat environment has greatly increased the need for real-\n     time sharing of sensitive information. The Director of \n     National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, and the Attorney General, should review and report \n     to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on proposals \n     for a new and more realistic approach to the processes and \n     structures that have governed the designation of sensitive \n     and classified information. The report should include \n     proposals to protect against the use of the classification \n     process as a shield to protect agency self-interest.\n       16. Assured standards of accountability are critical to \n     developing the personal responsibility, urgency, and \n     diligence which our counterterrorism responsibility requires. \n     Given the absence of any substantial efforts within the \n     Intelligence Community to impose accountability in relation \n     to the events of September 11, 2001, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence and the heads of Intelligence Community agencies \n     should require that measures designed to ensure \n     accountability are implemented throughout the Community.\n       To underscore the need for accountability:\n       The Director of Central Intelligence should report to the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committee no later than June \n     30, 2003 as to the steps taken to implement a system of \n     accountability throughout the Intelligence Community, to \n     include processes for identifying poor performance and \n     affixing responsibility for it, and for recognizing and \n     rewarding excellence in performance.\n       As part of the confirmation process for Intelligence \n     Community officials, Congress should require from those \n     officials an affirmative commitment to the implementation and \n     use of strong accountability mechanisms throughout the \n     Intelligence Community; and\n       The Inspectors General at the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the \n     Department of State should review the factual findings and \n     the record of this Inquiry and conduct investigations and \n     reviews as necessary to determine whether and to what extent \n     personnel at all levels should be held accountable for any \n     omission, commission, or failure to meet professional \n     standards in regard to the identification, prevention, or \n     disruption of terrorist attacks, including the events of \n     September 11, 2001. These reviews should also address those \n     individuals who performed in a stellar or exceptional manner, \n     and the degree to which the quality of their performance was \n     rewarded or otherwise impacted their careers. Based on those \n     investigations and reviews, agency heads should take \n     appropriate disciplinary and other action and the President \n     and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees should be \n     advised of such action.\n       17. The Administration should review and report to the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees by June 30, 2003 \n     regarding what progress has been made in reducing the \n     inappropriate and obsolete barriers among intelligence and \n     law enforcement agencies engaged in counterterrorism, what \n     remains to be done to reduce those barriers, and what \n     legislative actions may be advisable in that regard. In \n     particular, this report should address what steps are being \n     taken to insure that perceptions within the Intelligence \n     Community about the scope and limits of current law and \n     policy with respect to restrictions on collection and \n     information sharing are, in fact, accurate and well-founded.\n       18. Congress and the Administration should ensure the full \n     development of a national watchlist center that will be \n     responsible for coordinating and integrating all terrorist-\n     related watchlist systems; promoting awareness and use of the \n     center by all relevant government agencies and elements of \n     the private sector; and ensuring a consistent and \n     comprehensive flow of terrorist names into the center from \n     all relevant points of collection.\n       19. The Intelligence Community, and particularly the FBI \n     and the CIA, should aggressively address the possibility that \n     foreign\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\n     governments are providing support to or are involved in \n     terrorist activity targeting the United States and interests. \n     State-sponsored terrorism substantially increases the \n     likelihood of successful and more lethal attacks within the \n     United States. This issue must be addressed from a national \n     standpoint and should not be limited in focus by the \n     geographical and factual boundaries of individual cases. The \n     FBI and CIA should aggressively and thoroughly pursue related \n     matters developed through this Joint Inquiry that have been \n     referred to them for further investigation by these \n     Committees.\n       The Intelligence Community should fully inform the House \n     and Senate Intelligence Committees of significant \n     developments in these efforts, through regular reports and \n     additional communications as necessary, and the Committee \n     should, in turn, exercise vigorous and continuing oversight \n     of the Community's work in this critically important area.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n101 is located in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it was with great sorrow that I learned \nlast week of the death of our former colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan of New York.\n  Senator Moynihan, was an intellectual giant in the Senate and \nthroughout his service to our Nation. The breadth of his interests--and \nhis knowledge--was extraordinary. From questions about the architecture \nand urban development of Washington, D.C. to the problems created by \nsingle parent families to the workings of the International Labor \nOrganization, Senator Moynihan had thought deeply and designed policy \nanswers. I don't think there was a Senator who served with Pat Moynihan \nwho didn't learn something from Senator Moynihan's vast stock of \npersonal experience, understanding of history, and ability to draw \nparallels between seemingly unrelated topics to enlighten our \nunderstanding of both.\n  I will always have fond memories of the several occasions on which I \njoined Senator Moynihan in the Senators' private dining room and was \ntreated to a lunchtime tutorial. I could ask a question on virtually \nany topic and get a dissertation in response. Our conversations ranged \nfrom art history to baseball, American history, our Middle East policy, \nthe history of science and scientific advancement, and more. Seemingly \nthere was no topic on which Pat did not have unique insight, and I \nalways came away from those lunches feeling like I had just emerged \nfrom an intellectually stimulating graduate seminar.\n  I had the particular pleasure of serving with Senator Moynihan on the \nFinance Committee for eight years. As Chairman and as ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan was a true leader. Starting in \n1993, when I took Senator Bentsen's seat on the Committee and Senator \nMoynihan claimed his chairmanship, Chairman Moynihan successfully \nguided the 1993 economic plan through the committee and the Senate. \nThat budget, which I was proud to help shape and support, laid the \nfoundation for the record economic expansion of the 1990s.\n  After Republicans took control of the Senate in the 1994 election, \nSenator Moynihan was a fierce critic of their excessive tax cut \nproposals. We joined in opposing shortsighted proposals to have \nMedicare ``wither on the vine,'' turn Medicaid into a block grant, and \ndestroy welfare rather than reforming it. Senator Moynihan was, as \nalways, an especially passionate defender of teaching hospitals, \nwarning that the plan to slash spending for Medicare's graduate medical \neducation would threaten medical research in this country--a fear that \nhas proved well-founded as teaching hospitals have struggled to survive \nthe much smaller changes enacted as part of the compromise Balanced \nBudget Act that emerged in 1997.\n  The Finance Committee--and the Senate--would not have been the same \nwithout him. Who else will be able to gently tutor witnesses on the \nrelevance of the grain trade in upstate New York in the early \nnineteenth century to a current debate about health care policy? Who \nelse will call for the Boskin and Secrecy Commissions of the future? \nAnd who else will educate his colleagues on the impact on our society \nof the demographic time bomb of the baby boom generation?\n  The Senate has lost a legend. The country has lost a brilliant and \nunconventional thinker who contributed greatly to our society on fronts \nranging across transportation, welfare and poverty, racism and civil \nrights, and architecture and urban planning.\n  I will miss Pat Moynihan. I will miss his sly wit, his apt and \nsplendidly diverse quotations, his sharp questioning and distrust of \nglib answers, and his fierce humanity. On behalf of myself and my wife \nLucy, I want to express my deepest condolences to his wife Liz, their \nchildren and the rest of his family and friends. My heart goes out to \nthem.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, an intellectual pioneer who I felt honored to serve \nwith in the U.S. Senate. He rose from humble beginnings to Harvard, and \nto a life of service in four different Presidential administrations, as \nan ambassador to India and the U.N., and as New York's Senator for four \nterms. Throughout his career in service, he paved his own path--one of \nintegrity, independence, and principled leadership on the critical \nnational questions of our age.\n  Whenever he spoke I listened closely, because I knew I would always \nlearn something from him. He possessed tremendous intellect and \nforesight, showed unflagging courage in championing unsung causes, and \ncommanded extraordinary respect on both sides of the aisle. He was a \ntrue renaissance man who put action behind his diverse interests: from \nprotecting the sanctity of the American family, to preserving historic \nart and architecture, to restoring Pennsylvania Avenue as America's \n``main street,'' to saving Social Security for future generations.\n  I offer my condolences to his wife Elizabeth, who was truly his life \npartner. There will no doubt be a memorial built in his honor someday \nsoon on the streets of New York; but Senator Moynihan's legacy is \nalready living--in safer streets in our cities, a cleaner environment, \nand a stronger national community. To borrow a memorable Moynihan \nphrase, his life defined public service and public policy up for all \nwho aspire to contribute to our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, as we stand here today, the conflict goes \non in Iraq. I was just talking to a friend. He asked me when are we \ngoing to make a move and how is it going?\n  We have only been there a week and a half, but one would think from \nthe television coverage that we are in the middle of the Hundred Years \nWar.\n  There will be many stories that come out of conflicts such as this. I \nwant to relate one.\n  SSG Charles Donovan, Jr., is a 27-year-old 8-year Marine Corps \nveteran, born and raised in Great Falls, MT. On the 17th of February he \nwas deployed to Kuwait for military service with the First Marine \nDivision. He is a communications expert and a towgunner. A towgunner is \nthe one who fires ammunition from the tank.\n  He has been married to his wife Candice for almost 8 years. They met \nat Camp Pendleton, CA. They served in the Marine Corps together for 4 \nyears. Since his deployment, Donovan has been able to contact his \nfamily frequently and recently received the news from his wife that \nthey are expecting their first child. He was able to reply to his wife \nby e-mail.\n  It is needless to say anything more about the news and the elation \nthat is experienced by this couple. No. 1, he was all right and getting \nalong fine; and, second, the experience of learning of the good news of \nan expected first child is always great.\n  So my congratulations go out to Charles and Candice. And I have every\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nfaith that he will complete his mission and come home.\n  There are thousands of similar stories stemming from this mission, so \nably carried out by our men and women in uniform. It is uniquely \nAmerican and typical of our warriors of freedom. It distinguishes and \nsets the American military apart from any other nation in the history \nof man's constant struggle for freedom and human dignity.\n  We see the pictures every day, not of the ugliness of war but of the \nmen and women who carry out the humanitarian acts as war is carried on. \nWe will succeed in our mission. And we look forward to the day when \nthey all come home.\n  Also, I take great pride to stand here today on the Senate floor to \nrecognize and say thank you to the men and women from Montana and all \nwho serve across this land.\n  We have support organizations popping up in just about every State, \norganizations formed to give comfort to families and provide various \nprograms such as the one I just mentioned. It is happening everywhere, \nand there are far too many to mention today.\n  I commend the efforts of one program especially because I met with \nthis group in Livingston, MT. They call themselves MOST--the Military \nOverseas Support Team--made up of people who have family members \nserving in that area, and they act as a support system for each person.\n  Then there is another one called Operation Clean Socks. It has been \nset up to collect and send socks to our military men and women in the \nMiddle East. That sounds strange, but to those of us who have worn the \nuniform of this great country, socks become a big item, especially to \nus old marines who traveled on our feet.\n  Folks all over this country are rallying their communities to get \nsupport for our troops. I am pleased to see so many of them supportive \nin Montana.\n  Here in Washington we see the images on television. We are thinking \nabout the troops every day. We know how hard it is fighting for the \nfreedoms of those who are oppressed, and we thank you. We thank you for \nwhat you are doing and want you to know that our thoughts and prayers \nare not only with you but also with your families.\n  You are the best and the greatest ambassadors of the American dream. \nYou will succeed in the efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein and free the \nIraqi people. I am confident in our military. I know this effort will \nbe accomplished as soon as possible so they all can come home to the \nwelcoming arms of their families, so that every Charles Donovan, Jr., \ncan see his first child enter the world with the same freedoms with \nwhich he was born. We think about them every day.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 77, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Theresa Lazar \nSpringmann, of Indiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Indiana.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise in support of \nJudge Theresa Lazar Springmann, who has been nominated to the United \nStates District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.\n  Judge Springmann has served on both sides of the bench with \ndistinction. Upon graduation from the University of Notre Dame Law \nSchool, Judge Springmann clerked for the Honorable James T. Moody of \nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana--\nthe very court she will join upon her confirmation. She then entered \nprivate practice as an associate with Spangler, Jennings & Dougherty, \nP.C., and later became the first woman partner there. During her tenure \nin private practice, she specialized in insurance defense litigation, \nautomobile liability, contract disputes, unfair competition and trade \ninfringement. She also participated in her firm's pro bono program, \naccepting at least three cases a year from Legal Services of Northwest \nIndiana, Inc., in Gary IN.\n  Judge Springmann has made a broad range of contributions to the bar. \nShe was a founding member of the Lake County Bar Association and has \nserved in various leadership roles with this organization. Judge \nSpringmann is also a member of the Federal Bar Association and the \nWomen Lawyers Association.\n  Since 1995, Judge Springmann has served as a United States Magistrate \nJudge for the Northern District of Indiana. From 2000 to 2002, she \nserved as the Federal Magistrate Judges Association Seventh Circuit \nDirector, where she represented all magistrate judges in the Seventh \nCircuit in forming policy positions and recommendations to the \nAdministrative Office and Federal Judicial Council on issues concerning \nmagistrate judges.\n  I am confident that Judge Springmann will serve on the bench with \nintegrity, intelligence and fairness.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we again demonstrate how cooperative \nthe Senate and, in particular, Democratic Senators are being to an \nadministration that continues to refuse to work with us to select \nconsensus court judges who could be confirmed relatively quickly by the \nSenate and fill the remaining Federal court vacancies.\n  In the prior 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we were \nable to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies \nthat Republicans had stored up by refusing to allow nominees of \nPresident Clinton to be considered. We were able to do so despite the \nhostility of the White House. The judicial nominees of this President \nare conservatives, many of them quite to the right of the mainstream. \nMany of these nominees have been active in conservative political \ncauses or groups. Democrats moved fairly and expeditiously on as many \nas we could consistent with our obligations to evaluate carefully and \nthoroughly these nominees to lifetime seats in the federal courts.\n  Last year alone, in an election year, the Democratic-led Senate \nconfirmed 72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior six years \nof Republican control. Not once did the Republican-controlled Committee \nconsider that many of President Clinton's district and circuit court \nnominees.\n  While Republicans point to the 377 judges confirmed under President \nClinton, but they fail to mention that only 245 of them were confirmed \nduring the 6\\1/2\\ years Republicans controlled the Senate. That amounts \nto only 38 confirmations per year when the Republicans last held a \nmajority and there was a Democrat in the White House. In 1999, the \nRepublican majority did not hold a hearing on any judicial nominee \nuntil June. Tomorrow, the Republican majority will hold its seventh \nhearing including a 32nd judicial nominee in the last 2 months. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee is acting like a runaway train, operating at \nbreakneck speed and breaking longstanding rules and practices of the \ncommittee.\n  This year we have had a rocky beginning with a hearing for three \ncontroversial circuit court nominees that has caused a great many \nproblems we might have avoided. The chairman's insistence on \nterminating debate on the Cook and Roberts nominations is another \nserious problem. Of course, the administration's unwillingness to work \nwith the Senate so that we may be provided the documents and \ninformation needed to proceed with a final vote on the Estrada \nnomination has already proved to be a significant problem. The \nopposition to the Sutton nomination is\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nalso extensive. The concerns about the Tymkovich nomination are \nsignificant. The unprecedented nature of a President renominating \nsomeone for the same judicial position after a defeat in committee has \nled to the Owen nomination is pending on the floor with the assent of \nonly the Republicans on the committee.\n  Nonetheless, the Senate has proceeded to confirm 114 of President \nBush's judicial nominees, including 14 this year alone. The Senate \nconfirmed the controversial nomination of Jay Bybee to the Ninth \nCircuit, another pro-life judicial nominee. With this one circuit court \nconfirmation, the Senate has confirmed more circuit court judges than \nRepublicans allowed to be confirmed in the entire 1996 session. In \naddition, I note that it was not until September 1999, 9 months into \nthe year, that 14 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were \nconfirmed in the first session of the last Congress in which \nRepublicans controlled the Senate majority. At the pace set by \nRepublicans now, we are a full six months ahead of that schedule.\n  The Indiana nominee, Theresa Lazar Springmann, is currently a U.S. \nMagistrate Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District \nof Indiana. She has the bipartisan support of her home State Senators. \nThe fact that she is being confirmed to the district court months in \nadvance of the vacancy arising demonstrates how cooperative the Senate \nis being. Only rarely has a nominee been confirmed in advance of a \nvacancy arising. The nominee is well regarded and supported by her home \nState Senators. I congratulate Judge Springmann and her family on her \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Theresa \nSpringmann who is being considered for a position on the United States \nDistrict Court of Northern Indiana.\n  Early last year, Judge William Lee and Judge James Moody informed me \nof their decisions to assume senior status after distinguished careers \nof public service. Both of these individuals are remarkable leaders on \nthe Federal bench, and I applaud their leadership to Indiana and to the \nlegal profession.\n  Immediately upon hearing of these decisions, I notified the White \nHouse and was asked by the President to help find the most qualified \ncandidates to fill these two important positions in Hammond and Fort \nWayne. I took this role very seriously and selected the candidates who \nwould best serve the Northern District of Indiana.\n  After sharing my selections with my friend and colleague Senator Evan \nBayh, I submitted the names and applications of three outstanding \ncandidates to the White House for their consideration. The President \nrecently selected Assistant United States Attorney Philip Simon and \nUnited States Magistrate Theresa Springmann.\n  Judge Theresa Springmann was the first woman to be made partner at \nSpangler, Jennings & Dougherty, the largest law firm in Northwest \nIndiana. She followed up this distinction by becoming the first woman \njudicial officer in the Northern District of Indiana. Judge Springmann \nhas served as a United States magistrate judge since March of 1995, \nwhere she has presided over 30 civil jury trials, 10 civil and criminal \nbench trials, and conducted over 300 settlement conferences for the \ndistrict court.\n  She has received a number of high performance ratings throughout her \ntenure as a magistrate judge, including the A.V. rating from \nMartindale-Hubbell and the highest judicial rating from the Lake County \nBar Association.\n  I believe that Theresa Springmann will demonstrate remarkable \nleadership to Northern Indiana and will appropriately uphold and defend \nour laws under the Constitution. I encourage my colleagues to support \nher nomination.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, the Washington Post saw fit to \nprint an article entitled ``Many Willing, But Only A Few Are Able.'' \nOstensibly about the U.S. and British-led force of the coalition now \nfighting in Iraq, the Post's article mocks the sovereign nations of the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, \nand the Republic of Palau--three of our country's most steadfast allies \nin the Western Pacific. This is both offensive and undeserved. As \nChairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's subcommittee \nwith responsibility for our relations with the freely associated \nstates, I would like to set the record straight. In making this \nstatement, I am speaking not only for myself but also on behalf of \nSenator Domenici, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. The citizens of these nations deserve better.\n  The Post would have its readers believe that these Pacific islands \nare nothing more than banana republics. This is not the case. It is \nobvious to me and anyone familiar with the special relationship between \nour Nations that the Post is unaware of the islands' historical \nsignificance and continued role in our national defense. The Post's \nfailure to learn the most basic facts about our allies is sloppy and \nirresponsible.\n  These islands endured occupation by Japan under a League of Nation's \nMandate and then saw some of the bloodiest fighting during World War \nII. It was the residents of these islands who endured the contests for \nEnewetak, Pelilieu, and Kwajalein.\n  After the War, the islands were placed under the United Nations' \nTrusteeship system. The United States brought self-government and the \ndevelopment of political institutions. The Congress of Micronesia \nrejected both integration with the United States and independence in \nfavor of sovereignty and free association and Congress overwhelmingly \nratified the Compacts of Free Association. An important aspect of that \nrelationship is the ability of citizens of the freely associated states \nto attend the United States military academies and serve in the United \nStates Armed Services.\n  As we speak, there are citizens of all three countries serving in \nIraq in every branch of the U.S. military, ready to make the ultimate \nsacrifice. Marshallese citizens are fighting with the 101st Airborne \nDivision and the Third Infantry Division, in harm's way and approaching \nBaghdad. The Federated States of Micronesia has hundreds of its people \non active duty. Indeed, the son of the current President of Micronesia, \nLeo Falcam, is a Lieutenant Colonel with the U.S. Marines and commands \nan air squadron in Okinawa. Clearly, the Marshall Islands and \nMicronesia are contributing to the war effort.\n  The Compact of Free Association has guided our relationship with \nthese nations for nearly 20 years. During that time, these nations have \nbeen among our strongest allies in the United Nations and elsewhere. \nTheir sons and daughters have known oppression and have volunteered to \nserve with our citizens to end despotism and terrorism. It is offensive \nto read articles like that published by the Washington Post that \ndenigrate foreign nations and their citizens in an effort to ridicule \nPresident Bush and the administration.\n  The Post conveniently forgets the outrages committed by Saddam \nHussein against the Kurds and the people of Iraq and now chooses to \ninsult good and decent people who have the courage to stand with the \nUnited States.\n  As I said, I take issue with this article. So while the reporter and \neditor of the Post congratulate themselves on one more cheap and vulgar \nattack on the Administration, I would like to offer my apology to the \nthousands of citizens in our freely associated states. We owe them our \ngratitude for their commitment. The Post should be ashamed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4554-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4554-S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Women's \nHistory Month. This time has been appropriately designated to reflect \nupon the important contributions and heroic sacrifices that women have \nmade to our Nation and to consider the challenges they continue to \nface. Throughout our history, women have been at the forefront of every \nimportant movement for a better and more just society, and they have \nbeen the foundation of our families and communities.\n  In Maryland, we are proud to honor those women who have given so much \nto improve our lives. Their achievements illustrate their courage and \ntenacity in conquering what others perceive as overwhelming obstacles. \nThey include Harriet Elizabeth Brown, civil rights leader, teacher and \nprincipal. In the 1930s in Calvert County, she fought to eliminate pay \ndisparities between white and black teachers. Another noteworthy \nMarylander was Anna Ella Carroll who served as an unofficial adviser \nand strategist to President Abraham Lincoln in her efforts to preserve \nthe Union during the Civil War. We are all indebted to Rose Kushner, \nteacher, medical writer, and psychologist, who worked tirelessly as an \nadvocate for better screening and treatment of breast cancer. Their \naccomplishments and talent provide inspiration not only to the \nresidents of Maryland, but to people all over the globe.\n  My good friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, \nis a tremendous example of the commitment and dedication women give to \npublic service. From her background as a social worker to her election \nto the U.S. Senate, Senator Mikulski, who has served longer than any \nother woman currently in the Senate, has always worked to ensure those \nin need receive the critical support services necessary for them to \nlive independently and with dignity. She appropriately played a key \nrole in establishing this month when in 1981, cosponsoring a resolution \nestablishing National Women's History Week, a predecessor to Women's \nHistory Month. Today, I wish to honor her dedication and service to the \npeople of Maryland and this Nation.\n  This Women's History Month is a fitting time to honor the women of \nthe armed services and recognize the sacrifice they make for our \ncountry, especially in light of the unprecedented role women are \nplaying in our military engagement in Iraq. Approximately 15 percent of \nall active duty personnel are women. From the American Revolution and \nthe Civil War through modern day armed conflict, American women have \nmade sacrifices along side their husbands, sons, brothers and fathers \nto preserve the freedom upon which this Nation was founded. At this \ntime, we know that Army Specialist Shoshawna Johnson is being held as a \nPOW in Iraq, and Private First Class Jessica Lynch is missing in \naction. We send our hopes and prayers for the safe return of these \nbrave young women, and all of those serving our country, and want their \nfamilies to know that our thoughts are with them during this very \ndifficult time.\n  Women have made great strides in overcoming historic adversity and \nbias but they still face many obstacles. Unequal pay, poverty, \ninadequate access to healthcare and violent crime are among the \nchallenges that continue to disproportionately affect women. While the \nmost recent Census Bureau figures show that the percentage of women \nholding managerial jobs grew from one-third to a high of 46 percent \nsince 1983, this figure has not improved since 2001. In addition, women \ncontinue to earn less than their male colleagues, earning only 77.5 \npercent of every dollar earned by men. Despite these obstacles, women \npush on. In recent years, the poverty rate for single women has \ndeclined and more women hold advanced degrees than ever before. Recent \nfigures show that women received approximately 45 percent of law and 42 \npercent of medical degrees awarded in this country. This is a dramatic \nimprovement from a few decades ago and should continue as more and more \nyoung women recognize their opportunities are limitless.\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\n  Indeed women continue to make great progress. As we highlight their \naccomplishments in history this month, I believe it is also important \nto educate present and future generations about gender discrimination \nso that we do not repeat past mistakes. During my service in Congress, \nI have strongly supported efforts to address women's issues and \neradicate gender discrimination and inequality. These include \ncosponsoring the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Equity in Prescription \nInsurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act, and continually supporting an \nEqual Rights Amendment to the Constitution. I am proud of these efforts \nand I will continue my commitment to bring fuller equality to all \nwomen. I am confident that the women of America will continue to excel \nwhile continuing their role as advocates for those values and ideals \nwhich are at the heart of a decent, caring and fair society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4555-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEXT STEPS: MA AND PA METHAMPHETAMINE LABS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today after hearing several \nreports of the continued problem of methamphetamine production in rural \nAmerica. Law enforcement must dedicate more and more resources to the \nsmall, ``ma and pa'' meth labs. These small labs pose a threat not only \nbecause of the drugs they produce, but also the serious health and \nenvironmental risk caused by the production process.\n  In years past, methamphetamine production was controlled by skilled \nchemists or well-educated individuals who were paid significant amounts \nof money to manufacture the narcotic. Methamphetamine production at \ntimes took an entire day to produce. Today, with modern technology and \nthe help of information readily available over the Internet, \nmethamphetamine production can be accomplished within a very few hours. \nProduction no longer takes a highly skilled individual or chemist. \nRecipes for producing meth can be downloaded off the Internet, complete \nwith step-by-step instructions anyone can follow. These recipes use \nproducts available at any number of local retail outlets as \ningredients, first reducing them to the needed chemical components and \nthen recombining them to produce meth.\n  Small cooks, often producing only enough meth for themselves and a \nfew friends, dominate the concerns of rural law enforcement \norganizations. Several of the narcotics task forces in Iowa report that \nwhile they believe over 80 percent of the meth within their \njurisdiction comes from outside the State, they spend 80 percent of \ntheir time and resources on these small cooks. If we are going to get \nahead of this problem, we must change this ratio.\n  Several years ago we took some important steps in limiting access to \nmany of the precursors needed for meth production. These were good \nsteps, and have proven somewhat effective. But more needs to be done.\n  Officers from the Southeast Iowa Task Force will tell you stories of \nsuspects they have followed all over the county, stopping at each \nconvenience store, supermarket, and drug store they passed to pick up \nas much cold medicine as they could. Not because they were sick, but \nbecause they needed the ephedrine in these drugs to cook meth. \nSometimes it is purchased, but just as often it is stolen. These \nsuspects were followed back to apartments, farm houses, motel rooms, or \neven deserted areas of gravel roads where the cold medicines were \ncombined with other chemicals like starter flud, anhydrous ammonia, and \ndrain cleaner solvents for a ``cook'' of methamphetamine. This is all \ntoo common anyplace we find meth being cooked by amateurs using recipes \noff the Internet.\n  There are several different recipes for cooking meth. In rural areas, \nmany of the small cooks use a receipt calling for anhydrous ammonia, \nwhich is a fertilizer readily available wherever farming occurs. Other \nrecipes call for the use of red phosphorous, the common ingredient in \nemergency road flares. But all of these recipes need some form of \nephedrine or pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in cold medicine.\n\n  If we make it more difficult for meth cooks to acquire ephedrine, \nthen it will be more difficult for them to manufacture this poison. \nSeveral proposals have been put forth by the DEA and others which would \nhelp control access to ephedrine products. Many of these have merit, \nand I hope we will continue to pursue these proposals.\n  One method that could be very effective would be to put products \ncontaining ephedrine or pseudoephedrine behind the counter, such as is \ncurrently do with cigarettes. Other proposals would increase the \npenalties for possession of excessive amounts of precursor chemicals \nfor meth. Some quarters have suggested collecting names or even social \nsecurity numbers for everyone who purchases products containing \nephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Clearly, each of these proposed solutions \nbrings its own set of challenges.\n  But new steps need to be taken. Spending 80 percent of the time on 20 \npercent of the problem is not a way to get ahead. Increasing the \ndifficulty of getting the products needed to do a small ``cook'' of \nmeth decreases the likelihood these ``cooks'' will take place at all. \nWhile none of these proposals will stop all of the ma and pa meth \noperations, the status quo is not acceptable. Our cops are being \noverwhelmed, and our kids are dying--we cannot remain silent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4555-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPPORT FOR NATO EXPANSION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on March 26, NATO signed the Protocols \non the Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, \nSlovenia, and Romania. This is an important step toward the full \nmembership in NATO for these countries. Soon, the Senate will debate \nwhether to approve admission for these seven new and vibrant \ndemocracies. These countries have thrown off the shackles of communism. \nThey are pressing forward, and I am confident their admission to NATO \nwill only make that great alliance stronger and more robust.\n  The enlargement process presents a historic opportunity for NATO to \nstrengthen security and peace, as well as a significant step toward \nfulfilling the vision of a Europe whole and free. The new members have \nproved willing and capable of adding value to NATO's missions, and they \nstrongly reinforce the importance of a trans-Atlantic link.\n  The aspirant members have long contributed to NATO and allied \nmissions, and they will bolster similar NATO and allied operations in \nthe future. They have provided logistical support and troops in combat \nor peace support missions in Western Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. \nRomania, for example, currently has over 1,300 troops engaged in allied \nmissions, including a combat battalion that carries out operations \nshoulder to shoulder with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and a NBC unit in \nIraq. Additionally, the Romanian Government will shelter up to 1,500 \nwar refugees from Iraq if needed. Romania and Bulgaria are currently \nproviding host nation support at the Black Sea airbase and seaport \nbases. Moreover, Slovakia and the Baltic countries have provided \npeacekeeping troops, air surveillance support, as well as NBC \nspecialists.\n  I look forward to the debate in the U.S. Senate on ratification of \nthe protocols for NATO expansion. NATO expansion will prove beneficial \nto those countries seeking entrance to NATO and the those countries \nalready in the alliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4555-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4555-S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GENERAL WALLACE M. GREENE, JR.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing on \nMarch 8, 2003, of GEN Wallace M. Greene, Jr., of Waterbury, VT. General \nGreene served with distinction as Commandant of the Marine Corps from \n1964 until he retired in 1967.\n  General Greene was born on December 27, 1907, in Waterbury, a small \ncity in central Vermont. He began his academic career at the University \nof Vermont, and after one year he entered the armed forces at the U.S. \nNaval Academy, Annapolis, MD, graduating in 1930, commissioned as a \nSecond Lieutenant.\n  After Annapolis, General Greene first assignment was the Philadelphia \nNavy Yard and from there, his career took him to Portsmouth, NH; San \nDiego, CA; on board the battleship USS Tennessee; Quantico, VA; and \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba. During World War II, General Greene took part in \nplanning the invasion of the Marshall Islands in 1943\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nand, in 1944, in the Saipan and Tinian operations.\n  After the war, General Greene returned to the Marine Corps \nHeadquarters and in 1953, he graduated from the National War College, \nafter which he served as Special Assistant to the Joints Chiefs of \nStaff for National Security Affairs. Beginning in 1955, he commanded \nthe bases at Parris Island, SC, and Camp Lejeune, NC. After holding the \npost of Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans, General Greene earned his \nthird star in 1960 and became Chief of Staff. In 1964, after his \npromotion General, he became Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  During General Greene's career, he earned myriad citations, \ncommendations, and awards including the Distinguished Service Medal, \nwith one gold star, and prestigious medals from the governments of \nChina, Korea, Brazil, and Vietnam.\n  I have come to the Senate floor on many occasions to extol \nVermonters' contributions to the United States and to our military \nforces. General Wallace Greene served his country and his people with \nhonor, pride, and dignity. General Greene will be laid to rest at \nArlington National Cemetery on Thursday, April 3, 2003, among the many \nother Americans who have dedicated their lives to public service in the \nArmed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4556-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 47th anniversary of \nTunisian independence. On March 20, 1956, Tunisia took its place among \nthe free nations of the modern era.\n  Shortly after Tunisia's independence, in 1957, the United States \nstood by Tunisia in a challenging post-independence environment. \nThrough the pledge of economic and technical assistance, the United \nStates helped Tunisia to achieve its national goal of a self-confident \nand self-sustaining modern nation.\n  Through the vicissitudes of history Tunisia has sustained the \nhardiness of its Berber forebears as Roman, Vandal, Moor and Ottoman \nEmpires have come and gone. Each has left its cultural mark, but today \nTunisia stands independent, and proud of its history. Today, Tunisia \nhas shown its commitment to democratic ideals as a leader in the Arab \nworld in promoting the legal and social status of women.\n  In this its 47th anniversary of independence, Tunisia and the United \nStates can look back on a much longer and more important relationship. \nIn 1797 Tunisia was among the first countries to recognize the nascent \nUnited States of America. This recognition enabled America to make its \nway in the international community. In the 21st century, Tunisia has \nalso shown support for the United States in the war against terrorism, \nand our two nations should seek ways to enhance cooperation.\n  Congratulations on your 47 years of independence, and may you find \nthat each subsequent year brings further peace and prosperity to \nTunisia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4556-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    HONORING THE LIFE OF PHIL KAUBLE\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nfellow Hoosier, Phil Kauble, who passed away on March 24, 2003.\n  Phil Kauble worked and lived in Kokomo, IN. He was the kind of man \nwho helped to define that hard-working community. Phil was first a \nsteelworker, and later in life a dedicated crusader for pension reform.\n  Those of us who knew Phil were inspired by his commitment to the \ncause of pension reform. After his career as a steelworker, Phil became \ndedicated to protecting retired steelworkers by fighting to correct a \ndiscrepancy in the pension laws that had hurt him and others when \nContinental Steel closed its Kokomo mill in the 1980s.\n  Phil was tireless in his work to correct this problem. For over 20 \nyears he displayed an unwaivering commitment to help his fellow retired \nsteelworkers and his community by making the pension system fairer. One \nof the many consequences of his determination is legislation I have \nauthored to require improved notification procedures by the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, a Federal agency that oversees the \nmaintenance of benefit pension plans, fondly referred to as ``Phil's \nBill.''\n  Phil never gave up the fight. All who knew him were very proud of his \nmany contributions. Phil always believed in the promise of America and \nthe difference one man can make. He truly made a difference. Later \ntoday, I will be reintroducing ``Phil's Bill.'' I know that he would \ninsist that we push on. That is what we intend to do.\n  Phil Kauble showed us that one person can make a difference. His own \nlife experience led to an extraordinary commitment to correct a serious \ngap in the pension system and to help his fellow citizens. His tenacity \nand idealism will be missed.\n  When we reflect upon the lives of men such as Phil Kauble, we are \nreminded that we live in a country where the true power to shape the \ndestiny of government is vested in the people. We will all miss Phil \ndeeply, but his memory will serve as a beacon and his life as an \nexample of the virtues of civic involvement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4556-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF ADJUTANT GENERAL BOENISCH\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nman from my home state of Wyoming who has dedicated his life to public \nservice. The Wyoming National Guard has been extremely fortunate to \nhave MG Edmond W. Boenisch, Jr., to head its ranks for the last 8 \nyears. As the adjutant general for the State of Wyoming, Ed has been \nresponsible for managing Wyoming's Air National Guard and Army National \nGuard through over 500 deployments around the world and insuring that \nour citizen soldiers are highly motivated and properly prepared to meet \nany challenge. No leader can expect to maintain consistently high \nperformance under stress and challenging conditions if the people he \nleads do not have confidence in him. I believe that the Wyoming Guard's \nsuccess is a reflection of General Boenisch's personal commitment and \ndedication to the personnel under his command.\n  Through 20 years of service, General Boenisch has brought leadership \nto Wyoming's National Guard. Raised in a home of solid faith and the \nson of a drill instructor, Ed learned early to value self-discipline \nand moral conviction. Through his life and over 30 years of marriage, \nEd and his wife Linda have shared their strong faith with their family. \nThe challenges of raising two daughters, Laura and Lisa, and an ever \ndemanding career have not shaken Ed and Linda's compass for God, \nfamily, and country. As Eucharistic Ministers, they both share their \nspirituality and are vital members of their church and community.\n  I would be doing a great disservice if I did not mention Ed's strong \nties to the Wyoming education community. Before becoming adjutant \ngeneral, Ed spent 20 years working in a variety of positions in Laramie \nCounty Community College. With a master's degree in student personnel \nand guidance and a PhD in college student personnel administration, Ed \nhas written several books on stress management. After such a long and \ndistinguished career, I can attest that General Boenisch knows a thing \nor two about managing stress.\n  Although we will miss General Boenisch, I am proud that he will \ncontinue his public service as deputy director for the Wyoming \nCommunity College Commission. As a warrior and a scholar, I know that \nGen. Edmond W. Boenisch, Jr. will continue after this post to be a \nvital asset to our State. I would like to thank Ed on behalf of the \npeople of Wyoming for his years of service and wish him success on the \nnext stage of his career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4556-4", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY, from the Committee on Finance:\n       Special Report entitled ``Report on the Activities of the \n     Committee on Finance of the United States Senate During the \n     107th Congress'' (Rept.

A bill to designate a building that houses the operations of \nthe University Park United States Postal Service in Charlotte, North \nCarolina, as the ``Jim Richardson Post Office Building''; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``James F. \nRichardson Post Office Act of 2003.'' This measure would name the \nUniversity Park Post Office in Charlotte, NC, after a man who has come \nto mean so much to the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and the \nState of North Carolina. His record of public service goes back 60 \nyears.\n  A Charlotte native, Jim Richardson graduated from Second War High \nSchool, the only high school in the area African Americans were allowed \nto attend. In a separate and unequal society he learned early on the \nimportance of character and serving the public good. Our World War II \nveterans are said to be the greatest generation. As part of that \ngeneration Jim Richardson entered the United States Navy and served our \ncountry honorably in the South Pacific theater during World War II. It \nis with character and a deep\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\nand abiding hope for a better future that a man such as Jim Richardson \nfought for his country only to return to a society that did not afford \nall that was allowed them under the Constitution of the United States.\n  After the war, Jim returned to Charlotte and entered Johnson C. Smith \nUniversity. He graduated with a degree in Physical Education and \nminored in General Sciences. His Post Office career began in 1949 as a \npostal clerk in Charlotte. With the railroads still being the dominant \nform of transporting the mail, Jim transferred to the Railway Postal \nService. When he returned to the Charlotte Post Office years later he \nhad risen through the ranks to having held several supervisory \npositions. With 33 years of service in the Federal Government, he \nretirement as the US Postmaster in Mt. Holly, NC.\n  Now, that would be a full career for most individuals. What I have \nnot mentioned is that Jim Richardson was an elected official having \nserved distinguishably in both the North Carolina State House and State \nSenate. It was here that this man whose family taught him the mantra \n``do good for others and goodness will return to you'' continued his \nadvocacy for those who needed it most. These were often the poor, \nminorities and the elderly. Jim's legislative record reflected his \nlife's experiences. When he retired from the State Senate, he was a \nrole model for elected officials of both parties. I include myself as \nbeing one who looks to Jim Richardson not on the issues of the day, but \non the manner in which we conduct ourselves in the daily business of \nserving the people who elected us.\n  Again, you would think this would be enough public service for most \npeople. Not for Jim. He returned from the State Legislature to \nCharlotte and was elected as a Mecklenburg County Commissioner. I came \nto know him during this his third career. When I called on him for \nadvice and counsel, he opened the wealth of his life's experiences to \nme. He also opened his home where I stayed during my campaign for the \nSenate seat. I learned from the man and about him. He and his wife Mary \nare revered for so many of their contributions to the community. Chief \namong them is their work on HIV/AIDS awareness among young people. \nTheir hope is to save lives and spare families the experience of losing \na loved one to this dreaded disease.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the consent of an individual prior to the \nsale and marketing of such individual's personally identifiable \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \n``Privacy Act of 2003.''\n  This legislation would establish, for the first time, a comprehensive \nnational system of privacy protection.\n  It would: require companies to gain consumers' written consent prior \nto selling their most sensitive personal information including personal \nhealth information, financial information, Social Security numbers, and \ndrivers' license data; and require companies to provide consumers' \nnotice and an opportunity to refuse to allow their less sensitive \npersonal information to be sold.\n  Simply put, this legislation would give consumers more control over \nhow their personal information is used.\n  The personal information of today's consumer is too vulnerable to \nabuse. With access to sensitive data so widely available--often just at \nthe touch of a keyboard--it is easy to understand why identity theft \nhas become one of the country's fastest growing crimes.\n  Recent statistics on the growth of identity theft suggest we have no \ntime to waste in protecting personal privacy.\n  Identity theft is the number one consumer complaint reported to the \nFederal Trade Commission. American consumers filed approximately \n163,000 identity theft complaints with the FTC in 2002. Fully 43 \npercent of all the complaints the FTC receives are about identity \ntheft.\n  An estimated 700,000 cases of identity theft occur each year. The \naverage victim spends an average of 175 hours over a two-year period \nclearing off an average of $17,000 fraud off their credit reports.\n  My own State, California, has more victims than any other state. The \nFTC recorded 30,738 identity theft cases last year from California \nconsumers alone.\n  While modern technology has increased the threat to personal security \nand privacy, the protections for individual privacy have not kept pace. \nOur country's privacy laws form an incomplete and inconsistent \npatchwork.\n  For example, Americans enjoy the highest level of privacy protection \nconcerning the names of the movies they rent at a video store. But, at \nthe same time, it is perfectly legal to sell another person's Social \nSecurity number over the Internet.\n  The Privacy Act would establish a Federal privacy standard that \nadjusts the level of privacy protection according to the sensitivity of \nthe information at issue.\n  The legislation provides the highest level of protection for a \nperson's most sensitive data--personal financial data, health data, \ndriver's license information, and Social Security numbers.\n  For this sensitive data, the bill gives the individual ultimate \ncontrol over whether or not his or her information is shared. If an \nindividual does not actively decide to permit sharing of personal data, \nthe data is not disclosed.\n  Specifically, this legislation tightens the privacy provisions of the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act. Under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, a bank can share a \ncustomer's personal information with other companies so long as it \ngives consumers notice and the right to opt-out of the data sharing.\n  The problem with opt-out is that most people toss out their privacy \nnotices from banks along with the rest of the unrelenting pile of \ncommercial solicitations they receive. Since the passage of Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley, banks have sent out over one billion privacy notices.\n  According to available published information, fewer than 5 percent of \nbank customers have opted out of sharing their personal information, \nand for many financial institutions, the response rate has been less \nthan one percent.\n  It is not surprising that consumers do not respond overwhelmingly to \nthese notices, since, by some estimates, the average American household \nreceived a dozen of these notices. A consumer should not have the \nburden of constantly monitoring how his or her most sensitive personal \ninformation is shared with other companies.\n  Accordingly, the Privacy Act prohibits the sale or disclosure of \nsensitive personal financial information to third parties unless the \nconsumer affirmatively consents or opts in.\n  This legislation also toughens Federal financial privacy laws for \naffiliate sharing and joint marketing. An affiliate is a company that \nis linked by common ownership with another company. Under Federal law, \na bank can share with affiliates or joint marketing partners regardless \nof whether the consumer wants this information shared.\n  The Privacy Act of 2003 would require that banks give consumers the \noption of opting out of the sharing of their personal financial \ninformation with the bank's affiliates or joint partners.\n  Some banks argue that affiliates are just branches of an \norganization, and a bank should for efficiency purposes be able to \nshare data within the entire organization. In an era where a bank had \none or two affiliates, that might be true.\n  But, now, some companies are so big that if a customer has no control \nover\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\naffiliate sharing, then the customer is unable to prevent the \ndisclosure of their data to hundreds of companies. For example, in \nrecent testimony before Congress, U.S. PIRG reported that Citibank has \n2,761 affiliates, Key Bank had 871 affiliates, and Bank of America has \n1,576 affiliates.\n  Similarly, a customer must be able to restrict a bank's sharing of \npersonal information with its joint venture partners if the customer \nwants to maintain control over his personal information.\n  I would also like to describe several other key components of the \nfinancial privacy section.\n  The bill prohibits banks from denying a customer a financial product \nor financial service just because the customer chooses to not disclose \nhis personal information to third parties, affiliates, or joint venture \npartners. However, the bill does allow banks to offer incentives to \ncustomers to encourage them to permit the sharing of their personal \ninformation.\n  Additionally, the bill permits banks to disclose, but not sell, \npersonal information to third parties for vital public interest \npurposes such as identifying or locating missing and abducted children, \nwitnesses, criminals and fugitives, parents delinquent in child support \npayments, organ and bone marrow donors, pension fund beneficiaries, and \nmissing heirs.\n  Just as with financial data, personal health data deserves the most \nstringent privacy protections.\n  The recently adopted Department of Health and Human Services privacy \nregulations set a basic opt-in framework for disclosure of health \ninformation. But more can be done to protect patient privacy.\n  The regulations only prohibit ``covered entities''--namely health \ninsurers, health providers, and health care clearinghouses--from \nselling a patient's health information without that patient's prior \nconsent.\n  Meanwhile, non-covered entities such as business associates, health \nresearchers, schools or universities, and life insurers are not subject \nto this opt-in requirement, except through contractual arrangements.\n\n  This legislation would preserve the privacy of health information \nwherever the information is sold. Any business associate, life insurer, \nschool or non-covered entity trying to sell or market protected health \ninformation would, like covered entities, have to get the patient's \nprior consent.\n  Drivers' license data also is given the strongest level of protection \nunder this bill.\n  With its recent amendments, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, \nDPPA, offers some meaningful protections for drivers privacy.\n  For example, under the DPPA, a State Department of Motor Vehicles \nmust obtain the prior consent, Opt-in, of the driver before ``highly \nsensitive information''--defined as the driver's photograph, image, \nSocial Security number, medical or disability information--can be \ndisclosed to a third party.\n  However, loopholes remain. Other sensitive information found on a \ndriver's license deserves equal protection.\n  The Privacy Act would expand the definition of ``highly sensitive \ninformation'' to include a physical copy of a driver's license, the \ndriver identification number, birth date, information on the driver's \nphysical characteristics and any biometric identifiers, such as a \nfingerprint, that are found on the driver's license.\n  Thus, this bill would ensure consumers have control over how their \nmotor vehicle records and driver's license data are used.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight the Social Security number \nsection of the privacy bill, which reflects over four years of \nnegotiation with Senator Hatch, Senator Gregg, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Baucus, and other Senate colleagues. I have also introduced \nthis section as a stand-alone bill, Senate bill 228.\n  It is crucial to protect Social Security numbers because the numbers \nare the key to a person's identity. Many identity theft cases start \nwith the theft of a Social Security number. Once a thief has access to \na victim's Social Security number, it is only a short step to acquiring \ncredit cards, driver's licenses, or other crucial identification \ndocuments.\n  Not surprisingly, members of the public have flooded our Federal \nagencies with pleas for assistance. Reports to the Social Security \nAdministration of Social Security number misuse have increased from \n7,868 in 1997 to 73,000 in 2002--an astonishing increase of over 800%.\n  The Feinstein/Gregg compromise bars the sale or display of Social \nSecurity numbers to the public except in a very narrow set of \ncircumstances.\n  Display or sale is permitted if the Social Security number holder \nconsents or if there are compelling public safety needs.\n  Government entities will have to redact Social Security numbers from \nelectronic records that are readily available to the public on the \nInternet.\n  Moreover, State governments will no longer be permitted to use the \nSocial Security number as the default driver's license number.\n  The legislation, however, recognizes that some industries rely on \nSocial Security numbers to exchange information between databases and \ncomplete identification verification necessary for certain \ntransactions.\n  Thus, the bill directs the Attorney General to develop regulations \nallowing for the sale or purchase of Social Security Numbers to \nfacilitate business-to-business and business-to-government transactions \nso long as businesses put appropriate safeguards in place and do not \npermit public access to the number.\n  Recognizing that not all personal information merits the same \nrestrictions, the bill permits businesses to collect and sell \nnonsensitive personal information, e.g., name, phone number, address, \nto third parties so long as they give customers notice and the \nopportunity to opt-out of the sale.\n  The opt-out standard for non-sensitive information means that if a \nperson fills out a warranty card, signs up for a computer service, or \nsubmits an entry for a sweepstakes, the business must notify him before \nit sells his personal information to other businesses or marketers.\n  This framework guarantees basic privacy protections for consumers \nwithout unduly impacting commerce.\n  To further minimize the regulatory burden of these privacy rules, the \nbill sets up a safe harbor so that industries and industry-sponsored \nseal programs which have already adopted Notice-and-Opt Out information \npolicies, will be exempt from the regulatory requirements of the \nlegislation.\n  To ensure uniformity of the laws across all 50 states, the bill \npreempts inconsistent state laws regarding the treatment of non-\nsensitive information.\n  A jumbled patchwork of State privacy laws helps neither businesses \nnor consumers. Consumers will have confused expectations about what \ninformation is protected.\n  Another distinguishing characteristic of the Privacy Act of 2003 is \nthat it protects the privacy of information regardless of the medium \nthrough which it is collected.\n  Other privacy proposals have tried to confine privacy legislation to \nthe Internet.\n  These proposals unfairly discriminate against high technology users. \nPut simply, companies and other entities can misuse personal \ninformation from off-line sources just as easily as with on-line \nsources.\n  For example, telemarketers who besiege consumers with phone calls \nduring the dinner hour do not typically get customer information from \nthe Internet. Much of the identifying information used to make these \ncalls comes from consumers filling out and mailing back warranty and \nregistration cards.\n  Regardless of how information is collected, it should get equal \nprotection.\n  This legislation codifies steps Congress can take to protect citizens \nfrom identity thieves and other predators of personal information.\n  It restores to an individual more control over his or her most \nsensitive personal information such as Social Security numbers, health \ninformation, and financial information. It also sets reasonable \nguidelines for businesses that handle our personal information every \nday.\n  A byproduct of our information economy--personal information is much \nmore vulnerable to exploitation than ever before.\n  Every American has a fundamental right to privacy, no matter how fast \nour technology grows or changes. A\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\nperson should be able to have control over how their most sensitive \npersonal information is used.\n  But our right to privacy only will remain vital, if we take strong \naction to protect it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Privacy Act \nof 2003.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social \n     security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     social security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n     security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     social security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of social security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this title provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a social security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 202.

A bill to prevent and respond to terrorism and crime at or \nthrough ports; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Anti-\nTerrorism and Port Security Act of 2003, comprehensive legislation \naimed at preventing and punishing a terrorist attack at or through one \nof our nation's 361 seaports. I would like to thank Senator Kyl for \njoining me in sponsoring this bill.\n  Currently, our seaports are the gaping hole in our nation's defense \nagainst terrorism. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics, about 13 million containers, twenty-foot equivalent units, \ncame into United States ports in 2002.\n  However, the U.S. government inspected only about two or three \npercent of these containers--they rest were simply waved through. In \naddition, in almost every case, these inspections occurred after the \ncontainers arrive in the United States.\n  The problem is that a single container could contain 60,000 pounds of \nexplosives--10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used to blow \nup the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City--and a single container \nship can carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time.\n  Containers could easily be exploited to detonate a bomb that would \ndestroy a bridge, seaport, or other critical infrastructure, causing \nmass destruction and killing thousands.\n  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' \ncould also be installed in a container and shipped to the United \nStates. The odds are that the container would never be inspected.\n  And, even if the container was inspected, it would be too late. The \nweapon would already be in the United States--most likely near a major \npopulation center.\n  In addition, any attack on or through a seaport could have \ndevastating economic consequences.\n  Excluding trade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports handle 95 \npercent of U.S. trade. Every year U.S. ports handle over 800 million \ntons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion.\n  The West Coast labor disruption last year cost the U.S. economy \nsomewhere $1-2 billion a day--a total of $10-20 billion. A terrorist \nattack would have an ever graver impact.\n  The U.S. would likely shut down all major U.S. ports, bringing \nthousands of factories to a standstill and leaving retailers with bare \nshelves within days. And this shut down will have a ripple effect \naround the globe, raising the cost exponentially.\n  In its December 2002 report, the Hart-Rudman Terrorism Task Force \ndiscussed the implications of a possible terrorist attack at a seaport. \nHere is what they said:\n\n       If an explosive device were loaded in a container and set \n     off in a port, it would almost automatically raise concern \n     about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in \n     U.S. ports each day and the many thousands more that arrive \n     by truck and rail across U.S. land borders. A three-to-four-\n     week closure of U.S. ports would bring the global container \n     industry to its knees. Megaports such as Rotterdam and \n     Singapore would have to close their gates to prevent boxes \n     from piling up on their limited pier space. Trucks, trains, \n     and barges would be stranded outside the terminals with no \n     way to unload their boxes. Boxes bound for the United States \n     would have to be unloaded from their outbound ships. Service \n     contracts would need to be renegotiated. As the system became \n     gridlocked, so would much of global commerce.\n\n  I am particularly concerned about such an attack because such an \nenormous proportion of U.S. foreign trade passes through my home state \nof California.\n  Last year, 6.2 million imported containers--48 percent--passed \nthrough California, 5.7 million just through two ports alone: the Port \nof Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.\n  That means that, if terrorists succeeded in putting a weapon of mass \ndestruction into a container undetected, there is about a one in two \nchance that this weapon would arrive and/or be detonated in Southern \nCalifornia.\n  And the problem is not just with containers.\n  Nearly one-quarter of all of California's imported crude oil is \noffloaded in one area. A suicide attack on a tanker at an offloading \nfacility in this area could leave Southern California without refined \nfuels within a few days.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that terrorists are seeking to exploit \nvulnerabilities at our seaports right now.\n  Indeed, the Al Qaeda training manual specifically mentions seaports \nas a point of vulnerability in our security.\n  In addition, we know that Al Qaeda has already tried to attack \nAmerican interests at and through seaports in the past. Let me mention \nsome examples.\n  In October 2001, Italian authorities found an Egyptian man suspected \nof\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nhaving ties to Al Qaeda in a container bound for Canada. He had false \nidentifications, maps of airports, a computer, a satellite phone, \ncameras, and plenty of cash on hand.\n  In October 2000, Al Qaeda operatives successfully carried out a \ndeadly bombing attack against the U.S.S. Cole in the port of Yemen.\n\n  In 1998, Al Qaeda bombed the American Embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania. Evidence suggests that the explosives the terrorists used \nwere shipped to them by sea. And the investigation of the embassy \nbombings concluded that Bin Laden has close financial ties to various \nshipping companies.\n  We cannot afford to be complacent. Terrorists can be very patient. We \ncannot forget the successful attack on the World Trade Center on \nSeptember 11 took place eight years after a relatively unsuccessful \nattack on the same target.\n  I introduced legislation in the last Congress to offer a \ncomprehensive solution to the problem of seaport vulnerability. I am \npleased that some of its provisions we adopted in some form by recent \nregulatory changes as well as the Maritime transportation Security Act \nof 2002 and Trade Act of 2002.\n  For example, one provision in my bill required shippers to provide \nmanifest information to Customs at least 24 hours before departure from \na foreign port. Soon after the bill was introduced, Customs published a \ndraft regulation with the same requirement.\n  This requirement is now being enforced. However, Customs is still not \ngetting all relevant information from every important party involved in \nthe shipping process.\n  In addition, I am pleased that, especially in the last six months, \nCustoms has aggressively promoted its Container Security Initiative \n(CSI). One of the core elements of this initiative involves placing \nU.S. Customs inspectors at major foreign seaports to pre-screen cargo \ncontainers before they were shipped to America.\n  Most of the biggest ports in the world are now participating in CSI. \nHowever, Customs has posted relatively few inspectors overseas and I \nbelieve that CSI can and should be expanded further.\n  The Maritime Transportation Safety Act of 2002 and Trade Act of 2002 \nalso included a number of security measures.\n  However, in my view, many of these measures do not go nearly far \nenough, particularly in the areas of criminal penalties, pushing back \nthe border, minimum port and security standards, employee \nidentification cards, research and development, and so on. And even the \nstrongest provisions in these bills are, in some cases, years away from \nimplementation.\n  The bottom line is that, while we have made some modest improvements \nin seaport security in the last year, much more remains to be done. \nAnd, crucially, much remains to be done right now.\n  In fact, I believe that our seaports remain almost as vulnerable \ntoday as they were before September 11. That is why I am introducing \nthe Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003.\n  This legislation builds on improvements made to our laws in the last \nyear but goes much further than those changes to ensure the security of \nour seaports.\n  The Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003 does three main \nthings:\n  First, the bill ensure that our criminal laws apply to deter and \npunish terrorists who choose to strike against our seaports. The bill \ncloses a number of loopholes in our criminal laws to ensure that \nterrorists are held accountable for any attacks. Let me provide a \ncouple of examples.\n  If a person blows up an airplane, he commits a crime. However, if he \nblows up a oil tanker, he does not commit a crime--unless he is doing \nit to injure the person.\n  If a person distributes explosives to a non-U.S. national, he commits \na crime. But if the same person sows mines in the San Francisco harbor, \nhe does not commit a crime.\n  Specifically, the bill would: Make it a crime for terrorists to \nattack a port or a cruise ship or deploy a weapon of mass destruction \nat or through a seaport. Make it a crime to put devices in U.S. waters \nthat can destroy a ship or cargo or interfere with safe navigation or \nmaritime commerce. Update our federal criminal piracy and privateering \nlaws and increase penalties. Make it a crime to use a dangerous weapon \nor explosive to try to kill someone on board a passenger vessel. Make \nit a crime to fail to heave to (that is, to slow or stop) a vessel at \nthe direction of a Coast Guard or other authorized federal law \nenforcement official seeking to board that vessel or to interfere with \nboarding by such an officer. Make it a crime to destroy an aid to \nmaritime navigation, such as a buoy or shoal/breakwater light, \nmaintained by the Coast Guard if this would endanger the safe \nnavigation of a vessel. Make it a crime for terrorists or criminals to \ntry to attack U.S. citizens or U.S. marine live by putting poisons in \nthe water off shore. Require the Attorney General to issue regulations \nmaking it easier to determine the extent of crime and terrorism at \nseaports and improve communication between different law enforcement \nagencies involved at ports.\n\n  Second, the bill would help improve physical security at seaports by \nbeefing up standards and ensuring greater coordination. Specific \nprovisions would: Designate the Captain-of-the-Port as the primary \nauthority for seaport security at each port. This would enable all \nparties involved in business at a port to understand who has final say \non all security matters. Require minimum federal security standards for \nports. These standards include restrictions on private vehicle access, \na prohibition on unauthorized guns and explosives, and unauthorized \nphysical access to terminal areas. They would also mandate that \nterminal areas at ports have a secure perimeter, monitored or locked \naccess points, sufficient lighting, and son on. Mandate that all \nCustoms inspectors have personal radiation detection pagers. Require \nall port employees and contractors to have biometric smart \nidentification cards. Require Captains-of-the-Port to keep sensitive \ninformation on the port secure and protected. Such information would \ninclude, but not be limited to maps, blueprints, and information on the \nInternet.\n  Third, the bill would ensure that we devote our limited cargo \ninspection resources in the most efficient and effective manner. The \nbill would improve our shipment profiling system by requiring \nadditional information from more relevant parties to the shipping \nprocess, and it would substantially improve container security. \nSpecifically, it would establish a comprehensive risk profiling plan \nfor the Customs Service to focus their limited inspection capabilities \non high-risk cargo and containers. Under this plan, all relevant \nparties in the shipment process would provide electronically relevant \nand timely information to enable Customs to determine which shipments \nto inspect. Impose steep monetary sanctions for failure to comply with \ninformation filing requirements, including filing incorrect information \n(the current penalty is only up to a few thousand dollars). The Seaport \nCommission found that about \\1/2\\ of the information on ship manifests \nwas inaccurate. Push U.S. security scrutiny beyond our nation's borders \nand improve our ability to monitor and inspect cargo and containers \nbefore they arrive near America's shores. If a weapon of mass \ndestruction arrives in a U.S. port, it is too late. Require the use of \nhigh security seals on all containers coming into the U.S. Require that \neach container to be transported through U.S. ports receive a universal \ntransaction number that could be used to track container movement from \norigin to destination. Require all empty containers destined for U.S. \nports to be secured. Authorize pilot programs to develop high-tech \nseals and sensors, including those that would provide real-time \nevidence of container tampering to a monitor at a terminal. Require \nports to provide space to Customs so that the agency is able to use \nnon-intrusive inspection technology. In many cases, Customs has to keep \nthis technology outside the port and bring it in every day, which \nprevents some of the best inspection technology (which is not portable) \nfrom being used. Require the Department of Homeland Security to take \nthe relative number of imported containers received at each port into \naccount in exercising its discretion in determining the allocation of \nfunds appropriated for seaport security grants.\n  I believe that the Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003 would \nmake a\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nsignificant contribution to protecting America from terrorist attacks \nat or through our seaports. I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.;\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I was alarmed over the past weekend to \nnote the suicide bombing which was perpetrated on Saturday where four \nUnited States soldiers in the 3rd Infantry Division were murdered by a \nsuicide car bomb, with a bomber driving a taxi filled with explosives \nto a highway checkpoint in central Iraq. This is the first such attack \non American troops in this war, a war in which Iraqi forces have been \naccused of dressing as civilians and employing so-called human shields.\n  In an interview which appeared on ABC Television on Sunday, March \n30th, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz stated that this was to be the \npolicy of Iraq. This statement was in response to a question by ABC \nNews correspondent Richard Engel, a question related to the comment by \nthe Vice President of Iraq the preceding day, Saturday, March 29th, and \nthen again by a Defense Ministry spokesman on March 30th, that Iraq is \n``welcoming the use of [such] suicide attacks.''\n  I am today introducing a resolution which condemns this practice as a \nwar crime, to put the government of Iraq on notice that the United \nStates, Great Britain, and coalition forces will be prosecuting these \natrocities as war crimes. Human Rights Watch commented on this matter, \ncondemned the act in a press release issued just today, saying: \n``Feigning civilian or noncombatant status to deceive the enemy is a \nviolation of the laws of war. . . .''\n  On March 29, that is last Saturday, at a U.S. military roadblock near \nNajaf, an Iraqi noncommissioned officer, reportedly posing as a taxi \ndriver, detonated a car bomb that killed him and four U.S. soldiers. \nIraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in a Baghdad news \nconference that such attacks would become ``routine military policy.'' \nThe executive director of the Human Rights Watch, Mr. Kenneth Roth, \nsaid: ``When combatants disguise themselves as civilians or \nsurrendering soldiers, that is a serious violation of the laws of war. \nAny such blurring of the line between combatant and noncombatant puts \nall Iraqis at greater risk.''\n  International law prohibits attacking, killing, injuring, capturing, \nor deceiving the enemy by resorting to what is called perfidy. A \n``perfidious attack'' is one launched by combatants who have led \nopposing forces to believe that the attackers are really noncombatants. \nActs of perfidy include pretending to be a civilian who cannot be \nattacked, or feigning surrender. Surrendering soldiers cannot be \nattacked, so it is perfidious to use that protected status to attack as \nthe opposing forces let down their guard as they try to take the \n``surrendering'' soldiers into custody.\n  Now, this technique, this tactic, has been sanctioned, as noted, at \nthe highest level of the Iraqi government by the Vice President of Iraq \nand by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Minister Aziz has been the \nleading Iraqi spokesman for more than a decade, going back, actually, \nbefore the gulf war in 1991. When Minister Aziz speaks, there is no \ndoubt that he is speaking at the highest level of the Iraqi government.\n  The Iraqi government awarded the suicide bomber two posthumous medals \nand the Vice President said the suicide attacks will become routine \nmilitary policy in Iraq and in the United States unless the Bush \nadministration abandons the (then) 10-day-old war and pulls back its \ntroops.\n  The interview by ABC TV news correspondent Richard Engel went on to \nquestion Deputy Prime Minister Aziz about the nature of such attacks in \nthe future, and Minister Aziz commented: ``There will be others. \nIraqis, Arabs, maybe Muslims, yes. We welcome them.''\n  Minister Aziz took pride in pointing out: ``[T]he first one who did \nit was an Iraqi. He was not a foreigner.''\n  It is my view that this is one of a series of acts by the Iraqi \nGovernment in violation of the laws of war itemized in the Hague and \nGeneva Conventions, and that more and varied types of atrocities may be \nexpected by the desperate Iraqi Government.\n  That is why I have prepared today this resolution which calls upon:\n\n       . . . the governments of the United States, the United \n     Kingdom, and other nations comprising the coalition \n     conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom [to] prosecute by trial by \n     tribunal each person in the Government of Iraq, each person \n     in the armed forces of Iraq, and any other person, regardless \n     of nationality, who orders, directs, solicits, procures, \n     coordinates, participates in, or supports acts in violation \n     of the international law of armed conflict (including the \n     aspects of such law known as the Hague and Geneva \n     Conventions) . . . .\n\n  The resolution specifies a series of circumstances where there is:\n\n       . . . abuse of places protected from military attack under \n     international law, such as the use of mosques and hospitals \n     as military headquarters or for other military purposes;\n       . . . the ruse by which Iraqi combatants wear civilian \n     clothing instead of, or over, uniforms to conceal their \n     status as combatants and, while so clothed, attack coalition \n     forces;\n       . . . the ruse by which Iraqi combatants feign surrender to \n     coalition forces to gain advantage used by the Iraqi \n     combatants to attack personnel of the coalition forces;\n       . . . the use of civilians or other persons protected under \n     international law as human shields for Iraqi combatants on \n     the battlefield;\n       . . . assault, murder, kidnapping, or torture of civilians \n     or other persons protected under international law in order \n     to terrorize those persons or others or to prevent them from \n     gaining the protection of coalition forces;\n       . . . abuse, torture, assault, or murder of personnel of \n     coalition forces entitled to treatment as prisoners of war or \n     of civilians entitled to a protected status under \n     international law; and\n       . . . recruitment or encouragement of non-Iraqi foreign \n     nationals to engage in violations of the international law of \n     armed conflict.\n\n  We are saying what has occurred in Iraq today are the actions of a \ndesperate nation.\n  I believe it is very important that the upper echelon of the Iraqi \nGovernment, people such as the Vice President, people such as Deputy \nPrime Minister Aziz, be put on notice that these acts in violation of \nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions will be dealt with very forcefully by \na tribunal which is yet to be established.\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\n  I do not specify at this time the kind of tribunal. That will require \nsome further analysis. It could be a military tribunal to try those \noffenses where the victims are soldiers of the U.S. Army, or of the \nBritish Army, or soldiers of the coalition forces.\n  It might be an international tribunal such as that which was \nestablished for the former Yugoslavia, or Rwanda.\n  It is worth noting, and the Iraqi officials ought to be watching, \nwhat has happened at The Hague and what happened in Rwanda. The former \nhead of state of Rwanda is now serving a life sentence--notwithstanding \nthat he was the head of state of Rwanda--for crimes against humanity. \nIn a well-publicized case, former Yugoslavian President Milosevic is \nnow on trial in The Hague for violations of international law and \ncrimes against humanity. Many have been sentenced for criminal conduct, \nfor violations of international law in Bosnia and in Kosovo. So at this \nearly stage I believe it is important that the word go out to the Iraqi \nhigh command and to those who follow orders of the Iraqi high command \nthat they will be prosecuted as war criminals.\n\n  It is not a defense that someone says that he or she is operating \nunder an order from a superior officer. In a very celebrated case in \nWorld War I, a German U-boat sank an Allied ship. As it went down, \nthose in lifeboats were machinegunned by the submarine, which had \nsurfaced. The perpetrator of the machinegunning entered a defense that \nthe machinegunner was operating under superior's orders. That was \nsoundly rejected. So the principle has been established as a matter of \ninternational law that it is no defense to say a person operates under \nsuperior's orders.\n  Of course, it is not a defense at all for ranking officials such as \nthe Iraqi Vice President and the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, who know \nbetter, who are engaging in these violations of international law. \nThose who carry out the orders of these Iraqis ought to be on notice, \ntoo, that these matters will not be over when we win the war, when the \nwar stops, because these individuals will be pursued in trials just as \nthe head of state of Rwanda was pursued and is serving a life sentence; \njust as former President Milosevic is being pursued and prosecuted; as \nso many others are being pursued.\n  This word ought to go out in a very forceful way to the Iraqis that \nthis conduct in violation of international law will not be tolerated.\n  In 1998 I introduced S. Con. Res. 78 calling for a war crimes \ntribunal to try Saddam Hussein as a war criminal. On March 13, 1998, \nthat was passed unanimously, 93 to nothing, by the Senate. So there is \na demonstrated interest on the part of this body in acting very \nforcefully to give notice to, not only Saddam Hussein, but other Iraqi \nofficials and those who carry out their orders that they will be \nprosecuted as war criminals if they continue to violate international \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/31/senate-section/article/S4579-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

RESERVE FUND FOR STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or \n     joint resolution, or if an amendment thereto is offered or a \n     conference report thereon is submitted, that extends the \n     availability of fiscal year 1998 and 1999 expired State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program allotments and the \n     expiring fiscal year 2000 allotments, the chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget may revise committee allocations for \n     that committee and other appropriate budgetary aggregates and \n     allocations of new budget authority (and the outlays \n     resulting therefrom) in this resolution by the amount \n     provided by that measure for that purpose, but not to exceed \n     $1,260,000,000 in new budget authority and $85,000,000 in \n     outlays for fiscal year 2003, $1,330,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $85,000,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year \n     2004, $1,950,000,000 in new budget authority and $845,000,000 \n     in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2003 through 2008, \n     and $1,825,000,000 in new budget authority and $975,000,000 \n     in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2003 through 2013.\n\n                  Subtitle C--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n     SEC. 221. ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CONCEPTS AND \n                   DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In the Senate, upon the enactment of a bill or joint \n     resolution providing for a change in concepts or definitions, \n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget shall make \n     adjustments to the levels and allocations in this resolution \n     in accordance with section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as in effect prior to \n     September 30, 2002).\n\n     SEC. 222. APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS \n                   AND AGGREGATES.\n\n       (a) Application.--Any adjustments of allocations and \n     aggregates made pursuant to this resolution shall--\n       (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;\n       (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and\n       (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as \n     practicable.\n       (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised \n     allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in \n     this resolution.\n       (c) Budget Committee Determinations.--For purposes of this \n     resolution--\n       (1) the levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct \n     spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and \n     surpluses for a fiscal year or period of fiscal years shall \n     be determined on the basis of estimates made by the \n     Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate; and\n       (2) such chairman, as applicable, may make any other \n     necessary adjustments to such levels to carry out this \n     resolution.\n\n     SEC. 223. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     or of that House to which they specifically apply, and such \n     rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n\n                     TITLE III--SENSE OF THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FEDERAL EMPLOYEE PAY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Members of the uniformed services and civilian \n     employees of the United States make significant contributions \n     to the general welfare of the Nation.\n       (2) Increases in the pay of members of the uniformed \n     services and of civilian employees of the United States have \n     not kept pace with increases in the overall pay levels of \n     workers in the private sector, so that there now exists--\n       (A) a 32 percent gap between compensation levels of Federal \n     civilian employees and compensation levels of private sector \n     workers; and\n       (B) an estimated 10 percent gap between compensation levels \n     of members of the uniformed services and compensation levels \n     of private sector workers.\n       (3) The President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2004 \n     includes an average 4.1 percent pay raise for military \n     personnel.\n       (4) The Office of Management and Budget has requested that \n     Federal agencies plan their fiscal year 2004 budgets with a 2 \n     percent pay raise for civilian Federal employees.\n       (5) In almost every year during the past two decades, there \n     have been equal adjustments in the compensation of members of \n     the uniformed services and the compensation of civilian \n     employees of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that rates of compensation for civilian employees of the \n     United States should be adjusted at the same time, and in the \n     same proportion, as are rates of compensation for members of \n     the uniformed services.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TRIBAL COLLEGES AND \n                   UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) More than 30,000 full- and part-time Native American \n     students from 250 federally recognized tribes nationwide \n     attend tribal colleges and Universities, a majority of whom \n     are first-generation college students.\n       (2) The colleges and universities are located in rural and \n     isolated areas and are often the only accredited institutions \n     of higher education in their service area. While the Tribal \n     College Act provides funding solely for Indian students, the \n     colleges serve students of all ages, about 20 percent of whom \n     are non-Indian. With rare exception, tribal colleges and \n     universities do not receive operating funds from the States \n     for these non-Indian State resident students. Yet, if these \n     same students attended any other public institution in their \n     States, the State would provide basic operating funds to that \n     institution.\n       (3) While Congress has been increasing the annual \n     appropriations for tribal colleges in recent years, the \n     President's fiscal year 2004 budget recommends a $4,000,000 \n     decrease in institutional operating funds. The combination of \n     annual increases in enrollments, reduced Federal\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\n     funding, and the addition of two new tribal colleges would \n     result in a devastating decrease in funding of $540 per \n     student below the fiscal year 2003 estimate.\n       (4) Despite a $2,000,000 increase in fiscal year 2003 for \n     basic institutional operating budgets of the reservation-\n     based tribal colleges, the per Indian student count (ISC) is \n     only $30 more than in fiscal year 2002, or $3,946, still less \n     than \\2/3\\ of the $6,000 authorized.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced \n     by tribal colleges and assumes that priority consideration \n     will be provided to them through funding through the Tribally \n     Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the Equity \n     in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the Higher \n     Education Act, and the National Science Foundation Tribal \n     College Program; and\n       (2) such priority consideration reflects Congress' intent \n     to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding goals \n     for the tribal colleges and universities.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE 504 SMALL \n                   BUSINESS CREDIT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Small businesses play a critical role in our Nation and \n     our economy and the Federal Government assists that role by \n     providing small businesses with loans and loan guarantees.\n       (2) Since the enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of \n     1990, the Small Business Administration and the Office of \n     Management and Budget have repeatedly overestimated the \n     subsidy cost of the Small Business Administration's 7(a) and \n     504 credit programs. Those overestimates have resulted in \n     borrowers and lenders having to pay higher than necessary \n     fees to participate in those programs.\n       (3) Last year, in response to bipartisan pressure from the \n     Senate Budget and Small Business Committees, the \n     administration developed a new econometric model to improve \n     the accuracy of its estimates of the cost of the 7(a) \n     program. Consistent with claims by the Senate Budget and \n     Small Business Committees, that effort resulted in the \n     administration lowering the estimated subsidy cost of the \n     7(a) program by an astounding 40 percent in 2003, allowing \n     the Federal Government to guarantee an additional \n     $3,300,000,000 in small business loans this year alone.\n       (4) Notwithstanding past assurances, the administration, \n     however, has failed to begin work on an econometric model for \n     the 504 small business credit program, despite similar, \n     chronic problems with estimates of that program's costs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the performance of the SBA and OMB in administering the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act for the 504 small business credit \n     program remains unsatisfactory;\n       (2) the administration should develop an econometric model \n     for the 504 program for use in the fiscal year 2004 \n     appropriations cycle; and\n       (3) the Office of Management and Budget should report to \n     the Budget and Small Business Committees on the progress of \n     this work by no later than June 2003.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PELL GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Public investment in higher education yields a return \n     of several dollars for each dollar invested.\n       (2) Higher education promotes economic opportunity.\n       (3) For a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served as \n     an effective means of providing access to higher education.\n       (4) Over the past decade, the Pell Grant has failed to keep \n     pace with inflation, and over the past 25 years, the value of \n     the average Pell Grant has decreased substantially.\n       (5) Grant aid as a portion of student aid has fallen \n     significantly over the past 5 years.\n       (6) The percentage of freshmen attending public and private \n     4-year institutions from families whose income is below the \n     national median has fallen since 1981.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) within the discretionary allocation provided to the \n     Committee on Appropriations, the maximum Pell Grant award \n     should be raised to the maximum extent practicable, and \n     funding for the Pell Grant program should be higher than the \n     level requested by the President; and\n       (2) to the maximum extent practicable, Congress should seek \n     to increase the maximum individual Federal Pell Grant award \n     to $9,000 by fiscal year 2010.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Army National Guard relies heavily upon thousands \n     of full-time employees, Active Guard/Reserves and Military \n     Technicians, to ensure unit readiness throughout the Army \n     National Guard.\n       (2) These employees perform vital day-to-day functions, \n     ranging from equipment maintenance to leadership and staff \n     roles, that allow the National Guard to dedicate drill \n     weekends and annual active duty training of part-time \n     personnel to preparation for the National Guard's war \n     fighting and peacetime missions.\n       (3) The role of full-time National Guard personnel is \n     especially important as tens of thousands of our National \n     Guard and Reserve forces are being mobilized for the ongoing \n     fight against terrorism and in preparation for a possible war \n     with Iraq.\n       (4) When the ability to provide sufficient Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Military Technicians end strength is reduced, \n     unit readiness, as well as quality of life for soldiers and \n     families, is degraded.\n       (5) The Army National Guard, with agreement from the \n     Department of Defense, requires a minimum essential \n     requirement of 25,286 Active Guard/Reserves and 26,189 \n     Military Technicians.\n       (6) The fiscal year 2004 budget request for the Army \n     National Guard includes the minimum required end strengths, \n     but provides resources sufficient for only approximately \n     24,562 Active Guard/Reserves and 25,702 Military Technicians, \n     funding shortfalls of $51,200,000 and $29,300,000, \n     respectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this resolution assume that the \n     Department of Defense will give priority to fully funding the \n     Active Guard/Reserves and Military Technicians at least at \n     the minimum required levels.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING WEAPONS OF MASS \n                   DESTRUCTION CIVIL SUPPORT TEAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The emerging chemical, biological, and other threats of \n     the 21st century present new challenges to our military and \n     to local first responders.\n       (2) Local first responders are on the front lines of \n     combating terrorism and responding to other large-scale \n     incidents.\n       (3) The National Guard's Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil \n     Support Teams (WMD-CSTs) play a vital role in assisting local \n     first responders in investigating and combating these new \n     threats.\n       (4) The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks emphasize the \n     need to have full-time WMD-CSTs in each State.\n       (5) There are currently 32 full-time and 23 part-time WMD-\n     CSTs.\n       (6) Section 1403 of Public Law 107-314, the Bob Stump \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, \n     requires the Secretary of Defense to establish an additional \n     23 WMD-CSTs and that at least one team be located in each \n     State and territory of the United States.\n       (7) The President's fiscal year 2004 budget request \n     includes no funding for these additional WMD-CSTs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the functional totals in this resolution assume that \n     the Department of Defense should give priority to fully \n     implementing section 1403 of Public Law 107-314, the Bob \n     Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2003; and\n       (2) the Department should increase its full-time manning \n     requirements to include the 506 additional full-time National \n     Guard personnel that will be needed to man the 23 additional \n     WMD-CSTs.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EMERGENCY AND DISASTER \n                   ASSISTANCE FOR LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE \n                   PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Significant portions of the United States suffered \n     through severe drought conditions in 2000 and 2001.\n       (2) The economic effects of drought are long-term and \n     widespread.\n       (3) Current drought indices predict that the drought will \n     continue through 2003.\n       (4) Congress has a history of providing financial \n     assistance to agricultural and livestock producers for losses \n     incurred due to drought.\n       (5) Emphasis must be placed on planning efforts that will \n     mitigate the negative effects of drought.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate--\n       (1) develop a long-term drought plan that effectively \n     recognizes the reoccurring nature of drought cycles and \n     adequately support emergency and disaster assistance to \n     livestock and agricultural producers hurt by drought; and\n       (2) establish an agricultural reserve to fund the \n     activities in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 308. SOCIAL SECURITY RESTRUCTURING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is the foundation of retirement income \n     for most Americans;\n       (2) preserving and strengthening the long term viability of \n     Social Security is a vital national priority and is essential \n     for the retirement security of today's working Americans, \n     current and future retirees, and their families;\n       (3) Social Security faces significant fiscal and \n     demographic pressures;\n       (4) the nonpartisan Office of the Chief Actuary at the \n     Social Security Administration reports that--\n       (A) the number of workers paying taxes to support each \n     Social Security beneficiary has dropped from 16.5 in 1950 to \n     3.3 in 2002;\n       (B) within a generation there will be only 2 workers to \n     support each retiree, which will substantially increase the \n     financial burden on American workers;\n       (C) without structural reform, the Social Security system, \n     beginning in 2018, will pay out more in benefits than it will \n     collect in taxes;\n       (D) without structural reform, the Social Security trust \n     fund will be exhausted in 2042, and Social Security tax \n     revenue in 2042 will only cover 73 percent of promised \n     benefits, and will decrease to 65 percent by 2077;\n       (E) without structural reform, future Congresses may have \n     to raise payroll taxes 50 percent over the next 75 years to \n     pay full benefits on time, resulting in payroll tax rates of \n     as much as 16.9 percent by 2042 and 18.9 percent by 2077;\n       (F) without structural reform, Social Security's total cash \n     shortfall over the next 75 years is estimated to be more than \n     $25,000,000,000,000 in constant 2003 dollars or \n     $3,500,000,000,000 measured in present value terms;\n       (G) absent structural reforms, spending on Social Security \n     will increase from 4.4 percent of gross domestic product in \n     2003 to 7.0 percent in 2077; and\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\n       (5) the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting \n     Office, the Congressional Research Service, the Chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board, and the President's Commission to \n     Strengthen Social Security have all warned that failure to \n     enact fiscally responsible Social Security reform quickly \n     will result in 1 or more of the following:\n       (A) Higher tax rates.\n       (B) Lower Social Security benefit levels.\n       (C) Increased Federal debt or less spending on other \n     Federal programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Congress and the American people \n     (including seniors, workers, women, minorities, and disabled \n     persons) should work together at the earliest opportunity to \n     enact legislation to achieve a solvent and permanently \n     sustainable Social Security system; and\n       (2) Social Security reform--\n       (A) must protect current and near retirees from any changes \n     to Social Security benefits;\n       (B) must reduce the pressure on future taxpayers and on \n     other budgetary priorities;\n       (C) must provide benefit levels that adequately reflect \n     individual contributions to the Social Security System.\n       (D) must preserve and strengthen the safety net for \n     vulnerable populations, including the disabled and survivors.\n       (3) We should honor section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement \n     Act of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING STATE FISCAL RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) States are experiencing the most severe fiscal crisis \n     since World War II.\n       (2) States are instituting severe cuts to a variety of \n     vital programs such as health care, child care, education, \n     and other essential services.\n       (3) According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the \n     Uninsured, 49 States already have taken actions or plan to \n     cut medicaid before or during the current fiscal year 2003. \n     Medicaid budget proposals in many States would eliminate or \n     curtail health benefits for eligible families and \n     substantially reduce or freeze provider reimbursement rates.\n       (4) In 2002, at least 13 States reported decreased State \n     investments in their child care assistance programs.\n       (5) According to a forthcoming analysis of 22 States, at \n     least 1,700,000 people are now at risk of losing their health \n     care coverage under cuts that have already been implemented \n     or proposed.\n       (6) Fiscal relief would help avoid adding even more \n     Americans to the ranks of the uninsured while preserving the \n     safety net when it is most needed during an economic \n     downturn.\n       (7) Curtailing the States' need to cut spending and \n     increase taxes is essential for true economic growth.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this resolution assume that any \n     legislation enacted to provide economic growth for the United \n     States should include not less than $30,000,000,000 for State \n     fiscal relief over the next 18 months (of which at least half \n     should be provided through a temporary increase in the \n     Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP)).\n\n     SEC. 310. FEDERAL AGENCY REVIEW COMMISSION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that a commission should be \n     established to review Federal domestic agencies, and programs \n     within such agencies, with the express purpose of providing \n     Congress with recommendations, and legislation to implement \n     those recommendations, to realign or eliminate government \n     agencies and programs that are duplicative, wasteful, \n     inefficient, outdated, or irrelevant, or have failed to \n     accomplish their intended purpose.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HIGHWAY SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Highway construction funding should increase over \n     current levels.\n       (2) The Senate Budget Committee-passed Resolution increases \n     highway funding above the President's request.\n       (3) All vehicles, whether they are operated by gasoline, \n     gasohol, or electricity, do damage to our highways.\n       (4) As set out in TEA-21, the direct relationship between \n     excise taxes and highway spending makes sense and should be \n     maintained.\n       (5) Highways should be funded through user fees such as \n     excise taxes and not through the General Fund of the \n     Treasury.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should only consider legislation that \n     increases highway spending if such legislation changes \n     highway user fees to pay for such increased spending.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AN EXPANSION IN \n                   HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) there were 74,700,000 Americans who were uninsured for \n     all or part of the two-year period of 2001 and 2002;\n       (2) this large group of uninsured Americans constitutes \n     almost one out of every three Americans under the age of 65;\n       (3) most of these uninsured individual were without health \n     coverage for lengthy periods of time, with two-thirds of them \n     uninsured for over six months;\n       (4) four out of five uninsured individuals are in working \n     families;\n       (5) high health care costs, the large number of unemployed \n     workers, and State cutbacks of public health programs \n     occasioned by State fiscal crises are causing more and more \n     individuals to become uninsured; and\n       (6) uninsured individuals are less likely to have a usual \n     source of care outside of an emergency room, often go without \n     screenings and preventive care, often delay or forgo needed \n     medical care, are often subject to avoidable hospital days, \n     and are sicker and die earlier than those individuals who \n     have health insurance.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the functional totals in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) expanded access to health care coverage throughout the \n     United States is a top priority for national policymaking; \n     and\n       (2) to the extent that additional funds are made available, \n     a significant portion of such funds should be dedicated to \n     expanding access to health care coverage so that fewer \n     individuals are uninsured and fewer individuals are likely to \n     become uninsured.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN \n                   ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The control of illegal immigration is a Federal \n     responsibility.\n       (2) In fiscal year 2002, however, State and local \n     governments spent more than $13,000,000,000 in costs \n     associated with the incarceration of undocumented criminal \n     aliens.\n       (3) The Federal Government provided $565,000,000 in \n     appropriated funding to the State Criminal Alien Assistance \n     Program (SCAAP) to reimburse State and local governments for \n     these costs.\n       (4) In fiscal year 2003, the fiscal burden of incarcerating \n     undocumented criminal aliens is likely to grow, however, \n     Congress provided only $250,000,000 to help cover these \n     costs.\n       (5) The 56 percent cut in fiscal year 2003 funding for \n     SCAAP will place an enormous burden on State and local law \n     enforcement agencies during a time of heightened efforts to \n     secure our homeland.\n       (6) The Administration did not include funding for SCAAP in \n     its fiscal year 2004 budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assumes that the State Criminal Alien Assistance \n     Program be funded at $585,000,000 to reimburse State and \n     local law enforcement agencies for the burdens imposed in \n     fiscal year 2003 by the incarceration of undocumented \n     criminal aliens; and\n       (2) Congress enact a long-term reauthorization of the State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program beginning with the \n     authorization of $750,000,000 in fiscal year 2004 to \n     reimburse State and county governments for the burdens \n     undocumented criminal aliens have placed on the local \n     criminal justice system.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PROGRAMS OF THE \n                   CORPS OF ENGINEERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Corps of Engineers provides quality, responsive \n     engineering services to the United States, including \n     planning, designing, building, and operating invaluable water \n     resources and civil works projects;\n       (2) the ports of the United States are a vital component of \n     the economy of the United States, playing a critical role in \n     international trade and commerce and in maintaining the \n     energy supply of the United States;\n       (3) interruption of port operations would have a \n     devastating effect on the United States;\n       (4) the navigation program of the Corps enables \n     2,400,000,000 tons of commerce to move on navigable \n     waterways;\n       (5) the Department of Transportation estimates that those \n     cargo movements have created jobs for 13,000,000 people;\n       (6) flood damage reduction structures provided and \n     maintained by the Corps save taxpayers $21,000,000,000 in \n     damages every year, in addition to numerous human lives;\n       (7) the Corps designs and manages the construction of \n     military facilities for the Army and Air Force while \n     providing support to the Department of Defense and other \n     Federal agencies;\n       (8) the Civil Works program of the Corps adds significant \n     value to the economy of the United States, including \n     recreation and ecosystem restoration;\n       (9) through contracting methods, the civil works program \n     employs thousands of private sector contract employees, as \n     well as Federal employees, in all aspects of construction, \n     science, engineering, architecture, management, planning, \n     design, operations, and maintenance; and\n       (10) the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that \n     $1,000,000,000 expended for the Civil Works program generates \n     approximately 40,000 jobs in support of construction \n     operation and maintenance activities in the United States.\n       (b) Budgetary Assumptions.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) to perform vital functions described in subsection (a), \n     the Corps of Engineers requires additional funding; and\n       (2) the budgetary totals in this resolution assume that the \n     level of funding provided for programs of the Corps described \n     in subsection (a) will not be reduced below current baseline \n     spending levels established for the programs.\n\n     SEC. 315. RADIO INTEROPERABILITY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS.\n\n       (a) Study.--It is the sense of the Senate that the Attorney \n     General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, should conduct a study of the need and cost to make \n     the radio systems used by fire departments and emergency \n     medical services agencies interoperable with those used by \n     law enforcement to the extent that interoperability will not \n     interfere with law enforcement operations.\n       (b) Grant Program.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress should authorize and appropriate $20,000,000 to \n     establish a grant program through which the Attorney General \n     would award grants to local governments to assist fire \n     departments and emergency medical services agencies to \n     establish radio interoperability.\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CORPORATE TAX HAVEN \n                   LOOPHOLES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that companies are taking \n     advantage of loopholes in the United States tax code to \n     direct taxable income to tax haven jurisdictions, some of \n     which have excessive bank secrecy laws and a poor record of \n     cooperation with United States civil and criminal tax \n     enforcement.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should act to stop companies from avoiding \n     paying their fair share of United States taxes by--\n       (1) addressing the problem of corporations that have \n     renounced their United States citizenship (``inverted'') by \n     relocating their headquarters to tax haven jurisdictions \n     while maintaining their primary offices and production or \n     service facilities in the United States; and\n       (2) addressing the problem of Bermuda-based insurance \n     companies that are using reinsurance agreements with their \n     subsidiaries to direct property and casualty insurance \n     premiums out of the United States into Bermuda to reduce \n     their United States taxes in a way that places United States \n     property and casualty insurance companies at a competitive \n     disadvantage.\n\n     SEC. 317. SENSE OF SENATE ON PHASED-IN CONCURRENT RECEIPT OF \n                   RETIRED PAY AND VETERANS' DISABILITY \n                   COMPENSATION FOR VETERANS WITH SERVICE-\n                   CONNECTED DISABILITIES RATED AT 60 PERCENT OR \n                   HIGHER.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the new budget authority \n     and outlays for fiscal years 2004 through 2013 for National \n     Defense (050) specified in section 103(1) are adequate to \n     provide, and should provide, for the phased-in of concurrent \n     receipt of retired pay and veterans' disability compensation \n     by veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 60 \n     percent or higher as if section 1414 of title 10, United \n     States Code, were amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1414. Members eligible for retired pay who have \n       service-connected disabilities: payment of retired pay and \n       veterans' disability compensation for disabilities rated at \n       60 percent or higher\n\n       ``(a) Payment of Both Retired Pay and Compensation.--A \n     member or former member of the uniformed services described \n     in subsection (b) is entitled to be paid retired pay, up to \n     the amount determined for such member or former member under \n     subsection (d), in addition to any entitlement to veterans' \n     disability compensation, without regard to sections 5304 and \n     5305 of title 38.\n       ``(b) Covered Members.--A member or former member described \n     in this subsection is any member or former member who is \n     entitled to retired pay (other than as specified in \n     subsection (c)) and who is also entitled to veterans' \n     disability compensation for a service-connected disability \n     rated at 60 percent or higher, as determined under laws \n     administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n       ``(c) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply to a member \n     retired under chapter 61 of this title with less than 20 \n     years of service otherwise creditable under section 1405 of \n     this title at the time of the member's retirement.\n       ``(d) Maximum Amount of Retired Pay.--The maximum amount of \n     retired pay to which a member or former member is entitled \n     under subsection (a) is as follows:\n       ``(1) For months beginning with January 2004 and ending \n     with December 2004, the amount equal to 45 percent of the \n     amount of retired pay to which the member or former member \n     would be entitled if the member or former member were paid \n     retired pay without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of title \n     38 for such months.\n       ``(2) For months beginning with January 2005 and ending \n     with December 2005, the amount equal to 60 percent of the \n     amount of retired pay to which the member or former member \n     would be entitled if the member or former member were paid \n     retired pay without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of title \n     38 for such months.\n       ``(3) For months beginning with January 2006 and ending \n     with December 2006, the amount equal to 80 percent of the \n     amount of retired pay to which the member or former member \n     would be entitled if the member or former member were paid \n     retired pay without regard to sections 5304 and 5305 of title \n     38 for such months.\n       ``(4) For months beginning after December 2006, the amount \n     equal to the full amount of retired pay to which the member \n     or former member would be entitled if the member or former \n     member were paid retired pay without regard to sections 5304 \n     and 5305 of title 38 for such months.\n       ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `retired pay' includes retainer pay, \n     emergency officers' retirement pay, and naval pension.\n       ``(2) The term `service-connected' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 101(16) of title 38.\n       ``(3) The term `veterans' disability compensation' has the \n     meaning given the term `compensation' in section 101(12) of \n     title 38.''.\n       (2) Coordination with special compensation authority.--\n     Section 1413 of such title is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by inserting ``, for months in 2002 and 2003,'' after \n     ``Secretary concerned shall''; and\n       (B) by striking the last sentence; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``September 2004'' and \n     inserting ``December 2003''; and\n       (B) by striking paragraph (3).\n       (3) Additional conforming amendments.--(A) Effective on \n     December 31, 2003, section 1413a of such title is repealed.\n       (B) Effective on the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     subsection (d) of section 641 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107; \n     115 Stat. 1150; 10 U.S.C. 1414 note) is repealed.\n       (4) Clerical amendments.--(A) Effective on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the table of sections at the beginning \n     of chapter 71 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking the item relating to section 1414 and inserting the \n     following new item:\n\n``1414.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING NATIVE AMERICAN \n                   HEALTH.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress has recognized \n     the importance of Native American health. In 1997, Congress \n     enacted a program to spend $30,000,000 a year on research and \n     treatment on diabetes in the Native American community. This \n     amount was increased to $100,000,000 a year in 2000 and \n     further increased to $150,000,000 a year in 2002. This is a \n     500 percent increase since 1997.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROVIDING TAX AND OTHER \n                   INCENTIVES TO REVITALIZE RURAL AMERICA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that if tax relief measures \n     are passed in accordance with the assumptions in the budget \n     resolution in this session of Congress, such legislation \n     should include tax and other financial incentives, like those \n     included in the New Homestead Act (S. 602), to help rural \n     communities fight the economic decimation caused by chronic \n     out-migration by giving them the tools they need to attract \n     individuals to live and work, or to start and grow a \n     business, in such rural areas.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HIGHER EDUCATION \n                   AFFORDABILITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in our increasingly competitive global economy, the \n     attainment of higher education is critical to the economic \n     success of an individual, as evidenced by the fact that, in \n     1975, college graduates earned an average of 57 percent more \n     than individuals who were only high school graduates, as \n     compared to the fact that, in 2001, college graduates earned \n     an average of 84 percent more than high school graduates;\n       (2) over the past 20 years, the average cost of college \n     tuition has increased by over 250 percent and is increasing--\n       (A) at a faster rate than any consumer item, including \n     health care; and\n       (B) at a rate that is more than twice as fast as the rate \n     of inflation;\n       (3) despite increases in grant amounts contained in \n     legislation recently enacted by Congress, the value of the \n     maximum Pell Grant has declined 15 percent since 1975 in \n     inflation-adjusted terms, forcing more students to rely on \n     student loans to finance the cost of a higher education;\n       (4) from fiscal years 1990 to 2000, the demand for student \n     loans rose by 41 percent and the average student loan amount \n     increased by 48.2 percent; and\n       (5) according to the Department of Education, there is \n     approximately $150,000,000,000 in outstanding student loan \n     debt and students borrowed more during the decade beginning \n     in 1990 than during all of the decades beginning in 1960, \n     1970, and 1980.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that economic stimulus legislation enacted pursuant to the \n     instructions contained in this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget should include provisions to make higher education \n     affordable, including--\n       (1) a provision to make permanent the above-the-line \n     deduction for the higher education expenses of a taxpayer and \n     members of the taxpayer's family and to increase such \n     deduction to $8,000 for taxable year 2003 and $12,000 for \n     taxable year 2004 and thereafter; and\n       (2) a credit against tax of up to $1,500 for each taxable \n     year (indexed for inflation) for interest paid during such \n     taxable year on loans incurred for higher education \n     expenses--\n       (A) during the first 60 months such payments are required; \n     and\n       (B) paid by individuals who are not dependents.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILDREN'S GRADUATE \n                   MEDICAL EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) children's hospitals provide excellent care for \n     children;\n       (2) the importance of children's hospitals extends to the \n     health care of all children throughout the United States;\n       (3) making up only 1 percent of all hospitals, independent \n     children's hospitals train almost 30 percent of all \n     pediatricians and 50 percent of all pediatric specialists;\n       (4) children's hospitals provide over 50 percent of the \n     hospital care in the United States for children with serious \n     illness, including needing cardiatric surgery, children with \n     cancer, and children with cerebral palsy; and\n       (5) children's hospitals are important centers for \n     pediatric research and the major pipeline for future \n     pediatric researchers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, for fiscal year 2004, children's\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\n     graduate medical education should be funded at $305,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR CRIMINAL \n                   JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) bipartisan efforts have led to success in the fight \n     against crime and improvements in the administration of \n     justice;\n       (2) Congress steadily increased funding for crime \n     identification technologies between 1994 and 2003; and\n       (3) a strong commitment to improve crime identification \n     technologies is still needed.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funding levels in this resolution assume that the \n     programs authorized under the Crime Identification Technology \n     Act of 1998 to improve the justice system will be fully \n     funded at the levels authorized for each of the fiscal years \n     2004 through 2007.\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR DRUG \n                   TREATMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in \n     this resolution assume that up to $20,000,000 from funds \n     designated, but not obligated, for travel and administrative \n     expenses, from drug interdiction activities should be used \n     for service-oriented targeted grants for the utilization of \n     substances that block the craving for heroin and that are \n     newly approved for such use by the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n\n     SEC. 325. FUNDING FOR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Studies show that organized extracurricular activities, \n     such as after-school programs, reduce crime, drug use, and \n     teenage pregnancy.\n       (2) According to the FBI, youth are most at risk for \n     committing violent acts and being victims of violent crimes \n     between 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.--after school is out and \n     before parents arrive home.\n       (3) There remains a great need for after-school programs. \n     The Census Bureau reported that at least 8 to 15 million \n     children have no place to go after school is out.\n       (4) Current funding for after-school programs provide \n     almost 1.4 million children across the country a safe and \n     enriching place to go after school instead of being home \n     alone.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that funding for \n     21st Century Community Learning Centers is at least enough to \n     ensure the number of children participating in afterschool \n     programs does not decrease.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE $1,000 CHILD CREDIT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that extending the $1,000 \n     child credit for 3 additional years (2011-2013) can be \n     accommodated within the revenue totals and instructions of \n     this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 327.

Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et \n     seq.); and\n       (iii) the child and adult care food program established \n     under the section 17 of the Richard B. Russell National \n     School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1766); and\n       (C) renews and fully funds the special supplemental \n     nutrition program for women, infants, and children \n     established by section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1786).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the final budget conference agreement should not take or \n     propose any actions that reduce the level of funding provided \n     for domestic nutrition assistance programs administered by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture below current baseline spending \n     levels for the programs.\n\n     SEC. 328.

LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS DAMAGED BY \n                   DROUGHT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act of 2003''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of July 2002, more than 36 States (including \n     Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Louisiana) have suffered \n     from continuing drought conditions;\n       (2) droughts have a negative effect on State and regional \n     economies;\n       (3) many small businesses in the United States sell, \n     distribute, market, or otherwise engage in commerce related \n     to water and water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and \n     streams;\n       (4) many small businesses in the United States suffer \n     economic injury from drought conditions, leading to revenue \n     losses, job layoffs, and bankruptcies;\n       (5) these small businesses need access to low-interest \n     loans for business-related purposes, including paying their \n     bills and making payroll until business returns to normal;\n       (6) absent a legislative change, the practice of the Small \n     Business Administration of permitting only agriculture and \n     agriculture-related businesses to be eligible for Federal \n     disaster loan assistance as a result of drought conditions \n     would likely continue;\n       (7) during the past several years small businesses that \n     rely on the Great Lakes have suffered economic injury as a \n     result of lower than average water levels, resulting from low \n     precipitation and increased evaporation, and there are \n     concerns that small businesses in other regions could suffer \n     similar hardships beyond their control and that they should \n     also be eligible for assistance; and\n       (8) it is necessary to amend the Small Business Act to \n     clarify that nonfarm-related small businesses that have \n     suffered economic injury from drought are eligible to receive \n     financial assistance through Small Business Administration \n     Economic Injury Disaster Loans.\n       (c) Drought Disaster Authority.--\n       (1) Definition of disaster.--Section 3(k) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(k)) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(k)''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) For purposes of section 7(b)(2), the term `disaster' \n     includes--\n       ``(A) drought; and\n       ``(B) below average water levels in the Great Lakes, or on \n     any body of water in the United States that supports commerce \n     by small business concerns.''.\n       (2) Drought disaster relief authority.--Section 7(b)(2) of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``including drought, with respect to both \n     farm-related and nonfarm-related small business concerns \n     affected by drought,'' before ``if the Administration'';
